0,Dr. Faraone has joined us today to provide educational information. Please do not ask questions about the treatment plan for you or your loved one.,10.4,8.2,58.79
1,Is there more research being done for female ADHD symptoms/diagnosis/treatment?,76.4,14.3,10.56
2,"There has been a dramatic increase in research about females with ADHD.  About 24 articles about ADHD in females were published in the year 2000.  In the year 2024, 376 articles were published.  So progress is being made, although ADHD is still underdiagnosed in females under aqe 20",51.3,9.2,50.84
3,"In the research you've seen, has there been a clue to the underlying cause of the differences in symptom presentation in males and females?  Hormonal? Environmental? Societal expectations?",35.0,17.8,17.68
4,"That is one of the biggest mysteries in the world of ADHD research.  We have no idea why ADHD is more common in boys than girls and why that difference disappears in adulthood.  We do know that hormonal changes due to the menstrual cycle and to menopause will affect symptoms of ADHD.  If I had enough time for another research career, I would focus on these issues.",63.0,9.8,54.42
5,Have you found why there seems to be a correlation between adhd and autoimmune disorders ? And others like neurofibromatoses 1,56.1,9.6,44.41
6,"Thank you for doing this. Having been in this community for a while, I have seen many struggle to get proper diagnosis, even as far as doctors not believing ADHD is a real problem. My question is, with all the advancements we have seen, why do you think it is still so difficult, and how could there still be doctors denying its authenticity?",57.0,10.3,58.62
7,"The main problem is that many doctors have received little or no training about ADHD, especially ADHD in adults.  This much more of a problem in primary care, ie, your family doctor, rather than specialty care, eg., psychiatry.  Another problem is that ADHD medications, especially stimulants are stigmatized as being addictive, even though when used therapeutically they help patients avoid addictions.",51.4,14.7,25.49
8,Which symptoms are best remediated by medication and which by behavioural therapy? Is it ever appropriate to just treat with one or the other? Thank you!,70.6,8.4,58.28
9,"Medications do a very good job reducing inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.  Behavior therapy yields some improvements but not as much.  In youth, family behavior therapy reduces disruptive behaviors.  In adults, cognitive behavior therapy, helps patients with daily life skills, like staying organized, that are impaired by their ADHD symptoms.",64.2,14.0,16.69
10,Thank you!,5.0,-3.1,120.21
11,Have there been any new developments around medium to long term negative effects of medication for adults?,51.0,12.3,37.3
12,"There have not been any new concerns that have led the US Food and Drug Administration to require new warnings.   It is well known that the stimulants can cause hypertension, and there are, periodically, papers published that suggest a small increased risk for other cardiac problems, but if the latter occur, they are likely rare. Other studies suggest the medications may increase the risk for glaucoma.   The problem with the studies that report these findings is that they cannot establish causality.  Given that the medications have very strong effects for improving a person's life, most clinicians view those benefits as outweighing other small, uncertain risks.",53.0,11.5,50.16
13,"This is a wonderful opportunity Professor, thank you!

My question really is this: In regards to mixed type ADHD (As this is what I was diagnosed with a few weeks ago), what are the unique struggles that tend to follow mixed type over singular? Is it as accepted in the academic and medical community as the singular types in regards to the amount of research available?

Cheers!",72.4,12.0,48.84
14,"The 'mixed' type of ADHD is usually referred to as the 'combined-presentation', which is how it is described in the diagnostic manual.  'mixed' or 'combined' means that both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present.  It is the most common form of ADHD.  We call these 'presentations', not 'types' because they can change over time.    The combined presentation of ADHD is usually more severe in the sense that the patient has more problems in living than the other type.  That is because they have more symptoms of ADHD.  The good news is that combined ADHD responds as well to treatments for ADHD as the other presentations.",53.3,10.3,47.79
15,"I learned a lot from your answer, and that is very interesting to know! Thank you, and have a lovely day :)",92.3,2.7,94.66

17,"Sometimes cognitive fatigue occurs due to difficulties sleeping, which are common among those diagnosed with ADHD, even when not treated with medication.  In such cases naps can be restorative.    For some people with ADHD, cognitive fatigue is simply boredom.  Even when one is not sleepy, it is more difficult to engage in a task that is not  rewarding.  Since people diagnosed with ADHD often experience shifts in rewardingness, that can lead to the type of fatigue you describe.",40.2,10.6,47.18
18,Thanks for doing this AMA. Is there a link between stuttering and adhd?,76.6,7.0,56.42
19,"I've not heard that there is such an association.  If it is, it is probably a rare one.",8.3,3.3,87.72
20,"May I ask if you mean a literal, diagnosed stutter (forgive me if that’s not best way to describe) or do you mean trouble finding or just spitting out words? If it’s the latter, I struggle with this too. I found this article helpful:

21,"Interesting question, I have both lol",5.0,4.5,73.85
22,"1. Is it true that Adderall makes a person more dehydrated? If true, is drinking more water than usual recommended to counteract dehydration?

2. Is it true that Adderall depletes essential nutrients such as vitamin B’s, D, magnesium, calcium, and zinc? If yes, does taking vitamin supplements along with Adderall in the AM prevent this depletion?

3. Does a high protein diet make Adderall more effective? On the other hand, does acidic food make it less effective?

4. Does an increase in progesterone (during the luteal phase of a menstrual cycle) make Adderall less effective?

5. Is it common for tolerance to build? How many tolerance breaks (in days) should one take to prevent tolerance?",63.3,8.3,58.48
23,"1. Yes, drinking water is a good idea.

2. I don't know.  That's a good question.

3. I've not heard that a high protein diet has that effect.  Acidic foods can interfere with the effects of amphetamines like Adderall.

4. There are not a lot of data on this point.

5.  Data suggest that some people appear to develop tolerance to amphetamines, meaning that the effect that the medication had had on their brain diminishes with time.  But it is not clear if this is a physiological effect (e.g., a change in brain chemistry) or is due to a change in the person's environment.  For example, if one's life presents more challenges, eg., due to the birth of a child, a new job, etc...,  the original dose of medication may not be sufficient to deal with new symptoms of ADHD.",10.0,6.7,68.06
24,[deleted],5.0,20.2,-47.99
25,Sleep apnea would make symptoms of ADHD worse and those symptoms would be helped if the sleep apnea were to be treated.   Sleep problems wouldn't make the drug have a lesser effect but it may feel that way because the sleep problems worsen one's ADHD.,51.1,9.7,65.56
26,"Is there a link between ADHD and muscular dystonia? 
This is based on anecdotal evidence - I am hypermobile with poor muscle tone, treated by physiotherapy. Funnily enough, besides typical positive effects, taking Elvanse has immediately resulted in increased muscle tone.",65.7,13.2,24.14
27,I've never heard about such a link before.,88.2,4.1,80.28
28,"I am interested in ADHD as a barrier to education, and interventions that help people with ADHD in education. Wondering if you have any tips on where to begin research. Thank you so much!",75.3,8.9,51.55
29,A good place to start would be the literature about allowing accommodations for those with ADHD:   [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=adhd+accommodations%5Bti%5D&sort=pubdate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=adhd+accommodations%5Bti%5D&sort=pubdate),5.0,35.9,-131.91
30,What are the key differences between high functioning autism and adhd?,76.6,12.3,26.47
31,"The two are very different.   High-functioning autism presents with challenges in social interaction, communication, and sensory processing, despite strong cognitive abilities.  People with ADHD are inattentive, hyperactive and impulsive.   Although the two conditions can co-occur, the symptoms used to make their diagnosis are very different.",57.4,14.8,9.25
32,To what extent is it possible to self-treat adhd as an adult without resorting to medication or therapy?,60.3,13.9,27.83
33,Omega-3 fatty acids seem to help some patients but their effect is much small than what one would expect from medications or cognitive behavior therapy.,51.3,13.0,46.1
34,Is it advisable to continue taking adhd medication while breastfeeding? How does it affect the breast milk and baby?,68.4,9.4,44.91
35,"There is not a lot of research in this area.   A recent review (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9185785/) concluded that ""The treating physician should judge the need for treatment during pregnancy in relation to the severity of the clinical symptoms. If needed, methylphenidate is preferred over amphetamines""  and ""If one uses non-stimulant medications, bupropion seems to be the preferred drug"".",53.1,12.3,31.89

37,"Firstly, procrastination and social weirdness are not diagnostic criteria for ADHD.  Being restless would not be sufficient for making a diagnosis of ADHD.",10.1,14.9,9.04
