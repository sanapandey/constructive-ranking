2. Is it true that Adderall depletes essential nutrients such as vitamin B’s, D, magnesium, calcium, and zinc? If yes, does taking vitamin supplements along with Adderall in the AM prevent this depletion?

3. Does a high protein diet make Adderall more effective? On the other hand, does acidic food make it less effective?

4. Does an increase in progesterone (during the luteal phase of a menstrual cycle) make Adderall less effective?

5. Is it common for tolerance to build? How many tolerance breaks (in days) should one take to prevent tolerance?",53.4,8.3,58.48,63.3,8.3,58.48
1,"1. Yes, drinking water is a good idea.

2. I don't know.  That's a good question.

3. I've not heard that a high protein diet has that effect.  Acidic foods can interfere with the effects of amphetamines like Adderall.

4. There are not a lot of data on this point.

5.  Data suggest that some people appear to develop tolerance to amphetamines, meaning that the effect that the medication had had on their brain diminishes with time.  But it is not clear if this is a physiological effect (e.g., a change in brain chemistry) or is due to a change in the person's environment.  For example, if one's life presents more challenges, eg., due to the birth of a child, a new job, etc...,  the original dose of medication may not be sufficient to deal with new symptoms of ADHD.",56.0,6.7,68.06,10.0,6.7,68.06

'mixed' or 'combined' means that both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are present.  It is the most common form of ADHD.  We call these 'presentations', not 'types' because they can change over time.    The combined presentation of ADHD is usually more severe in the sense that the patient has more problems in living than the other type.  That is because they have more symptoms of ADHD.  The good news is that combined ADHD responds as well to treatments for ADHD as the other presentations.",56.6,10.3,47.79,53.3,10.3,47.79

Other studies suggest the medications may increase the risk for glaucoma.   The problem with the studies that report these findings is that they cannot establish causality.
