[Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). \n\nBeyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). \n\nIf you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  \n2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  \n3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  \n4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  \n5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  \n6. Encouraging others to do all the above.  \n\nIf you're tired of all the chaos on Reddit, leave it behind and join /r/aww's Discord server to share and view all things adorable: https://discord.gg/UXfd5Pn\n\n---\n\n[](#autoignorereports)\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You also legally can't. AI generated images are not copyrightable for a reason. You didn't do anything. Nothing of the actual creative process, composition, line work, color theory, lighting, anatomy, style, nothing about it came from you. \n\n\"But I wrote the prompt!\" Okay, should we then give Pope what's-his-name the credit for the Sistine chapel? He's the one that gave the instructions of what he wanted to Michelangelo, after all.   \nOr was Mona Lisa the actual artistic genuis behind her portrait because she commissioned Da Vinci to paint her?\n\nPrompt-writing is not art.
