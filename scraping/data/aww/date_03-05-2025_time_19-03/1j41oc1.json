He has always been there, it feels like. \nOf course, there was a \"before Max\", but... It doesn't feel real.\nI can't imagine that he is... Just gone tomorrow. Cancer. Fifteen beautiful years and adventures have finally come to an end and... I don't know what to do with myself. This is my Max, my beloved boy. I really don't know how to cope with this.\n\nI sincerely hope you find the images as beautiful as I found him. He was - still is - a source of joy and happiness beyond belief. \n\nTake care of your family, of your best friends, your rocks and safety nets.",

I had to do the same with my little Reggie \ud83d\ude14 \n\nThis is a terribly hard time \ud83d\ude22 \n\nCancer is horrible and you are doing the kindest yet heart tugging thing to do. \nHe will know he's with you when he passes and that means everything \ud83c\udf1f \n\nGive yourself lots of breathing space and be extra kind to yourself. It's really important.\n\nThe photos of Max you share are magnificent! \ud83d\udc99\n\nSending love \u2764\ufe0f and \ud83e\udec2 hugs your way \n\n \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc99 \ud83d\udc9c \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc99 \ud83d\udc9c",
