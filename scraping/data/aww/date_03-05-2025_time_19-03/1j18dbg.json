They love us and want to be near us, oftentimes on our lap or in our arms \ud83e\udd70 They come from a home where they were socialized from day 1 and intrinsically trust all humans (who treat them with respect). You can snuggle into their bellies, massage their toebeans, hold them any which way without any agression. They actually teach eachother when to use their nails in play so playtime is super safe as they will retract their nails when they sense our skin. They also communicate their boubdaries to one another by hissing, so I too can use a gentle hiss to set a limit. \nNow that they are 5 months they are becoming slightly more independent and also seek us out independently, so I don't worry that they are overly attached at all. Plus they always have an age appropriate playmate to occupy them when they're busy, meaning they don't act up out of boredom. Our experience getting littermates has been nothing short of amazing and I would never get a singleton kitten after seeing our girls grow up together \u2764\ufe0f",
