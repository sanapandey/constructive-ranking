So we got him a harness and a short leash and tied him up. He had plenty of shade and water. One day, when my mom went to grab something inside. She was gone for merely a minute. Our neighbors dogs got loose and attacked him. Our neighbors were able to stop them before it was too late. They then rushed Togi to the ER. Their dogs also went in. \n\nWhen they got back. We found out one of their dogs got blinded in one eye cause Togi fought back. The other had a couple of stitches on his face. Togi ended up with 5 stitches. He was 5 then and ended up living 5 more years. He was an awesome.",
