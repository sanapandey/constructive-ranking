He was playing with his mom Sohni and ended up pushing her off the platform, then he jumped off and ran around with the zoomies. \n\nThey used to have a short video inside his backstage habitat once a week until he was allowed into his normal habitat (he had to learn to swim first as his habitat has water) that I used to watch. He was allowed to explore his habitat in late January and I finally was able to see him today after missing him multiple times.",
