This litter was born during lockdown in 2020, we actually had her pregnancy confirmed the day they announced school closures in the UK. We could have placed them a thousand times over, as it was we were able to cherry pick their new owners from a very, very long list. We have a private FB group with all of the owners of both litters, out of 15 pups we only had issues with 2 - one guy was forced back into the office having been WFH for a few years and his boy had serious separation anxiety, at 10 months he asked if we could help rehome him, which we did with one of his siblings. Another couple separated and the women sold their boy out of spite, we had her ex on the phone in tears, he'd wanted a Mal since childhood but the pup's documents were all in her name at their request and she used that to hurt him. My daughter found him a year later on Tiktok, the buyer hadn't looked after him well and he'd been rescued, thankfully he still had his distinctive name. We contacted his new mum via Tiktok and was able to add her to the FB group and he was reunited (online, at least) with of his siblings, our girl and the daddy of both litters. We get pics of them having birthday cake and wearing hats, we get regular updates of them and it's an absolute privilege to share a glimpse of their whole lives. One was collected by private jet and lives in the Channel Islands, one moved to France when his owner, a pro rugby player, changed clubs, two are therapy dogs, another is in Northern Ireland and one made a tv appearance in the UK two weeks ago on [this show](https://www.channel5.com/show/alan-titchmarsh-s-underdog-to-superdog/season-1/episode-3)\n\nWhen we got our girl we felt the breeder could have helped us more but they were all too quick to take the money and be done, we wanted to offer more and have been rewarded by sharing in the pups lives from day 1, they will always, always be precious to us.",

Both were fixed and both were pure BITCHES in every sense of the word. They first one, Tikkah, started more than her share of dog fights in her life, but was sweet and gentle towards other humans. The present one, Tikkup, is smaller, does not start any trouble at all, but treats my arms like chew toys. Its amazing to think that these vicious wolverines can turn their entire personalities around and become such gentle mothers\u00a0",
