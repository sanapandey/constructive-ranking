If you eat something and then get a finger-stick glucose and then the CGM reading and they can be hundreds of points different (with the finger stick likely being more accurate), it often takes 5-15 minutes before the CGM catches up.  Second the CGM can fail...batteries, bluetooth are the most common technological failure points but also that little needle that stays in your skin can bend or get clogged which makes readings unreliable. Another failure point is the human one.  CGMs only work when people are around.  If you fall asleep and don't hear the CGM alarm...well that isn't good and the chances of you waking up are...well...not 100%.\n\nDogs aren't perfect either.  They can make mistakes and miss things too.\n\nBut overall the CGM, plus the alert dog, plus routine finger-stick testing creates a safer environment for that person, redundancy is a good thing.",

The badge and card is granted by the organisation that trains the dog and certifies it every few years. The name of the organisation is on the badge and the card. So in this case, the Hypokoira Ry gives the dog a deep blue vest, with light blue and white badge. My brother has the badge on a tactical/camo type vest. And the granting organisation lists all the licensed dog's calling name, breeder name, and breed, these are also registered in the *dog register* (Finland has a dog register, meant to track breeding, owners, etc. It started as unofficial register among the Kennel organisation but then became an official one.)\n\nI mean like... Obviously you could fake these if you really wanted to. But you can do that to just about every document and card if you wanted to. But fact is that it can be checked easily by just visiting the organisation's site.",

I would be somewhat skeptical of someone doing it for less, and would definitely want to get good references. Not all dogs can be taught too, either because of temperament or they aren't sensitive enough to it (unlike some service dog jobs, it's not a completely binary sense, most dogs can sense it but many aren't consistent or sensitive enough). As far as small dogs go, absolutely. In fact, they are fairly common for blood sugar alert and heart alert dogs because they are easier to transport (for instance, if you have to fly often times small dogs can stay in the cabin with you) and they can be less intimidating for people who might be afraid of larger dogs. \n\nI'm far from an expert, but I have done a lot of research. My wife has some chronic health problems. One of our dogs decided he was a heart alert dog. Unfortunately, he wasn't well behaved enough to go out in public, but around the house he served her very well for about 6 years, then he started to lose it as he got older. After realizing how helpful it was we looked into getting a dog that was specifically trained for it, but my wife decided it wasn't worth the money. We did get a puppy (same breed) with the hope that maybe the older dog would teach him, but the young one is three and nothing yet. That was about the age that the older one started alerting though, so still a small chance. Heart alert is more binary though, either a dog can do it or they can't. We really have no way of knowing if our younger dog is even capable of detection.",

The training does involve taking body oudor swaps at specific blood sugar levels and conditions. However it isn't only scent, because they also react, and are taught to react if the person goes confused or unconscious, and alert people and seek help/assistance. So there are behaviours they track also.\n\nAnd some dogs can sense it on other people than the owner it was trained on.\n\nIt's more complex than scent, but everything with dogs basically revolves around scent to some degrees.\n\nBut I know my brother - we grew up together - and even I can spot, when the blood sugar has started to change dramatically to one direction or another (but I can't say which or how much). I can't fully say what it is... but it is that something is just off about him, but it ain't smell as I ain't a dog. Our mother is even better at it, as she also grew up with diabetic sister.",
