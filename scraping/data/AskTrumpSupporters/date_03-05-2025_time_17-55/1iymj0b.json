    "selftext": "Setting aside the fact that some Trump Supporters will discount a story from NBC News bye default, there are reports that House Republicans are being advised to limit or avoid scheduling town hall events following the recent anger and outcry some representatives have received from constituents over Trump's cuts to the Fed and the Republican plans for cuts to things like Medicaid.  \n  \n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-town-halls-blowback-trump-cuts-rcna193766](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-town-halls-blowback-trump-cuts-rcna193766)\n\n>  \nObviously we\u2019re very aware of those headlines,\u201d a Republican National Committee official familiar with the dynamics said.\n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t know that a specific edict is going to come down from on high that they need to stop or anything, but a message I believe has been clearly sent that this narrative should end very soon,\u201d the official said. \u201cProbably the best way for that to happen is no more town halls. Elon Musk\u2019s work still has the administration\u2019s support, period.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>\n\nHow do you feel about this notion? From where I stand, it's the duty of all representatives to give their voters a chance to speak with them directly. If they're taking a position that upsets people that much, shouldn't the people have a chance to express how it will affect their lives? What does it say to voters if Republicans aren't willing to risk public anger to defend the policies they enact? ",

Because every bit of communication I've ever received is something along the lines of \"Hey, there is this issue we think you care about. This politician in your area who can effect it will be hosting an event. Can you make it? Can you call?\"\n\nThe entire point of having representatives is that they are supposed to represent the people in their districts. If their positions are going to potentially do harm to people they represent, why is it a bad thing to confront them with that fact?\n\nAnd if a Congressional representatives doesn't feel confident in their position to face that criticism? Why are they voting for it?\n\nForgive me if I'm wrong, but your stance basically sounds like dissenters should just shut up and stay home? Would you say the same to the groups that organize anti-abortion protests outside of Planned Parenthood? Or the conservative committees that go after libraries?",

We send American forces to retake all of Ukraine. Europeans will send token forces to say \"they participated\". Meanwhile, all of our American families who have send people to WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Gulf War, etc. have family members who come back in body bags, missing limbs, or PTSD. Nobody comes home unscathed.\n2. We negotiate a deal where the new borders are somewhere along the front lines. Bonus if we can make trade deals that ensures Ukraines security. But the idea of punishing Russia when they hold all the cards (nearly unlimited men to fight compared to Ukraine), or insulting them is not how you make a deal.\n3. We say fuck it, let Ukraine fight to the last man. They will not win this way, at all, and they know it.\n\nBut see, nobody really wants to think this through. So distraction on a level of mean tweets, memes, AI videos, etc. keeps you all distracted. That is all you want to talk about. Real policy requires thinking and is difficult, and sometimes there is no solution that everyone would think is great.",
