    "selftext": "Basically, the Great Replacement Theory is about White people in majority-White countries being outnumbered by non-White immigrants and their non-White offspring.  Sometimes called the \"demographic shift for which we did not vote.\"\n\nIs this what is motivating the massive deportations?\n\nAre you concerned, and is massive deportation the answer?\n\nAlso, Fox News hasn't yet gone this far, but a lot of adherents think that the Jews are behind the Great Replacement.  Thus, the chant \"The Jews will not replace us!\"\n\nDo you think that the Jews are behind the Great Replacement, and how are the Jews effecting this?",

So what we see currently is nothing new. At this point in history the northern hemisphere has greater resources than the equatorial regions/ southern hemisphere. Hence, migration of people.",

The few countries that are standing up to it are demonized.\n\n[In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: Killing members of the group; Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group](https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition#:~:text=In%20the%20present%20Convention%2C%20genocide,the%20group%20to%20another%20group.)\n\nI think the applicable portion of the definition of genocide is the third point:\n\n>Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\n\nSo without a secure homelands wherein the caucasians can continue their national, ethnical and racial identities into the future, how is it not genocide?\n\nFew foreigners are in Africa, broadly. Few in Asia (China and Japan especially), broadly.\n\nIs it Jews? Does it matter when one can clearly see the problem in real time.\n\nIs America (or should it be) an ethnostate? No, although it was founded with a relatively homogenized group of settlers there have been serious attempts to bring in immigrants. But what America does have is a unique culture. So although we accept immigrants from any ethnicity, they need time to assimilate into our culture. Too many and we will lose our culture. There are hostile cultures that we don't want established in our country, militant cultures.\n\nSharia is the main one I think of, they have no qualms with using violence for political ends. Do we want to indiscriminately invite such a hateful ideology and allow it to stay isolated from the broader more liberal American culture? It's a recipe for disaster.",

If an African country wanted to prioritize other African immigration rather than making half of its country white over 1 generation, you would not be calling it \u201cracist,\u201d you would be saying it\u2019s \u201canti colonial\u201d \u201canti-imperial\u201d or some other such euphemism.\n\nAmericans never voted to radically reduce the white population. This issue isn\u2019t even so much about race as it is about sovereignty.",

He just often cannot say as much because the country has been so flooded by outsiders that he has to pander to them a bit too.

You\u2019re just like Vivek, the audacity is amazing. Like I said you\u2019re a walking example of everything MAGA doesn\u2019t like about immigration.

I\u2019m sure some do, but I refuse to believe that they comprise the majority of the base and Trump has already disavowed that narrative. \n\nHe likes being popular including being popular with minority Americans. As a Vietnamese-American I appreciate him for that for not capitulating to actual white nationalists like Nick Fuentes.\n\nThis is used to shut down any conversation of wanting to regulate immigration. I think the Great Replacement is real and used by Democrat to nefariously win election by importing voters. \n\nDemocrats always win the majority of the minority Americans votes, so it makes sense for why they want mass migration. To me it seems common sense that Democrats are maliciously trying to win elections by supporting open borders, but that\u2019s just me.",

Because I like the idea of this being the place that people come to in search of a better life. I think that's fucking *awesome* and something to be so, so proud of. There's nothing \"nefarious,\" there's no malice \u2014 if anything, it's the absence of both of those things.

People clearly do not think this way. Actually, no one hates the current group of immigrants more than the last group of immigrants, and that's been a thing since the very beginning of immigration in this country, because it's the surest way to prove that one is truly, as we say \"Medigan.\" \n\nAdditionally, we are not the ones Republicans to say such vile things about immigrants. Quite frankly, people find that WAY more terrifying than a strict-but-humane border policy. Hell, both Obama in his individual terms and Biden actually had more people deported than Trump did. They didn't talk about shooting people in the knees and bring race into it and building walls and they didn't have all the drama, but they were weirdly more effective at dealing with what you're supposedly mad at than Trump was. Why is the cruelty aspect to this, the extreme rhetoric so important? And how is that not malicious?\n\nAlso, I don't mean being allowed on social media, I mean that those types are actively given a BOOST by GOP politicians, who speak at their events, have dinner with them, etc. etc. \n\nHave you, however, considered that what Musk did by inviting all of the  Nazis back to Twitter and giving them a means to pay to boost their message and making them the focus of his \"for you\" feed actually ultimately led to less free speech? Now normal people don't want to go on there, because it's a weird, gross cesspool of hate, racial slurs and trolling. It's unpleasant. By having some rules, it was nice for everyone, now it's just ... ew. Do you think you can expect people to want to be around that for fun?\n\nAlso you realize the Right does WAY more censorship than we do, right? Like, with actual government power behind it? Not just \"Hey, how about people not be assholes on this website so that it remains a good time for people?\"",

I realize you're trying to make an argument here, but I just don't freaking get it.\n\n78% of farm workers identify as Hispanic or Latino.  That does not mean they are not White, as many people from countries that speak Spanish are White.  Furthermore, you'll note that on the Census, Hispanic is considered an \"other\" category, in that you can be Hispanic and Black, White, etc.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not sure what you're getting at here, and I don't like the rabbit hole you're going down, because I see a lot of \"WHO IS GONNA PICK YOUR TOMATOES?\" coming up.

The motivations of the people responsible are not actually relevant, yet that's what almost all of the 'conspiracy' talk centers around. If someone judges White decline to be bad (in the same way that basically everyone on Earth would feel about the decline of their group, e.g. Chinese people in China, Jews in Israel, etc.), whether the people involved have good or hostile motivations doesn't matter.\n\nThere is no 'conspiracy'. It's like talking about how taxes have changed over time and someone starts calling you a believer in taxation conspiracy. \n\nSo that aside, it shapes my views, and I'm sure it shapes some people's views subconsciously, but it is not a majority position. Many Trump supporters support legal immigration and are simply opposed to illegal immigration. That's a dumb, incoherent position, but it does mean that the view isn't fundamentally racial in nature (because if it were, they would oppose the current legal immigration system too).\n\n> Do you think that the Jews are behind the Great Replacement, and how are the Jews effecting this?\n\nThe views of the organized Jewish community are well-known. They support mass immigration and 'diversity', for every country on Earth except Israel. They are an influential minority well beyond their numbers.

What the journalist is expecting to hear something like \"these are so wrong, they say we're behind x because we hate White people, but we have nothing to do with it\". But what the person actually said is \"well yeah we do the things they accuse us of, it's just that we're motivated by compassion for outsiders\" (if you are skeptical that I am paraphrasing this accurately, listen to the journalist at 18:11).\n\n* This is paywalled so I don't know if you'll be able to listen to it.

I assume, frankly, that you aren't, so I am not backhandedly trying to insinuate that you are.

The same Zionists pushing it on the West refuse to have mass immigration in Israel and call it racist. Replacement for thee but not for me.\n\nI believe two of his wives were? Nonetheless he was a Zionist and wannabe Jew. Kalergi proclaimed Europe and America would be dominated by Jews and replaced by mass immigration.",

The union would deal with other countries as one, but would also respect internal national differences...\n>\n>According to distortions and fabrications first made by Nazis, repurposed by neo-Nazis, adopted by the European far-right and, more recently, referenced by American conservatives, Kalergi planned the destruction of white European civilization through migration and interracial marriage....\n\nHave you read Kalergi's book?\n\nFrom here: https://www.mqup.ca/hitler-s-cosmopolitan-bastard-products-9780228005452.php\n\n>In the turbulent period following the First World War the young Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the Pan-European Union, offering a vision of peaceful, democratic unity for Europe, with no borders, a common currency, and a single passport. His political congresses in Vienna, Berlin, and Basel attracted thousands from the intelligentsia and the cultural elite, including Albert Einstein, Thomas Mann, and Sigmund Freud, who wanted a United States of Europe brought together by consent. The Count's commitment to this cooperative ideal infuriated Adolf Hitler, who referred to him as a \"cosmopolitan bastard\" in Mein Kampf.\n>\n>Communists and nationalists, xenophobes and populists alike hated the Count and his political mission. When the Nazis annexed Austria, the Count and his wife, the famous actress Ida Roland, narrowly escaped the Gestapo. He fled to the United States, where he helped shape American policy for postwar Europe.\n\nDoesn't that sound a bit like the present state of Europe?",

Obviously people hear a sentence like that and they don't want to examine it in any more detail. But even if people want to blame a group that is real, it's still putting the cart before the horse. The actual merits of the policy are the one thing that don't get discussed. It just gets dismissed as pure conspiracy (lizard people stuff), anti-semitism (if a Jewish role is acknowledged), or some combination thereof. \n\nThat's not an accident of course.

Whether it's slaves or illegals, they want exploitative cheap labor to do the menial tasks because they're too important to do them.\n\nAspect 2: The Left's leadership want an underclass to keep them in power.  Importing the third world achieves this.\n\nAspect 3: The more radial Left believe (perhaps correctly) that globalism (of which open borders is a component) will destroy the country.  According to Marxist crackpot doctrine, only then in the ashes of civilization will the workers realize their class consciousness and embrace hellish communist totalitarianism.  They got the destruction part right.  But going Mad Max won't usher in communism.\n\nAspect 4: The Elitist Left are all about NIMBY.  Notice how the migrants flown into Martha's Vineyard were dispatched in less than 24hrs.  None of the multimillionaires with their massive mansions invited a single migrant in.  But they get to virtue signal how noble they are when they swamp other towns and cities with their refuse.  Virtue signaling is a shield to direct attention away from the obscenely opulent lives they live.\n\nThat's a lot of aspects without the word \"Jew\" in them.",
