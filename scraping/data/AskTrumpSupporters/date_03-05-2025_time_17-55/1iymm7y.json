    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I\u2019m Puerto Rican and I\u2019ve been thinking hard about what\u2019s next for my island. Right now, we\u2019re a US territory and it\u2019s a disaster. Quick rundown: we were part of Spain for 400 years until 1898, when the US took over after the Spanish-American War. In the 1940s, independence folks (including my great grandparents) got shut down hard, arrested, persecuted, so that faded. Today, we\u2019re bankrupt. The Jones Act of 1920 makes us use only US ships for imports from US ports, driving up prices for everything (food, gas..etc) because we can\u2019t freely trade with closer countries. The US spends billions keeping us afloat, and it\u2019s a drag for both of us. (More here if you want: [Puerto Rico\u2019s Economic Mess](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/puerto-rico-us-territory-crisis)).\n\n\n\nI want a Compact of Free Association for Puerto Rico, it\u2019s the smart move. It\u2019s what places like Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands have with the US. They used to be territories too, but since the \u201880s, they\u2019re their own nations. With a Compact, we\u2019d be independent (run our own government, make our own trade deals) but stay economically and politically close to the US. The US military could operate here, like bases or defense, and people could move freely between Puerto Rico and the States for work or whatever. We\u2019d ditch the Jones Act, buy goods cheaper, and build our own economy. The US wouldn\u2019t be stuck footing our bill, and we\u2019d still be allies. Culturally, we\u2019re distinct (we speak Spanish, live our own way) and this fits that. A 2014 report from the US government even said statehood would hurt both sides economically (check it out: [GAO Report Summary](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-14-31)).\n\nHere\u2019s something else. In my experience, a lot of folks I know who want statehood just want to keep their US passport and more federal aid, like welfare, without actually becoming American. They don\u2019t want to lose our national identity to be \u2018gringos.\u2019 They want the perks but not the commitment. The pro-statehood party in Puerto Rico even uses those arguments in their campaigns, they never talk about wanting to assimilate, learn English and have an American identity. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. If you move to a country, or join it as a state, you should adopt its ways, not just take the benefits. \n\nI know you guys get self-reliance and smart deals. A Compact lets Puerto Rico stand on its own, keep our alliance with the US. without leaching off you and respects our differences. Would you back this for us? What\u2019s your take?",

I do not support statehood because Puerto Rico is very different from the mainland and I don\u2019t think those differences should be lost. But the arrangement they have now largely runs the island into the ground. On the other hand, if the Jones Act could be amended, and active help given and supervised by the mainland (so money doesn\u2019t just disappear as there\u2019s a lot of local corruption) I\u2019d also love to see Puerto Rico stay a commonwealth but produce our antibiotics like they used to. Being now that, is it 98%? (can\u2019t remember) of our antibiotics comes from China, which is stupid beyond belief.",

So is your disgusting use of the slur \u201cgringo\u201d and blaming white people for everything. Puerto Rico is lucky to be our territory it never would have survived on its own. Like Ukranians, you should really show us some gratitude \u2014 but you\u2019re so spoiled and addicted to the money we give you that you feel entitled to it.",

In the case of territories with a smaller population than Wyoming, I would support statehood once they reach around the same population or even allow them to band together under an umbrella name as a state. For example the pacific territories can be one and the Atlantic another. I\u2019m also completely ok with giving Puerto Rico more autonomy if they desire. In this day and age, I find it completely acceptable for any population to want more or less involvement with the USA, even if they are our territories, as long as they are still considered part of the USA on paper. \n\nAlso! I\u2019m currently doing a research project on Hurricane Maria that may end up being published. I\u2019m currently looking for residents or past residents to conduct interviews with. The project is mainly focused on the socio-technical aspects of the disaster response and the long term power grid failure. If you would be up for conducting a short zoom interview, I would love to hear your opinions around the situation and get your perspective.

Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, SZA (though perhaps not all strictly R&B) have all been successful lately. Heck, Usher played the halftime show just last year and then his new album reached #2 on the billboards. How\u2019s that not successful?\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much stock I can put in the rest of your answer with this oversight right at the top. \n\nThe general point you seem to be making is that the music promotes broken homes. That seems like a potentially spurious assumption. How do we know there\u2019s a causal relationship between the music people listen to and the state of their homes? Wouldn\u2019t economic factors and access to upwards social mobility be far more influential than what is playing on their speakers?",

We know for a fact 6 million people did not die in the holocaust. From newspaper reports back then it was only about 100,000 and it was 6 million jews that were displaced. History then turned that 6 million displace into  6 million deaths which is pure nonsense. We know from US intel from US officers that visited the sites back then that most of what is told as history now is not true. \n\nThere is a reason a certain group of people are banned from partaking in the financial sector aka banks in over 140 countries. Same reason this certain group of people have been burning children alive in Gaza yet it  is defended by the puppets they control in the US government and  throughout Europe. And no surprise this certain group of people vote democrat in the US at the highest clip than any other demographic even black females.",
