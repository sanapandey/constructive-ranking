If the President refuses to comply with the Supreme Court decision then it can be argued that he is breaking the law and he can be impeached. If impeachment fails, then it basically means he has consent of congress (i.e. the people) to break the law, in which case nothing happens. Though, I would expect congress to simply change the law before it came to that.",

It\u2019s not hard to imagine a situation where ignoring them is justified. The ultra-liberal 9th circuit is known as the \u201c9th circus\u201d because it\u2019s overturned routinely and the judges make little effort to actually abide by the constitution. They\u2019re low level judges going on anti-constitutional power trips, so regardless of whether their orders are temporarily \u201clegal,\u201d there is incentive to ignore what amounts to an obstruction tactic. \n\nThis is not Hitleresque btw. This is how the separation of powers is meant to function. If an executive ignores the judicial branch, it\u2019s Congress\u2019s job to impeach him if that action was unjustified. \n\nIgnoring the Supreme Court is another matter entirely. Although quite frankly, unless justices like Thomas and Alito voted against Trump, I wouldn\u2019t care what they said anyway and would not vote to impeach Trump if I were in Congress. The liberal justices are all hacks. Roberts is a borderline hack. Barrett, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh are all weak Mconnell-picks and I trust Trump/Alito/Thomas over whatever those guys say. Not to mention I have the knowledge to know whether or not any Trump action is justified or not without consulting Clarence Thomas.",

But I\u2019ll concede that she did great in your hypothetical imaginary contest involving dogs/cats. Just not sure what that has to do with anything. I do find it funny after all the talk about how weak Trump is and how strong girl bosses like Hillary and Kamala are \u2014 they\u2019re both left coping with imaginary contests about \u201cif 100 people voted for a unicorn or an alligator then Hilary would have won 52 alligators!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like a chess player losing in 4 moves, throwing over the board and saying \u201cyeah but I beat you at an imaginary unicorn-counting contest which I just made up!!\u201d I just can\u2019t understand the cope, but democrats are down so bad I don\u2019t think I want to understand what\u2019s going through their bitter minds. \n\nI think democrats brains would be broken regardless of party politics. They think men can be women, that countries don\u2019t need borders, that we should defund police and pay people not to work. This is why they lost every swing state, bigly!",

Trump supporters' evidence of fraud - and there are multiple affidavits that the on the ground Trump volunteers submitted as part of the litigation this effect, they are signed and notarized and part of the public record - was that too many people voted for Biden and they personally did not know anyone who voted for Biden and so they did not see how that was possible. Ergo, the votes must be fraudulent. Not sure who is in an echo chamber.\n\nBut in interests of civilized debate, let's talk voter protection in 2028. What are the measures that you believe to be necessary to prevent fraudulent voting in 2028?\n\nI think Trump is interesting bc the old stalwart ways Republicans used to use to suppress Democratic votes aren't as helpful, because he appeals to people with expired driver's licenses and unstable housing situations and he appeals across racial and age boundaries more than any Republican in recent memory. e.g., my green card holding Mexican house cleaner wants to get citizenship so he can vote for him lol.",

There was one case where they published an article that there was likely fraud bc the same person had put their initials on every ballot. I wrote them, citing the provision in WI election law that requires the municipal clerk to initial ballots before sent out, and the Republican legislature that wrote that law. RedState didn\u2019t retract. In fact they doubled down and published another article on the same theory.

Attorney, at the time working in voting law, with many years of experience. I have been honest about the fact I don\u2019t know the law in every state as well as I know it in say, Wisconsin - is that what you think means I\u2019m myopic? Most voting professionals focus on a specific state as each state has very different voting law. If I told you I knew every state, you\u2019d have pretty good evidence I was lying and was not a professional. I know every claim of voter fraud conspiracy I saw on right leaning media out of Wisconsin - and it was my job to watch them - was based on not understanding Wisconsin election law. I don\u2019t know what happened in other states, but if right wing media was as sloppy at fact checking there as it was in Wisconsin, I\u2019m deeply skeptical of their claims. I gave you one example, I have more. \n\nPersonally I think it should be easy for valid citizens to make their voices heard. I see no point to laws that effectively disenfranchise busy young parents with jobs and doctors scheduled to work 24 hour shifts on Election Day over the interests of retirees with nothing better to do. I would put early vote at the grocery store. But you are entitled to your opinion. \n\nAs I said previously, Trump shakes up the traditional efficacy of voter suppression laws, which works great when the Republican base is retirees and white suburban families and the Democratic base is poor people in cities. But he\u2019s made big inroads on the working class and young people; which traditionally struggle the most to vote with laws like you suggest that make it less convenient to vote. It\u2019s interesting you still support business as usual in that instance. Do you support, in addition to only voting on Election Day, early registration requirements (eg having to register a month before Election Day or being disenfranchised if you have moved since the last election), and voter ID laws, with no exceptions for say, expired driver\u2019s licenses or licenses that don\u2019t show your current address? Would you permit proof of residency to be shown electronically when registering to vote?",

I will only care to respond to those who went, \u201cWell that didn\u2019t work, rules are rules.\u201d\n\nRealistically many court orders are ignored by Congress and the President for decades. So unless something so wild comes out of this creates impeachment, well what is at stake while the courts work out an actual decision? Information gets out? Unless legally private info is published like THE J6 COMMITTEE did to Patel, then it\u2019s less damage than the FBI did putting out staged photos illegally pre trial. So in this case possible harm is minimal as long as they follow rules anyone looking at privileged info needs to- remembering that Trump is the final say for Secrets, able to declassify in an instant on a whim.",

It would be like a random FBI sargeant walking into the Supreme Court then making a ruling, preventing a Justice from accessing legal records, & telling the court how they must word a majority opinion or he'd arrest them. It is absurd, unacceptable, & grounds for immediate dismissal. The violation of the civic authority & representative of the people, even were it Biden or Harris, cannot stand over legitimate orders.\n\nThe funding freeze is less blatantly partisan than those instances & could be argued up the court line but my benefit of the doubt is running very dry on this. That should probably go up to the Supreme Court, but honestly I only see bad faith & active malice coming from those courts.\u00a0\n\n\n*Typo",

The Biden administration then crafted smaller, more targeted forgiveness plans to comply with the court's findings. \n\nWhen did he \"openly brag\" about ignoring the Supreme Court?\n\n>As it stands currently you have low federal courts mandating that government websites must display certain things, that legitimate officers of the Executive branch including confirmed cabinet members cannot access their own files, etc. Those are blatant violations & abuses of power that need to be completely obliterated as unacceptable & grounds to disbar those judges.\n\nDon't the vast majority of court cases make their way through the system, *starting* at district courts and only *eventually* making their way up to the Supreme Court? It sounds to me when you specifically say \"low federal courts\" like you assume that every court case has to start and end at the Supreme Court level, which is just not practical.\n\nAnd isn't it the judiciary's responsibility to ensure that both the administrative and legislative complies with the law? Thus far, it seems like there have been blatant violations of the law by the administration, most notably improperly dismissing multiple people immediately where there is a clear procedure set in law as to how (or IF) they can be dismissed.",
