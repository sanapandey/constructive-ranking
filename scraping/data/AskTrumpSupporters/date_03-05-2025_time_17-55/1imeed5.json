This would eliminate social classes, and since all conflict is caused via class warfare (supposedly), would eventually eliminate the need for a state to control the classes.\n\nWhat I've never been able to understand is where the vast resources of the system factor in to all of this. It seems to me like a revolution would require vast resources, such as weaponry, transportation, manpower, and leadership. Once the revolution is complete, the revolutionary force would then absorb the resources of the bourgeoisie. *What happens then*? History would tell us that the leaders of the revolution would simply use their new resources to to implement communism for the masses, while never ceding control of their new ruling class status. And how could they? Someone *has* to rule. Jobs need to be done. Resources need to be divided. Infrastructure needs to be built. An apparatus of authority would need to exist to ensure this happens.\n\nI guess I've just never understood the leap that communists take from a worker revolution --> classless utopia.",

            "body": "*TLDR: Communism is an evil arguably omnicidal ideology that wants everything you are collectively owned & wants to abolish the difference between man & child in every meaning, including sexual.\n\n\nCommunism is a political theory which draws off of Rousseau's theories on how the state is the arbiter & source of good, rights, & property. Fascism, Nazism, & Communism all originate from here, alongside the dialectics of Hegel's spirituality but inversed into materialism. Philosophy is really annoying to explain because in order to fully understand one philosophy you have to go over 4 others which each then require at least 2 more. To make it really as condensed as possible, Communism is a theory which engages in contradictory paradoxical thinking to believe it has encompassed everything & stratifies, divides, all of society into classes of people: oppressor & oppressed. Everything is to be done for the oppressed, everything against the oppressor is justified by them being the oppressor. It doesn't matter if all you did was own a small shop you operated alone, you are part of the petite bourgeoise & to be destroyed. It applies this material oppressor-oppressed state to all of history, in something that is blatantly absurd to anyone literate in history it argues that all of it is caused solely by the oppressor abusing the oppressed for economic reasons. There is no belief, no ideas, no conflict of culture, no differing values, it's all just about material wealth of an oppressor class oppressing others for more material to a communist. Decent note, this applied to ethnicity instead of economics is a decent summation of Nazism, this applied to governments - the state - is a decent summation of Fascism.\n\nCommunism is an absurd delusion with stated goals that are impossible so long as individual entities exist, the main stated one to be the elimination of social, economic, & physical differences between people. Thus it would destroy everyone as it goes along, in its truest state it would kill every last person alive, because so long as there are people there are judgements, so long as there are people there is a hierarchy of value.\n\nAccording to Engels, & this is something Marx agreed with though not nearly as enthusiastically, the purpose is to create a stateless existence of eternal pleasure, especially of the sexual variety. The purpose of mankind is purely one of pleasure & any impediment on the most base immediate form of pleasure is to be destroyed, that means no marriage, no singular relationships, no age restrictions either. Engels fully endorsed the destruction of all differences between man, woman, *& child.* Yes, he openly advocated for pedophilia as part of the end goal & believed it would be good for the children. As part of the idea of eliminating distinctions that includes distinctions between adult & child. Think the most degenerate, depraved pleasure garden in Warhammer 40k, that's what Engels wanted for all of humanity & believed was our purpose in life.\n\nKarl Marx was the premiere champagne socialist. He advocated against charity as the bane of the revolution for it sated the desire for it yet his whole life he begged others for money & lived as lavishly as he could. Partying away more than his wealthy father could afford. One of the least productive, most destructive, entitled people to have ever lived. I despise entitlement. At least Stalin actually put effort into it even if it was evil, there's still appreciable traits in just how brutally effective & dedicated & the scale of work & skill, no matter how vile those were, done to his goals. The only person Marx ever showed real love towards was his sister, who grew to call him a disgusting parasite that was eating away at the family & most especially the father. Read some of the letters between Karl & Heinrich Marx, it is heartbreaking watching the father slowly just break down in pleading with his son to do something. There's this one etched into my memory eternally where Heinrich is begging Marx to do something, talking about how smart Karl is in a letter obviously penned with love & care & cherishing him, but expressing how Marx's parties are destroying the family finances & he wants to see Marx do something with his life. Karl's response? A cold, heartless demand for more money. What evil sick bastard does that to a loving father? There's also the letter he writes to Engels about his mother's death, where he talks about how it is good she died for it means he will receive inheritance. He is one of the people in history I am most disgusted by. Engels is probably more disgusting though, because of the earlier stated goals he set up.\n\nAdditional note the idea of consent is anti-communist, in the truest sense of Communism, because of the way that Communism goes about eliminating all individualism & individual decision making. *You, your labor, your consent, your soul* are collectively owned in communist theory. It is not about the worker, as in the individual, owning his or her own labor, that is a trick, a deception. Most opponents of communism even fall for this lie, they just think it something communism fails to achieve, but that was never the goal. It is about the arbitrary collective owning you. You will be forced to labor & if necessary bare child for the collective pleasure whether you agree or not. That is the true face of Communism. It should be seen as equally detestably as pedophile & rape advocacy.",

It wants to end judgement & differences but to have thought at all is to have judgement & differences which invariably forms a value hierarchy. The latter half just read Engles's papers on it.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you're not capable of following basic logical argument & need me to put the exact same thing in a (usually corrupt) magazine with someone else with a degree to sign off on it to accept it you aren't thinking for yourself at all. You can debate my argument but if all you demand is a signature from someone else, then you only believe what others tell you to believe.\n\n\nMy argument is far stronger than a citation, it takes it down line by line. I can also point to how every communist society does this, they see any group that distinguishes itself like farmers, cossacks, kulacks, the educated, the musicians, etc. as something to be crushed into obedience to the state. Look up Stalin's ideas on the New Soviet Man. Stalin was a zealous communist before you deny that, his only difference from Trotsky was Stalin was slightly more realistic & less genocidal than Trotsky, as well as having a plan to enact the global revolution slowly through the nation of the USSR rather than attempt immediate open warfare with every single country as Trotsky desired. Trotsky's explicit, main criticism of Stalin was that Stalin wasn't killing the peasants _fast enough_ in the name of the Worker.\u00a0",

Everyone I talked to hated communism and hated Fidel. I saw with my own eyes how crappy the communist system was. Great in theory, crap in reality. \n\nI also lived in Vietnam, another \u201ccommunist\u201d country, for several years. I put it in quotes because it\u2019s only communist in the sense that the Communist Party rules with an iron fist and dissent is not tolerated. Economically they are capitalist.\n\nSo yeah I hate communism with a passion.\n\nI\u2019m curious why you\u2019re asking the question. What do you think of communism? Have you ever been to a communist country?",

As a thought experiment do you guys know what type of government 1984 is vs animal farm? Did you guys also know that both Cuba and Venezuela had capitalist democracy that where overtaken by a capitalist dictatorship before they became communist? The reason I ask that is because usually the biggest line that once its crossed is really hard to bring back is ignoring the countries constitution because sadly you set a precedent. Its really sad for me to see americans hate their constitution when its been the model that every other country envys why do you want to get rid of it?",

Both have sad endings but are really good representations on why both types of governments are bad. Animal Farm represents communism and 1984 represents Fascism. I actually feel Animal Farm is easier to read. However I wanted to point out how both dictatorships really suck (either far left or far right) and the reason why our constitution is so beautiful its because it creates a division of power, which is very necessary because power corrupts and it makes sure you don\u2019t end up with a power hungry king doing bad stuff. Sadly Trump ignoring courts order is actually leading us to a constitutional crisis. I am not against slashing spending we really need it but doing it in an unconstitutional way and defying court orders when Republicans currently have a trifecta is extremely worry-some because we are testing each day the limits of our constitution and there will be a point we cant fix the damages. The saddest part is that there is no need to ignore it other than to test how far Trump can destroy and ignore the constitution and what US stands for or why isn\u2019t he using the senate the way Bill Clinton (last president that had an actual budget deficit) did?",

I'll definitely re read animal farm, and 1984. which one do you recommend first? \n\nI agree with a lot of what you said, and i see where you are coming from. I watched the interview with musk and trump tonight, and trump said he will always follow the rulings of the courts but will legally fight back. before, he hinted that he might ignore them, but he confirmed tonight he wont do that. i just wonder WHY judges (not elected) dont want doge to look into treasury data. WHY there is so much controversy in looking into USAid, the DOE and the DOD. It seems like dem political activism vs the interest of the people, who elected trump. He talked about exposing govt waste at every single rally. we knew elon was going to do what hes doing, we voted for it. are you kept up with what they are uncovering so far? Ill link the press conference if youd like. \n\nIm happy with the transparency so far, and limiting government is a republican wet dream. so the fascism comments baffle me. Again, why are judges blocking DOGE from even looking? its fishy to me. we can only hope  what this administration is doing is for the greater good of americans. im not saying its impossible that there will be conflicts of interest or anything nefarious really.. most politicians arent worthy of our trust. But so far, i like where this is all going.\n\nAlso maybe you can educate me on what Clinton did through the senate? Im not aware. he was terrible though. the deregulation of the FCC which gave us the propaganda machines that are our msm, NAFTA, reducing taxes on billionaires (capital gains) and increasing taxes on average americans, repealing glass stegall (killed us economically) etc etc\n\nagain thanks for talking with me, i like hearing sober points of views from someone who pays attention!",

                                                            "body": "I\u2019d start with Animal Farm since it\u2019s much easier to read and serves as a great introduction to how a revolution can shift from democracy to authoritarianism. 1984, is more complex and takes place within a fully established authoritarian country, and focuses more on how control is maintained rather than how it begins. Keep in mind that while Animal Farm critiques communism and 1984 critiques fascism, both are authoritarian so they might seem similar in the methods that they use to control despite ideological differences.\n\nHe keeps saying that he will follow court rulings, but he isn\u2019t actually listening to them since he continues to pause funding. :( I think it\u2019s really important to understand existing laws and that judges aren\u2019t against audits or decreasing funds\u2014they are against unlawful behavior.\n\nFor a bit of context, there\u2019s a law passed by Congress because of Nixon\u2019s unconstitutional behavior called the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. It basically states that the president can\u2019t pause payments appropriated by Congress and that he must work with Congress to pause or cancel any payments. So Trump/Musk continue auditing and stopping funds without Congress is ignoring existing laws and really disregarding laws that were put there for a reason. I totally agree that we need to decrease spending ASAP, and it should be the number one priority, but with a senate and house majority, this would be very easy to do. Instead, they have deliberately decided to ignore the laws/the constitution. Especially a law that was created due to Watergate.\n\nFor me, it\u2019s really scary how they are controlling the narrative to make it look like it\u2019s activism, when they are showing spending that has always been publicly available online. To me, they are pushing a narrative  that makes people root for them and happy while hiding that they are undermining the laws and therefore the constitution. For example, they say that USAID spends money on the press, like Politico, but it\u2019s actually for subscriptions\u2014kind of like the Bloomberg of finance. Or they say the past government used FEMA funds to pay for illegal immigrants, which is technically true, but FEMA had specific funds appropriated by Congress for immigrants (like different bank accounts) under the same organization. I could go on, but the point is they are using this narrative to make it seem like it\u2019s the other side\u2019s corruption, but there\u2019s a reason they haven\u2019t launched any investigations\u2014because nothing was illegal. There\u2019s a huge difference between something being illegal and spending you don\u2019t like.\n\nThe scariest part is how, in their narrative, they\u2019ve been saying\u2014Vance, Johnson, even Musk\u2014that it\u2019s activist judges, that the judiciary branch does not have the authority. This makes so many people believe it and not realize how Trump/Musk is actually the one not following the Constitution. And I could go on about how terrifying some of the moves they are making are. And the fact that they have the majority in Congress and everyone is scared of Musk retaliation, but still wont use Congress is mind boggling. So many things they are doing are about undermining the separation of power, and I really think reading George Orwell\u2019s books would be eye-opening.\n\nFor example, actually weaponizing the DOJ. I know they say Biden weaponized it, but Biden had a reason for investigation but he never used to get loyalty from people. For example: The January 6 issue\u2014when Trump sent fake electorals (that said he won the states that he lost) and told Pence to certify those instead of the real ones\u2014is insane. That\u2019s very authoritarian and absolutely needed investigation since its a clear action to overthrow our government that got somehow lost in the noise? For example none or my friends new about the fake electoral plot until I showed them because the media kind of ignored this in their narrative. However Trump is using the DOJ to buy loyalty and making it extremely corrupt \u2014like the NYC mayor case, where Trump just got them to remove the charges of corruption to the mayor in the bat of an eye. The way they are removing things from public pages, removing women from the pages in the DOD is pure censorship. Deleting all data on J6 is literally about rewriting history, which is a huge theme in 1984 and is very fascist.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Elon, signing new deals with the government while he still owns shares in his companies. Just yesterday, he signed a $34 million deal, and he has around $4 billion in government contracts, yet he is auditing himself while still keeping his company. There\u2019s a reason why all heads of Treasury must sell all their stocks or investments when they work for the government (and it\u2019s even a huge plus for them because they don\u2019t pay taxes on anything they sell). But Elon still has full access to his company?? This is literally how corrupt governments work in third-world countries.\n\nAnd yes Republicans dream is less government, but Trump wants loyaltyS That\u2019s what fascists do. Not loyalty to the Constitution, but loyalty to the presidents And that\u2019s what Trump is getting at. Just look at how no one dares to question him on anything\u2014even Mike Johnson, a constitutional lawyer who knows better, said that the judicial branch was overreaching. That\u2019s where it gets really, really scary.\n\nSo Clinton has things people like and dislike, it is true that he decreased long term capital gain taxes but his idea was to incentivize long term investments, however the way he balanced the budget was by cutting spending and increasing taxes especially on corporations. He had a 39% tax on corporations, and we are currently at 21%. That\u2019s how he balanced the budget. There are things he did that weren\u2019t the best, but he did what he had to do to balance the budget he also removed people abusing welfare. (They used to call him a republican disguised as a democrat).  But my overall point with Clinton was that he did everything working with Congress, not ignoring Congress (He also had a trifecta) \n\nAnd I would also add that Fox News is a huge propaganda machine. Just notice how everyone there is saying the judiciary branch is overreaching when as I explained above they are just trying to follow the law. All these media outlets are out there to make money, and siding with Trump gets them more views therefore more money) But everything that Trump is doing\u2014if you really look at the details\u2014is to undermine our beautiful Constitution while crafting a narrative so well that no one is noticing it.\n\nLike, I\u2019m actually terrified. Even the American Bar Association has spoken out, but no one is seeing it because of these fake narratives\u2014about fraud and judicial overreach\u2014are being pushed so hard. It\u2019s honestly crazy. I\u2019m genuinely scared. And of course, I\u2019ll talk to you\u2014I feel like one of the biggest problems is that everyone is just screaming at each other instead of actually talking and explaining their worries. I really think Orwell\u2019s books are a great read to really see what\u2019s going on from a different perspective.If you get to here, thank you so much for reading my concerns and having an open dialogue. You have no idea how I appreciate and hopefully you can see some of my worries?",

I 100% agree that they are propaganda machines . I dont listen to republican talking heads either (tucker, candice owens, etc). anything filled with buzzwords and emotion. and there is an equally deceptive dumpster fire on the left (CNN ranking as the most powerful media outlet in the US, the WP, etc). \n\nYou seem to be well read enough to not fall for the trap that is sensationalized media. So im not accusing you of such and i respect that a ton. the problem is MOST people dont read past headlines. Most social media platforms, and all of the top media stations, have been left controlled for the last 10 years. No one has been put under a microscope as much as Trump, but the thing is, everything he does comes straight from his mouth- what you see is what you get. he isnt media trained. he isnt politically correct. nothing he says is scripted (to his own detriment ill admit) but i prefer that to politicians who move in the shadows and pay the msm to bury stories (hunter biden, etc.) to me a babbling transparent idiot isnt as scary as a deceptive and methodical politician hiding behind a facade. I have disagreed with much of what trump has done, but he doesnt hide his intentions as well as other politicians do. but i digress..\n\nill hit on some of your other points later. in the meantime, id love to share with you a few podcasts that i listen to through the week- \n\nUnbiased Politics (episodes are about 45 minutes twice a week- the host Jordan is a Lawyer who breaks down everything going on rn through legal analysis. she doesnt share a single opinion and is all fact based. she has a very thurough understanding of our constitution and laws) her last episode she touches on Dodge etc. Because of her, I am not as right leaning as i used to be. i still have my core beliefs, but i love how she breaks down everything.\n\nand a little bonus is \nUnbiased Updates (8 min episodes a morning, reporting on regular news, again all fact based)\n\nlistening to the first podcast i mentioned has calmed me a ton. i trust our separation of powers (even with the trifecta) and our constitution will hold strong against tyranny . but i completely understand everything you said . I may just be too trusting",

I feel its okay if a President doesn\u2019t have your views if elected as long as they dont constantly defy the separation of power. At the end you might learn something with a different perspective and if nothing works you vote them out. I would add that I tend to ally more with conservative values but Im anti trump. My main concern with Trump is that he has always used loopholes to bend the rules and is way to Narcissistic to be president. He sadly only likes Yes men and has always said that he will look into Revenge with anyone that betrays him if he gets the chance. That is a scary thing for someone that is a president and puts our constitution in danger. \n\nThe worse thing is that if we survive these 4 years there will be precedents for the next president to do the same and this is how people in third word countries behave. You mention Hunters laptop, however the entire investigation was started with Trumps DOJ. He was the first one to use the DOJ against enemies. And I know that there were to many cases against him but he sadly did cause an insurrection especially when you look at the Electoral Plot. To make it worse all the people that have gathered around him are bad people with no sense of duty and I actually think they are a bigger threat because they see him as a means to an end.\n\nI was looking at the podcast you recommended and it\u2019s really good. A little slow but I like how she just tells you everything that is happening. Im more of a reader and my favorite form of news is democracy docket. \n\nI would also add my family lives in latin america and I have seen how they dismantle institutions and destroy democracies and it\u2019s usually the way it\u2019s going with Trump. For me it\u2019s very sad because I have always loved how the US is the rule of laws and freedom and I see how we are losing that. I have friends now vocally saying democracy doesn\u2019t work which has really worried me.\n\nWith all that said lets hope for the best and let me know when you start reading the books, I might buy them again and reread them :) Let me know if there is anything you would like me to clarify?",

I firmly reject comunism and soclialism - and see the biggest difference beting the level of force to impose such rule.\n\nBoth are born of the utopian dream of everybody working together as a community for the communities good never works.  Communism is govenment (state) control of property, employment, services, where everyone is forced to have the same living, working, and social conditions.  In its uttimate form the theory is there would be no need for money.  Karl Marks, either a blid dreamer, or more likely just pure evitl,  goes way beyond this couple sentences.  However this short summery seems the ideal socialists / comunists dream of.\n\nIn reality communism is forced oppression by a ruling power to lower eveyone to the lowest common denominator - making everyone universally poor to force equity.   The whole \"You will own nothing and like it\" BS.\n\nI firmly stand by the basis of freedom that rejects communism, I can't find where I orginally herd this idea, althought Margaret Thatcher quoted something pretty much the same back in 1975, and it pretty much sums up my belief is what life should be and the pricipal behind most of my beliefs.  Granted this is brittish in origin, but I believe applies to all free countries; sadly it looks like the UK has lost out on this dream; hence I love the USA as long as it rejects socialism and communisim.  This ieal is pertty much the OPPOSITE OF COMMUNISM:\n\n**\"A man's right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the State as servant and not as master\" ...  \"They are the essence of a free economy. And on that freedom all our other freedoms depend.\"**",
