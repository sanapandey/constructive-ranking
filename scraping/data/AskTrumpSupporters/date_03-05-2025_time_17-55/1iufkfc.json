            "body": "The issue with CFPB is not tied to government waste and inefficiency, its tied to corruption. I encourage anyone truly curious in good faith to read the below transcript on the topic of CFPB and its exertion of \"soft power\" from a pre-election Marc Andreessen interview. \n\n_______________\n\nMy favorite twist is we have this thing called independent federal agencies. So like for example, we have this thing called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, CFPB, which is sort of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s personal agency that she gets to control. And it\u2019s an independent agency that gets to run and do whatever it wants, right? And if you read the Constitution, there is no such thing as independent agency, and yet there it is. And this agency does whatever she wants. Basically, terrorize financial institutions, prevent new competition, new startups that want to compete with the big banks. \n\nBack to your fascism point, which is, there\u2019s a constitutional amendment that says the government can\u2019t restrict your speech, but there\u2019s no constitutional amendment that says the government can\u2019t debank you, right? And so they, if they can\u2019t do the one thing, they do the other thing, and then they don\u2019t have to debank you. They just have to put pressure on the private company banks to do it. And then the private company banks do it because they\u2019re expected to. But the government gets to say we didn\u2019t do it. It was the private company that did it. And of course JP Morgan can decide who they want to have as customers, because they\u2019re a private company. And so it\u2019s this it\u2019s this sleight of hand that happens it \u2014 basically it\u2019s a privatized sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran. Kick you out of the financial system. \n\nAnd so this has been happening to all the crypto entrepreneurs in the last four years. This has been happening to a lot of the fintech entrepreneurs, anybody trying to start any kind of new banking service because they\u2019re trying to protect the big banks. And then this has been happening, by the way, also in legal fields of economic activity that they don\u2019t like. And so a lot of this started about 15 years ago with this thing called Operation Choke Point, where they decided to, as marijuana started to become legal, as prostitution started to become legal, and then guns, which there\u2019s always a fight about. Under the Obama administration, they started to debank legal marijuana businesses, escort businesses, and then gun shops, just like your gun manufacturers, and just like you\u2019re done. You\u2019re out of the banking system. And so if you\u2019re running a medical marijuana dispensary in 2012, guess what, you\u2019re doing your business all in cash, because you literally can\u2019t get a bank account. You can\u2019t get a Visa terminal. You can\u2019t process transactions. You can\u2019t do payroll. You can\u2019t do direct deposit. You can\u2019t get insurance. Like none of that stuff \u2014 you\u2019ve been sanctioned, right \u2014 none of that stuff is available. \n\nAnd then this administration extended that concept to apply it to tech founders, crypto founders, and then just generally political opponents. So that\u2019s been super pernicious. Operation Choke 1.0 was 15 years ago against the pot and the guns. Choke Point 2.0 is primarily against their political enemies and then to their disfavored tech startups. And it\u2019s hit the tech world hard. We\u2019ve had like 30 founders debanked in the last four years. It\u2019s been a big recurring pattern. This is one of the reasons why we ended up supporting Trump. We just can\u2019t live in this world. We can\u2019t live in a world where somebody starts a company that\u2019s a completely legal thing, and then they literally get sanctioned, and embargoed by the United States government through a completely unaccountable \u2014 by the way, no due process. None of this is written down. There\u2019s no rules. There\u2019s no court. There\u2019s no decision process. There\u2019s no appeal. Who do you appeal to, right? Like who do you go to, to get your bank account back? \n\nAnd so this is when Trump says the deep state \u2014 it\u2019s administrative power. It\u2019s political power being administered, not through legislation. So there\u2019s no defined law that covers this. It\u2019s not through regulation. You can\u2019t go sue a regulator to fix this. It\u2019s not through any kind of court judgment. It\u2019s just raw power. It\u2019s just raw administrative power. It\u2019s the government or politicians just deciding that things are going to be a certain way, and then they just apply pressure until they get it. You hear this sometimes, it\u2019s these terms, \u201ccompliance, reputation management, tone at the top.\u201d They have these lovely sounding terms that make it sound like everybody\u2019s going to be an upstanding citizen, but what they\u2019re all code for is \u201cdestroy the enemy.\u201d Bring the hammer of God and the bank and the government or whoever. Bring it down and just crush the individual with no due process. \n\nAnd look, there\u2019s an argument in the long run that this is all unconstitutional because the constitution gives us all the right to due process and this is government pressure. So there\u2019s probably a Supreme Court case in five years that\u2019s going to find retroactively that this was all illegal. But in the moment when you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s been debanked\u2013 And I think this is important context, where like when Elon and Vivek talk about reducing regulation, there\u2019s two ways of thinking about reducing regulation. It\u2019s like, oh my God, the water in the air is going to get dirty and the food\u2019s going to get poisoned. Now, some of those regulations, I think, are very important. But the other way to think about it is examples like this, which is just raw government power being applied to ordinary people who are just trying to live their lives, are just trying to do something legitimate, and they\u2019re just on the wrong side of something that the people in power have decided. \n\nI think that right way to think about this is when we think about totalitarianism we think about literally World War Two, you know we think about Nazis and jackboots with tanks and guns, beating people up and killing people. You might call it that hard totalitarianism, right? But there\u2019s this other version you might call soft totalitarianism, which is just rules and power exercised arbitrarily that just simply suppresses everything. And this is speech control and debanking and all these other things that we\u2019ve been talking about. The good news is they\u2019re not coming up and like beating you up in the middle of the night. The bad news is you are under their complete control and they can do whatever they want to you that doesn\u2019t involve physical violence, which basically includes every aspect of how you actually conduct your life and support your family and get an income and everything else.\n\n__________\n\nEDIT: Reformatted in response to request from OP.

                    "body": "The CFPB was formed to aggregated duplicate agency efforts and make each of the agencies and consumer protections more effective as a whole, which seems very at odds with your claim about it doing th4e opposite. From [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/cfpb-whats-at-stake) :  \n> Those existing regulators were created to look out for banks\u2019 interests, so the added consumer protection mandates created tension in their jobs, SoRelle says. On top of that, spreading out consumer protection across multiple agencies required a level of coordination that was hard to achieve.  \n\u201cWhat ended up happening was really weak consumer financial protections,\u201d SoRelle says. \u201cThat led in no small part to the financial crisis.\u201d\n>\n> The CFPB was set up to be a centralized rulemaker. Multiple regulators still coordinate, but now there\u2019s an obvious, expert authority with a singular goal to protect consumers in the financial space. Congress further insulated the bureau from political pressure by funding it through the Federal Reserve instead of Congressional appropriation \u2014 an unusual arrangement that the Supreme Court upheld in 2024. \n>\n> As a result, the CFPB is more efficient than the previous consumer protection system, SoRelle argues. And that\u2019s made it an effective watchdog. Since it was established, and especially under the Biden administration, the bureau has reformed many aspects of the consumer financial space, penalized companies that broke the law and refunded billions of dollars to consumers who lost money as a result of unfair or illegal practices. \n>\n> \u201cThe idea that it\u2019s duplicative or inefficient is simply not true,\u201d SoRelle says, adding that a diminished CFPB could bring back the environment that existed before the agency was created.\n\nI am totally for eliminating bureaucracy and redundancy where needed (it's one of the key parts of my job), but why disband an agency which provided a net-positive (financially and non-financially) to the American people? As the Supreme Court stated last year. From the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/cfpb-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-ted-cruz-gop-defund-b831384c) (a fiscally conservative publication):\n\n> Last year, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge that could have dismantled the agency, ruling that Congress had authority, when it set up the bureau, to insulate the bureau\u2019s funding stream from political interference.\n\nThe Roberts Supreme Court is very conservative compared to past supreme courts, so I don't see them liberally biased in their claims. I don't believe their assessment of the situation is out of line with the information out there about the CFPB--which I provided earlier from the agency itself, but is also publicly available in many news outlets and publications. Their 2022 ruling supports existing checks and balances provided by Article 1 of the US Constitution: Congress makes calls around budgeting/funding, not the Supreme Court (Article 3) or Executive Branch (Article 2).",

Dodd-Frank has mandated that these protections are provided so unless repealed they won\u2019t be going away.",
