I see things I would consider wasteful spending and then a few things that were slightly woke but I haven\u2019t yet heard of any money laundering, fraud, kickbacks, crimes etc\n>\n>Well, when there are so many things that are wasteful, it's hard to tell which one of them are fraudulent, money laundering, kickbacks, or crimes.\n>\n>But [GOA's own reports show that the improper payments account for anywhere between $233 billion and $521 billion](https://www.gao.gov/fraud-and-improper-payments)... note that this is [more than what we spend on Social Security](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/).\n>\n>So I'm not sure we should split hairs on what's fraud, money laundering, kickbacks, and crimes.\n\n\nDo you believe that government report? Can it be trusted?",

It would literally violate financial standards to have an auditor that holds contracts with the subject of the audit. So if Joe at Audit Firm A has material contracts with Public Company B he would not be allowed to take part in the audit. People are taken off of audits all of the time because of conflict of interest. In your thought process, are you thinking because all shareholders (similar to all US citizens) would have the same benefit to the company being audited as Joe (Elon) would, it makes it okay? Kind of a public good thing?",

It would literally violate financial standards to have an auditor that holds contracts with the subject of the audit.\n\nCan you name a single auditor that would have no direct or indirect contracts with the federal government, have no clients that would be affected by such an Audit, AND have the bandwidth to conduct said audit AND be willing to? \n\nI also have experience in this industry. I can think of no such company with all these qualities. There's no weight to this position- this is the US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT - the largest institution to EVER EXIST - OF COURSE there's going to be overlap - now if Elon somehow finagled his way into cancelling contracts with his competitors while keeping contracts with his company for no valid reason- you might have my attention.

Are you saying that there are firms with 100+ auditors in their employment who also don't have a single contract with the US government? What if their clients have contracts with the US government, or one of these auditors is working/has worked with a client who does have a current contract with the US government?

On the contrary from what I've read from your comment history I do believe you are here in good faith- what I'm asking is whether these firms even exist. I do not believe they do.

If Deloitte is being paid millions by Lockheed Martin, and additionally doing the auditing to determine the validity of Lockheed's government contracts - how is that not a conflict of interest? \n\n>\u00a0If you could design this audit in an ideal world, how would you do it?\n\nYou are probably not asking the most neutral person- but very similar to how it's being done here- with a small team, led by an outside critic, where their goal is moreso slash and burn over meticulousness. In my experience (especially with accounting/auditing) it's much too easy to get lost in the trees, and miss the forest. I would rather than Elon suggest and propose broad cuts, then reign them in if he receives enough evidence that they are a requirement, rather than an option for federal spending. \n\n>Would you get more information out to the public?\n\nIn terms of what specifically, financial reports? \n\n>People seem to be getting really upset about what Elon is finding, but there isn't any proof of it.\n\nProof of what exactly? I've seen the spending on most of the big ticket items that Elon has cut. I'm not gonna go ahead and claim that I've looked through every debit and credit and financial schedule of programs being cut, but I've at least seen a cursory summary of the spending and where it went.",

Not op but in the last trump presidency I cared that Trump was overcharging secret service to stay at his hotel the vast majority of weekends in order to make a shit ton of money, all of which was paid for by the tax payer. \n\nIn fact when he first became president I criticized him not giving away his businesses to a blind trust, like Carter did. Instead Trump gave them to his family.",

Russia just doesn't like that those states respond less to their control because they see a viable alternative.\n\nThis is by definition soft power and what this program was designed to do. These criticisms leveled by Russia are evidence it works. The important thing is not whether you think basket weaving classes in Botswana make sense, but whether overall it serves a good outcome.\n\nThat it's being used to score political points with a population that doesn't understand the reason for the programs, because it wasn't designed with the idea they would be used as internal political ammo, is just gamesmanship at all our expense IMO.\n\nDo you still think this is internal meddling in other countries, given all its doing is giving a positive impression of democracy and the united states in those countries through sponsoring public works and programs to help the people?",

This is the kind of wasteful spending that DOGE has found in 2 weeks- imagine what they'll find over the lifecycle of the entire Administration! \n\n>It\u2019s way cheaper than battling some growing aids epidemic.\n\nWe already have tons of condoms available in the US - the cost of which is pretty miniscule. \n\n>Besides, the actual amount coming out of taxpayers\u2019 pockets individually for this could hardly even be expressed using the unit of currency they just phased out, it\u2019s probably not even a cent.\n\nAssume the cost is split evenly across all Americans (which it's not, it's disproportionately coming from taxpayers obv) - it's actually more like 18 cents. 60M/330M. \n\nOverall, to your larger point though, these numbers add up. It's not like Dems support cuts to larger programs either, so I'm not sure what to tell you. Dems are unhappy that we're cutting spending, and I say good riddance. I'm tired of listening to their ridiculous economic fantasies, it's time to live in the real world.",

USAID didn't help a bit for modern pandemics, and if there were to be another \"wet market\" outbreak then USAID wouldn't help there either. \n\n>You refuse to believe that aid or research helps prevent outbreaks because COVID while we had those things?\n\nNot necessarily, but my bigger point is that the most deadly virus we saw didn't come because of a lack of aid. \n\n>\u00a0The alternative is to ignore the poor countries where disease can travel quickly\n\nDisease spreads for more quickly thru developed countries than poor ones bc of modern travel... \n\n>Ok.

(Though I\u2019m not bothered by the condoms either because of real issues others have noted above - starting with HIV.) And it amounts to 0.0009 percent of our federal spending. To me, that\u2019s worth it to work towards eradicating AIDS which is a horrible disease that destroys the human immune system and can be passed onto children through birth. I\u2019m fine with it looks like maybe a few cents of my tax money to go to this. Why be the richest nation in history if we can\u2019t help humanity with a life destroying disease!? \n\nThat being said, my question is, if we do save this money - is the right in favor of it actually being used for domestic homeless services? Or will those programs ultimately need to be cut too so the argument of \u201cwe need the money here\u201d is kind of moot when the right doesn\u2019t actually want those domestic programs either? I mean, a huge factor in homelessness is lack of medical care especially mental health support - but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a desire to expand Medicaid, open more tax funded low cost mental health providers, fund low cost tax supported housing, increase access to income security programs\u2026or is there? Or is the goal really to cut all this \u201cwaste,\u201d lower taxes (more for the wealthy/corporations) and then not actually put any money into our domestic needs?",
