            "body": "There is a trend on both the right and the left of signing \"deals\" that bypass the proper process for signing treaties, because congress is so dysfunctional.\n\nSo right off the bat, most of these agreements are not real in the first place. Really, it was insanely reckless on the side of the American administration that these kinds of deals got signed in the first place (ex. the Budapest Memorandum, Paris Climate Agreement, JCPOA, really most things signed in the last 40 years). They knew these deals couldn't get past congress and so they knowingly signed deals that were presented internationally as binding, when in reality they were not.\n\nThen concerning real treaties, there is a debate in conservative circles on whether the constitution's mandate for the executive branch to \"negotiate\" treaties necessarily includes the right to exit a treaty without congressional action. And, we'll have to see how that shakes out in the court. So that's just a straight disagreement.\n\nOne thing to note is that NATO really is a standout here, where there actually is agreement to maintain NATO membership even over whatever Trump is doing. Congress passed the law explicitly preventing the President from unilaterally exiting. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's still more than enough support is Congress to overcome any attempt at unilateral action from Trump.\n\nGenerally, I would not consider the US a reliable partner in the current environment, because the vision of major factions is so different. And over time, both sides have been willing to break more and more of the current process (because it's broken). But whose fault is that? IMO, there is a lot of blame to go around. Each side takes a few steps further in each congressional session, Presidential administration.\n\nAs far as whether I'm happy, IDK. I think it's more tragic than pleased. I think the intra-NATO unpleasantness was inevitable and deserved. And I'm generally thrilled with Trump's behavior specifically in negotiations, especially in trying to claw back some kind of value for the donations we have given. It's incredibly unfair that we have been donating free-and-clear while Europe has been expecting value in return (usually by structuring things as loans). Though, I do disagree with him on the value of supporting Ukraine. Europe has been incredibly reckless and blind with defense. And it's at the point, where after 30+ years of complaining about how they aren't taking Russian threats seriously and neglecting to maintain proper military readiness, it's too late now and it's really also Europe who has proven to be an unreliable partner.",

But trade deals are in another category. Should any country trust America on any international agreements any more?",

And might screw up everything else Trump is trying to accomplish by tanking the economy.\n\nPersonally, I think they should have started with tariffs on China and southeast asia to force manufacturing back into the west first. Mostly that would go do Mexico, which is a good carrot to bring Mexico to the table to negotiate aggressive anti-cartel operations by joint US/Mexican military forces.\n\nTrump is right IMO to target bringing manufacturing form Mexico and Canada back to the US. But I think he missed a step and it's going to make the strategy not work ultimately. Whereas adding an intermediate step would get us other benefits and avoid the blowback that is happening now like potentially driving Canada into deeper integration with Europe.\n\nUltimately, that's a way larger threat than I think anyone is really talking about right now. The US's unbelievable strength comes in part from our isolation. If we drive Canada and Mexico into deep, hostile foreign alliances, it create a staging area for true existential threats to the homeland.\n\nBut, I don't think there's really a debate over whether he has the power to do it. Just that it's not really a good idea even if your goal is returning manufacturing to the US.",

From what I've seen, I think most Trump supporters are mostly supportive of tariffs even on Mexico, Canada, and Europe. Or at least neutral, willing to give it a shot.\n\nEdit: and to be clear, I'm not really worrying that much about Mexico/Canada tariffs. I don't think it's going to work. But IDK. I'm interested to see what happens. I'm generally comfortable with the level of volatility Trump is bringing, knowing that some portion of it isn't going to work.",

And Clinton and Romney are closer than Romney and Trump.\n\nOne thing I'm wary of though is that proportional representation countries tend to have larger central governments, because they tend to have fewer checks and balances once a majority coalition is formed.\n\nAnd just feasibly, it's unlikely to work in the US because it requires such a dramatic change from our existing system, where it'd require very differently aligned districts with either tiny districts or multi-member representation in larger districts.\n\nEven just fighting to expand the house of representatives first would be a more realistic and achievable goal for long-term structural change. If the house was 10k+ members representing low 6 figure population districts, everyone could feasibly know their representative. And I think naturally you'd get more parties even in a FPTP system. For example, regional parties like a Texas Independence party, more explicitly Trump-aligned party (ex. America First party) in a lot of deep red districts, actual for real socialist/communist parties in some parts of liberal cities like the Bronx, Oakland, and parts of Portland/Seattle, and so on.",

The bureaucracy driven approach isn't the kind of checks and balances I am really interested in.\n\nReally, that's kind of inverted from what I'd like to see. Like in the example you mention, a cabinet secretary not being able to fully run their department is creating a weird unelected 4th branch of government, where somehow bureaucrats end up with the authority to execute laws based on their interpretation of legislation apart from the actual elected and politically appointed executives.\n\nThis is where most of the consternation over Trump's actions in the federal workforce come from. How is an independent agency even a thing? Like, there is no 4th branch of government. All executive power is vested in the President as the embodiment of the executive branch. Literally, the executive branch only exists as an extension of the president, so how can something be part of the executive if it's independent of the president?\n\nTo me, the way the constitution is designed is that:\n\n- The Legislature makes law and budget, which the President carries out. Implicitly that means, the President can't act without Congress\n- Buuuut, the President determines how to carry the laws out, how to spend within the guidelines Congress gives. Implicitly, this means the President can't be forced to do anything (ie. not enforcing things at their discretion, which is currently legal; and impoundment, which is currently illegal, but I think it should be legal, Congress cannot legislate away the President's constitutional power to act [and implicitly, not to act])\n- The Court determines if something the President is doing matches the thing the Legislature gave authority/money to do\n\nThe system is inherently biased towards inaction. And that's a deliberate choice on the part of the framers, which is limiting the government's power.\n\nObviously, only part of this is the way things are now. But that's where the underlying gridlock comes from. Both Congress and the President have varying levels of veto, but neither can do something alone. So there's a heavy bias towards inaction that makes the federal government fundamentally unsuited to it's current size.\n\nSpecifically on treaties, the constitution says this:\n\n> He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur\n\nAnd you can see the obvious bias towards inaction there. Both need to agree.\n\nOn execution of laws, it just says this:\n\n> he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\n\nBut what does \"faithfully executed\" mean? Definitely, there's an argument that 0% execution doesn't fit this (ex. impoundment, complete nonenforcement of certain laws). But, it's also a really wide target. And, this is definitely an area of the constitution that deserved more fleshing out, as we're learning now.",

This is how wars work - you gain a little, you lose a little. It goes back and forth. \n\nThere's no scenario here where Ukraine ends this war that doesn't involve them giving  up a bit of territory.

Newsflash - We've been doing that since the start of the conflict - economic sanctions and supplying their enemy with military aid. ***It's not working.*** Continuing to do the same thing and expecting a different result can and should be considered weapons grade stupidity.\n\n\n\n* This conflict is significantly more sustainable for Russia than it is for Ukraine. The only reason the conflict is sustainable for Ukraine is because NATO is propping up Ukraine with military equipment and financial aid. Russia can keep selling oil to it's neighbors who are willing to buy  - and keep up this fight. Recall reports of the use of North Korean soldiers on the front line? That's an entirely untapped resource for Russia.  Continuing on in this manner is just stupid - it's costing money and lives, and leading to overall global instability.",

We don't have to talk about Odessa, but a lot of cities have been destroyed. A lot of cities that are not recognizable. There's not a building standing.\n\n>President Zelenskyy: Oh, no. You have to come Mr. President. You have to come and to look. No, no, no. We have very good cities. Yes, a lot of things have been destroyed, but mostly cities alive and people work and children go to school. Sometimes it's very difficult, sometimes closer to the front line. Children have to go to underground schools or online. But we live, Ukraine is fighting and Ukraine lives. This is very important and **maybe it's Putin who sharing this information that he destroyed us.** He lost 700,000 people, 700,000 soldiers.\n\nIt seems he misunderstood Trump and thought that he had said that there was not a building left standing in all of Ukraine, as opposed to what Trump obviously meant, which was that there wasn\u2019t a building left standing in the cities that Russia had destroyed \u2013 something I imagine Zelensky himself has said.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>But English is his 2nd language so even though they can mean the same thing effectively, it's not correct grammar.\n\nYeah, as I mentioned, he\u2019s been repeatedly advised to use an interpreter to avoid such misunderstandings.\n\n> What guilt trip?\n\nHe showed him a stack of photos of released prisoners.\n\n> Why is this bad? I thought trump wanted to be more transparent.\n\nAs I believe Trump himself point out on social media, the point of the meeting was to show Putin that there was no distance between Trump and Zelensky. You\u2019re supposed to be appear as a united front in public, when your adversaries are watching, and hash things out in private \u2013 they had been about to attend a private lunch.\n\n>Be still my heart\n\nIt\u2019s far from the first time that the same thing has caused a diplomatic incident.\n\n>What makes you think it was sarcasm? It was a rhetorical question.\n\nThis seems pedantic. The point is that the subtext was \u2018Screw your so-called \u201cdiplomacy\u201d, JD.\u2019\n\n> How is this disrespectful?\n\nIt came off as a threat in Trump\u2019s ear. Again, poor English.\n\n>And this is all without mentioning the fact that even if I granted you everything, trump is famously disrespectful to world leaders and fellow Americans. Why do you guys not care when trump does it?\n\nHe wasn\u2019t disrespectful in this meeting, and he even mended bridges with Zelensky beforehand by retracting his \u201cdictator\u201d comment, and defended Zelensky\u2019s attire when a member of the media asked why he wasn\u2019t wearing a suit.\n\n> why is it disrespectful for Zelensky to \"tell it like it is\" if he genuinely believes it?\n\nYou just don\u2019t walk into the Oval Office and try to renege on a deal for the third time and negotiate it in front of the press, while disrespecting your hosts who are trying to help you.",
