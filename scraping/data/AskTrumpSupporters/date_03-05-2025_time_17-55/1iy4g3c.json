That the mechanism (whether it is Facebook or the WH) is *partisan*? If given the power, Trump will deny access to reporters if it's in his interests to do so. That's only natural, correct? So why should Trump be the one to have that power? In the same vein, why should liberal moderators on Facebook, under the influence of a liberal government, be the one to have that power?\n\n\\>Removing bad actors from that list is obviously a good thing.\n\nWouldn't liberal moderators argue that removing \"bad actors\" from Facebook is \"obviously a good thing\"?",

A few thoughts/options: \n\n- I could actually see a case for letting all outlets in, just under Biden administration standards \u2014 journalists pre-submit their questions in advance, the President reads responses off of notecards printed by staff, and nobody discloses it or says a word about it. Nobody complained about press freedom then, and a reporter confirmed to have pre submitted her question is now on the board of the WHCA. \n- The Biden administration implemented new standards for press passes that resulted in a mass purge of over 400 reporters from the WH Press Corps. These standards targeted smaller, often more regional outlets without the resources to meet them (e.g., many could not afford to have a dedicated reporter covering both the WH and Congress, which was required without explanation). Choose among these, and let the big corporations wait at the back of the line. It\u2019s only fair. \n- You could also apply a simple litmus test for starters and then make adjustments as time goes on and changes are warranted. Many ways you could design this. For example, have staffers review a week\u2019s worth of transcripts of that outlets primary news coverage (whatever medium) from the week prior to the Biden-Trump debate. Ask \u201cwould a viewer/reader/etc of this outlet have been reasonably aware that there was a significant, clear, growing body of evidence suggesting the President was experiencing significant cognitive and physical decline? Was that coverage appropriately framed as an urgent, critical matter of national importance?\u201d Under that standard, from what I\u2019ve seen, an outlet like FOX would maintain their credential. One like NBC would not. I\u2019d welcome their reapplication after an apology, an explanation, and a documented list of corrective actions they\u2019ve taken to better inform the public.",

If you don\u2019t respond then I totally get it lol. \n\nI think the blanket view of journalists as dishonest, ideological, and unaccountable is mostly undeserved, dangerous, and in some respects just false. All of these apply to government which, if we\u2019re referring to the president and Congress, are held \u201caccountable\u201d via elections every few years and still get away with lying constantly, whereas journalists and publications are held accountable by other journalists and publications as well as defamation law (Fox News v Dominion, CNN v Nick Sandmann).\n\nJournalists and mainstream media, if we\u2019re talking *individual actors* (Tucker Carlson, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, etc) range from being imperfect and misleading and to downright propagandistic and anti American, but as a whole, as a conglomerate of media outlets independent of each other on different parts of the political spectrum, they literally have an incentive to call each other out. The government however does not have an incentive to call itself out. \n\n*This* is why I as a rule of thumb trust journalists and mainstream media over the government and even over alt media as well. As long as you get your info from multiple decently reputable sources across the political spectrum, read full articles, and stay away from opinion pieces and media personalities, you are going to be more informed than the vast majority of people *despite* the bad actors/publications that give the field a bad name.\n\nWhat you\u2019re saying worries me because those in government exploit this distrust in media and add fuel to the fire by painting them all with the same distrustful brush, that way when the government does something bad they can take advantage of that brush and convince you to not trust the journalists/publications who are exposing them.\n\nWhy do you have such a blanket view of journalists?

There has always been skepticism in the media which is completely fair, as there have been many instances of certain publications or media personalities misleading through titles, reporting only on certain stories to weave certain narratives, and sometimes even outright lying. \n\nBut, for the most part, if you stick to reading articles from multiple trusted mainstream publications across the political spectrum (in order to correct for biases) that aren\u2019t opinion pieces and aren\u2019t the rant of X or Y media personality, you will be so much more informed than most people. And I believe it\u2019s always been this way and still is this way. The incentives of all these publications just line up in such a way where if your sources are varied, the truth becomes very clear. \n\nThe problem is that Trump has come along and labeled media critical of him as being fake news. He even comes down on outlets that are mostly favorable towards him whenever they give him slight criticism. This is no secret. And this has also plummeted trust in mainstream media in regards to many of his supporters, who seem to trust him or those completely favorable to him over all else. \n\n>when I say I don\u2019t trust them, I am not saying \u201cliterally every single thing they say is the opposite of reality\u201d\n\nMy fear is that this has legitimately become the outlook for many people. That if I were to link an article to prove something to someone, that someone might see that it\u2019s from CNN and immediately blow it off without reading it because it has been labeled as fake news. This *terrifies* me. Because now people put their trust in Trump who both has an incentive to lie and is also just an infamous exaggerator and peddler of misinfo (ie the pet-eating Haitians) and never corrects himself. \n\nPeople are also now getting their news and info from social media like X or Facebook or YouTube personalities, which in my opinion have the same pitfalls as mainstream media and particularly opinion pieces/media personalities, except *much* worse and *much* more biased and *much* less accountable and *much* more misleading. \n\nMainstream media isn\u2019t perfect and I don\u2019t know how to make it so aside from the government cracking down on it which I would much rather not happen, but it\u2019s the best option out of those in front of us from what I\u2019ve seen. \n\nInfo and news in a free speech society is difficult, but doing what Trump and MAGA has done by completely vilifying them is just a massive problem in my view because if we can\u2019t trust them then it feels like we can\u2019t trust anything, and if we can\u2019t trust anything then people default to their own biases and echo chambers. This to me is a ticking time bomb. \n\nAm I making sense? What do you see as a better alternative?",

What if it doesn\u2019t happen? I don\u2019t know, we\u2019re in uncharted territory.\n\nMedia consumption and news will never be perfect. There will always be bad actors, biases, and incentives to misinform. You can push the culture in one direction or another but it\u2019s incredibly hard. Like many other things in society, *you just have to learn how to navigate it*. \n\n>I think that flatly dismissing the media is a more useful heuristic than spending hours a day reading multiple news sources.\n\nAn average article takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes to read. Longer more investigative pieces will be closer to 10 min or longer (I generally avoid these). In addition, I\u2019m not literally reading multiple sources per story because certain stories don\u2019t require it. If Reuters reports that Xi Jinping has released X or Y statement, or if CNN reports that Donald Trump has signed X or Y bill, or if Fox reports that the Fed has cut interest rates X or Y percentage points, I\u2019m fine with just reading these stories and trusting the publications, because why on earth would they lie about something that\u2019s so easily verifiable. \n\nReading multiple articles will be for more complicated breaking news events that can be easily misconstrued or misinformed, such as DOGE firings/savings or what exactly is in the budget resolution that just passed the house or the details of one of the recent plane crashes. It\u2019s so easy to go on X and see a million variations of \u201cBREAKING: DOGE just fired 10,000 DOD workers and saved $140 BILLION dollars!!!\u201d or \u201cBREAKING: Sources say Trump has ADMITTED to ordering Epstein KILLED!!\u201d or \u201cBREAKING: documents show IRS targeting  GAY BLACK PEOPLE *shows random picture of computer screen that can be easily faked*\u201d, all from random journalists or anonymous accounts like EndWokeness who hardly source, often mislead, and have no reason to be trusted other than the fact that they have a lot of followers. \n\nWhen you come across BOLD claims like this on X or wherever else, just give it a quick google search and see what credible sources have talked about them. If they haven\u2019t, it\u2019s safe to label them in your brain as non verified and just move on, because it\u2019s probably *junk info*. Oftentimes these big claims will be either greatly exaggerated, misleading, or just plain false.  \n\nAnyway, all this to say, I read about 15-30 min of news a day. It\u2019s not a huge commitment especially considering how long people scroll through social media. \n\n>(Not that I think doing that even necessarily generates an accurate worldview anyway; if they\u2019re all lying/biased in the same direction, at least on certain issues, the fact that they word things slightly differently doesn\u2019t really do anything in terms of establishing truth).\n\nThis is hardly true. Reuters and AP are good examples of publications who are pretty straight forward in regards to foreign affairs who simply describe what\u2019s happening. International publications like these can sometimes misreport certain things that happen in warzones but this is nothing new as info coming out of warzones can be incredibly hard to make sense of. But even then, they correct themselves! \n\nIn regards to domestic policy, the left and right political spectrums are incredibly opposed on so many issues that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for MSNBC (and other left publications) and Fox (and other right publications) to lie or be biased \u201cin the same direction\u201d. I mean really, how often is it that a bunch of publications on both sides are ALL lying or misleading about the same thing and aren\u2019t called out by other publications? Can you actually think of a time where this happened?\n\n>So the choice is \u201cbelieve the media\u201d or \u201cbe very skeptical of everything they say\u201d, and to that, I suggest the latter. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but this just seems like faux skepticism. I don\u2019t know your media consumption habits so I can\u2019t speak for you but this will almost always manifest in believing in sources biased towards your side and not believing in sources that make your side look bad because when that happens, all of a sudden your \u201cskepticism\u201d kicks in. You just saw CNN report that Trump successfully negotiated a great trade deal? Fuck ya! You just saw CNN report that Trump is losing support in certain conservative states? Well CNN lies anyway, so how can I trust them! Same thing for liberals and Fox. \n\nMedia consumption is like food consumption. You can take the easy way and consume easy, convenient, and tasty junk and fast food, and you can live off of this. But, in the long run, you\u2019re essentially poisoning your body. Lightly dieting however might be a pain in the ass at first, but you get used to it, and before you know it, you\u2019ll be and *feel* healthier. It\u2019s the same for reading full articles. \n\n>Like how I read your comment is basically \u201cyou can trust the media, you just have to make politics your life\u201d. Okay, I get the argument, but I don\u2019t think the average person is capable of or willing to do that! \n\nYou don\u2019t have to make politics your life. You\u2019re on a political subreddit so I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s fairly present for you like it is for many others who go on X every day to see what Elon is tweeting or what Trump is doing. These people and seemingly yourself just prefer the comfort of algorithms, confirmed biases, and junk info. Because why keep in mind your health when McDonald\u2019s burgers and Doritos are so convenient and tasty?\n\nI\u2019m not asking you to stay off social media. Just approach media consumption differently. As an experiment, for *one* week, if you do what I suggest and start looking at news aggregators to get your info or major stories, such as Ground News, google news, MSN (msn.com the news aggregator, not to be confused with MSNBC), etc, and then scroll through X and you\u2019ll realize how misinformed the vast majority of people on that site are.\n\nHave I convinced you at all yet? Haha will you at least try the experiment?",

And yet Wiki says:\n\n>Among the more notable issues handled by the WHCA are the credentialing process, access to the president and physical conditions in the White House press briefing rooms.\n\nWhy should a hostile, left-wing captured, Democrat Loyalist type organization be given that power. They shouldn't.  \n  \nThey talk like they hold power to account, but it's obvious their function was the make sure Dems were NOT held to account, NOT spoken truth to, and at nearly all times cover run for. The way they covered Biden was pathetic.\n\nTheir second function appeared to be managing the Dems Opposition Research team of journos to make sure they had \"official\" status, to write non-stop hit pieces on Trump & co. to try and sabotage the President and his team at every turn. A sort of ground-zero Democrat Loyalist association trying to gate-keep and manage public perception to make sure to maximize hurting Trump and minimize any and all damaging truth for Dems. \n\nSo the WHCA was not only failing on multiple fronts to do good.

They didn\u2019t continue acting that way well into their 70s. Trump has stated that [he has never asked God for forgiveness](https://www.c-span.org/clip/campaign-2016/user-clip-have-you-ever-asked-god-for-forgiveness/4619501) and he continues to do these immoral things. Does that fit the mold of the people you listed?\n\nWhere is your proof he is currently adulterating? \n\nRegarding businesses, Trump has/had hundreds if not thousands of investments going on. Capitalism nor Christianity require every business to be profitable grand slams. Mistakes will be made. But obviously Trump is far in the black at that.\n\nWashington had lots of financial troubles and turmoil too. But Great things he did were Greater. Same with Trump.",

But Trump literally answered questions for an hour today and his press secretary did too, and he has been doing so non-stop for a month now, fielding questions from all sorts of terrible orgs with bad history and good.\n\nHe's been extraordinarily forgiving, patient, slow to wrath, reasonable, and helpful to both the good and bad press and no doubt he will continue to be.\n\n>1) Am I correct? ...\n\nSee above.\n\n> ... and 2) How do you even prove that stuff?\n\nProve? It's not a physics equation. It's not a physical science. Each must work out and navigate an ocean of judgement-call instances time & again to arrive where they do.",
