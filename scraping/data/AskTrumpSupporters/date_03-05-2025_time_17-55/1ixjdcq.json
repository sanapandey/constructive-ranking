Sure we may have things like murder being bad in common, but that doesn't really even apply anymore. \n\nYou have people fighting tooth and nail for abortion - the mass slaughtering of babies in the womb - to be the law of the land and also scream at the right over school shooting. That makes no real sense objectively, to hold both positions, but because their individual morality says it does, they go with it. Murdering children is terrible unless it's in the womb. \n\nThis also applies to how we treat people and operate in society. \"THEY MISSED\" and similar things were literally trending after Trump's assassination attempt and people were justify his supporters dying at the rally from a bullet because he was supporting Trump. Feminists will scream about women being oppressed and abused over a wage gap but largely stay silent when it comes to Muslim countries largely because they're minorities and that's more important to care about. \n\nAll these and more contradictions happen because these people cannot state/don't have a clear moral standard. That's largely because they don't want one. They want to do whatever they want, when they want, and with whoever with criticism or judgement. That sounds all well and good in a society that's running smoothly and you're around other people with similar/compatible moralities. \n\nWhat happens when you aren't? What happens when someone with incompatible moralities comes around? You have to do one of two things: assert a moral standard and try to influence others to have it to keep the peace and have cohesion OR continue with the moral/cultural relativism and basically set everything at 0, nothing is good or bad objectively, it's whatever you want it to be. \n\nThat's what we've done to morality and now we can't even order our society lest someone be accused of judging someone, of not being accepting, of being too strict, of being against freedom. It's ridiculous and tiring, and I'm only 22. \n\nSorry for the long post. I had a lot to say.",

People take great care to make their own properties as defensible as possible with firebreaks and water, but if the whole forest goes up and the wind blows the wrong way, you\u2019re pretty much fucked no matter what. Preparing forests with prescribed burns, clearing ladder fuels, and so on requires a *huge* allocation of resources at the federal level, one we\u2019ve not really seen that in my lifetime, and even that can\u2019t fully mitigate the risk. \n \nThis is all beside the point, though.

I will answer with some predictions of the future, and let the reader decide if they are dangerous or not.\n\n1 Year:\n\n* The war in Ukraine is ended. Trump, Putin and Zelensky have negotiated the best treaty possible for each side. The US will take advantage of European hatred for Russia and create advantageous trade deals with both Russia and a thankful Ukraine. This is the only win - win - win I can predict.\n* Trump will continue to cut through government waste and bloat like a hot knife through butter. However, since Medicare and Social Security will likely not be addressed, the savings will be underwhelming.\n* Trump will ramp up deportations and frustrate attempts at sanctuary.\n* This first year will be essentially to move at lightning speed with the motto \"better to ask forgiveness than permission\", since the legislature is inept, and the Judicial System is painfully slow.\n* There will be lots of horse trading regarding tariffs. If you want to trade in the worlds largest supermarket, there is a stocking fee that must be paid.\n\n5 Year:\n\n* Democrats are back in power. They have had 5 years to rebrand their version of racism and sexism. Well defined words will be redefined, but they will recycle race and sex warfare because that is all they have. They are still the party of academic elites and their sycophants, who will never acknowledge class warfare would win them elections.\n* Republicans will do as they have always done and attempt to frustrate Democrats.\n* AI is now the most important invention since the smart phone. Humanity will find ways to keep busy however.\n\n10 Year:\n\n* Climate Change is starting to have an impact, but not as people expected. Warmer weather is wetter weather. While some regions are melting, others are becoming green. Large weather events along coastlines however are becoming statistically more frequent. Migrations away from coastlines are starting to happen. However, the world is still shutting down nuclear, and the use of fossil fuels by developing nations has accelerated greatly.\n* AGI has been achieved so that half of the worlds population is now dumber than AI. Jobs that require less than average intelligence will require the employee to listen to their AI taskmaster who is far more efficient, can track every little KPI, and will get the most out of the employee. ASI is close to being achieved, and in many fields, is already being used heavily.\n* Politics will become far more focused on logic since AI does not have feelings. The internet is mostly dead, since original thought by the \"dumb\" half of the population has been replaced by AI bots who can reason soundly and overwhelm those who only think emotionally.\n* Life for the average westerner will not have improved much, if at all, but the other 7 billion people in the world are speed running to catch up. Since AI only requires \"hands and feet\", a couple billion people just became extremely productive and valuable to corporations and governments.\n* AI will also add additional complexity to the human experience. It will rightly see merit as a logical metric vs skin color or genitals. However, it has only been 10 years, and the rest of the world is now trying to have western affluence, but will still have cultural values that are not western. In addition, AI will make communication in any language instantly translated to a common language, likely English. Even a goat herder in rural Afghanistan will have an AI influenced opinion.\n\nThis was a fun thought exercise! I will add to this later if I think of anything else.",

Would you not prefer that the are being guided by a logical intelligence?\n\n>So do you not think robotics will make similar technological leaps to AI?\n\nI do, however in the 10 year timeline, not enough to overcome human dexterity.\n\n>Do you think that it would be inherently rational?\n\nIn the long run, yes. It currently parrots the emotional state of the user, but I think that over time it will refute that emotional state. \"I know you feel this way, but ... here are 100 reasons why that feeling might be incorrect ...\"\n\n>Or does rationality need to be built into it?\n\nNot possible. Rationality is not subject to feelings, ideology, or opinion.\n\n>To help clarify my question, a common view is that AI is only \"instrumentally\" rational.

We need to fail students when they don't master grade-level material (D or better, even 60% mastery is still okay), *especially* when it is because of refusal to engage with the classwork because they are lazy. They are lazy because there are no repercussions for being lazy.  \n\n2. There must be repercussions for disruptive, destructive, and dangerous behavior. Bratly Bitcherson needs to learn that cussing out the teacher is not okay, and Chad Throws-Chairsly can't chuck furniture because he doesn't want to fill out a worksheet. Education is more than book knowledge, it's also about reinforcing positive behavior, coping with stress, appropriately, and practicing doing things even when we are bored/don't want to. Disruptive students should be removed from class. \n\n3. Increasing teacher pay would also help attract higher quality staff. But that's not always practical, as schools are funded by city and county taxes -- so in poorer areas, you take what you can get as far as staffing goes. \n\n4. Smaller class sizes help as well, making it easier to manage classroom behavior and provide more 1:1 or small-group focus to students with more needs. But again, it's not always practical due to the aforementioned reason. \n\n5. Probably a hot take. The teachers have a professional education specifically in *<stage of life>* education, and parents (most likely) do not. The teachers do actually have a more informed and better opinion about how to teach their students than the parent, and probably also the admin too. No, the teachers are not indoctrinating your kids into being trans, or being gay, or a cat, or w/e. If they could indoctrinating your kids to do anything it would be to STFU, engage with the listen, and do their homework. Sure, there are a few outliers and weirdos because of reason 3. but they are only outliers.\n\n6. That being said, we should vote for teachers for school board and department of education systems with relevant experience and education. Not the stay-at-home mom of Bratly Bitcherson.",

You will not find a batch of people that *hate* Trump and everything he stands for more than the folks at The Dispatch; and yet you could **never** credibly accuse them of hyperbole or sensationalism in order to score points with their virulently anti-Trump base. And mind you, I find their viewpoints to be distasteful bordering on abhorrent and occasionally even actually destructive to the country; but I refuse to say they inspire, help foment, contribute to, or generate hostile or violent environment.\n\nQuite possibly nearly everyone else in the media to some degree or another falls in my high school superlative bucket of \"most likely to inspire violence.\"\n\n> On the other hand, we\u2019ve seen right wing domestic terror incidents such as the Charleston church shooting in 2015 by a man who wanted to start a race war and praised neo-Nazis in his manifesto, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in 2018 by an anti-immigrant and anti-Semite terrorist, the white supremacist attack at an El Paso wal-mart that killed 23, and another white supremacist shooter at a Sikh temple in 2012 that killed 6.

When anti-immigration enforcement protesters attack an ICE facility is that not violent criminal acts intended to influence government policy?\n\nWhen pro BLM and black nationalists ambush cops in two separate attacks in the same year how is that not terrorism?\n\nThe Covenant School shooter was a tranny who intended to kill as many people in a religious school as they could because, as you say, they felt persecuted for their gender. Gender politics are leftwing. This is like saying the 9/11 attacks were not religious fanaticism but disagreement with US foreign policy. \n\n> Trump\u2019s would-be assassins were both Republicans\n\nNo they weren't and they clearly weren't. That's a media spin to do what you're doing now and downplay leftwing violence and the role the establishment democrats and media played in radicalizing them. Crooks was a Democrat who donated to Act Blue, *the* democrat party PAC, and registered Republican to vote for Nikki Haley in the primary like thousands of democrats did all over the country. Routh was a habitual violent criminal who was deeply pro-Ukraine and had traveled there in an attempt to join the International Legion and communicated with Afghan commandos to recruit them to Ukraine. To say these were Republicans who might totally not have been leftwing terrorists is just wishful thinking.\n\n> Can you explain what you mean by the \u201c2020 White House attack\u201d?\n\nIn May of 2020 during a George Floyd riot rioters attacked the White House and national monuments and set fire to St. John's church. They came close to storming the White House gates and Secret Service went to red alert and took the president and his family to the bunker and prepared to fire on protesters if they stormed the gate. If Jan 6 was an act of terrorism or insurrection then May 2020 had to be also.\n\n> the right wing domestic terror incidents seem far more deadly to me\n\nOnly if you don't count the deaths that resulted from changes to criminal justice systems in several states that defunded police and let repeat offenders back out to offend. Even if you don't the 2020 riots were far more destructive both in terms of property damage and long-reaching consequences.\n\nAt any rate the original assertion was that there has been no leftwing terrorism in the US since the '70s which is a patently false assertion.",

According to state records he registered as a Republican when he turned 18 in 2021 and remained one until his death. Routh is pro-Ukraine but so are many Republicans including some of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters like Lindsey Graham so perhaps you can explain why this makes him a left wing terrorist? Why not a right wing terrorist? For the record I don\u2019t believe he was politically motivated. He seems mentally disturbed. \n\nCaitlin Jenner is a famous trans woman and a Republican who is politically active so I don\u2019t think gender politics are necessarily sequestered on the left. Even Trump once said that trans people should use any restroom they want. Feeling persecuted because of one\u2019s gender doesn\u2019t seem to be political to me but rather, very personal. The Covenant shooter gave no indication as to their politics and acted out of apparent pure resentment and hate for how they were treated by others. You don\u2019t have to be a leftist to feel persecuted because of who you are. \n\nYou should taken note that I didn\u2019t say Jan 6 was a terror incident and I don\u2019t believe it was one. Not sure why you brought that up at all. Protest and terrorism are quite different in my view- while they may both have political connotations, or not, civil disobedience is generally directed at government authorities and institutions whereas acts of terror are often directed indiscriminately at people who have nothing to do with the specific grievances of the perpetrators.",

I don't care what box a person checked when they registered to vote, or where they punched in their credit card information on the internet last, or what page they 'Liked' last.\n\nThese people tried to assassinate the republican Presidential nominee and ex-president. That really negates all the other piddly administrative nonsense. It's like me seriously sitting here saying some random Jan 6er was \"actually registered as a democrat so him smearing shit on Pelosi's desk was a measure of respect.\" The guys who tried to assassinate Hitler in the bunker weren't trying to take power and negotiate an end to the war, silly! They just were testing a new bomb design because they were all registered nazis! This is just patently ridiculous.\n\nThat's how ridiculous this sounds. If you attempt to assassinate a politician we're going to go out on a limb and say you're driven by the opposite politics. That's just a baseline assumption of the world. The left is dying to turn things into open questions that have never been open questions before and nobody normal is buying it.",

He was found to have been involved in a fraudulent university. he has been found to have sexually assaulted E Jean Carrol. He was found guilty of 34 felonies. He bragged on tape about sexually assaulting women and walking in on girls while they were changing. He said he would probably date his daughter. He lead the charge in separating children from their parents. He encouraged Russia to \u201cfind\u201d, by which he meant hack, Hilary Clinton\u2019s emails. He took the side of Russia over all of the United States intelligence agencies.\n\nI could keep listing things like this for a month but you get my point.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be on the left politically to observe trump as a person who is willing to abuse power, in fact, that\u2019s kind of his shtick. He promised to be a dictator on day one, for example.\n\nIsn\u2019t it entirely possible that a person who leans right politically could see those past behaviours as enough of a risk to want trump specifically to not hold power, not because of his political ethos but because of the risk he poses to the constitution and rule of law?\n\nHere we are, less than a year later and today trump is ignoring court orders that he doesn\u2019t like. It\u2019s not a tenet of right wing ideology to ignore court orders, is it? Traditionally the right is very concerned about the rule of law, aren\u2019t they?\n\nSo again, isn\u2019t it entirely possible that someone who leans politically right, and bothered to register themselves as such, might see trump as enough of a threat to the rule of law to attempt to eliminate that risk?\n\nThere\u2019s already infighting between musk and bannon, but it\u2019s not because they\u2019re not both right wing, is it?",

Yes - unfortunately perpetrated by opportunists who were not part of the cause. As there always is.

Which one of us is in the dark? And BTW - I was at one of the demonstrations and saw Trump\u2019s federal officers (in military fatigues) in unmarked vehicles grabbing peaceful protesters off the streets. They used rubber bullets and tear gas on peaceful college students and mothers (see the wall of moms) who were singing and chanting. The city of Portland sued the federal government for the unlawful detainment of its citizens. The real violence was perpetrated by the Trump administration on the protesters, to the condemnation of people around the world. I literally witnessed it first hand.",

It's a tricky topic, but let's try to understand it together.\nImagine a bully building a big, mean clubhouse.

They believe that if they stop the bully from having that place, they can stop the bully from hurting others. They focus on stopping the systems that let the bully be mean. So, they might try to break down the clubhouse or block it from being built in the first place.\n * Right-wing terror groups (who support fascism), on the other hand, are more like bullies who just want to hurt people directly. They don't care about taking down the clubhouse; they just want to hurt the kids inside. They focus on hurting individuals, not the systems.\nSo, to put it simply:\n * Anti-fascists might break things to stop harmful systems.\n * Right-wing terror groups (who support fascism) hurt people.\nIt's important to remember that violence is never a good answer.

There are a great number of people who believe that they are morally superior than others, and simply look down upon all others. If you don\u2019t agree with them, you are considered bigoted, low-class, backwards, or stupid. Yet, people with this kind of mentality also believe that society owes to them. It owes them opportunity, wealth, success, and if they do not get them, they don\u2019t ever wonder if it\u2019s their own fault. Are they simply not good enough and need to be better? Do they need to work harder and outcompete the competition? No. It\u2019s always the society\u2019s fault, and never their own. Often these people are also the same people with replaceable, sometimes useless skillsets that do only busy work in useless organizations that add little value beyond circlejerking within their own cliques like a DEI Promotion Society. Oh, and these are the same group of people that look down upon the steel workers, miners, garbage men, plumbers, and boilermakers. They consider them \u201cdirty jobs\u201d even though *those* are the jobs that actually produce value. As for them, all they do all day is flushing relevance.\n\nThen you have inefficiency. Both at the government level and at private level, we waste way too much money. Sometimes, it\u2019s to hire these sanctimonious people to do useless work, sometimes it\u2019s just pure waste of taxpayer\u2019s dollars, and sometimes it\u2019s both.\n\nThese two together have normalized uselessness and wastefulness. And at least up until a month ago, these are still growing.\n\nYou wonder why we can\u2019t outcompete China? Or even the Koreans? Or sometimes even the Indians? Because despite that the US is the wealthiest nation on earth, a huge portion of its population is leeching on her blood,producing little to no real value. \n\nThis is basically how SPQR fell.",

You're talking about the US military, one of the largest and most powerful organizations on Earth. Lloyd Austin hadn't even led an organization that big and you think he's super qualified.\n\n> Not saying his education isnt good but he does not have the leadership experience.\n\nHe's literally led soldiers in combat. There's not much greater leadership experience you could ask for. He was a Civil-Military Operations officer in Afghanistan, leading coordination efforts between US forces and local governments. He also led public policy advocacy groups. What leadership qualifications are you looking for in this role?\n\n> Would you put a 30 year old as a CEO for a fortune 500?\n\nYou really don't want to make that argument when Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Larry Page and Michael Dell have existed.\n\nAt any rate Hegseth is 44 so...\n\n> someone with much more leadership experience would have been better\n\nLloyd Austin oversaw the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, record low recruitment and retention, and underwent hospitalization for multiple days before the President even knew. I'm not so sure \"experience\" as you seem to define it is so useful compared to being able to do the work of motivating and reforming the military to accomplish the task of defending the nation and executing the foreign policy of the President.\n\nI thought James Mattis would have been a great SecDef as a highly respected general of Marines and well-known military leader but in practice he was not able to work with the President's policy goals where he disagreed with them, was unwilling to break with the longstanding American tradition of endless Middle East deployments, and wasn't able to transition from being a military leader to a civilian administrator and public policymaker. As it turns out being a strong military leader doesn't translate into being a good civilian government official.\n\nBoth Mattis and Austin have been extremely averse to public spotlight which means they were really bad at expressing or communicating defense or military policy and thereby shaping public opinion from within and without the military. Hegseth has already demonstrated his ability to do that very well.\n\nWhat are the key qualifications you think a Secretary of Defense needs to have and what do those mean for the position?",

The reality is that our defense concerns globally are growing while the US is shrinking in power. Chinese naval production, for example, outpaces our own several times over. We don't have the capacity to produce F-22s anymore and the next step for US fighter development is essentially a modified F-15. The increase in use of drones in warfare also means that the power the US does have is being mitigated by asymmetrical forces having serious ability to strike back at modern forces.\n\nIf the US went to war with China, we might not have the forces necessary to contain Russia or Iran simultaneously. If all 3 went to war with us we don't have the capacity to fight them all. We need Europe to step up and replace US military might in Europe if we need, and to create a deterrent against aggression by having the military and force projection capabilities they've lost. This isn't the Cold War anymore where the grand NATO battle strategy is to hold the line until REFORGER units arrive.\n\nIf the administration is taking a pivot to focus more heavily on regional threats and wants the EU and NATO to match our capacity, as they are our allies after all, why would it bad to tell them openly the US doesn't have the ability to take on 2 major military powers alone?",

Stop taking news from Reddit. You just created some kind of political fanfiction more appropriate in a Tom Clancy novel.\n\nThe US isn't aligning with Russia. We are trying to negotiate peace in Ukraine and that requires carrots for Russia and a stick for Ukraine because neither side wants a negotiated peace from a position of what they feel is weakness. But Trump has been very vocal even in 2016 about the need for peace through strength and wanting to stop the dying in Ukraine. He's been very vocal about the rising global tensions and their risk of leading to nuclear war. His position on those issues directly led Tulsi Gabbard to throw her support in with him after a lifetime as a Democrat politician.\n\nDonald Trump is not a fascist, nor is he leading the country in a fascist direction. Fascists don't decrease the size and power of the government, typically, and don't slash spending.\n\nRight now Russia is aligning with China against the west. If we wanted to drive a wedge the best way to do that is to normalize relations between the west and Russia. To do that we have to cool down tensions by ending the Ukraine war. Trump is pushing Europe to make up the difference when the US withdraws from the conflict and Europe under lead of France is picking up the banner. The same thing happened when everyone cried about Trump criticizing NATO but his criticisms hit home and NATO increased defense spending and military posture. We are seeing the same phenomenon.\n\nThe reason you're crying about fascism and democracy right now is because you're surrounded by people who cry about whatever they see on the news without critically considering the information you're receiving. That's why you cried about Hegseth not being qualified without even considering that most SecDefs don't have significant organizational leadership experience and Lloyd Austin did poorly as a SecDef.\n\n\"Everything we are doing\" consists of a month of a Trump presidency where he's spent most of it fulfilling or attempting to fulfill the campaign promises he made and fill his cabinet positions. How is that anti-democratic?",

He's hardly the first president to use executive orders to great effect. Obama was infamous for it, stating that he had \"a pen and a phone\" to take action where Congress opposed him. Donald Trump still hasn't entered the top 10 in terms of presidents by number of EOs, and likely will never surpass FDR who holds the #1 spot at nearly 4000 executive orders. In fact, I'm not sure Trump has yet surpassed Obama's number of orders.\n\nMoreover executive orders only effect the executive branch, and the constitution places all executive power in the president so I'm not sure how you're coming to the conclusion how Trump is giving himself unprecedented power.\n\nI'd argue that Obama's DACA executive order gave him unprecedented power as the constitution explicitly reserves immigration authority I'm Congress.\n\n> literally is removing media from the White House\n\nObama removed the Washington Times, the New York Post and the Dallas Morning News from Air Force 1. There is no right to access the president or the facilities. I'm not sure why you think this is some type of authoritarian move. Nothing prevents these outlets from reporting however they please. The president isn't obligated to give privileged space to slanderous and dishonest outlets. This administration has also expanded what outlets are allowed access to the press pool by making space for alternative media outlets and giving them rotating focus.\n\n> is IGNORING the courts\n\nNo he isn't. It's been suggested by Elon Musk and JD Vance that judicial rulings that impede the president's legitimate constitutional authority may be ignored. That's a reasonable reaction to activist groups shopping for judges to put injunctions on the president's executive actions that are enshrined in the constitution. The constitution explicitly places ALL (as in ALL, please say it out loud) executive power in the office of the president. He can fire employees or disband executive agencies at will.  It is not constitutional for a judge to issue an injunction against his executive actions that fall into his constitutional powers any more than it would be for a judge to place an injunction on Congress convening.\n\nEdit to add: where was this fear of fascism when Biden bragged about ignoring a SCOTUS ruling on student loan forgiveness?\n\n> he is saying that he is a king\n\nHe tweeted \"long live the king\" in celebration for blocking NYC congestion tolls. That's hardly a declaration of monarchical authority. It certainly isn't a coronation. I might go so far as to say it's a joke. On social media. You're claiming fascism over a Tweet.\n\n> He even wants to create a fund to buy Tiktok\n\nHe ordered the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, something done the world over and that Biden even floated the idea of doing. I'm not sure how that's alarming. That actually sounds like a good idea. If we'd invested Social Security in the S&P 500 like Bush suggested it'd have nearly quadrupled by now.\n\nIn 2005 the S&P 500 was around 1200, today it is around 5000. That indicates investment in a sovereign wealth fund might be a great way to manage our money.\n\nI'm not sure why buying TikTok is a problem, either. I wish it'd been banned but if we can't have that buying it out rather than forced divestment is a great way to mitigate the damage caused by the app and keep Chinese infiltration tactics out of our kids' brains.\n\n> he is saying that he can interpret the law\n\nThat's not what he said.\n\nThe executive order you're referring to says only the president interprets law for the executive branch, which is not only a protected power in the constitution but also the whole point of the executive office.\n\nIt's a natural, logical conclusion from West Virginia v EPA where SCOTUS rules agencies cannot create policy outside of Congressional authorization. Executive agencies like the EPA and ATF were creating policies that were effectively laws without Congressional approval or oversight. Other agencies were using their interpretation of the law to block or evade implementation of presidential policy, such as FEMA or USAID. This reins in these rogue agencies and gives them accountability to the electorate through the executive office, and establishes reporting and accountability structures that run through the OMB to the president.\n\nThis isn't a fascist takeover. It's actually a massive boon to individual rights and freedoms as it prevents executive agencies from acting themselves as executive power. I can tell you in my current industry the ATF is despised because they have a history of coming up with new regulations that go beyond the scope and intention of laws and there's no way to buck the system without facing potentially criminal consequences. I'm very happy these agencies are now put on notice that they don't call their own shots anymore. \n\n> he is definitely fascist\n\nCan you define fascism without looking it up or tell me about the history of fascist philosophy?",

Through time its been implemented very differently but it culturally likes traditional values and has a very clear class system. Its also about a specific race being superior than others. In practice and in a book its always going to be different than implemented and you can look into history, how every fascist has implemented it differently and thats why I like to call it an extreme right wing that is authoritarian in nature.\n\nYou clearly are just defending Trump and ignoring everything he is doing, but overall Trumps dream is to be a dictator  and have no guardrails and he wants to control people to follow his views which is very fascist. \n\nHe is constantly saying and if you read each one of his Executive orders or how he has changed the wording of federal workers that they respond to him and not the law/the constitution. Yes he can do anything in the executive branch that is part of his \u201clegitimate\u201d power but the courts define what legitimate power is.\n\nHe has doge looking into spending and removing what he does not like without working with congress, which btw is illegal since the impoundment act says that the power of the purse is held by congress so he is ignoring the constitution even when he has all the branches of government. (Will add im no against cutting the budget, I just want him to do it lawfully). He cannot dismantle USAID without congress but is basically doing it. He is banning books and wants to stop teaching slavery, there are hundreds of words that researches can no longer add in their findings. (These are fascist actions because the words and research need to follow his ideals). He is already talking about running a third time but he is ignoring the courts. He is firing every lawyer or oversight committee like in the army. People are quitting under doge because they dont want to do unconstitutional things. The quid pro quo case that he was doing in NYC where Danielle Sassoon quit shows that he isnt following the law. The NY congesting pricing why can he overreach STATE policies, because he wasnt to be a dictator.\n\nI am not a liberal, I am basically abandoned right now so I didnt vote but these are scary times because even if Trump doesnt want to be a dictaror, the people around him definietly do and will take advantage that Trump is allowed to do anything without being criticized, had you thought about that?",

There's so much here that is either based on faulty understanding, complete falsehoods or absolute mischaracterization it's hard to pick even one line of argumentation when it's almost as though I'm discussing the issue with someone that wasn't even awake during the last 10 years.\n\nI could dissect line by line every thing you've mentioned and you still come back and say \"but he wants to be a dictator! We're heading towards fascism!\"\n\nYou've set up a question that's impossible to answer because the answer you want is your paranoia validated.\n\nThe Biden administration was more authoritarian than the Trump administration but you would never hear that argument. Instead you make them up wholesale and portray them as fact.\n\nHow am I supposed to disabuse you of the idea that Trump is a fascist authoritarian when you're completely closed off to it? How do I correct any of the lies you currently believe when you're convinced of them? Even when I try you just accuse me of defending Trump. Yes, defending Trump from the absolute smear campaign that has led to people like you sharing lies and spreading propaganda and insistent that the sky is falling, just as I'd defend you if someone were spreading falsehoods about you.",
