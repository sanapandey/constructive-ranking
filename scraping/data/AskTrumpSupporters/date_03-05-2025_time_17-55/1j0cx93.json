The financial system and low interest rates allowed big business (private) to fake liquidity. VCs generally get smart to what\u2019s going on at some point and kill funding, but not always (depends on how good the BS is that the leaders sell to the VCs). The CFPB/FTC/SEC was a check/balance to corrupt business dealings. Were they perfect? Of course not, but Project 2025 promises to take us back to the days of the Gilded Age/robber barons in the late 1800s.\n\nI also disagree partly with lack of accountability of big government: government agencies (minus more independent ones like the Fed) are accountable to Congress oversight committees and were accountable to Inspectors General/OMB\u2014before the Trump admin fired all of the Inspectors General (the Inspectors General\u2019s jobs were to actually root out waste, fraud, and abuse!) and many of the JAGs/legal councils across the executive branch. Did the oversight function well 100% of the time? Of course not, but throwing it all out is worse than reforming the thing!\n\nThe key things that need to come out of this whole Trump 2.0 admin debacle, regardless of which party you vote for is: - election reform by getting rid of Citizens United (get Dark Money out of politics!)\n- getting rid of Gerrymandered electoral maps. We have had a technical solution to this problem for over a decade!\n- impose term limits for federal (Supreme Court especially!) judges and Congress members.\n\nAnother hail-Mary goal would be to break up the duopoly the Democrat and Republican parties have in our electoral politics. We need more choices because our current ones suck (in general) and have for decades.",
