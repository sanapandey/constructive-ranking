Fixing the hole doesn't fix the water already there. \n\nAre you saying that high grocery store bills are a policy decision by the previous administration, or a symptom of them? In other words, did Trump promise a boat with no water in it (promise to fix the outcomes) DAY ONE or did he claim that the policy decisions that led to the water in the boat would be addressed, and the water still there is not his fault? \n\nThis doesn't even address how his actions have in any way \"fixed\" the hole in the proverbial boat. Just, what did he promise would change and what change can we observe. \n\n\nI voted for him in 2016 based on his 100 day Contract mind you, so I've already wrestled with this before.",

Stemming inflation is much more important. In that vein, I believe that gas prices have continued downward since last fall. That should help decelerate inflation. \n\nOut of curiosity, are you upset that Biden did not cure cancer? After all, he did promise to do so during his term. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I think both statements are equally as hyperbolic and that anyone that believed/bought in to either one was being silly.",

An intellectually honest assessment reveals that without that action, American energy would have fared far worse. \n\nEnergy prices skyrocketed under Biden due to cancelations of federal leases for oil exploration. Oil is a commodity traded on the futures market. The price of gas today reflects those futures prices. \n\nSo yes, Biden did drive a spike in energy prices. Leading into the 2022 midterms, he flooded the market with oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower prices for a more favorable election. Afterwards, he paid significantly higher prices to replace some of the SPR than what was originally paid for the oil following the 2020 market contango (and higher than he sold our reserves to China for). The SPR is still below the level it was when Biden took office. \n\nBiden made a campaign promise during one of the 2020 debates to increase the price of gas. It is incredibly disingenuous to cheer that policy on, then claim that it never happened because it was deeply unpopular and damaging to our economy. \n\nI don\u2019t need to call you names or say you have moral failings to demonstrate that you are wrong, because you are just wrong. \n\n\u201cWhen debate is lost slander becomes the tool of the loser.\u201d",

If they worked on changing election laws again to go into effect for an election in under a year; that'd get me fired up for sure.\n\nOtherwise I think we all permit little infringements all the time. I'd write an angry letter to my state rep about LGB rights if they did that stupid shit they did in Idaho and drafted a resolution asking SCOTUS to reconsider a ruling- and I'd write that letter if only to tell my rep that they should resign since they clearly do not understand the goddamn constitution because that's not how SCOTUS works; but also because I've always been a 'live and let live' guy with the LGB thing. I'm pretty socially moderate (or left-wing by 1990s standards) but I care a fair bit about marriage and love.\n\nI guess if somebody tried to make my interracial marriage illegal; but that's so unlikely it's ridiculous to think about much.\n\nSo basic stuff like that I suppose.

The codeword is \"youths\" or \"Asian man\" in the UK. In America they just bury the story.  Usually photos are omitted too, unless a photo of the suspect at a very young age with babyface is found.  \n\n> Is your understanding of the question asked that such executions would be done in a similar vein to capital punishment as it exists today? If so, would you react positively or negatively to any hypothetical expansion of the death penalty's use in the US?\n\nI support capital punishment given the forensic tools we have today. I truly believe that it is more humane for the irredeemables than life in prison, which costs a lot more to taxpayers too. Capital punishment incentivizes not committing murder using the very basic human instinct to stay alive.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I remember every \"bad karma\" action I have committed since childhood. I just don't think I would get over killing someone myself.    \n\nI don't support assisted death for anyone else, like babies or those in hospice. That incentivizes providing a lack of support/care or pushing people to kill themselves for the slightest inconvenience in life. Basically eugenics. \n\nI consider the moral dilemma of consenting to pulling out life support or respecting the right to a \"DNR\" different from the above issues. Completely situational.",
