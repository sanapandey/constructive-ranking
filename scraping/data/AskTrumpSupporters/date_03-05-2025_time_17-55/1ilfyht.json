As for Greenland, what are we not able to already do?  We have Thule AB.  Militarily, we have been able to do whatever we want since forever.  I do not see the benefit.\n\nPanama, however, needs to not be allowed to drift under Chinese control. As for China, they need to be our focus.  Europe needs to defend it self, not align with China, thereby allowing us to focus our resources against China.",

Now, I would prefer the cutting be done with a scalpel and precision, not with dull spoon spun in a circle by a berserker.  But I want waste cut from the government.  No other politician is going to do it, especially not Harris. So this is what we have. \n\nSoft power is influence through persuasion by various means.  Culture, media, diplomacy, spending.  And spending on other countries is certainly a means of using soft power.  However, it needs to be effective and affordable.  A discussion on what we spend and how spend it needed.  Again, I would like it to be done civilly.  But no one in the Democratic party will actually look at the value we gain on what we spend.  The answer is always to raise revenue and spend more.  This cannot continue.  This is not the way I would like to do it.  If you have seen my previous posts, you would see that I wanted Haley.  Did not happen, so I must support Trump.  And he, at least, is tackling government waste. And in true Trump fashion, doing so in a way that is loud, boisterous and messy. Things that will upset the high brow, civil and old school politicians.  Who did not do their job and left the conditions necessary to allow Trump to become President.  I will continue to support his cost cutting methods as it appears to be the only way I can get it.",

But when the US levels Gaza for primarily financial reasons, and suicide bombers strike back against us, why would we think attacking their homes & families would do anything but create more suicide bombers?

I hesitate to call them trolls because I can't know for certain their intent, but if I were to join a subreddit and post comments just to annoy people, they'd look a lot like some Trump Supporter comments here.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd that's fine, whatever. It's the Internet. I don't take it personally. What really bothers me is that this is one of the few interactions I get to have with Trump Supporters, and I'd hate to have these low-effort replies color my perception of most Trump Supporters. I think it's more damaging to actual Trump Supporters who are willing to discuss in good faith, than it is to trolling libs.\n\n\nThe replies that will do anything to avoid answering a question are exhausting.\n\n\nOr when your reply has 3 questions, and they don't respond to 2 of them, but nitpick the meaning of a single word in the third question as an excuse to throw up their hands and say 'I already answered your question and don't have time to explain it to someone who doesn't understand.

So based on that, you can\u2019t ask a question based on the incorrect assumption that he will use military which is nothing but speculative.\n\nNo one assumed he will use military force. Trump chose not to rule it out, so therefore that is an option on the table. It's a hypothetical question. The question posed to you is, if he does use military force, do you agree this is common sense? The only assumption made here was you thinking the original commenter is saying Trump will indeed use military force. That was an incorrect assumption on your part. Thanks for clarifying.\n\n>Further more taking control does not mean imperialism. We control Guam to deter China and we control many other places to deter Russia. It has nothing to do with imperialism. \n\nHow do you define imperialism? From that definition, we can look at the history of US gaining control of Guam, and compare your definition, to the events that took place and see if it is imperialism or not.\n\n>When I asked him to clarify he refused and accusing me of being having bad faith.

US spent many lives and billions of dollar on it. now it's controlled by the Chinese company CK Hutchison Holdings. This has nothing to do with \"imposing rule and/or authority over these already owned territories.\"\n\nSo I really don't know where is the imperialism coming from, except from ungrounded speculation.  \n\nlet me be clear: Trump will loose my support if he uses troops to acquire other territories. In fact, he is the only president did not start a new war. Look at all these other presidents. I am against all those silly wars like gulf war, Iraq war, Kosovo war, Korean War, and the Afghanistan fiasco.",

Say our car is $30k, they add 20% tax, and their car is $30k, we add %0-10% (some states don't have sales tax), how is that fair?\n\nI don't see how there's any unfairness as long as the tax is consistent for each market. Our car is $30k, domestically we have 10% tax so it's $33k for the US market, and in EU they have 20% tax so it's $36k in the EU market. If their car is $30k, still domestically we have a 10% tax so it's $33k for the US market, and in EU they still have a 20% tax so it's still $36k in the EU market. So both cars have the same underlying price and are sold for the same amount within each market. I don't see what's unfair about that.\n\nRegarding the fines - I asked for an example fine that you thought was unjustified, but there were a lot of fines mentioned in the links you provided, and I'm not sure if you consider all of them unjustified or only specific ones. So I picked one out somewhat arbitrarily: \"Most recently, the European Commission has announced a\u00a0[$2 billion fine against Apple](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161), arguing that its App Store has hurt competition among music stream apps.\" Is your argument that that fine is unjustified? And the US government should take some action against EU companies in retaliation for that unjustified fine?",

That the reason why Trump is putting tariffs in place is because we are being ripped off.  Does it bother you that the current trade agreement that we are being 'ripped off' with was put in place during Trump's last term when he ripped up NAFTA and re-negotiated it?",
