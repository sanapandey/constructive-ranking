Morals are neither randomly selected nor virtuously selected.\n\nFurthermore, morality is entirely subjective.  Thus, no one can legitimately claim their morals superior to mine.  Or vice versa.\n\nFor something that claims \u2018foundational\u2019 status, that\u2019s a lot of missing foundation.",

As long as you're not white, asian, male, cisgender, christian, other non-muslim religious, non-aligned white female, conservative, \"deplorable,\" rural, a raped Israeli woman, or capitalist. They have contempt for more of humanity than virtually any other group. \n\n* Liberty? If you mean oppressive bureaucracy, economic control, intergenerational race guilt, lockdowns, and speech suppression, then sure.\n\n* Fairness? Equity is the opposite of fairness.\n\nIronically, Loyalty, Authority, and somehow both Sanctity/Degradation better describe the modern leftist. Party dissent leads to excommunication, they're championing the unelected bureaucracy as we speak, and moral inversion is their morality.",

Although, there were a few issues that were lumped together in one question, that I would have preferred were separated into multiple questions. Or, maybe rather than having the answer being a degree of agreement/disagreement, maybe the questions could have been more vague, and the answers could have been examples of where you draw the line. \n\nI also do seem to follow the websites political prediction based on my test scores. It predicts that libertarians will hold Liberty highly and it\u2019s not uncommon for them to score high on fairness as well. So, at least in my case, it seems to be somewhat accurate.",
