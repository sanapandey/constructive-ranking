To clarify, I am not a US citizen, I actually live in a country that is on the \u201cnext to be shot right after Ukraine\u201d list (Poland) and I would really like to know what you guys think about this. My curiosity is all the more justified because really my country relied on your word and promise of help I wanted to ask if Article 5 means anything to you in the sense of a commitment. Maybe you don't even know it, but Poland helped both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and therefore curious if it means anything to you today?\n\n\n\n",

If we are referring to Europe as a whole, not just the countries that belong to either the EU or NATO, then the numbers change and they've actually given or allocated more money to Ukraine than received in energy from Russia. [Graph.](https://i.imgur.com/fg4dnoT.jpeg)\n\nI'm happy that we can agree that it would be nice to not be reliant on Russia however.  U.S. Exports of energy to Europe has increased since Russia's invasion.  Do you think that in this way it has drawn America and Europe closer together?",

            "body": "> Maybe you don't even know it, but Poland helped both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and therefore curious if it means anything to you today?\n\nI do, and it does; the fact that the EU came to our aid post-9/11 to help with the war effort in the Middle East and the coalition even during Desert Storm in the Gulf War. I was 12 years old when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait and lived in the UK at the time as my parents were US and UK military (dad and mum respectively). I was amazed to hear from my dad about all the countries working together to help defend the Kuwaitis from the Iraqi war of aggression.\n\nI think unfortunately we're due for a proper renegotiation with our NATO allies; if only because the EU (and Europe as a whole) has had little interest or need to suitably arm themselves and contribute sizably to international defense. But pending that renegotiation, yes; I think it's unfortunately our responsibility to defend our NATO allies in the instance of Russian invasion or attack- or attack by any nation or state actor, for that matter.\n\nMy wife is also a military officer (and military physician) and in my 40+ years between my parents and now my wife I have truly lived all over the world on military bases and met members of militaries from nearly everywhere in the world, and thusly I don't take war very lightly. I know hundreds of junior officers in the ROK military, USAF/USN/USMC/USA, Australian Air Force, Royal Navy, Luftwaffe, and countless others in their 20s who right now would be the ones flying sorties over Russia if we were forced to take action, and the thought of them facing Anti-Air defenses, and the patients from behind the line coming into my wife's clinic as a new world war sparks is something that keeps me up late at night.\n\nI think it was very smart of European countries to take advantage of the geopolitical situation post-WWII to invest in their infrastructure and redevelopment and building first-class high-tax social welfare states and lean on building countries that can value nationalism and curate law protecting national identity all under the safety and umbrella of United States protection.\n\nI also think that this meant the United States had to do without in many ways, and our prosperity combined with largesse has been taken for granted. I don't support those sorts of social welfare programs in the US, to be clear, but the idea that they simply weren't an option for us at all due to our obligations to the broader world order make me disappointed. And to be the butt of international jokes despite all that is a one-two punch I don't think I want to abide any longer.\n\nSo at the end of the day do I want to watch my wife get deployed to some forward operating base to defend  EU's bear-poking of Russia due to NATO obligation? Definitely not. Will I? I don't have much choice. Do I think that should be the way of the future? I don't think so, not anymore. Europe wants our researchers, our academics, our higher education, our technology, our businesses, our products/services, our energy, our money, and even our wives, sons, daughters, husbands; and in return they want to shit on our President when they don't like him, tell us we're backwards inbred hicks, and treat us as their idiot cousin they have to put up with because we're rich. I say no more.",

Instead, it is a much weaker country that just wants to maintain its own sphere of influence in the countries around it which share a heritage and culture with Russia. That does NOT include Poland. Poland is not under threat by Russia.\n\nAs for NATO, it has outlived its usefulness. It was supposed to be a defensive alliance against the Soviet Union, not an offensive alliance against Russia and random brown people countries.\n\nAlso I dont understand why Europeans think 'helping' America in Iraq was a big deal. That was a really dumb war and I respect countries that said no.",
