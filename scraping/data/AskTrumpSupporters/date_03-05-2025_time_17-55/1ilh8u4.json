NS asks a question.  TS answers question, TS gets downvoted to oblivion.  We ALREADY know you (NS) do not agree with the answer, but it is an answer to your question -- you should upvote it.\n\n(for the bad-faith political back-and-forth point scoring, I am probably as guilty as everyone else...

Some topics I full well know will be 100% diehard supported, but other topics that I think will be supported surprise me when I see TS disagreeing with Trump, like his desire to take over Gaza. \n\nI was shocked that many TS were against it. And that helped me to realize that it\u2019s not entirely blind devotion to Trump from TS and that if his supporters disagree with Trump then they speak up and say so. And that\u2019s refreshing because it shows that they have a voice and opinions and not everything is Trump or bust. No one in the world could ever agree 100% with any politician because everyone is different and has different values and wants different things. And so to see that Trump supporters speak up if they don\u2019t agree with Trump on something is refreshing.",

People generally don\u2019t think \u201ctaking over Gaza \u201c is a good idea because we want to try and stay out of that mess, not get further enmeshed into it. Also, no one really knows what he means, he just blurted it out for the first time during a live press conference. Even Netanyahu was like \u201cuhhh that\u2019s an interesting idea I guess?\u201d But Trump has a history of saying all kinds of things, and Trump supporters know this, so they take it with a grain of salt. Part of his strategy, I think, is to just throw a bunch of ideas out there and see what sticks. He has also talked about his strategy of \u201cflooding the zone.\u201d He wants to keep saying and doing things quickly so the media doesn\u2019t have time to react negatively and shut it down. The general consensus with Trump supporters is that we liked his ideas better than Kamala\u2019s ideas. But that doesn\u2019t have to mean *every* single idea.",

Do you think it is possible that some of us truly just think TS might agree with Trump on his ideas in good faith?

I can appreciate trumps humor and the humor content he generates while still not loving every single idea he has. But we do love most of his ideas, and even if we don\u2019t, we appreciate his willingness to think outside the box and try and find solutions. Also we don\u2019t pour over every decision and comment he makes. I voted for someone else to run the country, so I don\u2019t have to.",

I don't think that the support of anyone is above criticism; we're all human and have our own takes on things. My issue is with the constant bombardment of attempted shut-downs and 'gotchas' that typically flows much more heavily one way than the other (especially on places like Reddit).\n\nJust like anyone else, Trump is human. He has his own thoughts on how things should be and why. I agree with some things he says, and disagree with others (though I do find that I mostly align with him on the majority of things, hence why I support him). He won the election because he resonated enough with Americans, at least more so than his opposition. I welcome conversations as to why, as I hold a strong belief that it should be we the people, united to keep the government in check no matter who is in charge. But when it constantly devolves into gotcha moments and downvoting anything a TS says into oblivion, it loses its purpose.",

Look to the anti subs (basically every sub) & how they portray any action & them predicting truly absurd things that would never happen, not even remotely possible. Look to the literal support of genocide in South Africa by significant portions of these sites & ask why this is permitted, but a minor disagreement isn't.\n\n\nHave you considered you're the unhinged person? I listen to everyone, I go out of my way to hear out people I completely disagree with, even those ideas I think as or more evil than Mao or Khan. This whole website, all of Reddit, went from being one of the most influential websites online to a tiny fringe isolated minority with the only influence on the discourse being that of mockery by conservatives & pointing to the most fringe, unhinged lunatic predictions & hypocrisy spread as top posts or screenshots of the most minor, mild support of Trump being banned. This is what Reddit's reputation has been relegated to since Spez took over from the former free speech individuals who initially ran it. Look at the number of people online in these subs. You cannot claim to remain hinged & having a good understanding of reality if you only associate with the most extreme version of agreement in outright hatred of a man.\n\n\nThis subreddit itself composes, at best, tens of Trump supporters, not hundreds, but less than 50, because every other one was chased off & banned. You aren't getting even a remotely representative sample size of Trump supporters, those left long ago, just whatever fragments are left who are bullheaded stubborn enough to keep trying to talk to people more politically isolate than uncontacted tribes (myself included). Even among non trump independents, mild objection to lunacy got you banned. Simple association was often enough. I was there when it started, I was around in 2015. I was actually still hostile to Trump though conservative in temperament & only lightly informed in my political beliefs. There had at one point been a thriving discourse, then things were just often invented whole cloth by Reddit's CEO directly in order to ban Trump supporters. He literally edited comments of Trump supporters, invented events to justify banning people while also defending cannibalism subs. You think people who primarily socialize through such an insular & censorious site that it would make the Soviet & Nazi secret police seem mild will accurately be able to understand people outside of it?\n\n\nEven if Trump was literally the devil the common understanding on Reddit would be so exaggerated as to be comical because these social circles are so insular & censorious that they turned servers with hundreds of millions of people into places where the best, largest amount of people wouldn't fill out a school gymnasium in a small town.\n\n\nThe point of this isn't to debate, though it often devolves into it, but rather to understand from a one sided discussion. The amount of times I see NS throwing in completely irrelevant questions that basically amount to 'but Trump is evil, right? You're actually just a Nazi, right?\" to pretty standard answers is staggering.\n\n*Typo",

Video has never stopped being relevant.\u00a0Nazi - Everyone I don't like.\u00a0\n\n\nYou are actually the one who has to constantly assert he is a Nazi, you're just so isolate you can't see it. If I go into a Hitler apologist group I fully expect I have to keep asserting Hitler is bad, they will think I'm the crazy one. If I go on Reddit I fully expect to hear about how Trump is worse than Hitler. Even if it was popular opinion though, which it obviously is not, I would stand my ground because what is right & true is oft unpopular. I will listen, I will try to understand, but I will oppose that which I believe wrong.\n\n\nNational Socialist German Workers Party held a very particular set of beliefs. It believed the German Peoples are the oppressed & the Jews, Poles, & Cripples as well, to use their terms, were oppressors by keeping the German People from their glorious destiny, in the same way communists view oppressor & oppressed economic classes. They're essentially kissing cousins fighting over what group is the actually oppressed & oppressor. Fascism is the same but it goes by civic nation rather than ethnicity, how dare the Brits & French & Greeks take land from us & not give us our rightful claims after we fucked up WWI & blah blah blah the state is the sole good & everything inside the state. This is how these ideologies think. If the person deviates from these very specific foundational bounds that person is not a Nazi, Communist, or Fascist respectively. It was German ethnocentrism mixed with romanticism & socialist theories traced back to Rousseau. It was a non-Marxist branch of socialism that is, for all intents & purposes, long dead.\u00a0",

The average American had a significantly less access to information about the world and even their own country's social issues.  That, in turn, could lead to a more insular understanding of what's \"normal\", and in turn anything that goes against it as being \"extreme\".\n\nConversely, some concepts like \"gender identity\" have seemingly gone through an extremely regressive shift.  Gender identity is a very easy example of this; multiple episodes of Star Trek TNG (which began airing in the 80s) casually discussed gender identity, and the 1990 episode \"The Offspring\" involved Data building a child that he explicitly stated he would respect the autonomy of and grant them full freedom to choose their appearance and gender identity.  I am fully convinced that had that episode aired today, a significant number of right-wing culture warriors would be decrying Data as a child groomer for that act.\n\nThe big point here though is, just because a belief was \"common\" a quarter-century ago, is it possible that the passage of time and cultural re-assessment might lead people to realize that \"common\" belief should've been discarded?",

I get most of Reddit are zoomers, but it's literally retarded to pretend that's a long time ago. The vast majority of Americans were alive and aware during the 90s.\n\nIt's been *more* than 25 years since the *last* year of the 90s.\n\nAs a millennial, it was a long time ago.  Gay marriage was still not a thing.  Pagers were still in use.  For better and for worse, Islam really hadn't entered public perception and America hadn't gone into the Middle East.  The housing market crash of 2008 hadn't happened.  Climate change and CTE weren't well known.  The Soviet Union collapsed in the 90s and we got to see Putin's rise up from the ashes.\n\nFrom where I'm standing, technology and society advanced extraordinarily quickly.  I don't know how old you are, but why should I treat a chunk of time that started thirty-five+ years ago (if we start at 1990) as \"it wasn't that long ago\"?  If I look at any other 35 year gap period in the history of America, I can comfortably talk about how a lot of things changed, why shouldn't that be applied for the gap between the 90s and 2025?\n\n>Re trans issues in the 90s\n\nI wasn't talking about trans acceptance, I was talking about the topic being presented in a cultural landmark of entertainment without it getting accused of promoting child grooming.\n\n>But you are right, much of our downfall is linked to the 90s. I'm only saying it was normal back then to be socially conservative. Hell, many of these ideas were normal 15 years ago. Most Americans disagreed with gay marriage up to about 2010.\n\nMany Americans weren't fully aware of the indignities that the LGBT+ community were subjected to on a routine basis.  As I said before, information about that, along with medical research into the human brain and how sexual preferences and gender identity develop within it weren't really available for the average \"normal\" person in the 90s.  That can change minds.  Being able to interact with LGBT+ individuals can do so likewise, and it was a landmark moment for gay rights when even Dick Cheney was willing to come out in defense of homosexuals.\n\nCan you understand how that exposure to new ideas can stimulate change?\n\n>Sure, liberalism should have been discarded!\n\nTangent, but I was really hoping you wouldn't go reaching for low-hanging gotcha comments like this, especially in this thread specifically where there are so many TSes complaining about being on the receiving end of this exact conduct.",

Let me ask you if this type of statement is someone trying to understand. Your critique and restatement are both valid. But does this type of response make it look like they're trying to understand my point of view? You're in the minority of NTS and I appreciate it.

But what do remember is it has so far been about a very narrow points of fact.  Eg if we\u2019re re talking about, say, healthcare and let\u2019s say I believed all Doctors are over 5ft and they point out there are a few that aren\u2019t, they\u2019re just rare. \n\nWhat it hasn\u2019t been yet is a big revelation that would convince me that we should have Gov run healthcare.  But I\u2019m open to the idea.  \n\nTo switch my position on Trump, there would have to be a position change on most of my major positions.  To vote Democrat today I\u2019d have to change my views on fundamental economics, the last 25 years of Democrat presidents, globalism and more.  That\u2019s a lot of really big ticket items that I\u2019ve drawn from decades of knowledge building and analysis.  Trivialities are unlikely to present a formidable challenge. \n\nThe one thing that can and likely would get me to switch is because as an individualist, I will naturally align with the underdog.  Underdogs (communists and absolutists) always seek freedom.  But when they get institutional power, they pivot to authoritarianism.  Just as the Democrats have this decade.  Individualists consist of about 30% of voters so we will never seize power ourselves.  We don\u2019t have the numbers.  \n\nOnce you understand we have a political trichotomy and not a dichotomy, this all makes sense.",

Many of the questions are just plain boring and not the things people vote Trump for, why don't you ask us about why we want ICE to do what they do?\n2. It's not rare to see posts where nearly EVERY answer is downvoted to hell\n3. People downvote you for simply stating the facts, I'll give you my example here:\n\nTwitch is far-left and censors everything right-wing and at the same time promotes terrorists, hires antisemites as chiefs of safety, ban country of Israel, host race tier list on Twitch Con with Jews at the bottom, don't punish streamers for calling Jews pig-dogs, don't punish for excusing October 7, don't punish for 9/11 cake, don't punish for basically calling Jews scumbags that deserve to be exterminated, don't get punish for inviting members of literal terrorist group, that is officially acknowledged to be terrorists and fucking literal pirates. Oh, no-no-no-no, it's not THOSE kinds of interviews where western idiots ask terrorist about woman rights, it's kind of interviews where you call those people \"cool\" and say that you support them. The people who has a motto of \"Death to America, curse upon the Jews\". Oh, I also remember Hasan LITERALLY showing a violent terrorist propaganda video with guns and \"QUESTIONABLE\" lyrics and showing the dude SUPPORTS THIS.\n\nI just stated that THIS exists, which is undeniable truth, all the proves are on the internet. But SOMEHOW Andrew Tate and FUCKING ASMONGOLD WHO IS LEFT LEANING CENTRIST is too much for Twitch? Elon and his \"Nazi salute\"? Really? How about Hasan Piker calling jews pig-dogs that should be instinct and to yap about how much he wish they all were dead? You are for real are concerned about a FUCKING HAND GESTURE and totally fine with RACIAL TIER LISTS WITH JEWS AT BOTTOM? Get your priorities straight, this looks insanely disingenuous. And don't start talking about \"whataboutism\", people literally ignore REAL, HARDCORE, extreme and violent antisemitism but have a fucking problem with hand gestures. This is pure clownery at this point \ud83e\udd21\n\nAnd I said that Twitch does one sided censorship (anti right) and allows pretty much terrorist if it's pro left.\n\nAnd I get downvoted for mentioning that, isn't this extremely stupid? Why do you even try listening to TS if you melting down from recognizing this little lukewarm fact?\n\nI told you that on Twitter/X Hasan Piker is NOT banned. And lots of people whose opinion I despise, because they are extremists and terrorist supporters in my opinion. But on Twitch? Heeeeeeeeeeell, nah. We literally had adpocalypse recently because advertisers were concerned with all this \"kill all the jews\" videos being a place where their products are promoted. X is MUCH more fair and represented than Twitch, but nah, you get downvoted for mentioning that because NS are apparently all moved to BlueSky and hate Twitter now because they lost one sided censorship they so much liked back then when Twitter was only woke",

TS are outnumbered, so if you say things that make NS sufficiently angry, you are inevitably going to be downvoted. There is nothing the mods can do about it and TS just have to stop caring. I don't like when I'm talking with someone and it's obvious that he is instantly downvoting every reply I write. It just seems petty and childish. But I've had multiple comments that are -30 and beyond and it doesn't strike me as some grand injustice the way that some TS describe it. You're saying stuff people disagree with. They're going to downvote you. What do you expect?",
