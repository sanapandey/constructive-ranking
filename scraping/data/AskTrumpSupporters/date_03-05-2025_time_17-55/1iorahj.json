I'm not saying that you believe it to be true, but after spending a little too much time on social media lately, I'm seeing a lot, and they tend to make me both chuckle and roll my eyes.\n\nFor the sake of everyone's sanity, let's keep it to relatively recent ones.\n\nAlso, as a bonus question, have you ever heard a conspiracy theory and later found out that it was true?",

            "body": "Two of my favorite conspiracy theories are:\n\n* Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone in order to screw over Square payment processing, and force people to use Apple Pay instead.\n* Hobby Lobby somehow came to own literally millions of miniature chalkboards - either by accident or on purpose - and started the whole miniature chalkboard artwork craft a few years ago in order to get rid of them.\n\nAlex Jones conspiracy theories that ended up being true:\n\n* \"THE WATER IS TURNING THE FROGS GAY!\"  This turned out to be true.  Unused drugs that contain hormones that humans are dumping into the waterways are messing with frogs' reproductive cycles.  In some cases, there were entire colonies of frogs that were of the same sex (despite frogs having the ability to change sex when needed).\n* \"HUMAN ANIMAL HYBRIDS IN SECRET LABS!\".  Turned out to be true.  Of what little information that came out of some of the bio labs in places like Wuhan and Ukraine, the press reported on \"humanized mice\" existing there.  So, human-mice hybrids.\n* \"HAARP IS ENGINEERING THE WEATHER!\"  I don't know if HAARP is actually involved, but weather modification has been around and used for a very long time by now.  Not sure why Liberals kept calling this a conspiracy theory.\n* \"THE GOVERNMENT'S DOING CHEMTRAILS!\"  It got very little attention, but, about two years ago, our government literally came out and said, \"Yep.  Chemtrails are a thing, and we've been doing it\".  This was after decades of calling those who believed it to be crackpots.\n\nBut, probably my absolute favorite is the \"Arecibo Answer\":\n\n* Way back in the 1970s, just as a test, the Arecibo dish in Puerto Rico transmitted an 8-bit coded message, which displayed stuff about us humans and our planet, out into the void of space.\n* In August of 2001, we got an answer to our broadcast.  It came in the form of an elaborate crop circle in a field next to a large observatory in England (instead of back to Arecibo).  It mimicked our message, but changed some details to describe the beings and solar system who sent it.\n* It was quickly mowed over.\n* This was one month before 9/11.",

That's what his theory was, and it was a lie. The corporations that he wants to furthet deregulate were doing it, because they could and no level of environmental or human destruction is too far in the name of profit.\n\n\nAlex claims to have been taken into facilities where actual chimeras looked at him with their \"sad human eyes.\" None of what he says about this is true, they are the fantasies of a sad, broken man. There is no such thing as \"humanized mice\" as you or he are presenting it. They put some lung tissue in a mouse to run tests, that is not one of Alex's chimeras.\n\n\nCloud seeding is not liberals aiming hurricanes at Republican towns. If I say that you're targeting me for an assassination, and it turns out you told me to fuck off one time, that doesn't make me partially right, it makes me a liar.\u00a0\n\n\nChemtrails still aren't real.\n\n\nHave you ever actually looked into any of this? Are you aware that the people who spread these things are often outright lying about what their sources say?",

                    "body": "Speaking of 9/11:\n\n* There is an organization called something like \"The Human Consciousness Project\".  They came about through a discovery that some scientists stumbled across.\n* There are millions of random number generators across the world.  These generate truly random numbers, and they are very important for encryption and such.\n* Attached to each random number generator is a secondary device that is constantly looking for potential patterns that the random number generator might have generated.  A potential pattern emerging in the numbers would be a big problem.  These secondary devices send a \"ping\" of sorts when one is detected - just to record the event.  It's common for this to happen a few times every day.\n* Well, leading up to every major happening in the world since these pings have been recorded, there has been a serious increase (like exponentially serious) in the number of potential non-random numbers that the random number generators create.  This peaks at the time of the event, and then crashes back down to normal.\n* They saw this for such events as 9/11 and Princess Di's death.  These pings also match up with global stock market crashes.\n\nI have my own conspiracy theory:\n\n* Trump's last year in office was plagued with Covid.\n* Despite what anyone else says about how serious they think it actually was, you had the President of the country - a billionaire who made his money through real estate - telling everyone to stay home.\n* People did, and ended up working on their houses - which increased the value of their own real estate.  Lumber prices skyrocketed.\n* And, a secondary part to the conspiracy theory is that the reason house prices are so high right now is because everyone who dumped tens of thousands of dollars into home improvements a couple years ago are now trying to recoup that money through the selling of their houses.",

Many legal challenges were filed in 2020, but weren\u2019t the vast majority dismissed due to a lack of evidence or standing? If courts\u2014some with judges appointed by Trump\u2014did not rule these changes unconstitutional, what evidence supports the claim that they were?\n\n2.\tHow does Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution prohibit state officials from adjusting election procedures? Doesn\u2019t it grant state legislatures the power to determine the manner of elections but not necessarily prohibit executive agencies or courts from interpreting or implementing election laws, especially in emergency situations?\n\n3.\tWhat is the basis for saying there was \u2018no chain of custody\u2019 or that ballots were counted \u2018for several days\u2019 in a way that affected the outcome? Wasn\u2019t ballot counting always expected to take time in close races, especially with historic levels of mail-in voting? And weren\u2019t both Republican and Democratic observers present in key states during the process?\n\n4.\tRegarding signature verification and relaxed ballot collection timelines, how do these changes compare to previous elections? For instance, were deadlines and signature verification standards significantly stricter in past elections, or were these adjustments largely in line with historical precedent?\n\n5.\tIf \u2018most people at least recognize this,\u2019 why were Republican-led audits and reviews\u2014such as those in Arizona and Georgia\u2014unable to demonstrate widespread fraud or a meaningful impact on the outcome? If even Republican officials in charge of elections confirmed the legitimacy of the results, why should we believe otherwise?\n\n6.\tHow does this comparison support the idea that concerns over 2020 were legitimate while dismissing those in 2024 as \u2018bat-shit insane\u2019? If distrust in election outcomes is harmful to democracy, shouldn\u2019t we be equally critical of both baseless and exaggerated claims, regardless of which party they come from?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on these points!",

I would like to inquire on this though:\n\n\\> Doesn\u2019t it grant state legislatures the power to determine the manner of elections but not necessarily prohibit executive agencies or courts from interpreting or implementing election laws, especially in emergency situations?\n\nYou should then be able to point to the specific and requisite legislation authored, voted on and passed by said state legislatures delegating this electoral power outside of the legislative body. Just saying this power must be granted, doesn't mean it is without the requisite legislation. Because Article 2 Section 1, with no other supporting legislation, prohibits this.",

However, I have a question about your interpretation of Article II, Section 1:\n\nIf Article II, Section 1 prohibits any non-legislative body from making election-related adjustments without explicit legislative delegation, how do you reconcile this with the fact that courts have historically played a role in interpreting and enforcing election laws? For example, wasn\u2019t the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 largely based on judicial intervention in state election administration?\n\nAdditionally, if no legislation explicitly granted such authority, wouldn\u2019t that mean longstanding practices\u2014such as secretaries of state setting election deadlines, state supreme courts ruling on election disputes, or governors issuing emergency orders related to elections\u2014have all been unconstitutional? Has any court definitively ruled that these actions in 2020 were unconstitutional, or is this an interpretation rather than a settled legal principle?\n\nAnd finally, if state legislatures alone have absolute authority, does that mean a legislature could\u2014without judicial review\u2014arbitrarily invalidate election results or refuse to certify an outcome based on its own discretion? Wouldn\u2019t that contradict the broader system of checks and balances in constitutional law?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts!",

Elections\u2014especially on a national scale\u2014require structured, rule-based administration. The idea that you can run a complex democratic process without an organized system bound by rules and regulations isn\u2019t just naive; it\u2019s outright laughable.

The alternative is chaos\u2014individuals making ad hoc decisions with no oversight, which would be a breeding ground for actual fraud and manipulation.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be absolutely clear: The courts exist precisely to ensure that these rules and regulations are followed. That\u2019s why, when Trump\u2019s legal team, the GOP, and countless individuals challenged the 2020 election results, they lost every single case. Not one single claim of election impropriety survived judicial scrutiny\u2014not even in front of Trump-appointed judges. The legal system didn\u2019t fail them; their arguments failed because they were built on baseless speculation, conspiracy theories, and outright fabrications.\n\nYou can call these court losses \u201clack of standing\u201d all you want, but that\u2019s just a convenient way of avoiding the fact that not one single judge\u2014conservative, liberal, or neutral\u2014found any legal merit in these claims. The judiciary, including courts packed with Trump\u2019s own appointees, ruled overwhelmingly against them. That is not a coincidence. That is not a conspiracy. That is reality.\n\nSo at this point, continuing to argue that something shady must have happened, despite the overwhelming lack of legal validation, is no different from believing in horoscopes or palm readings. It\u2019s superstition masquerading as political analysis.

However, I can provide an overview of notable cases and direct you to resources that offer detailed information.\n\n## Notable Pre-Election Lawsuits and Rulings:\n\n### Arizona:\n- **Mi Familia Vota v. Hobbs**: Two non-profit groups filed a motion to extend the voter-registration deadline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial extension was granted but later shortened upon appeal.\n- **Arizona Democratic Party v. Hobbs**: This case addressed whether absentee voters who submit unsigned ballots should have the same opportunity to correct their ballots as those with other identification issues. The appellate court ultimately dismissed the case.\n\n### California:\n- **Gallagher v. Newsom**: Challenged Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s executive order mandating mail-in ballots for all Californians. The court ruled that Newsom overstepped his authority, but since the legislature had enacted a similar law, the ruling had no impact on the election.\n\n### Michigan:\n- **Michigan Alliance for Retired Americans v. Benson**: A lawsuit challenging the requirement for mail-in ballots to be received by Election Day. The initial ruling extended the deadline, but this was later overturned on appeal.\n\n### Minnesota:\n- **Carson v. Simon**: Addressed the extension of the mail-in ballot deadline through a consent decree. The appellate court ruled that only the Minnesota Legislature could establish election rules, leading to the segregation of late-arriving ballots pending further proceedings.\n\n### Nevada:\n- **Kraus v. Cegavske**: Filed by the Nevada Republican Party and the Trump campaign, this lawsuit cited alleged issues with the signature verification process. The court rejected the lawsuit due to lack of standing, and a subsequent settlement effectively ended the case.\n\n### New Jersey:\n- **Donald J. Trump for President v. Way**: The Trump campaign sued New Jersey officials to overturn an executive order mandating mail-in ballots for all active voters. The court denied the campaign\u2019s request to prohibit vote counting before Election Day and the counting of certain mail-in ballots.\n\n### Washington:\n- **Washington v. Trump**: This case focused on whether changes to the United States Postal Service violated federal administrative rulemaking requirements and infringed upon states\u2019 rights to regulate elections. The court issued an order regarding election mail procedures.\n\n## For a more comprehensive and detailed list of cases, I recommend consulting the following resources:\n- **[SCOTUSblog\u2019s Election Litigation Tracker](https://www.scotusblog.com/election-litigation/)**: Provides up-to-date information on major election law cases across various court levels.  \n- **[Federal Judicial Center\u2019s COVID-19 and Emergency Election Litigation](https://www.fjc.gov/content/350168/covid-19-and-emergency-election-litigation)**: Offers case studies on election-related litigation triggered by the pandemic.  \n- **[Wikipedia\u2019s \u201cPre-election lawsuits related to the 2020 U.S. presidential election\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_U.S._presidential_election)**: Contains summaries and outcomes of various pre-election lawsuits.  \n\nThese resources provide detailed information on the numerous legal challenges and rulings related to the 2020 election.\n\nNow, my question for you, if you reject all of this evidence and all the work these organizations, individuals, lawyers, jurists, et al, can I sell you some magic rocks?",

To address your concerns comprehensively, let\u2019s examine the legal challenges in key battleground states during the 2020 U.S. presidential election, since you seem to think that makes any difference when it comically doesn't. The extensive litigation and subsequent rulings underscore that skepticism regarding the election\u2019s integrity is unfounded and often stems from misinformation.\n\n1. Legal Challenges in Battleground States:\n\nArizona:\n\n* Ward v. Jackson: Arizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward filed a lawsuit alleging irregularities in ballot processing. The Arizona Supreme Court dismissed the case, citing a lack of evidence.\n\nGeorgia:\n\n* Pearson v. Kemp: Plaintiffs sought to decertify Georgia\u2019s election results, alleging widespread fraud. The case was dismissed by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia due to insufficient evidence.\n\nMichigan:\n\n* King v. Whitmer: A lawsuit alleging massive election fraud in Michigan. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan dismissed the case, labeling the claims as speculative and unsupported.\n\nNevada:\n\n* Law v. Whitmer: Plaintiffs challenged Nevada\u2019s election results, alleging irregularities. The First Judicial District Court in Carson City dismissed the case, citing a lack of credible evidence.\n\nPennsylvania:\n\n* Donald J. Trump for President v. Boockvar: The Trump campaign alleged unconstitutional changes to mail-in voting procedures. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the case, stating the campaign\u2019s claims had no merit.\n\nWisconsin:\n\n* Feehan v. Wisconsin Elections Commission: A lawsuit alleging widespread fraud and seeking to overturn Wisconsin\u2019s election results. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin dismissed the case due to a lack of evidence.\n\n2. Misinterpretation of \u2018Lack of Standing\u2019:\n\nThe legal principle of \u201cstanding\u201d ensures that only parties with a direct and tangible interest can bring a lawsuit. In the context of the 2020 election, many cases were dismissed because plaintiffs couldn\u2019t demonstrate direct harm from the alleged issues. This is a foundational aspect of the legal system, not a tactic to sidestep evidence. As noted by Reuters, state and federal judges dismissed more than 50 lawsuits challenging the election or its outcome, often citing a lack of standing or evidence.  \ufffc\n\n3. Allegations of \u2018Suspect\u2019 Election Administration:\n\nAssertions that the 2020 election administration was \u201csuspect\u201d or \u201cunconstitutional\u201d have been thoroughly investigated and have so little merit that not even one single maga judge would allow the case in their courtrooms. Both state and federal agencies, including the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), described the 2020 election as \u201cthe most secure in American history.\u201d Furthermore, numerous audits and recounts across various states reaffirmed the accuracy of the results. Continuing to claim otherwise, without substantive evidence, undermines the democratic process and is akin to relying on unfounded conspiracy theories.\n\nThe sheer volume of court cases across multiple battleground states, all rejected due to absence of the tiniest shred of evidence, proves beyond any doubt that allegations of widespread fraud or unconstitutional election changes are pure fantasy. Ignoring these rulings while clinging to vague, undefined \u201csuspicions\u201d isn\u2019t skepticism\u2014it\u2019s conspiracy-fueled wishful thinking, no different from reading horoscopes and convincing yourself they predict the future. At this point, anyone still insisting the 2020 election was \u201csuspect\u201d despite the overwhelming legal smackdown isn\u2019t engaging in a fact-based discussion\u2014they\u2019re indulging in tinfoil-hat delusions designed to preserve a comforting lie.\n\nIf half a decade of overwhelming evidence\u2014including rulings from conservative judges, Republican-led audits, DOJ investigations, and even Fox News (which was legally forced to admit in court that no fraud occurred)\u2014still isn\u2019t enough for you, then that leaves us in only one place, doesn't it? \n\nAre you willing to admit that even if you had a magic crystal ball with access to all events and information everywhere, not even possession of the absolute truth will change your mind because your belief isn\u2019t based on evidence, but on an emotional need for the outcome to be different?",

While I don't want them claiming an election was stolen, I do wish they put in some amount of effort to see if there's evidence of something being manipulated or altered. \n\nI do think it's far more likely that the election results were affected by things like voter suppression, throwing away votes on technicalities, or threatening violence like the many bomb threats that happened on election day (I'm not saying these factors mean the election was \"stolen\", it well could've been a non factor; it certainly should not be happening, though). Maybe the whole thing with trump suddenly saying 'he already has the votes' and that musk 'knows the voting machines better than anyone' does point to some crazy conspiracy that they stole the election, it's certainly possible but nobody can prove it; they can just point out what they've said. At the end of the day I just want our elections to be fair and secure but don't see the left doing anything about possibilities that something went awry. I honestly think they don't look into anything because they don't want to be associated with the absolutely frivolous claims presented by the right last election. \n\nIdk what exactly I'm saying.

While I don't want them claiming an election was stolen, I do wish they put in some amount of effort to see if there's evidence of something being manipulated or altered.\n\nThat's really the core issue though. The democrats have painted a HUGE election sentiment corner for themselves. They couldn't really claim 2020 as the most safe, secure and fair election in history, while simultaneously ridiculing, mocking, dismissing and censoring anyone who thought otherwise, and then suddenly claim shenanigans in 2024 and be taken seriously. It just doesn't work like that. In addition, I think the fallout from 2020 (J6 prisoner treatment, lawyers being disbarred/indicted simply for proving associated legal representation) means that elections will rarely be challenged in the future, just way too risky to do so - pretty sure that was the entire point though.\n\nRegardless of that added variable, the path to question elections is not necessarily easy for either side, much less recourse or restitution. Even if there is evidence, you can't make a case in court too early, because since the states haven't certified their elections, standing can't be established. After certification, standing might be established, but a court cannot overrule an act of the legislature. A slate of alternate electors might be gathered at that point, but the Congress is under no obligation to accept them. At that point the Supreme Court would probably need to be appealed to, but that's tough since they don't want to be in the business of deciding elections. Then all that's really left is the right of assembly for a redress of grievances and march/protest. But no one is even touching that one after the fallout from January 6. So the path to successfully challenge/change an election outcome in the 2 months before certification is almost insurmountable. Add that it's now legally and criminally risky to do so.",

You know... the guy the belt is named after.\n\n>\"A person in the cabin of a space shuttle in a circular equatorial orbit in the most intense region of the inner radiation belt, at an altitude of about 1000 miles, would be subjected to a fatal dosage of radiation in about one week.\n\n>However, the outbound and inbound trajectories of the Apollo spacecraft cut through the outer portions of the inner belt and because of their high speed spent only about 15 minutes in traversing the region and less than 2 hours in traversing the much less penetrating radiation in the outer radiation belt. The resulting radiation exposure for the round trip was less than 1% of a fatal dosage - a very minor risk among the far greater other risks of such flights. I made such estimates in the early 1960s and so informed NASA engineers who were planning the Apollo flights. These estimates are still reliable.\n\n\n>*The recent Fox TV show, which I saw, is an ingenious and entertaining assemblage of nonsense. The claim that radiation exposure during the Apollo missions would have been fatal to the astronauts is only one example of such nonsense.*\n\nThings never change with FOX, huh[?](https://forum.cosmoquest.org/forum/the-proving-grounds/conspiracy-theories/3856-statement-from-james-van-allen-on-radiation-effects?3885-Statement-from-James-Van-Allen-on-radiation-effects=&s=359c4bf7120f031a13821c2da72ff66e)",
