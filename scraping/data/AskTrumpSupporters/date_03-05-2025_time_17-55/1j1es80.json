    "selftext": "With no clear leader in sight and the party effectively running around aimlessly like a chicken with its head cut off, the 2028 democratic primary is looking to be very competitive and unpredictable with plenty of potential candidates seeking the nomination. That being said, is there any democrat you'd be fine with seeing in the oval office if republicans lose in 2028? This can be any politician that can run as well as outsiders that lack any experience in elected office and fit outside the establishment.",
