Most of the village likes to go to Village Pub.  One day, Dave decides to start calling one of his patrons Peter, even though his name is Frank, and everyone knows him as Frank.  He demands everyone else calls him Peter, but no one does , because his name is Frank and has always been Frank.  Frustrated, Dave changes the name of his bar to Pete's Pub, and everyone is fine calling it that, as it's Dave's bar, and he can rename it if he wants, silly as it may be.  \n\nDoes this make sense of the AP's neutrality relating to the Gulf of Mexico and Mt.Mikinley?",

How can there ever be freedom of the press, if the press is not free and unrestricted from hearing the information presented to the \u2018obedient\u2019 yes-people journalists?\nElon Musk bought MSNBC today.\nState run media is happening in the USA right now. Right. Now.\nJust like Russia and North Korea, for instance.\nControlling the media, controlling the narrative, creating a propagandized populous, these things can only be viewed as dangerous for democracy, and simply horrifying for the groups of people that the new regime hates, which could change from moment to moment.\nWhen we do not, as a nation, fight for free press and freedom from state run media, we doom ourselves as a democracy. \nCan anyone anyone anyone explain to me how this is just ok?",

Despite occasional tensions, these organizations maintained their credentials and coverage capabilities.\n\nIn the Biden administration, conservative outlets like Fox News continued to have access to press briefings and Pentagon facilities. However, policy changes regarding press credentials have led to concerns about access for some conservative reporters. For instance, The Daily Signal's White House correspondent faced challenges due to new credentialing requirements.\n\nNow that I've answered your question in good faith, could you answer my original question?

If this were something much more significant then I would care, but to me it\u2019s just a name change. \n\nAs for any news sources being barred from the White House, no I do not support that. But I\u2019m not going to support everything that Trump does or says. I do see where you\u2019re coming from with the free speech thing, and that\u2019s a genuine concern to have, which is the main reason for me not supporting the AP being barred.\n\nI think every news source should be allowed, and every American get to decide which one they get their news from because at this point people are aware that mainstream media is going to have some sort of bias. Although I feel like the AP is one of the better sources.\n\n I guess if I had to form an opinion on the matter altogether, I think Trump should\u2019ve just left the name alone because it doesn\u2019t do anything but give him pushback from people about something that\u2019s so small in the grand scheme of things. I also think Trump shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve barred the AP because not only do I think it\u2019s stupid, but it gives people more ammunition for the fascist narrative. Also, because of the point about free speech as well.\n\nI hope this answered your question",

Suddenly, there is a right and wrong name for this gulf which is the opposite to reality.

I think it\u2019s just a display of ultra patriotism to be honest, but taken to an extreme I suppose due to the context of the situation.\n\nI can see how you can come to that point of view but as of right now I\u2019m not worried, although of course things can always change. I do appreciate your opinion because it has made me acknowledge how this could potentially be a slippery slope into a worst case scenario. \n\nLastly, yes. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind. I feel like that\u2019s not just a Republican/Trump supporter thing though. I think people will always have situations that they just can\u2019t bring themselves to care too much about something if it doesn\u2019t impact them or the ones they care about personally. Life can be exhausting and sometimes I just don\u2019t have the energy to dedicate much thought and care to certain things, even though I\u2019m well aware that\u2019s not always a good thing.\n\nIt\u2019s very important to not just care about things that affect me personally, and I try to remind myself of that. But sometimes, world events are just too much for me to sacrifice some peace of mind for immediately.\n\nWhen it comes to The Gulf in particular though, this isn\u2019t like a war or some other physical political issue. It\u2019s just a silly renaming, at least in my mind. I\u2019d guess there are some (maybe a lot, I don\u2019t really know) in Mexico that are upset about the change, but I think most of them will just laugh it off and keep calling it The Gulf Of Mexico, and I think they should if they don\u2019t like the name change. \n\nI kind of look at this like Twitter being changed to X. I still call it Twitter, because that\u2019s what it was called for so long and X is just a stupid name. Also, Twitter rolls off the tongue better. Honestly if for some reason I need to refer to it, I\u2019ll just call it The Gulf and hope the person I\u2019m talking to knows what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nAs a side note, your opinion as an Australian is valid in my opinion. I don\u2019t specifically know why but this seems like a topic that anybody can have a valid opinion of to me",

Trump also has requirements that I guess include using correct names for geographical locations. He\u2019s not prohibiting them from printing what they want or jailing them for printing something. Those would be first amendment violations. Trump, in general, gives plenty of press access and gives press conferences himself almost daily. I don\u2019t feel like, as a voter and a citizen, that he is restricting my access to the White House and what is going on. I feel like he\u2019s pretty transparent with his policies.",
