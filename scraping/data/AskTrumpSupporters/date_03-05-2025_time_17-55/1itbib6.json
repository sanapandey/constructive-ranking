The order in no way asserts that Trump alone decides what he can or can\u2019t do, or what powers he has \u2014 it asserts his Constitutional authority to direct one of those three branches. \n\nOn what the order *actually says*, the Constitution is clear. The Executive Authority of the United States is vested in the President \u2014 nobody else. All corners of the Executive Branch must report up through politically accountable leadership, and ultimately the President, as prescribed by the Constitution. Federal Officials with discretionary authority are responsible for faithfully implementing the President\u2019s policies for the Executive Branch, as communicated and directed through politically accountable leadership.",

            "body": "Just to make it clear for everyone, in no way does this executive order state that \"the President alone should have the power to decide what the President can or cannot do and what powers the presidency does or does not grant\" nor does it say that \"the current president gets to decide the powers of the president instead of the constitution\" nor is it saying that \"he can choose what the limits of presidential power are\".\n\nAny party stating otherwise has misread the order or is deliberately inerpreting it in a dishonest way, we have no way of knowing. It's telling that no media outlet or constitutional authority has interpreted this order that way.\n\nHere is the full text.\n\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\n\nSection 1. Policy and Purpose. The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws. Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties. In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President's ongoing supervision and control. The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people. This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.\n\nHowever, previous administrations have allowed so-called \"independent regulatory agencies\" to operate with minimal Presidential supervision. These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people. Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.\n\nThese practices undermine such regulatory agencies' accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law. For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people's elected President.\n\nTherefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials' accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch. Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register.\n\nSec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order:\n\n(a) The term \"employees\" shall have the meaning given that term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n(b) The term \"independent regulatory agency\" shall have the meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code. This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.\n\n(c) The term \"independent regulatory agency chairman\" shall mean, with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed independent regulatory agency, such agency's chairman, director, or other presiding officer.\n\n(d) The term \"head\" of an independent regulatory agency shall mean those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom the agencies' authorities are generally vested, encompassing the chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable, other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with responsibility for supervising such agencies.\n\nSec. 3. OIRA Review of Agency Regulations. (a) Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (\"Regulatory Planning and Review\"), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n\"(b) \"Agency,\" unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of the United States that is an \"agency\" under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), and shall also include the Federal Election Commission. This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy. This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.\".\n\n(b) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866. Agency submissions by independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of such implementation guidance.\n\nSec. 4. Performance Standards and Management Objectives. The Director of OMB shall establish performance standards and management objectives for independent agency heads, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and report periodically to the President on their performance and efficiency in attaining such standards and objectives.\n\nSec. 5. Apportionments for Independent Regulatory Agencies. The Director of OMB shall, on an ongoing basis:\n\n(a) review independent regulatory agencies' obligations for consistency with the President's policies and priorities; and\n\n(b) consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies' apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President's policies and priorities. Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such restrictions are consistent with law.\n\nSec. 6. Additional Consultation with the Executive Office of the President. (a) Subject to subsection (b), independent regulatory agency chairmen shall regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council, and the White House National Economic Council.\n\n(b) The heads of independent regulatory agencies shall establish a position of White House Liaison in their respective agencies. Such position shall be in grade 15 of the General Schedule and shall be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service.\n\n(c) Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to finalization.\n\nSec. 7. Rules of Conduct Guiding Federal Employees' Interpretation of the Law. The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President's supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch. The President and the Attorney General's opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties. No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General's opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General.\n\nSec. 8. General Provisions. (a) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\n\n(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n\n(c) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\n(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person",

You could easily flip around all your hypotheticals and they're far worse with agencies that don't answer to elected representatives.\n\nA bureaucrat could simply say \"No\" and refuse to implement a policy 99% of the public agrees on and is constitutionally mandated, or they could sabotage the implementation of duly elected laws they disagree with. \n\nThey could disagree that the candidate they opposed won an election and refuse to implement any of their orders, or refuse to recognize an election in a state they didn't have confidence in.\n\nWe can play what if all day, but objectively having MORE means of holding government accountable through elected representatives is BETTER for a functioning transparent democracy.\n\nThe democrats will understand that when it's their turn in power again. Right now their hatred of trump is clouding their judgement. They can be entirely reasonable as long as the Agent Orange factor isn't present.",

We've already discovered cases where federal agencies have paid money to groups that the state department opposed, actively undermining standing US policy. That's ridiculous, dangerous, and unacceptable.\n\nI don't agree that having these agencies answer directly to the people via elected representatives will undermine efficiency or productivity.\n\nIf you had another question I'm going to ask that you make it purely inquisitive with the intent to discover, not challenge the opinions of TS. As a NTS your role here is to ask questions from a neutral POV, not give your own opinion or soapbox. I've been ignoring it so far but it's getting excessive and if your comments were reported to me they would likely result in a ban. Thank you.",

Let's review what is actually changing with the governance of the following organizations named in 44 U.S. Code \u00a7 3502:\n\n* Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u00a0(Excluded)\n* Federal Election Commission\\* (Nice of him to casually slip this one in as an addition)\n* Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n* Consumer Product Safety Commission\n* Federal Communications Commission\n* Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n* Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n* Federal Housing Finance Agency\n* Federal Maritime Commission\n* Federal Trade Commission\n* Interstate Commerce Commission\n* Mine Enforcement Safety and Health Review Commission\n* National Labor Relations Board\n* Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n* Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission\n* Postal Regulatory Commission\n* Securities and Exchange Commission\n* Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection\n* Office of Financial Research\n* Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n* and any other similar agency designated by statute as a Federal\u00a0independent regulatory agency or commission.

Aren\u2019t you happy the President has never been given free license to have complete authority over the entire Executive branch? The checks and balances of our government surely shouldn\u2019t be literally divided between three separate branches like sports teams?",

The SEC and FCC, while agencies within the Executive branch, have tradtionally operated under \"multi-member commissions\" of \\~5 presidential \\*\\*nominees\\*\\* that to be approved by the Senate. They also submitted proposed changes to budget or regulatory measures to be approved by Congress by way of OMB. While the language of the EO doesn't say these commissions are somehow newly nested under OMB, it greatly epxands and redefines OMB's authority in several key ways that shift a great deal of power from either their independent operation or the checks and balances of the other branches. Just a few excerpts that really stand out:\n\n1. \"\\[commissions\\]...*shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register.\"*\u00a0\\- OMB and the President will now require they review and approve any regulatory changes proposed by the SEC and FCC, before Congressional review and before they can be enacted. This is a pretty significant change in practice, if not legally much different. The President is gaining far more authority over two domains he has serious conflicts in: Media and Communications, and... well, the SEC.\n2. *\u201cThe Director of OMB shall... consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies' apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President's policies and priorities.\u201d*\u00a0*-*\u00a0The President/OMB is not just pressuring how the SEC and FCC can decide what to regulate, they are now more directly dictating what funding they receive (or don't). This is, again, a large swing in precedent that previously included more checks and balances from the other branches.\n\nSo what does this all mean? I personally think it's a bad thing that commissions like these will now be pressured to align proposed changes and upkeep re: regulatory oversight and budget allocation with the desires of a President who has a ton to gain from \\*\\*not\\*\\* being regulated by the SEC and FCC. These \"'so-called' independent regulatory agencies\" have literally been more independent, bipartisan, and counter-balanced by other branches right up until this EO.\n\nRight wing, left wing, whatever: \\*\\*None of us should want the executive branch to have swelling authority over the governance of regulatory oversight\\*\\*. That is, unless you want to see DJT enjoy an unprecedented, less-and-less controllable position of authority?",

And trump himself is in the executive, and he is the executive, is he not? \n\nWouldn\u2019t that provision therefore provide him the ability to interpret any law he wants, in any way he wants? Meaning he can pick and choose which laws to enforce and which to ignore, not only as it pertains to the public, but also those that may attempt to place a limit on his own presidential power, no? \n\nIn other words, say Congress writes a law prohibiting a specific type of election interference. Would trump then be able to interpret that law any way he wishes, and then enforce, or not enforce that law any way he wants so long as his enforcement or lack thereof is in alignment with his own personal interpretation? \n\nI\u2019d love to be wrong on this, because it feels like, as written, to be a gross overreach of executive power.

I could have misunderstood the ruling but didn\u2019t SCOTUS recently rule that it is the judiciary that should be deciding that kind of thing?  Wouldn\u2019t that be somewhat at odds with this EO? \n\nIt also seems like the way Congress has been writing laws for decades is essentially delegating a good chunk of their power to the executive. They leave so much room for interpretation making it necessary for the various agencies to fill in the gaps for them. \nIt makes sense, though. Congress simply can\u2019t move fast enough to define all the minutiae and keep it up to date especially with such a hotly divided two-party system.  \n\nI\u2019ve always thought that was why Congress had to approve so many leadership positions and also why there are so many legal restrictions on how the president has historically been able to act with regard to certain agencies. \nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m explaining my thoughts very well but I\u2019m interested to see how it all plays out. \n\nDo you think there could be a better way for Congress to manage the definitions of the law so that the executive isn\u2019t creating so many pseudo laws through regulation?

Biden certainly had his fair share of absurd legal interpretations. \n\nYes, the espionage act was bad law when it was passed by the worst president in US history, Woodrow Wilson. It was abused then against political dissidents, it was abused for the past 20 years to go after whistleblowers, it was abused under Biden to go after Trump in unprecedented and completely novel ways. The espionage act should be interpreted in a very limited way, and probably should be removed from the US code all together. Anyone who defends the Espionage act as a piece of law is in my view an antidemocratic imperialist. \n\nThere is no law that gives birthright citizenship to illegal immigrants. There is an interpretation made by the supreme Court of the US constitution's fourteenth amendment in the late 1800's to apply the provision meant to give freed slaves US citizenship to apply to immigrants. People have assumed based on the wording of the decision that it applied to anyone in the US, despite the case in question dealing with the child of 2 legal immigrants, and it has not been tested since. This Supreme Court was also responsible for Dred Scott, so they did not make the best decisions, and we've overturned this court's reasoning in the past. Trump is allowed to interpret the law differently than past administrations since this is a fairly open question, and eventually the supreme court will have to weigh in to clarify the issue.",

Wade).\n\nIt's all really thanks to Biden for setting the precedent. For example, Trump is able to fire anybody in the Federal Government without wasting time in lawsuits due to [Spicer v. Biden/Severino v. Biden](https://aflegal.org/litigation/spicer-v-biden/).\n\nSome people did warn the Democrats back in 2021 about the trap they walked into:\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/biden-trump-severino-trap.html  \n\nThey just didn't expect Trump to win in 2024 and use the same precedent.  \n\nThe Severino v. Biden judgement states that the President has the authority to fire Presidential appointees at will.    \nSuch Presidential appointees have the authority to fire people under them so Severino really set the case for Trump to fire any employee at will by virtue of his executive powers.  \nThe EO only uses the same precedent to say that anyone in the Executive branch not in line with the President can and will be fired.  \n\nSame with DOGE - the way Obama's USDS was utilized and rebranded was a bit of legal checkmate too. He really has the most brilliant minds behind his actions this time.",

The President is the CEO.  \n\nThe CEO takes the advice and consent of the Board members of the company when hiring important people like the COO/CFO. The board is the senate, which currently is in favor of the CEO.\n\nAnd the house - well they kind of represent voting power of the shareholders. They can sue the company. The House has impeachment powers and the people have voting powers every 2 years.  \n\nSaying that the President cannot direct Presidental appointees to fire non-Presidential appointees does not pass the common sense test. The CEO cannot tell the Head of HR to fire certain employees for insubordination?  \n\nSure, those employees have certain rights depending on which state they're in, but as far as the Federal government is concerned, it follows at-will employment. And even with states that are not at-will - insubordination will get you fired almost anywhere.\n\nThe EO, I'm sure, aims to simplify the process of firing insubordinate employees by just citing this EO instead of following a wasteful bureaucratic process set up to stop Trump's agenda.\n\nI'd have cared more if there was similar noise and reporting when Biden fired Trump's appointees.",

Worked out quite well for Musk and his companies despite the media screeching about how like the entire Twitter staff got laid off.  X and xAI are collectively worth a lot more than Reddit right now.  \n\nGiven how many people Biden hired, and given how partisan and political the entire Fed machinery was during the last 4 years (added pronouns everywhere, all sorts of flags/awareness days/wokeism, straight up tried to force the 28th Amendment, etc.) it wouldn't be surprising if Biden's personnel hiring policy excluded hiring people who posted a photo in their family group chat wearing a MAGA hat some 10 years ago. The only two solutions to fixing this are to hire an equal number of MAGA hat wearing people or fire the people he hired. Given the party's fiscal conservative aspirations, it only makes sense to fire them.  \n  \nIt's a digital, fast moving world now. Federal employees don't have to arrive in DC by horse drawn carriages anymore. It's also a hyper partisan world - but the partisanship wasn't started by the Republicans.

This is made clear in your source...\n\n\"The problem with the executive order\u2019s definition.\n\nA person\u2019s \"sex,\" according to scientists, is not easily measured by one factor. Chromosomes, gonads, hormones and genitalia can all contribute to a person\u2019s sex categorization.\n\nAnd those determinants are not all clear at conception. Nor do they always add up to typical male or typical female anatomy.\"\n\nFrom the citation...\n\n\"The chromosomal sex of the embryo is established at fertilization. However, 6 weeks elapse in humans before the first signs of sex differentiation are noticed. Sex differentiation involves a series of events whereby the sexually indifferent gonads and genitalia progressively acquire male or female characteristics. Believed initially to be governed entirely by the presence or absence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, gonadal determination has proven to rely on a complex network of genes, whose balanced expression levels either activate the testis pathway and simultaneously repress the ovarian pathway or vice versa. The presence or absence of primordial germ cells, of extragonadal origin, also has a sexually dimorphic relevance. Subsequently, internal and external genitalia will follow the male pathway in the presence of androgens and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), or the female pathway in their absence.\nAs already mentioned, the gonadal ridges are bipotential until the 6th week after conception in humans, i.e. they have the capacity to follow the testicular and the ovarian pathways.\"\n\nDo you think gender is biological?",

They think that [even an abortion clinic under construction is determined to be an abortion clinic and will be treated as such by law](https://apnews.com/article/wyoming-abortion-clinic-fire-arrest-4524825ae149b37a677fbfe72ce76400)...now apply that logic to the fetus (the under construction human) perhaps.\n\nRegardless,   \nDo svidaniya",

The use of CEO to refer to heads of the executive branches predates their use in private corporate structure.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer#Origins  \n \nThere were no \"CEOs\" before America existed. Private company structure is based on state company law which is loosely based upon the constitution of the states which themselves are loosely based on the US Constitution which makes good use of \"executive\" and \"officer\" and \"chief\".  The rest of the world simply followed American corporate structure.    \n\nThe term \"chief executive officer\" was used in 1782 to refer to Governors of states and the President pretty much has the same powers over the federal executive branch as the governors have over the state executive branches.  You could swap out \"President\" for \"Federal Governor\" or \"US Governor\" or \"Chief Executive Officer of the United States\" and it would make just as much sense.  \n\nYou should do some research before asking such rhetorical questions.

Because a partisan SCOTUS could interpret the Constitution to give them more power than the status quo or original intent of the Constitution.  \n\nThe legislative branch has impeachment powers over both executive and judiciary, judiciary has powers over both legislative and executive, while the executive is the one really enforcing the powers of both of the branches. It's effectively a loop with no final authority really except for people and elections spread out over decades.  \n\nThe system relies upon people respecting the fundamental text of the Constitution. Activist judges (often overruled) are a significant vulnerability to this system because they create a feedback loop wherein crazier rulings lead to less authority and even crazier rulings.\n\nFor example, if the Republicans pack the SCOTUS with 12 more Justices all of whom who happen to be former Trump cabinet members (let's say 12 copies of Kash Patel but as a Supreme Court Justice), they could interpret Article 2 to be effectively useless and neuter a future Democrat President. But a Democrat Congress could just ignore by not impeaching the Democrat President. In this scenario the states still function as usual and keep elections going on because the Governors are not in on the craziness.  \n\nThat's why the First and Second Amendment exist as the final check over all giving the final enforcement to the People. It's one of the reasons why the President almost has the powers of an elected dictator, but the country does not turn into a dictatorship.  \n\nIn other countries especially parliamentary democracies, the chief executive usually reassigns or transfers executive officers to remote places or insignificant positions instead of firing them outright. Or often they just turn into quasi dictatorships especially in third world countries.  \n\n> executive branch beholden\n\nThe Federal executive officers are beholden to the US Constitution and Judicial Review is currently an \"implied power\" stemming from Article 3 and the only enforcement authority for that is impeachment by Congress because the enforcement of the judgement would rest with the Department of Justice which is part of the executive branch. There's various things the states could do as well depending on how close to a civil war they're willing to go.   \n\nSo far, the institution that is SCOTUS has been respected by everyone, but I could see a timeline in which the Democrats have packed the court with activist judges and the implied power is lost with increasingly partisan judges with both the President and Congress just ignoring it.\n\nI respect Kystern Sinema and Joe Manchin for preventing the Democrats from packing the courts. As far as the current status quo goes, SCOTUS is still the supreme authority over the Constitution with their implied, respected and enforced Judicial Review power.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Judicial_review  \n\n> The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution, is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents.\n\nWhen fundamentals like the Electoral College, First Amendment, Second Amendment, States' Rights,, etc. become a highly partisan issue...the court will start to lose authority even with Congress. For a real world example outside of gov, see the various medical institutions that have become highly partisan and have lost credibility - because they decided to cover up the origins of COVID or prevent debate on the efficacy of the COVID vaccine or rules.     \n\nDemocrats could pack the courts and the Republican Congress could just refuse to impeach Trump for violating enforcement of SCOTUS orders via the Department of Justice.",

Non-political my ass.    \n\nBiden set the precedent by firing a Presidential appointee who sued and got a judgement against him and made it easy for Trump to do the same without lawfare, period. That appointee was also serving a term, if you actually care to look up details.    \nIt would be unfair to Trump to reinstate Biden appointees while Trump appointees were fired for 4 years - if the original judgement against Severino was overturned then maybe the original Trump appointees should also be restored instead, no?  \n\nThe \"independent\" agencies like FTC, FCC, etc. rely on the sanctity of the two party system and whatever little bipartisanship in Congress that is left to have bipartisan commissions because the Constitution does not define political parties and it is only up to the Senate's advice-and-consent decree to enforce bipartisanship in those commissions. The significant erosion of bipartisanship really started under Obama, with the Democrats appointing increasingly partisan people and Harry Reid invoking the nuclear option to override GOP concerns.    \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats stopped bipartisan appointments to these independent agencies given how far they were willing to go to pack the courts, so much that Kystern Sinema and Joe Manchin had to leave the party itself.  \n\n> Are you genuinely saying that this is wholly consistent with past Presidential norms and that both sides do this to the same degree?\n\nThe presidential norm for this goes as far back as Lincoln or even Andrew Jackson.",

It was designed as a foundational framework, with the powers of the executive branch subject to checks and balances by both congress and the judiciary. Historically, these powers were expanded and retracted over numerous administrations by congress and the judiciary. In other words, our system is set up so that Aladdin can\u2019t unilaterally wish for more wishes.  \n\nSo, this executive order likely violates the separation of powers, improperly expands presidential authority, and undermines independent regulatory agencies. By subjecting agencies like the SEC, FTC, and CFPB to WH oversight, the order contradicts congressional intent, which established these agencies to operate autonomously and free from political influence. In statutory interpretation, courts consider the original intent of congress, and in this case, congress intentionally designed independent agencies to function outside direct presidential control.\u00a0SCOTUS precedents such as Humphries Executor v U.S. (1935) and Morrison v Olson (1988) affirm that congress has the power to insulate agencies from executive overreach, making this order an unconstitutional expansion of presidential power. Additionally, the order could violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\u00a0by imposing new executive review requirements that are not authorized by law. Furthermore, by centralizing regulatory oversight in the executive branch, the order threatens the neutrality and enforcement of financial and consumer protections, potentially turning independent agencies into partisan enforcement tools. Given these legal weaknesses, the order is vulnerable to judicial challenges, potential injunctions, and congressional pushback. Ultimately, this executive order represents an unconstitutional power grab\u00a0that disregards legislative intent\u00a0and should be struck down by the courts. \n\nThat said, with Trump controlling congress, and a SCOTUS that is politically conservative, he has a strong chance of getting what he wants. \n\nThis rapid-fire executive order strategy is meant to overwhelm the system - flooding the courts and political landscape with extreme actions to see what survives legal and legislative challenges. It\u2019s a \u201cshock and awe\u201d approach, straight out of Bannon\u2019s playbook.\n\nQuestion for the Trump supporters who are constitutional originalists\u2026 do you really think that the power which Trump is currently wielding  (regardless of what it accomplishes) was intended by the founding fathers? They historically have moved to limit, rather than expand executive branch power. Even Thomas\u2019 ruling in Trump v U.S. (2024) was widely seen a departure from this interpretation (because Thomas is an ardent originalist) and therefore more politically motivated.",

The Republican congress could give an entirely new classified agency to Trump and he could do whatever within it until it's discovered by the public. You really think I give a shit about procedure when pretty much none of the Marxist progressives give a shit about 1A/2A/10A or any laws relating to illegal aliens?  \nI'm lowkey hoping for the Supreme Court to classify Marxism as a religion and the LGBTQIAAAA21SP++ Pro Max flags as religious symbols so they can stay out of schools and government buildings forever.  \n\n>  do you really think that the power which Trump is currently wielding (regardless of what it accomplishes) was intended by the founding fathers\n\nI'm not sure if the answer to that question is relevant since they didn't intend for a lot of the things post FDR, or even post-1913.

But nobody is independent or non partisan in an age when Judges like Paul Engelmayer can restrict the Senate confirmed Scott Bessent from doing his own job by restricting his access to the Treasury systems.  \n\nCFPB has no oversight from anyone. It's an entirely unconstitutional agency.  And the FTC just helped bankrupt Spirit Airlines.  These 3 agencies simply exist so that Nancy Pelosi can do insider trading while her wall street friends can short companies before these agencies issue their rules or fines.",

Just work harder to convince people against Trump on Reddit as a digital soldier of the #resistance and maybe that'll help for 2028. Or maybe another lab leak and truckloads of ballots. \n\nWhite House is posting deportation ASMR and Trump King pictures. The executioner of DOGE just had his 13th kid out of wedlock and nobody gives a fuck.

Or if you are in support of Marxism then you're probably just gaslighting TS anyway. \n\nI'm quite young, would have called myself a socialist before Trump...but it seems pretty clear that the emotional blackmail to erode 1A, 2A, etc. is necessary because Marxism is incompatible with these \"individual rights\".  \n\n> While the Christian right, through Trump as their new JC, is trying to make public schools post the Ten Commandments in classrooms\u2026 and he is trying to direct federal funding to religious schools\n\nI'm not born Christian and I'm still not quite sure if I'm one but I respect them more than the others because I live in a Western society. When the other side unironically promotes Satan worship as their religion I'd like to side with the \"good\" guys.   \n\nI didn't care about all of the \"slippery slope\" warnings until 10 years passed and I realized that we're at the bottom of the slope with people unironically asking for pedos to have reduced sentences and what not.   \n\nUltimately the world as a whole is a lot less religious now (except for Islamists in the West - somehow more extreme than many Arabs in ME) so I don't think it is a fair comparison. Wokeism on the other hand...\n\nI consider large churches to be institutions like any other, and my respect for them is the same. Especially after USAID revealed their hand in human trafficking migrants with billions in taxpayer funding.    \n\nYou can say that the far left made me try to become religious again after my religious parents turned me atheist. So good job on that.    \n\nTrump is a New Yorker at heart and I really don't think he is religious at all. Vance has a Hindu wife. So I'm really not seeing the slope to Christian nationalism as you leftists like to put it. They respect secularism more than the Democrats who have no respect for Hindus and Christians both. And arguably they seem to be fine with the \"river to the sea\" crowd posting literal Nazi stuff on TikTok.  \n\n>  how deregulation would make America great again\u2026 just like in 2008\n\nIt's not about regulation or deregulation really. We all witnessed GME and naked shorting abuses under Biden. Now after 4 years of Biden, a majority of the trading happens in dark markets.  That change happened under the leadership of the same party as Warren, did it not?  \nGary Gensler pretending to care didn't help a single bit.  \nIt just seems clear that Wall Street has 2 factions - bulls and bears and the \"bears\" hoping on the downfall of humanity will do anything to make it happen. I'm not surprised Soros spent so much to resist Trump when Trump made him lose billions from shorting.  \nI hope Trump reforms the shitty Cede & Co system, makes DRS easier, and nukes CFTC & SEC with completely new people and forces FINRA to do their job.\nThese agencies are simply a tool for the big banks to pat themselves on their back. CFPB is a business harassment tool for Warren. Just because the CFPB and FTC do SOME good work doesn't mean they're excused. \n\nThey only exist as a facade for big institutions to say they're following the rules and occasionally pay small fines to keep up the facade - they seemed doing so necessary to keep the OWS crowd from waking up again. \n\nBut those same fines are quite large to smaller banks and businesses and only hurts them. Especially when a lot of them turn out to be based on no laws. These agencies operated like courts of equity/chancery but without the due process part.",

It is little known outside of academia and liberal news media, because people (especially on the right) simply don't care about being told something when it can be judged collectively by everyone on an individual basis. You will never see [criticisms of the NOMINATE](https://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-mismeasurement-of-polarization) BS on your news feed because the media itself is a major proponent of the far left ideology. \n\nMeanwhile Trump's position on things have remained [relatively unchanged since the 1980s](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/20/510680463/donald-trumps-been-saying-the-same-thing-for-30-years) - this fact a little unknown. His positions and views are more likely to align with the \"antifa\" that actually fought the Nazis than the communist terorrist group known as antifa today.\n\n> democrats would cover everything in Europa \n\nEurope's welfare and far-left aspirations are solely due to the United States policing the world and massively spending on military, while benefiting from unfair trade deals, regulations and trade deficits. Europe's [arrogance and hypocrisy](https://www.nysun.com/article/europeans-laughed-at-trump-over-russian-gas-no-longer) are the sole reason for their current situation with Russia. \n\nIt's unfortunate but the Europeans haven't realized that America has already moved past just \"left/right\" and we have an entire political compass (r/PoliticalCompassMemes). Europe would be \"AuthLeft\"...in line with Communism. What you people call \"far right\" are more in line with \"LibRight\" or Libertarianism which is in favor of free speech and not against it. [There are people being arrested for silently praying outside abortion clinics in Europe](https://reason.com/2024/10/17/british-man-convicted-of-criminal-charges-for-praying-silently-near-abortion-clinic/) - which goes against not just freedom of speech but also freedom of religion.\n\n> Any source for this?\n\nMy advice would be to join less-censored platforms (unlike Reddit) and let your own brain decide if society in general is rightward or towards the far left.  \n\nI think the Communists would have succeeded in their mission if it wasn't for their leftist suicidal empathy for Hamas terrorists - that made free Palestine synonymous with Hamas and then the Hamas supporters started posting calls for another Holocaust. The bipartisan TikTok ban in America wasn't over the communist China ties (for the Democrats)...[it was over the free palestine stuff](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-tiktok-ban-linked-israel-china-insiders-reveal). \n\nAccording to your world view, I am far right...The media constantly publishes news articles about so called far right organizations like \"Patriot Front\" - except that I have never come across any of their stuff personally nor on social media. They wear masks (which only leftists do - right wing protests never have masks), all of them look fit (like they all would pass fitness checks for law enforcement) and so on. Common people [see through this BS](https://x.com/search?q=patriot%20front%20fed) trying to pass off some shadowy groups as far right. Most of what was left of the Democrats and left wing was funded by taxpayers across the West using foreign aid and grants - you will see a rapid rightward shift everywhere now those funds have been cut off because the media propagandists won't get paid to keep up the illusion anymore.",

There seems to be some confusion among some people on what authorities the President has, over which subjects, and the lengths that the President can affect them.  They seem to think that it is a vague subject.  Basically, if it is a department that falls under the Executive Branch, the President has almost full control of it (notice I said \"almost\", for the lawful-evil lawyers out there), and takes responsibility for them.\n\nBut, everyone is burying the lead on this.  To use another euphemism, they can't see the forest for the trees.  This actually *limits* the power of the Executive Branch.\n\nUp until now (and you may have heard rumblings about it underneath the everyday cacophony) the various agencies in the Executive Branch had unmitigated power.  The FDA absolutely controls what substances are legal, and how long the process to approve them takes.  The FBI, CIA, and ATF are just allowed to run amuck.  The EPA can levy incredibly heavy fines, and/or shut down entire companies or industries, without there being a day in court over the matter.  This is abuse.  This is authoritarian.  It can be leveraged and politicized.\n\nTo use parlance that Liberals seem to understand, none of these people are elected, either.\n\nAnd that is how the Executive Branch has been acting for the past 35 years.  Completely unchecked.  No one taking responsibility for anything.  Waco?  Naw.  Ruby Ridge?  Naw.  Deploying our military to destroy far away places and die in useless conflicts for decades?  Naw.\n\nThis Executive Order changes that.  It says that it is the President's authority and responsibility (and the Attorney General's, as well as anyone they deputize for the task) to decide how the Executive Branch functions under our Constitution and laws - not anyone else, including departments within the Executive Branch itself - and the other two branches of our government are there to check that.\n\nThe key word here is \"*responsibility*\".  It is saying that the President, and those who he imparts authority to, can do this stuff, but they will also be held responsible.  It seems like what is meant by that is a bit more than just being able to vote-out that President every four years.",

Every agency was created by Congress, whose members are elected by the people to be the voice of the people. These agencies operate under congressional oversight, meaning they are accountable to the legislative branch, which has the power to modify, defund, or dissolve them if necessary - if it is the will of the people. \n\nMoreover, agencies are given rule-making authority precisely to avoid the inefficiencies of excessive bureaucracy - the very red tape that all of us oppose. They are staffed by experts in their fields, not politicians, ensuring that regulations are based on technical knowledge rather than political maneuvering.\n\nThis is fundamentally different from a president granting an unelected official the unilateral power to mass-fire federal employees. Unlike agencies created through legislation and subject to congressional oversight, handing unchecked authority to a single official bypasses constitutional checks and consolidates executive power in a way that directly undermines democratic governance. Dismissing agencies as \u201cundemocratic\u201d while advocating for unchecked executive purges is not only inconsistent but also far more dangerous to the balance of power.",

In pragmatic reality, what actually ends up happening is that you get one faceless agency \"answering\" to another faceless committee.  Strongly-worded letters are sent.  No one is held accountable at all. We have seen this happen repeatedly, over and over, every single time.  I cited some examples above.\n\nSince not one person oversees and is responsible for just one thing, there is Spiderman finger-pointing and [three monkeys](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.07a24c3f647acf7b5524eb64c3977d15?rik=2EHiXeo7qEkipw&riu=http%3a%2f%2fimages4.fanpop.com%2fimage%2fphotos%2f14700000%2fSee-no-evil-hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil-monkeys-14750406-1600-1200.jpg&ehk=75Isa7O3UzCv01asN4SWSOuPTaXlBR7d3cW%2f%2fEe91%2bA%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0) all over the place.  Sure, there are hearings in front of Congress probably every single day about something or other, but nothing ever comes of them.  And, based on who is in charge of these Congressional hearings, these subjects automatically become political.\n\nI'll submit the January 6th hearings as a prime example.  Very political in who was selected to be on the committee, and what evidence was allowed to be heard publicly, and whether such Robert's Rules as hearsay and perjury were going to be taken seriously (Cassidy Hutchinson).  Oh, and the primetime televised \"emergency session\" that everyone needed to see.  And, yet, nothing came of any of it - either way.  Useless all around.\n\nRand Paul has repeatedly pointed out how the \"expert\" Dr. Fauci - the highest-paid government employee at the time - had perjured himself in front of Congress by lying about gain-of-function.  Dr. Fauci also lied about the [six-foot social distancing rule being based in science, and that masks are effective](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jun/06/did-fauci-say-he-made-up-covid-19-rules-on-social/).  The Covid shot will protect you from contracting and transmitting Covid.  He used [poll numbers to determine herd-immunity](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/531611-fauci-herd-immunity-could-require-90-percent-of-country-to-be-vaccinated/).  Nothing happened.  He retired as a very wealthy man.\n\nThe Twitter Files.  Nothing happened.\n\nOperation Fast and Furious - aka \"The Gunwalking Scandal\".  Nothing happened - except the whistleblower was fired.\n\nThe last time that I can remember anything of substance coming out of a Congressional hearing is when Oliver North was arrested for the Iran Contra debacle - in the 1980s.\n\nWell, I stand corrected.  The scandal around Crossfire Hurricane did see the upper echelon of the FBI get removed after those hearings.  McCabe, Brennan, Strozk, Page (Lisa), etc.  But, I don't think that Congress had anything to do with that.  I think that was more along the lines of the FBI jettisoning trash in order to save itself from sinking.\n\nReally, this should have happened back when [Clinton, Gore](https://youtu.be/RMBUuabroiY?t=59), and [Obama](https://youtu.be/LtoqHGbO7Ow?t=275) first proposed these actions to happen.  Ironically, it was Obama's US Digital Services that Trump revamped into DoGE, in order to be doing the things that he is doing now - because it wasn't happening before.",

You have no idea what you're talking about. This EO doesn't say Trump is the sole person in government who can interpret law. It says the president is the only one that can interpret law for the executive branch; the executive agencies cannot interpret it for themselves, especially where it contravenes the president's agenda (see ICE immediately after DACA was issued).\n\nJudicial review still applies. If the executive branch does something unconstitutional SCOTUS can still step in, and Congress can still pass legislation. The Constitution clearly establishes that the powers of the executive branch are vested in the president. This EO just makes it clear policy for all executive branch agencies that have acted semi-independent and requires them to report to the office of the president for accountability. The objections to this EO are all based on fundamental misunderstandings of the Constitution.\n\n> If the Supreme Court doesn't have the power to override and put a stop to what trump did because of this EO\n\nThe Supreme Court still has unquestioned power to determine the constitutionality of executive actions.\n\nHowever, if your question is what happens when there is an impasse, I'll note that historically the SCOTUS hasn't had any enforcement ability; see Andrew Jackson or Joe Biden. Biden famously bragged about pushing through loan forgiveness in violation of the SCOTUS and nothing happened.\n\nHowever, this EO doesn't give the president more powers than are already outlined in the Constitution and doesn't diminish the powers of the courts or the legislature.",

But even in the absence of any official declaration of War by the US government, Congress has typically authorized military interventions or escalations of military interventions amounting to war such as in Vietnam, Kuwait, the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq. Of course not all military interventions were conducted with such congressional authorizations.\n\nIt seems to me there is a fine, but important distinction here between having authority over a subordinate and having absolute authority over that subordinate. So it begs the question about scenarios where a member of the Executive receives a directive from the White House or the Attorney General that certain parts of the law are (interpreted to be) no longer applicable - whatever they maybe - then the subordinate maybe forced to act against his/her better judgement and execute on orders that are patently illegal.\n\nAgain does it not seem similar to the \"F\u00fchrerprinzip\", i.e. the idea that absolute obedience trumps the autonomous ability of any individual member of the government to exercise their own judgement. Isn't this contradictory to the more traditionally idea of governance that authority is delegated from above to subordinate entities and that the subordinate entity is required to report back to the entity from which power is delegated?",
