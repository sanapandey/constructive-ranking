    "selftext": "[Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-expansion-of-american-timber-production/)\n\n> The United States has an abundance of timber resources that are more than adequate to meet our domestic timber production needs, but heavy-handed Federal policies have prevented full utilization of these resources and made us reliant on foreign producers.  Our inability to fully exploit our domestic timber supply has impeded the creation of jobs and prosperity, contributed to wildfire disasters, degraded fish and wildlife habitats, increased the cost of construction and energy, and threatened our economic security.  These onerous Federal policies have forced our Nation to rely upon imported lumber, thus exporting jobs and prosperity and compromising our self-reliance.  It is vital that we reverse these policies and increase domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security.",

Federal lands are jointly managed with the state within which they reside. California decided that a hands off approach was better and they paid for it, in terms of forest burned, risk to human life and property, and risk to game and fish.\n\n>Do you think the 'run free' thing may have anything to do with the SC fires happening now?\n\nAbsolutely.

Does your information differ? If so, can you share?\n\n> Setting up a managed forest depends on several factors, including the size of the land, tree species, climate, and the level of management intensity. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the timeline:\n\n> 1. Planning & Site Preparation (6 months \u2013 2 years)\n\n> Land assessment (soil, water, biodiversity)\n\n> Defining management goals (timber, conservation, carbon credits)\n\n> Obtaining permits & regulatory approvals\n\n> Clearing invasive species and preparing the soil\n\n\n> 2. Planting & Initial Growth (1 \u2013 5 years)\n\n> Selecting and sourcing tree species\n\n> Planting (seedlings or direct seeding)\n\n> Establishing infrastructure (roads, firebreaks)\n\n> Early maintenance (watering, weeding, pest control)\n\n\n> 3. Canopy Closure & Mid-Term Management (5 \u2013 20 years)\n\n> Trees start competing for light; thinning may be required\n\n> Wildlife habitat and biodiversity increase\n\n> Carbon sequestration starts becoming significant\n\n> Potential for some early returns (e.g., thinning for firewood, small-scale harvesting)\n\n\n> 4. Maturity & Sustainable Harvesting (20 \u2013 100+ years)\n\n> Trees reach commercial or ecological maturity\n\n> Selective harvesting can begin (depends on species & goals)\n\n> Continuous monitoring and replanting for sustainability\n\n\n> Total Timeline for a Functional Managed Forest:\n\n> Short-term (5\u201310 years): Forest starts becoming self-sustaining.\n\n> Medium-term (20\u201350 years): Significant ecosystem benefits and economic returns.\n\n> Long-term (50+ years): Full ecological and commercial maturity.\n\n\n> If you\u2019re looking at fast-growing species like eucalyptus or hybrid poplar, you can start harvesting in as little as 10\u201315 years. However, for hardwood species (oak, teak, mahogany), full maturity can take 50\u2013100+ years.\n\n> What\u2019s your goal\u2014timber production, conservation, carbon credits, or something else?",
