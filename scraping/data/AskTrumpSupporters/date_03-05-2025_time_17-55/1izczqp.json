    "selftext": "I\u2019ve noticed that many on the left tend to lump all Trump supporters into the category of \u201cclimate change deniers who think scientists are part of a conspiracy\u201d But after browsing this subreddit, I see that some of you are concerned about climate change\u2014you just disagree with how the left approaches the issue. Some have even criticized Trump for ignoring it or actively working against certain initiatives.\n\nSo, I wanted to start a discussion on this. Here are a few questions that come to mind. No need to answer all\u2014just share your thoughts on whatever resonates with you, and explain your reasoning:\n\n\t\u2022\tDo you think climate change is real?\n\n\t\u2022\tDo you believe human activity, particularly CO2 emissions, is contributing to it?\n\nIf yes:\n\n\t\u2022\tDo you disagree with how the left is trying to address climate change? If so, why?\n\n\t\u2022\tAre there things you wish Trump would handle differently on this issue?\n\n\t\u2022\tWhat do you think are the best strategies to ensure future generations have access to similar resources and opportunities than we do? \n\n\t\u2022\tDo you think the free market can solve climate issues better than government intervention? Why or why not?\n\n\t\u2022\tAre there any climate policies you support or would be open to if they were structured differently?\n\n\t\u2022\tWhat role do you think energy independence (oil, gas, nuclear, renewables) should play in addressing climate concerns?\n\nCurious to hear your perspectives!",

            "body": "> \u2022 Do you think climate change is real? \n\nYes, very much so.\n\n>\u2022 Do you believe human activity, particularly CO2 emissions, is contributing to it? If yes: \n\nI do, in large part I think the carbon emissions from the mass transit of goods is in large part to blame, plus the lack of restrictions in third world countries.\n\n>\u2022 Do you disagree with how the left is trying to address climate change? If so, why? \n\nYes. Forcing people to buy electric cars they don't want? Mass implementation of technology before it's ready? Not good. I, personally, drive a plug-in hybrid. I love it. I think a lot of the stuff being done in the US goes overboard. There is a lot we can do, but it needs to be done at the local level. Encourage local farmers, encourage grocery stores to promote locally produced goods, things like that. \n\n>\u2022 Are there things you wish Trump would handle differently on this issue? \n\nI would like to see him address it more, especially when he does things that appear contrary.\n\n>\u2022 What do you think are the best strategies to ensure future generations have access to similar resources and opportunities than we do? \n\nSorry, I answered a little of this above. I think encouraging STEM and research into alternative energy sources is important. \n\n>\u2022 Do you think the free market can solve climate issues better than government intervention? Why or why not? \n\nI do, I believe in small federal government, I prefer there to be broad general guidelines that state and local governments \"fine tune\" to fit their areas. \n\n>\u2022 Are there any climate policies you support or would be open to if they were structured differently? \n\nI like the rebates for electric and hybrid vehicles. I liked Obama's beater-car trade in program. I would like to see more investment into clean energy shipping, and I would love us to participate in cleaning the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\n>\u2022 What role do you think energy independence (oil, gas, nuclear, renewables) should play in addressing climate concerns?\n\nI think energy independence is extremely important, especially because income generated from it encourages research.",

I cannot say how much impact man has it, I can only say that when the people telling us the world is going to be underwater in five years if we don't stop driving cars fly around in private jets and sail private yachts from their beach front mansions all around the world to tell us we're not sacrificing enough, well, I feel like they're not nearly as concerned about it as they want to pretend they are.\n\nWhat I do know is that apparently we're 100 or so years into a polarity shift that will take 1,000 years to complete, at the peak of which our atmosphere will only be at about 10% strength, so if that's true that would explain a lot.\n\nDespite this, I am fully on board with green initiatives - within reason.  Fear mongering, pushing paranoia and doom-saying to scare people - nuh-uh, that shit don't fly with me.  They've been literally doing this shit for over 100 years now, starting by claiming we were on our way to a second ice age, then global warming, and now just calling it \"climate change.\"  After years of them swearing we were just five more years away from annhilation, and constantly watching that deadline move back, yeah, no, I ain't buying that shit.",

And not by subsidizing industries like wind and solar. They subsidized Geo-thermal heat pumps before that and it was all the craze until the money ran out and now no one installs those systems anymore. So not by forcing money into 1 or 2 industries, but by rewarding advancements and upgrades with tax credits or something. \n\n7: No I can't think of any climate change relate policies that do anything productive. \n\n8: Energy independence is crucial, period. As a side benefit of this crucial goal, the environment will be easier to protect and better protected. Add in what I said previously about innovation and this multiplies the benefit.",

If so, why?\n    Yes I do - I do not belive we can legislate our way out of climate change (too little too late).  I don't think the \"Green new deal\" is about being green but is more about control.  I don't think killing oil and natural gas is going to help.  Locally, the left has opposed a bio-fule power plant - BIO FUEL - its literllay CO2 NOT from fossile sources, does not increase the worlds CO2 content as long as we're growing the fuel, this would have been far better than the petrolium generators it would have replaced (Hawaii Island), and the objection was for CO2 emissions WTF?!!  Forcing EV's isn't sane - the power grid isn't ready, locally its mostly fossil fueled generators, the nearly 50% transmission line losses, it doesn't help.  I've been solar and/or wind powered at home for going on 20 years now in 3 homes - we started this effort to reduce our carbon footprint.  Its not feasable for me to charge an electric vechicle that can replace my vehicles - the cost would be over $40K in equipment in addition to the vehicle - not feasable, and if its impractical on the micro scale (without line losses, etc) it doesn't make sens on the grid scale either.   The war on gas stoves was just stupid IMO - electric heating is way less efficient.  The lef'ts methods to address CO2 are NUTS!\n    \n    >Are there things you wish Trump would handle differently on this issue?\n    I wish he wasn't opposed to wind power.\n    \n    >What do you think are the best strategies to ensure future generations have access to similar resources and opportunities than we do?\n    Develop Neuclear power.  Teach people to be energy responsible (being self sufficient has shown us where and how to be efficient, others can learn this without going off grid if they spend time to educate and inform themselves).  Continue to develop battery technology.  Identify domestic soures for critical minerals for this and other technology.\n    \n    >\u2022Do you think the free market can solve climate issues better than government intervention? Why or why not?\n    Government is netoriously bad at doing things economically.  If we don't want the costs to go out of control, we need to find a balance and policies that encourage free market solutions and not force people to where they don't want to be.\n    \n    \u2022Are there any climate policies you support or would be open to if they were structured differently?\n    Maybe - but I don't know what they are.  I don't want anything to do with the Paris Accords, and so far left policies have a poor track record for being effective nor affordable.\n    \n    \u2022What role do you think energy independence (oil, gas, nuclear, renewables) should play in addressing climate concerns?\n    I think energy independance is essential first then do what we can to reduce CO2, as long as the rest of the world (i.e. China) is doing so as well - otherwise its a wasted effort.",

            "body": "A little more than a hundred years ago we had a strong scientific consensus on the efficacy of a scientific theory. Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H.G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California. These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort. All in all, the research, legislation, and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant.\n\nThat theory was eugenics. The work got done. Millions died. Lesson obviously not learned.\n\nPolitics should stay out of science.",

Science does not cease to exist without government. Government should not be the driver and the funding for science.\n\n>For the first of OP's questions, do you believe climate change is real?\n\nI do believe that the climate changes and that happened well before human's existed. I do not believe that making government more wealthy (carbon tax) or making government more powerful (carbon exchange) will deter climate change. I also do not think that wrecking the present to save the future is a good strategy.",

Climate change exists in natural pretexts to, this is true, but there\u2019s a lot of hard evidence of the effects humans have had on the environment. The effects of climate change and its deterrence are felt in the present and the future. Air quality control laws for instance inarguably prevent many of the blights on society that were felt with the introduction of factories in the 1800s in high density places like London.

There is evidence that carbon gas raises temperatures in a hermetically sealed box in a lab. There is no experiment that falsifies that hypothesis with an atmosphere sealed globe surrounded by an absolute zero vacuum. The rest of it is all sketchy computer models predicting the future.\n\n>Air quality control laws for instance inarguably prevent many of the blights on society that were felt with the introduction of factories in the 1800s in high density places like London. \n\nHumans thrived during this terrible air quality problem. In 1600 the world population was 500 million people. In an air pollution free agrarian age the population doubled to 1 billion. For the next 200 years, through the worst of the pollution, the world population increased  to 6 billion. The benefits of the industrial activity that allowed medical innovation, better hygiene, etc.  far outweigh the negatives.",
