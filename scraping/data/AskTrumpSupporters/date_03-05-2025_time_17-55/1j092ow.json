The small batch of documents included copies of flight logs from Epstein\u2019s private plane, which have long been available in multiple court cases, and a heavily redacted photocopy of an address book purportedly compiled by Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell, which has been cited in media accounts for many years.\"\n\nThe House Judiciary GOP even [rick-rolled their twitter followers](https://newrepublic.com/post/192117/gop-rick-rolls-jeffrey-epstein-files).\n\nDo you think there is an ongoing coverup of Epstein? By whom, and why?\n\n----\n\nedit: I did not tag this 'Israel'.  I don't think post submitters can submit tags.\n\n----\n\nedit: Could this have something to do with that time [Trump said he might keep the Epstein file sealed - \"you don\u2019t know, you don\u2019t want to affect people\u2019s lives if it\u2019s phony stuff in there, because it\u2019s a lot of phony stuff with that whole world.\"](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fox-news-edited-trump-saying-205750634.html)?\n\nFox edited this part of the answer out of their televised interview, but it's available in the full version.

Even I defended him early on until I couldn\u2019t anymore. Having to come to terms with something negative about someone you\u2019re actively rooting for is difficult. There was this obvious elephant stomping around the room and many dems, myself included, were in denial and kept looking in every other direction instead of just acknowledging the elephant. This seems to be happening right now. \n\nI mean, think of Epstein dying while Trump was president. Think of Trump\u2019s incredibly suspicious answer [this interview](https://youtube.com/shorts/ZJorAVgHy7Y?si=nYCkfM54FFWV6JU9). Think of Epstein saying Trump was his [good friend for years](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-jeffrey-epstein-tapes). Think of [Epstein describing the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s White House](https://youtu.be/f3KIO6VfxpU?si=XpUZDlF8mlt1Hrpv) implying that he was still friends with Trump when he was still president in his first term. Think of the completely bizarre releasing of these documents. Think of the fact that Trump rarely brings up Epstein despite being a focus of many of his supporters. Is it really the case that this is all made up deep state lies and fake news? I mean there\u2019s a very very clear through line here. Do you think this might be MAGA\u2019s elephant?

                            "body": "A lot of it stems from the career and strange death of ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s father, Robert Maxwell. He had a long running feud with Pulitzer winning journalist seymour hersh. Hersh wrote a book or two detailing maxwells early career and connections with efforts to clandestinely arm a nascent israeli nation. Maxwell fought him in court with considerable resources and won a few cases in Britain but not in the US. Upon the explosion of a particular story in British media, Robert Maxwell was found dead in the Mediterranean after having allegedly fallen from his yacht, Ghislaine. His funeral was a full Israeli state funeral on the Mount of Olives and was attended by the PM and the president of Israel, along with the current and 6 former heads of the Mossad. His eulogy included thanks for his extraordinary service to the state.  Epsteins connections to high powered jews, particularly at the beginning of his very strange career, along with his long time partnership with apparent Mossad royalty form the root of the story but it\u2019s about high society and finance, so things aren\u2019t always so A \u2014> B. It\u2019s extremely complex and there is a lot of dubious thought circulating around it but i think the basic facts are pretty inescapable. \n\nId recommend the hersh book, The Samson Option (about the nuclear arming of Israel). Gordon Thomas\u2019s book, Robert Maxwell, Israeli Superspy. \n\nI\u2019d recommend the 5 hour martyrmade podcast on the topic if you like audio. https://open.substack.com/pub/martyrmade/p/epstein-the-full-series-pts-1-3?r=7wbqz&utm_medium=ios\n\nThe podcast gets much more into the ghislaine and epstein connection but i think the Maxwell legacy is very important to the story as well",

There was this obvious elephant stomping around the room and many dems, myself included, were in denial and kept looking in every other direction instead of just acknowledging the elephant. This seems to be happening right now.\n\nI mean, think of Epstein dying while Trump was president. Think of Trump\u2019s incredibly suspicious answer [this interview](https://youtube.com/shorts/ZJorAVgHy7Y?si=nYCkfM54FFWV6JU9). Think of Epstein saying Trump was his [good friend for years](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-jeffrey-epstein-tapes). Think of Epstein [describing the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s White House](https://youtu.be/f3KIO6VfxpU?si=XpUZDlF8mlt1Hrpv) implying that he was still friends with Trump when he was still president in his first term. Think of the completely bizarre releasing of these documents. Think of the fact that Trump rarely brings up Epstein despite being a focus of many of his supporters. Is it really the case that this is all made up deep state lies and fake news? \n\nForget all the dirt actually. Let\u2019s pretend for a second that any potential dirt on Trump has been destroyed or something. Do you feel that there\u2019s a clear through line here? Do you think this might be MAGA\u2019s elephant? Genuine question.",

What if that\u2019s happening now but in the other direction?

Even I defended him early on until I couldn\u2019t anymore. Having to come to terms with something negative about someone you\u2019re actively rooting for is difficult. There was this obvious elephant stomping around the room and many dems, myself included, were in denial and kept looking in every other direction instead of just acknowledging the elephant. This seems to be happening right now.\n\nI mean, think of Epstein dying while Trump was president. Think of Trump\u2019s incredibly suspicious answer\u00a0[this interview](https://youtube.com/shorts/ZJorAVgHy7Y?si=nYCkfM54FFWV6JU9). Think of Epstein saying Trump was his\u00a0[good friend for years](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-jeffrey-epstein-tapes). Think of Epstein\u00a0[describing the ins and outs of Trump\u2019s White House](https://youtu.be/f3KIO6VfxpU?si=XpUZDlF8mlt1Hrpv)\u00a0implying that he was still friends with Trump when he was still president in his first term. Think of the completely bizarre releasing of these documents. Think of the fact that Trump rarely brings up Epstein despite being a focus of many of his supporters. Is it really the case that this is all made up deep state lies and fake news?\n\nDon't you think that there\u2019s a clear through line here? Do you think this might be MAGA\u2019s elephant?
