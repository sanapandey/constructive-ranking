    "selftext": "Im a supporter but I'm looking at this as more a land grab and an opportunity for trump to make money for himself and his family by building hotels and resorts. I feel like this is a conflict of interest. One of the reasons I didn't like Harris is she seemed like she wanted to keep sending money to Israel. BUT how is this different? We will be sending billions there if it's approved instead of rebuilding our infrastructure. Why don't we invest in tool and dye and other factories that were sent over seas years ago instead of making resorts in Israel. I'm 60. I've been watching the Palestinians fight for their land forever. The US taking over Gaza is not going to make the conflict go away. The US investing more into Israel isn't making the US stronger. It's just lining pockets of people who already have money. The Middle East countries have said many times they want 2 states, Palestine and Israel. Not just one giant Israel. Jordan doesn't want to take in Palestinians. Pretty soon Israel will try to take over Jordan. Its tiny. Only about the size of Michigan. Please help me to understand the logic here and to not make me sorry I voted for trump, because to me this seems like a conflict if interest. ",

It is easily his biggest negative for me.\n\nOne of his biggest essential donors is a father/daughter combo that pretty much paid to have him move the embassy last time.  He is beholden to his donors on this one.\n\nI have no idea what he would be doing without the influence.  This isn't a win for him with me, but I fully expected something like this.\n\nIn this case he is likely just doing what his donors requested.\n\n\n....and before anyone suggests in a vacuum that having a single bad position means I should vote for someone that I disagree with 90% because they don't have this one position....

No other country on earth would be expected to live next to a country that continually murders their people on a regular basis. So there\u2019s two options as I see it: the first is Gaza gets aid money to rebuild, Israel creates a naval blockade around the Gaza coast on the Mediterranean, builds a steel reinforced concrete wall around Gaza, establishes a Korean style DMZ, with accompanying minefield, establishes a permanent military presence around that wall, installs ground movement sensors to detect tunnel building, establishes 24/7 air patrol to monitor ground movements and warn against aerial attacks such as on 10/7, and imbeds Mossad agents to develop a surveillance network within Gaza or just establishes another military occupation of the strip. The second option is to do what every single other country and civilization on earth has done when it conquers a country, and takes the land for its own use and since assimilation is impossible, it has to relocate people. I don\u2019t like that idea, but I like the idea of my brothers and sisters, AND the peaceful Israeli Arabs and Israeli Christians being slaughtered even less, and many of whom did on 10/7.\n\nYou can call it a land grab and if Trump profited off of this I\u2019d be very disappointed, but the fact is life isn\u2019t pretty, tough decisions must be made, and the greater good must be served, and it\u2019s not served by offering up innocent people\u2019s lives to some post modern, leftist notion of \u201canti colonialism\u201d.\n\n- Every downvote equals 1 lib that got their fee fees hurt by what I said.

There\u2019s no way the Dems could have given him a pass and still maintained the thin veneer of fairness they think people still believe exists. Menendez was the sacrificial offering to try and maintain that appearance. Let\u2019s talk about Hunter Biden, who broke, among others, federal firearms laws (for which I think he shouldn\u2019t even have been charged bc they\u2019re unconstitutional) those laws the left LOVES suddenly wanted to give him a pass. Biden used intel officials and the media to lie and claim the laptop was \u201ca right wing conspiracy\u201d until they couldn\u2019t anymore and he had to give him up to maintain the facade and even then, he got him a sweetheart deal that would\u2019ve gone unnoticed until the judge dove into it and yanked the deal. Then it looked like he was going to prison, then what happened? Oh, Biden pardoned him after lying for months that he wouldn\u2019t, and then Dems went from criticizing Trump for pardons for his sons that he didn\u2019t even give to making excuses for why Biden pardoned his, and everyone else he ever met. \n\nWhen a democrat is held to account it\u2019s strictly because it\u2019s necessary to avoid a loss of support because the corruption is so blatantly obvious. And this isn\u2019t to say the GOP is any better or at least not historically. Two sides of the same corroded, slimy coin.",

Getting bad mouth from other people is not that important comparing to saving lives.  It's not about flip flop. The reason you think that way is because you use a blank generalization for every issue, in practice, nuances matter. It's not a yes/no question.",

It was wild to watch as an outsider from the MAGA movement as everything was reduced to basic, simple slogans to get people on board\u2026but in reality, us non MAGA were saying THESE AREN\u2019T VIABLE SOLUTIONS\u2026things are more nuanced! The response we get is always very generalized, very basic, very black and white. Democrats are constantly scrutinized about their messaging because they tend to explain things in complexity that doesn\u2019t resonate. I just have to admit, it\u2019s all very confusing to watch Trump supporters live on both sides of the fence, now saying no, it\u2019s actually more nuanced. Maybe that\u2019s just the winning philosophy? Simple messaging and then care not when it looks like hypocrisy when put into practice?",
