This follows a recent visit from France's president, Emmanuel Macron.\n\nI always find these meetings interesting, more for the cultural significance if nothing else. \n\nI'm interested in how Trump supporters view these relationships, these visits and wider relationships with global leaders - in particular those of Europe.\n\nSo...\nWhat are your thoughts on these meetings? \nAre you happy with how Trump handles them?\nDo you think they influence Trump in any way?\nDo you care? Or is this just a distraction from national politics? \n\nThanks and have a nice day!\n \n",

Hopefully that makes some sense here.\n\nBut we will see what comes of things.  Generally speaking, a new leader spends a lot of time hosting other leaders.\n\nThere is always one thing that somewhat confuses me on these visits, but it's entirely minor.  What food is served?  Food is an excellent way of sharing culture and finding some common ground, and I'm a foodie, but I've always wondered if, for example, Zelensky would be treated to whatever passes for Ukrainian food in DC or if he was given a meal indicative of \"America\" (yeah, yeah, we can discuss exactly what that means, but let's do it in another post.  Is Trump offering these leaders a pile of hamberders a mile high or what?",

I assumed it's more of a fancy hotel kind of deal, with generic 'nice' food, probably leaning to french cuisine? Maybe with some wines/desserts from whichever country is visiting. \n\nA family member worked where GWB stayed when he was here and that's what the menu looked like. I don't have it on hand but I can probably dig it out if you're interested! I also have AF1 brand m&ms.",

I mean it went poorly for him in that he had to sit and get tag team berated by Trump and Vance, but if you sit and listen to the points that Vance is making and Trump is making...theres not much there. I mean their main gripe was that he wasn't saying Thank You enough it seems.\n\nIn terms of optics, I think it will be highly beneficial for Zelinksky...he looked like the adult in the room trying to talk about real issues. He scored a few little zinger points here and there as well.\n\nMy favorite part about politics is how 2 people can watch the same exact video clip and walk away with completely different opinions. We often talk about the red team and blue team, but I think the biggest difference is that sports fans usually are ok admitting that their team played poorly or that they are in a slump. Politics were always afraid to give up any ground or risk being called a shill or a RINO.",

He has not said how, but given his skepticism over aid to Ukraine, officials in Kyiv fear he will immediately cut off the flow of money and weapons and try to force a settlement on terms favorable to Moscow.\n\n> Ukraine had planned to sign an agreement to cooperate on extracting and processing minerals with the Biden administration.
