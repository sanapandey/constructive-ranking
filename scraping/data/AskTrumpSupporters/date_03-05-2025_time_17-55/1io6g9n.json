I recall several reps indicating they wouldn't cut Healthcare funding. Do we support cutting $800 billion from Healthcare services to fund other Trump agenda items? ",

Tell me more.\n\n>A key provision in former President Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0[Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.irs.gov/inflation-reduction-act-of-2022), negotiating Medicare drug prices, remains untouched for now. Last week, Medicare unveiled a list of prescription drugs up for negotiations next. They included\u00a0[Ozempic](https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/general-health/ozempic-2665708850.html)\u00a0and Wegovy, the popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs.\n\nSo, Trump actually *isn't* ending a push to slash prescription drug costs.  Okay.\n\nBut, what about,\n\n>A $35-a-month cap on\u00a0[insulin](https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/diabetes/everything-you-need-to-know-about-insulin)\u00a0costs and $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap on prescription\u00a0[drugs](https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/news/doacs-and-amiodarone-concomitant-therapy-increases-bleeding-risk-in-af/)\u00a0were not affected by the executive order signed Monday,\u00a0*NBC News*\u00a0reported.\n\nOh, good.  Trump's original plan (the one that Biden destroyed) also included epinepherine.  I hope that is included, too.  These two seem like really easy, affordable, and effective things to do.",

Btw in his last term, he did try to stand up to them with price transparency and capping insulin, the problem was EO are hard to enforce.\n\nHe didn\u2019t necessary run on protecting the elite uber-rich class. Did he not campaign on capping credit card interest rates? I expect him to do something good because he\u2019s responsive to his base. He doesn\u2019t have a consistent ideology, he just does whatever that makes him more popular. \n\nBtw not everything the uber-rich does is bad. I support foreign corporations and American corporations investing into America and creating thousands of new jobs which is what happened recently.",

Assuming $800B is for Medicaid is ridiculous.  Energy and Commerce is the largest committee and has everything from clean water, to food and drug safety, vehicle safety, tourism, foreign commerce.  This article is only fearmongering the readers.\n\nSo do we support cutting $800 billion from Healthcare services?  I support as much as there is fraud and excessive overhead.  If it's $10m or $2.7 trillion, I don't care.\n\nSource: [https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BU/BU00/20250213/117894/BILLS-119NAih.pdf](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/BU/BU00/20250213/117894/BILLS-119NAih.pdf)",

Additionally, one of the benefits to USAID buying these grains to send overseas was that if an immediate need for more grains occurred here in the US (such as a tree disease attacking fruit harvests this requiring supplementation in the supply chain), we would already have the stock and the output to use internally. Currently if something like that happened, wouldn't you think we might be in a tougher spot for some time?\n\nAlso, USAID was one of our greatest diplomatic assets. When foodstuffs were delivered to third world countries and areas that we wanted a diplomatic foothold, those bags of grains and food said USAID in bigger lettering than even WFP.

Farm subsidies often disproportionately benefit large, corporate farms, leading to farm consolidation, inflated land prices, and fewer jobs in rural areas, ultimately harming the economic diversity and stability of smaller rural communities.  They can also incentivize unsustainable farming practices that harm the environment, impacting the long-term viability of rural landscapes.  John Oliver had a piece on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI78WOW_u-Q\n\nHowever, farm subsidies are unlikely to be cut, given the clout that agricultural states have in the legislature.",

The money was likely already taxed when it changed hands. (ex. Income Tax)\n\nHowever, most rich people have assets and do spend money. If you own property you pay property tax. If you buy goods or services you pay sales tax. If you buy or sell equities like stock you pay capital gains tax when you realize the income.\n\nIt also should be noted that doing nothing with your money effectively causes it to depreciate by virtue of inflation. There is an incentive to utilize it.\n\nNow if you still wanted to tax wealthy people on top of that, then you have to make it painless or useful. \n\nI'm just spit-balling here, but what about a \"Sovereign Reserve Account\"? If you have large amounts of liquidity you're not using, you could park it in a government-backed product that guarantees protection from inflation. In exchange for this safeguard, the government would take a predetermined percentage of any interest earned above an inflation-protected baseline. This way, your funds maintain their real value, and any extra gains contribute to public profit. \n\nEh? Eh?",

Musk however is perhaps the worst of them all, having received taxpayer funded subsidies in the billions, and why I don't trust him to eliminate any actual bloat in our government.\n\nThanks for the reasonable discussion over universal healthcare, adjustment for population/inflation is necessary but I agree keeping an eye on it and altruistic accountability for anomalies is what we need.

Education and Workforce might be Medicaid - so $330B total there.  \n\n\"880\" - Oh here we go, under the Committee on Energy and Commerce.  $880B reduction of deficit for 2025 through 2034.\n\nSo the article's author is assuming 100% of that debt reduction is for Medicaid, nothing for the rest of the Energy and Commerce.  That includes Biomedical research, food drug device safety, environmental protection, clean air and climate change, water, toxic chemicals, energy policy, renewable energy, nuclear facilities, electronic communications, broadcast tv, cyber security, data security, consumer protection, vehicle safety, travel, tourism, and interstate and foreign commerce.\n\nok, let me answer your question now that I have information:\n\n>Do we support cutting $800 billion from Healthcare services to fund other Trump agenda items?\n\n  \nYOUR ARTICLE IS NOTHING BUT LIES AND DECEIT! $880B COVERS THE ENTIRE ENERGY AND COMMERCE JURISDICTION NOT JUST MEDICARE.  MIGHT! COULD! POSSIBLY!  SCARE TACTICS!  THAT'S ALL THIS IS!\n\nOMG! THE REPUBLICANS ARE TAKING AWAY SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE! pfft.  All bull.  All the Democrats have are lies.  Did you not think I would look at the source?\n\nWhat do you think of the article now?  Please answer this question.",

I believe it\u2019s in the mid 60\u2019s now because the cost to service the debt has increased since then, largely as a result of the liberal lockdowns and Biden wrecking the petrodollar. \n\nA 1% reduction in welfare waste would represent a staggering amount of money.  I\u2019d be willing to bet there\u2019s far more than that.",
