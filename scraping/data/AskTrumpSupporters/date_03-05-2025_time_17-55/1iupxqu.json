Typically, when acting as a mediator, meeting with each party separately is the initial step.

I agree that more parties could slow down the negotiations, but that's because the other parties involved also have a stake in the outcome. If you don't allow them to be part of the negotiations, and then you propose a deal that is unacceptable to them, wouldn't that slow down the process even more?",

Why not strengthen an ally at the BORDER of our adversary with them instead? Why not give them a fighting chance to secure, if not all then as much, of their country as possible so when Russia does decide to act on us we have a friendly place to stage a counter. Ukraine is make very good use of weapons that would be stuck here collecting dust and more likely be destroyed which is money lost anyways.

I do agree with most of what you said, (aside from a non-important to our convo reasoning of wanting to be part of Russia) though a more relevant point I don't understand is the reasoning that we'd 'have to use direct military force'. America is the king of logistics and in a battle of attrition of fighting aged adults and equipment, logistics reign. Simply supplying Ukraine with superior logistics back bone would be all that is needed in my eyes. Do you agree with this? If not, why? My reasoning is that is how just about every major war we have won with non insurgent forces has been through superior logistics.",

The GOP seem to have been stunting it (https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4619185-gop-critics-vow-no-more-us-aid-for-ukraine/)\n\nBits from the above article:\n\nBut he acknowledged Ukrainian setbacks in the war because of dwindling supplies, telling reporters Ukraine has had to ration ammunition and is under \u201csevere pressure on the battlefield.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time for us to dig out of the hole that was created by six months of delay before Congress passed the supplemental,\u201d he said. \n\n-And-\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really hard to get a package out of Congress,\u201d said Vance, who argued in a recent New York Times op-ed that the military aid package approved this week won\u2019t turn the tide of the war.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we lack the capacity to manufacture the amount of weapons Ukraine needs us to supply to win the war,\u201d Vance wrote in an essay that made waves on Capitol Hill. (my note: it should be considered that I don't think vance is up to date on this. 2 factories alone in pennsylvania output 36000+ shells a month)\n\nMcConnell, however, told reporters Tuesday that Republicans who support sending more military aid to Ukraine are winning the argument with colleagues he called \u201cisolationists.\u201d\n\n>And at a stand still is where it has been for about a year, despite us pouring in billions of dollars\n\nBut isn't this being paid in seized assets? Even at the lower estimate of 2.6 billion in pay backs per year, this is a full return in under 26 years which in investment time is pretty short AND it's hurting Russia\n\n\"Between October 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024, the G7 nations initiated $50 billion in what's called extraordinary revenue acceleration loans to Ukraine. The loans are to be repaid by future proceeds from these immobilized assets, roughly $2.6 to $3.2 billion per year.\"\n\n(https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-political-military-affairs/releases/2025/01/u-s-security-cooperation-with-ukraine#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20we%20have%20provided,invasion%20of%20Ukraine%20in%202014.

Additionally, prolonging the way benefits Russia, not Ukraine, as Russia has much more resources (even with Ukraine getting help from us and Europe)\n\nThe current approach of hindered logistical supply has got us to this point, as well as the multitude of restrictions put onto Ukraine to use our munitions. Again, with the assets being paid back in seized money, I don't see this helping Russia, as well as the hobbled male population to work in their businesses\n\n\n>Trump needs to end the war\n\nThat's more up to Russia it seems, though they have proven themselves pretty suicidal, it ultimately benefits the US and EU allies. The cold war killed off the USSR in the same way of exhausting their spending, we clearly beat them economically. Do you believe that we should reward their suicidal nature?\n\n\nDo you think better logistical supply coupled with no munition restrictions would lead to a better outcome? We've mainly allowed Ukraine to fight with our swords but with one arm tied behind their back.",

Trump, a master negotiator then began his very public disapproval of Zelenskyy knowing Zelenskyy would not be able to continue the war without USA assistance...and knowing he would eventually capitulate on Trumps demands. It now is being reported Zelenskyy has reconsidered his decision and it sounds as though he is now about sign an agreement (he may have already done so). Trump has now established a significant economic interest in Ukraine and now has legitimacy to protect its interest. Trump will make that clear to Putin. Putin, knowing Russia doesn't have the resources to directly compete against the USA and likely believes Trump isn't bluffing, so he must (and will) find a way to end the war with dignity. He won't get everything he wants, but neither will Zelenskyy. Trump has secured access to Ukraine's minerals so the USA can be repaid, and the killing is going to end. It's a win/win for everyone.

The reality is that they do not always. Insisting arbiters are, by definition, a neutral party is naive at best. I get that you believe that an arbiter will remain neutral. If a circumstance arises where a defined arbiter fails to remain neutral and negotiates in their best interest then they are no longer an arbiter, per the definition, but are hostile negotiator. Heretofore all instances I used the word arbiter where they were not neutral is referring to a role of arbiter in name only but is in actuality a hostile negotiator.\n\nWhat I think doesn't matter. What matters is how things play out. And how things play out in game theory is that when a party has realized they are dealing with a hostile negotiator, their only option is to compete with maximum force.\n\nAny \"arbiter\" should know this. Those that don't know this don't know how arbitration works. This gets into bad faith. Knowing ones role in a given scenario, I get why a \"neutral\" party would want to optimize any outcome to their benefit. But what happens when an arbiter operates in bad faith? Do other parties not see this and then realize that they are not a \"neutral arbiter,\" but rather a \"hostile negotiator.\"\n\nIn any deal appearances are important. Failure to understand this concept will truncate any future deals. Should America take the stance of a hostile negotiator? Or should we respect the rules and try to actually resolve the conflict?",

No.\n\nI'll sum things up for you.\n\nEnding the conflict is important, as it is costly.\n\nEnding the conflict requires neutrality, as failure to be neutral will mean one party will see no reason to negotiate. This ends negotiations.\n\nAmerica cutting funding to end the war will pull in other interested parties. (Western Europe, as they like the buffer of the Eastern bloc.) This signals that America is weak and can not negotiate. This will have other consequences.\n\nDo you see how forcing a party to accept a unilateral deal will force that party to not negotiate at all?\n\nTake this conversation as an example. You refused to accept the concept of \"hostile negotiator.\" I don't know why, but you don't want to accept that America should negotiate in its best interests unless it also means it gets something more than ending the conflict. Meanwhile ending the conflict should be the only interest America has.\n\nYou don't seem to accept anything outside of your understanding of things. If this is in fact the case, then this has been a bad faith discussion. The arbiter (mod) will see this comment as violation of the \"rules for the sub.\" And ban me for 14 days. You didn't explain your perspective (because you didn't answer questions) and I didn't get to understand your perspective. Meanwhile the 3 times you violated the rules will go unnoticed by the mod and you get to keep acting in bad faith.\n\nOh, if you don't see the irony, that's on you.",

First are laws. Governments make policies which are a code of morals/ethics they expect the civil members to obey. These laws tend to be based on a common moral code. And if people have a difference in morality, they will have a hard time agreeing on laws. There are two general methods of classifying morality: horizontal & vertical.\n\nNext is how to divide resources. Money is the medium of exchange here. There are two schools of thought here: merit or equality.\n\nThe third political divide is going to be information. I think misinformation is a better descriptor though. There will be people that want hard, raw, unemotional facts. Then there will be people that want their information to be based on faith. \n\nI call these the 3 \"M's\" of politics. Morality, money and misinformation.\n\nThe most amazing thing is that all of these perspectives have merit. The problem is that nobody wants others telling them how to \"live their life.\"\n\nSo, I get it. I don't want my tax dollars going to some brown kid getting a sex change in some other country. But I also don't want that brown kid being killed by the local mob because their government sided with a religion that sees anything but a binary based gender system as evil.\n\nBrown kids die all the time. But what about the white kid that has a ex-con as a father and a drunk for a mother that can't afford shoes for their kid, let alone food? He is American. Should I be upset when my taxes go up to buy him food? Do you see how this relates to the 3 M's?",

And it would\u2019ve been over if you had the right people. But you didn\u2019t. And now look at it\u2014just look. It\u2019s a total disaster, folks. A disaster. And you know, people come up to me, strong people, tough people\u2014big, powerful guys with tears in their eyes\u2014they say, \"Sir, why is this still going on?\" And I say, \"Because some people don\u2019t know how to make deals.\" You gotta know how to make deals. It\u2019s like real estate. You go in, you make the deal, you walk away with something great.\n\nAnd let me tell you\u2014because this is very important\u2014some people, they don\u2019t understand deals. They don\u2019t get it. And I get it. I get it better than anybody. I had a great uncle, Dr. John Trump. Genius. Absolute genius. MIT. They don\u2019t talk about him enough, but believe me, folks, he was one of the smartest guys. Smarter than the people running Ukraine, I can tell you that. Smarter than Zelensky. And he understood things about the brain, about technology\u2014very advanced things. They said, \"Sir, how do you know so much about nuclear weapons?\" Well, it\u2019s in the genes, folks. It\u2019s in the genes. Some people have good genes, some people don\u2019t. You look at Biden\u2014doesn\u2019t have them. Doesn\u2019t have them. But my uncle? A genius. And he would\u2019ve told you, \"You don\u2019t let things drag on, you make a deal.\"\n\nBut NATO\u2014NATO is a joke, okay? You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. I told them, \"You gotta pay up.\" And they started paying. And then what happens? They get lazy again. Always looking to the U.S. to clean up their messes. Not fair to the American people. And we love the American people, don\u2019t we, folks? The best people. And they know when they\u2019re being ripped off. And now, with Ukraine? More money, more weapons, more of everything\u2014except results. No results. And I said, \"Where is the deal?\" Because you gotta have a deal. But they don\u2019t do deals. They do wars. And we don\u2019t want wars, folks. Wars are bad for business. Bad for everybody. Well, maybe not for some people. You look at some of these guys, they love wars. Makes them a lot of money.\n\nAnd by the way, China is watching. Xi is watching. I had a great relationship with Xi. People said, \"Sir, why are you so friendly with China?\" Because I know how to negotiate. You gotta be tough. And you know, we had tariffs\u2014great tariffs. China respected us. But now? They\u2019re laughing at us. Same with Putin. I told him, I said, \"Don\u2019t do it.\" And he didn\u2019t. Because he knew. But now, they don\u2019t fear us anymore. They don\u2019t respect us. It\u2019s very sad. Very sad to see.\n\nAnd the border\u2014because, by the way, we\u2019re sending all this money to Ukraine, but what about our border? Our own border! Millions pouring in. Some very bad people, folks, very bad. I mean, look, I love immigrants. My policies were the best for immigrants, LEGAL immigrants. But what\u2019s happening now? It\u2019s a disaster. People come in, they get free phones, free money. Meanwhile, we have veterans living on the streets. Can you believe that? It\u2019s disgusting.\n\nAnd energy\u2014because this is important, folks. We were energy independent. We had the best energy, clean energy, beautiful energy. Oil, gas, coal\u2014clean coal. You don\u2019t hear about that anymore, do you? And I said, \"Drill, baby, drill.\" But they want to buy oil from Venezuela. Venezuela! I mean, come on. It\u2019s ridiculous. We have it right here. We could be making so much money. We could be dominating. But instead, they\u2019re making deals with dictators. You look at Biden, going hat in hand to these countries\u2014it\u2019s humiliating. America should never be humiliated.\n\nAnd Zelensky, you know, nice guy, maybe, I don\u2019t know. But he\u2019s on TV a lot. A LOT. More than any leader I\u2019ve ever seen. And I know TV. I was the king of TV. The Apprentice, remember? Huge ratings. The biggest. And I look at Zelensky and I say, \"Why are you always on TV? Shouldn\u2019t you be making a deal?\" But no, he wants more money, more weapons, more everything. And I say, \"At some point, you gotta wrap it up.\" The people are suffering. But the fake news won\u2019t tell you that. They won\u2019t tell you that the people of Ukraine want peace. They just want to live their lives. But the leaders, they want to keep it going. They like it this way.\n\nAnd you remember\u2014they impeached me over a perfect phone call. Perfect! I call Zelensky, I say, \"Let\u2019s talk about corruption,\" and they go crazy. Meanwhile, now, they\u2019re all talking about corruption in Ukraine. They\u2019re finally catching up! But they don\u2019t apologize. They never say, \"Trump was right.\" But I was. I always am.\n\nSo, in the end, folks, this should have never happened. Never. You had a chance to end it. You had a chance to make a deal. But you didn\u2019t. And now, it\u2019s a disaster. And it could have been avoided. So simple. So easy. **You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.**\n\n/s",

The closest he got to saying someone **started** at the end, \"You should have never started it.\" Surely he's not talking to Ukraine or Zelenskyy, as he referred to them in the third person throughout.\n\nMaybe he's continuing the line from the beginning, retelling when he was talking with Zelenskyy. Even then, throughout the whole section, he's explaining how it should have **ended**, and why it was allowed to **continue**. Allow me to ask you a question: based on this quote, why does Trump think Zelenskyy **started** the war? I can show why he thinks the war continued and should have ended, but there's nothing on how it started.",

Like, maybe something in the official bill that provided money for it and not someone's opinion?\n\nI found this article that gives some info and it looks like the 87,000 was a proposed idea of what the IRS would/could do with extra funding - many of the 87k would be replacements for people retiring as well as some amount of IT specialists, customer service people, etc. So what I don't understand is how hiring people to replace people is adding to the total number, isn't that disingenious? If if a decent chunk of those people aren't agents at all, how does one claim the IRS is hiring 87k agents?\n\nThe 85 billion thing - 7 billion is alot, but what I've always wanted to know is, why was that much stuff left there as of January 20th, 2021, if we were supposed to be out in just a few months? And, I believe that number is including what we gave to the Afghan Army, Police, etc, so why would that number include that if it really wasn't ours anymore? Does it change anything? Well, I guess it depends on if you expect accuracy from the person leading the country. 85 billion is quite a large way off from 7 billion. If he had said 10 billion, okay, but...he didn't.",

Now look what's happening over there. Arrests for memes, ect, ect. Had they not revolted in the first place, it wouldn't have happened. So technically, they did start it.\n    The revolution caused a counter revolution by the other side. Who were pro-russia and Russian backed, and resulting in the annexation of Crimea. Strangely enough. Nobody had an issue with this. Ukraine border territories declared independence. Still nobody cared. They set up independent governments. Nobody cared. Ukraine forces had battles with them in Donbas. Not a major war though. Nobody blinked an eye. Fast forward almost a decade. Russia \"invades\" Republics who has claimed independence from Ukraine for eight years. They were Russian backed. Russian controlled, Russian population who spoke Russian. Basically it was decided the NATO needed to intervene in Russia invading what was basically themselves. Because the UN didn't recognize those as independent. Even though they obviously were. How can you allow them to set up Russian gov. Then not say they're independent ? That's ridiculous. Then the media here pushes the \"democracy\" narrative. Massive obvious overuse of that word. Guess who else is a \"democracy.\" .... Russia.  Ukraine has been well known, worldwide, as the by far most corrupt country on the planet. Yet, people actually buy they have a legitimate democratic process. Again, insane or just unaware. That's where almost every corrupt oligarch, politician, ect. has laundered money through, done questionable medical experiments, tests, ect, for about 50-60 years. \n     Also, anyone who thinks Ukraine can beat Russia, is absolutely clueless. There is not a chance in Hell. They aren't even trying. Why are they using the people they're using ? Because they can. They're not following the way almost every country in history has fought. Send in the best. They get taken out send in the next best... Ending up with a very unskilled, untrained military. They're doing what we do. Use the best to train a bunch of conscripts. \n     Now, throughout all that mess. Early on Ukraine changed styles of government, twice. This means, the current government of Ukraine, is not the same government we made a deal to protect. Going by the rules people seem to want to follow, is like saying the US is still British. Different government. Declared independence, ect. Half the people here were on the Kings side as well.",

The same group of people who also arranged the overthrowing of the elected government of Ukraine for a puppet who was hostile to Russia.  And then when enough red lines were crossed and Russia responded, they funded a war (with our money) that they've been losing practically since it first started.  But they've been skimming shitloads of money, so hey... silver lining, right?\n\nTechnically Trump can correctly claim that Zelensky didn't have to go along with this.  But Zelensky is well aware of what happens to corrupt puppets when they outlive their usefulness or show too much defiance to their masters.  So of course he went along with it.\n\nI see this as Trump shaking things up trying to find a negotiating position, but the problem is that Biden and his administrative state who actually ran things have deliberately tried to make it impossible to satisfactorily end the war.  Why end the gravy train?  It's making (us) tons of money and only other people die, so it's all 'up-side'.\n\nThe only incentive for Russia to stop is nuclear war.  They don't want it.  But a shocking number of neocons and neolibs in The West really do want nukes to fly.  Being vaporized or radiation poisoning might dissuade them, but only after the fact when it's too late.  That's how dangerously stupid they are.\n\nTrump represents the only significant faction in US politics who are not warmongers.  So he is the best prospect for finding an answer.  But our negotiating hand only gets weaker as we lose more ground and more people in Ukraine.  So Putin doesn't have to cave if the terms aren't to his liking.  It doesn't matter how expertly we play our cards, we have the losing hand and this is obvious to everyone in the game.",

It\u2019s literally against russian law to send conscripts to Ukraine, and Putin has abided by this\n2. Conscription and mobilization are different things in russia (and there\u2019s no such thing as a draft there)\n3. Hundreds of thousands of russians left for Europe and Georgia during mobilization, and neither they nor their families suffered any consequences. \n\n4. The last mobilization was 2.5 years ago, and almost all of them have since replaced by russian volunteers (because they literally get years and years of pay as a signing bonus)\n\nSo I\u2019m very curious: why do you have such strong opinions on a conflict that you know so little about? You\u2019re wishing death on Ukrainians in some of your comments, but you can\u2019t be bothered to learn basic facts about the russian military?\n\nEdit: bullet formatting",

            "body": "I think it takes two to tango and until the invasion even the media admitted that Ukraine was not a proper Democratic nation. Ukraine and NATO played a part in causing this war and keeping it going, just as Russia did. Ukraine locked up an American journalist for what he said about the war and he died in jail. Was he murdered? I'm not sure, but I'm for free speech and if we were truly allies they should have sent him back to the U.S. instead. NATO and the U.S. encouraged an uprising that led to the overthrow of the elected president in Ukraine in 2014. That led to more civil unrest that lasted for years and split Ukraine into the pro-federalists who had their elected president ousted versus pro-unity who overthrew him. The reason NATO, the U.S. and Europe, had encouraged the overthrow of the elected president was for their own interests because he wanted positive relations with Russia and didn't want to join the European Union. Even if you dislike Russia that should have been the choice of the voters and the man they elected. 30% of Ukrainian citizens also speak Russian as their first language because Ukraine wasn't independent until the 90s so it's natural for them to want to have positive international relations with Russia. While all that unrest was happening the Odessa Massacre happened which was when the \"pro-unity\" side chased the pro-federalists into a building and set it on fire. A little boy who was not involved somehow ended up killed as well. When people tried to escape, many were beat to death. I am mentioning this because 48 people were murdered and no one was ever charged. The courts in Ukraine even said they didn't really investigate the pro-unity side, the side which had control of the government. Those who were murdered were pro-federalists and mostly Russian speaking Ukrainian. The UN: Ukraine website acknowledges this happened and that no one was brought to justice. In 2019, there was also a law put in place to limit the use of Russian in certain fields of work and in the news. The law took effect or was expanded around 2021, I believe. Again this is a nation where 30% of people speak Russian as their first language. What if one of those fields is where they have worked for years and they don't speak fluent Ukrainian? These are concerns even human rights organizations have expressed. Of course, many say this is just a land grab for Putin, but he did also say Ukraine possibly joining NATO would lead to an invasion. Assuming he was not bluffing, it is not surprising that he invaded Ukraine when NATO refused to agree not to extend an invite for membership. Even if that's not why, many stipulate that Putin is angry over the treatment of Russian speaking Ukrainian people in Ukraine. That would make sense too since he has tried providing them with resources and weapons in the past ever since the start of the conflict. My point here is not that Russia is innocent, but that Ukraine is not innocent and I believe that's President Trump's point, too. The Ukrainian people don't deserve to be slaughtered and neither do Russian soldiers. If you put Putin and Zelenskyy in a room and said now fight to the death over the war I feel that they might come to a peace deal much quicker. However, they're willing to sacrifice the peasants before themselves. Long-term this likely would end with Russia gaining more than they'd get in any peace deal the U.S. mediates now. Russia has more than three times as many citizens and three times as many adults as Ukraine. Russia's potential to successfully fight a long war is higher than Ukraine's due to sheer manpower. Russia has more nukes than the U.S. Russia has the most nuclear weapons at 5,580 warheads and the most strategically deployed, ready to launch missiles at 1,710. Democrats seem to think Putin is pure evil so why even risk him escalating the war knowing his capabilities? If what Ukraine needs to do is promise not to join NATO, for example, that should be worth saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Will Ukraine need to give up more at this point? I'm not sure, but the fact is Russia has the upper hand in the war and neither nation has a government that is Democratic, benevolent and innocent in this war. I can't even say I feel NATO or the U.S. is innocent in this war. \nThis war should have been mediated and settled before it got to this point.",

They have 75 trillion dollars in natural resources, and we should try to extract that for explosive economic growth. So yes, I am pro-Russia now if it means they give us favorable trade deals.",

I support trade protection against them for national security reasons. \n\nRussia on the other hand can be reasoned with and since the economy is my top concern, again unlocking their natural resources would result in explosive economic growth. This is what mega investment firm like BlackRock is trying to do, but I believe we can get those resources without pushing Putin out of the way. \n\nLastly, they are hostile toward American interest and allies in that region such as Japan.
