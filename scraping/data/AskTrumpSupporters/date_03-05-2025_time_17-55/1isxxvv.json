    "selftext": "Source: [NYT Maggie Habberman quoting Trump on Hannity](https://imgur.com/65nu6iE)\n\n> Mr. Trump told the Fox News host Sean Hannity that \u201ceverybody expects to be cut\u201d when they send a bill. He said he could pick a bill at random out of thousands that the federal government is paying, one that was dealt with \u201cby some bureaucrat.\u201d\n\n>*He offered an negotiating strategy, musing that an official could say, \u201cI\u2019ll give you three, I don\u2019t want to pay you five. It\u2019s too high. I\u2019ll give you three.\u201d*\n\n> \u201cBut they don\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a guy sends in a bill for 5,000, they pay 5,000. They expect to be cut. Everybody expects to be cut. When you send in a bill, you expect to be cut.\u201d\n\n> The comments echo Mr. Trump\u2019s long history as a real-estate developer, when he would brag about his negotiating prowess. He also was accused of not paying contractors and lawyers, as was his longtime lawyer and mentor, Roy M. Cohn.\n\n---\n\nBonus Q: are any of you guys electricians, or concrete contractors?     I need some major house panel rewiring, and  eventually a barn basement poured.   Just ... ahem ... send me your bill at the end.",

They would do built-in bookcases, staircases, etc.  Well, one of their jobs was actually for Trump.  He wanted a curved wooden staircase installed into one of his homes or offices, and he wanted it inlaid with marble.\n\nMeasurements were done.  Plans were drawn up.  They gave Trump's people a quote.  Trump accepted it.  They got halfway through the job when they realized that the plans did not include the weight of the marble, and marble is quite heavy.  The staircase would have trouble supporting all of that marble, and it might collapse.\n\nThey told this to Trump's people, because it was going to take longer than they said it would.  The response back was, \"Well, you better fix it, and not charge us any more for it\".  In the end, the staircase was redone suitably with marble, but that company broke even with that job.  No profit.\n\nPoint?  The universe is a messy place.  Marble is heavy.  Humans make mistakes.  So what.  Come to an agreement.",

The company does a fantastic job, no issues, always done on time and exceeds expectations. 3 years into the contract the owner of the company says trump is an idiot, the tariffs did not work and have caused the country great hardship.

When those services are complete, please resubmit your invoice. Until then, you get nothing.\"\n\nIf I go through a negotiation process and come to an agreement about the services and goods to be provided; sign a contract listing those goods and services, and their prices; I deliver the agreed-upon goods and services within the negotiated time frame; and I submit my invoice/bill for the delivered goods and services at the agreed-upon prices, why should the government not pay the bill?\n\nAlso, are you OK with vendors negotiating higher prices after delivery, or is is only the government who can negotiate lower prices?\n\nFor example, Boeing quoted a fixed $3.9 billion for two new Airforce One planes.  With increased cost of goods due to COVID and global supply chain changes, among other expenses, the cost for Boeing to deliver the two planes is expected to exceed $7 billion resulting in a $3 billion loss to Boeing.  Are you OK with Boeing delivering the planes and then negotiating a higher price after the government receives the planes?",
