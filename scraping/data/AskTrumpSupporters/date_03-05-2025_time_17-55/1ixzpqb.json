It's been twisted for years by a beaurocracy that believes they have decision making authority. They do not.\n\nThe leadership gives directions and makes decisions. You have 3 choices:\n\nAgree and execute.\nDisagree, try to convince them otherwise, execute.\nDisagree, resign. \n\nAll the #resistance porn (anonymous interviews, leaking, malicious compliance, obstruction, media mudslinging) is tiresome and symbolic of a broken system.

As directors make decisions for their departments. Note I said leaders make decisions.  Musk is the leader of that group. He is performing according to the directions and decisions of the executive branch. No issue.\n\n>the most recent press conference it was confirmed that Musk oversees the department and he was not elected nor approved by senate, and they have yet to identify the actual head of the department so we cannot say they were elected or approved either.\n\nYou'll have to go back to 2014 to complain about that. USDS is not a cabinet level post. Does not require Senate Advice and consent. This is an odd leftwing talking point.\n\n>Along with this, has this department with the power they\u2019ve been given by Trump not qualify as a bureaucracy with decision making authority?\n\nYou're mistaking appropriate decisions authority and not.\n\nEmpowered person (director, secretary, etc.) Has such decision authority (in the executive branch) as the president gives them.\n\nRandom staffer on the third floor by the water cooler has none.\n\nYou can see this play out in cabinet secretaries and SecDef's and AG's, and etc all resigning if they disagreed with the president, as it's a subordinate role and the executive's will is all that ultimately matters for decision making in the executive branch. (Though can be delegated, ie Musk).\n\nThis is presuming following constitution and all appropriate laws. Which, to date, has not been proven a problem at DOGE.",

I believe they have exclusive power to form new cabinet positions.\n\nIf your assertion is correct, Congress would need to create a new Cabinet level position. Until then, Trump is utilizing what Obama put in place. \n\n\"People\" can \"believe\" things if they'd like. \"Should now be\" is an opinion.\n\nWhat is your criteria for a cabinet level position? Since this is a \"Should now be\". What makes a position require congressional approval, specifically? Or is this a \"Stop Trump; We Hate Musk\" thing?\n\n^ Remember for this that it can be equally applied to democrats....\n\nExecutive using executive resources to achieve executive objectives using systems put in place (and uncontested) by the Executive (controlled by the other party) over a decade ago.\n\nThat sounds efficient.",
