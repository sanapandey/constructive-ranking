Obviously open to folks\u2019 opinions here, but I\u2019m more interested in how this example matches or doesn\u2019t match your perspective on federal government interference in state and local laws. Isn\u2019t this kind of the opposite of what small government conservatives typically want (returning decisions to the states)? Or do you view it differently?

I'm already taxed by fuel taxes and who knows what else, why do I need to pay on top of that? Like I understand to a degree when HOV lanes are also express lanes and single occupant vehicles are charged for use, but I don't believe that's the case here.",

Even with the congestion charge, the drivers wouldn\u2019t pay for the road maintenance alone but non drivers (who make up the majority of Manhattan\u2019s population, and the majority of its tax payers) would still pay.\n\nDoes that affect your opinion on the congestion pricing issue?",

                            "body": "Coincidentally I\u2019m an infrastructure investor by profession, so I\u2019ll piggyback here with a bit of info as to how roads, highways and other transport infrastructure are often funded. Though I can agree that I personally don\u2019t love paying tolls. \n\nMost highway projects are funded via public private partnership, so that tax dollars aren\u2019t the only development capital. These are EXPENSIVE projects (hundreds of millions or billions of dollars), and the assets depreciate over time (both physically and financially) such that they need to be heavily renovated / repaved or otherwise rebuilt after a certain period of time. That period of time varies and can tend to be shorter in cold climates where freezing temps cause cracks and road erosion more quickly. The costs that are paid by private investors (think, infrastructure funds, sometimes pension or e&f money) need to result in a return. Otherwise those investors wouldn\u2019t invest, and our tax dollars would need to bear the entire cost - way more expensive for taxpayers in the long run. Tolls are one mechanism for making the economics work and bringing private enterprise into the fold such that their capital is available to contribute to our public infrastructure. The return thresholds aren\u2019t high - generally high single digits, but we\u2019re talking about assets that have virtually no residual value after a certain point in their useful life. So an investor can\u2019t realize a return simply by selling it after a certain period - there need to be interim cash flows to support the project. So tolls are basically retroactively paying for the deployment of the highway in the first place. Just an aside on why we pay tolls.\n\nThat\u2019s actually not what\u2019s happening in NY with congestion pricing - this is a specific program to target high traffic in midtown, encourage the use of public transit, and fund maintenance for the MTA (subway, buses - ways that working class people get to work). I\u2019ve lived in NYC for most of my life and don\u2019t have a car. Most people don\u2019t. The main folks affected are individuals who commute into the city from other locations by driving rather than taking the train. This has been a long standing problem - our city attracts millions of people per day to work, but many don\u2019t want to live here due to city taxes. So commuters in many cases are using our services, roads, transit, cultural institutions etc. but we, city residents are paying for it. Though the congestion pricing program DEFINITELY has negative externalities, no argument there.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the response. Just wanted to add my two cents on the reasoning behind highway tolls. \n\nI agree with your first point pretty much completely. I have to ask a question so have a good day?",
