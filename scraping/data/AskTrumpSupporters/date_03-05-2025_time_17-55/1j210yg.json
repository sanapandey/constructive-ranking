            "body": "Veterans sacrificed their freedom and private sector financial opportunity to provide a necessary service to the nation, and federal jobs guidance attempts to repay those sacrifices by giving slight favorability when hiring for government jobs. There are about zero jobs in the US that pay better in the \"public sector\" or military than they do in the private sector, and given you are essentially property of the US Government for the duration of your service commitment it's not exactly a lifestyle of riches and personal autonomy.\n\nI don't think that situation is a DEI hire at all; unless the goal of this program is to arbitrarily increase the number of \"veterans\" you hire for the purpose of diversity/equity/inclusion, which it definitionally isn't. Equity is about equal outcomes which hiring preference here doesn't seek to create (nor could it in this instance). Inclusion seems sorta irrelevant here as well, nobody is arguing that including veterans just for the sake of including veterans is a net 'good'. Veterans themselves aren't a demographic group necessarily so 'diversity' isn't what you're doing either.\n\nThe short version is as a way to incentivize people to give up a decade or more of their lives it's nice to offer them benefits on the back end like VA services, MWR/commissary access, and some preferential hiring. I think that's quite a lot different than hiring a hispanic guy just so you can say \"we have more hispanic people\".",

You either support it or you don't! \n\nObviously if you commit yourself to the proposition that hiring should not factor in protected classes or other such designations in any way, then yes, you do have to speak about the issue differently if you don't want people to point out the discrepancy. But there's nothing inherently wrong with saying you're against race/sex-based DEI but fine with special, positive treatment for veterans.",

I suppose that once you're a veteran, you're always a veteran, but, at least these days, we have a voluntary military.  You choose to sign up and you choose to serve.\n\nIt's a lot like valuing someone with experience in a field over someone just out of college.",
