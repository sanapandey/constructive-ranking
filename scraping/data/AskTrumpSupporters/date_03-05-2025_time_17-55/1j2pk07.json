We just forgot about them.\n\nIm always reminded of the TSAR bomba basically so large that russia had to actually cut the power in half so the pilot could fly out of the blast range. This was in the 60s.\n\nTheoretically with enough material a country could actually build a bomb large enough to nuke the planet.\n\nThe nuclear bombs we can make now with modern technology could destroy 1/4 of the planet.\n\nChina is also looking for parity with the USA and Russia......they have also never been a party to the nuclear treaties. \n\nWhen more nukes enter the world thats a bad thing.....the world should be losing nukes.",

This info is spotty, and is reminiscent of the 60s, when we were pumping out nukes like crazy under the impression that the USSR was doing the same when in reality they had less than 10% of our warhead stockpile and had like 2 functional nuclear delivery systems that could threaten us.\n\nEven if our 600-nuke estimate is correct, the US and Russia have over 6,000 a piece. China's not estimated to hit 1,500 nukes until 2035-2040. Even if they went full mask-off nuclear production, they wouldn't be able to catch up to parity with the US or Russia for another decade.\n\nIn an all-out nuclear war scenario, China doesn't have the arsenal to wipe out *every* strategic target in a country in the same way the US or Russia do, and they won't have that ability for quite some time.  If the world went back to nuke-threat scenario, don't you think this paints an unbalanced picture?",

China has a modern stockpile and plan on 1000 by 2030. \n\nWhen you have the type of currently unstoppable delivery systems that China has you don\u2019t need numerical parity to teach effective parity. You think a few hundred nuclear warheads smashing into the country isn\u2019t enough for MAD doctrine to apply. I definitely disagree",
