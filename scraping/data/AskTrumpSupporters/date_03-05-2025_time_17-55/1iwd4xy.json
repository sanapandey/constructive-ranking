    "selftext": "The flu has spread from birds, to cows, and now to rats, and has been found in humans.\n\nBird flu specialists were terminated as part of the DOGE cullings and now the USDA is trying to undo the terminations. This may be difficult; in a similar case, nuclear safety employees were recently fired, the government changed their minds and tried to rehire them, but can't get in touch because they don't have contact information for them.\n\n> Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a member of the Agriculture Committee, told NBC News of the DOGE team \u201cThere\u2019s an old saying, \u2018Measure twice, cut once.\u2019 Well, they are measuring once and having to cut twice.\"\n\nRelated link on bird flu firings: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/usda-accidentally-fired-officials-bird-flu-rehire-rcna192716\n\nHow do you feel about the way the Trump administration is handling safety and disease prevention in the US, especially with respect to the bird flu?",

It would appear that those affects caused a substantial shift in political views and likely is the cause of the Trump presidency.",

From what I can gather, these \u201cviruses\u201d are the exact same tissue/cell culture and chicken embryo processes used to create a mish-mash of human and avian genetic material in the laboratory. The usual indirect non-specific antibody results were used to claim these \u201cviruses\u201d were related yet distinct entities. For good measure, Hilleman\u2019s unproven theories of antigenic shift and drift were used to explain away the vaccine failures and the inability to produce the same genome every time. However, the only antigenic shift, drift, and reassortment that occured was in the mixing of human genetic material in embryonated chicken eggs.\"   (!!!)\n-\nWhat a scam.\n\n[https://www.thefocalpoints.com/p/usda-has-spent-125-billion-on-mass](https://www.thefocalpoints.com/p/usda-has-spent-125-billion-on-mass)",
