            "body": "A few long term issues might arise if the immediate enticement of maximizing profit margins is always chosen and leads to high trade deficits:\n\n1. Currency depreciation as constantly exporting one\u2019s own currency might flood the market and decrease demand. \n\n2. Economic dependence on foreign countries. This has major implications for the stability of the nations economy as well as national security concerns\n\n3. Trade deficits often imply off shoring for existing industries. Having a large net trade deficit indicates that it\u2019s much cheaper to employ foreigners by proxy, funding foreign labor markets and foreign economies by shipping domestic dollars overseas. \n\nAgain, it may be 25 cents cheaper to produce a part overseas and so everyone directly involved in the transaction at that rate is happy to be involved in it. But the opportunity cost may well be domestic jobs, national security, and long term industry growth potential as industry cores wind up being solidified in foreign countries. \n\nObviously, buying something for cheaper from a third party can have immediate benefits for Americans but over the long term, shipping dollars, jobs, and national security overseas takes its toll on the domestic reserve of all these things. American businesses get rich quickly doing these things but there\u2019s an opportunity cost in the form of investment in the future of America. A trade deficit isn\u2019t always bad but people railing against Trump\u2019s insistence that long standing and massive trade deficits can be very bad for a country are telling on themselves that they value immediate maximization of corporate profits over long term/sustainable domestic growth that would benefit Americans for generations.",

Do you also believe in maintaining white purity, like Lothrop Stoddard?\n\nTo further address your points:\n\n1. You're not clear on the actual problem you're presenting, especially considering how strong the dollar has been performing. When has currency depreciation been a meaningful problem for us, or is this purely a hypothetical? What's the tangible risk here? Moreover, hasn't our lack of currency depreciation made our exports less competitive? https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RTWEXBGS\n\n\n2. Again, you're not clear on the implications you're referring to when you say \"stability of the nation's economy.\" Having a more export-driven economy undoubtedly creates far greater dependency on foreign markets. Can you be more specific? National security concerns is a fair point, which is why both Republicans and Dems, especially, have supported onshoring critical manufacturing and supply chains (see: CHIPS/Science Act, IRA, IIJA, Biden's EOs and tariffs on semiconductors, steel & aluminum, battery components & minerals, etc.). This is also why Biden preferred targeted tariffs rather than the indiscriminate ones preferred by Republicans. \n\n\n3. You don't give any normative assertion here. You state that we fund foreign labor markets--is this inherently wrong? How does this hurt us? Is this zero sum?\n\nTbh I'm not really sure what your actual argument is, other than some vague statements about how a trade deficit \"takes its toll on the domestic reserve\" and hurts \"sustainable domestic growth.\" What exactly do you mean here, concretely, and doesn't this seem at odds with the U.S.'s continued economic outperformance? Is there not a long-term opportunity cost in subsidizing non-essential jobs?\n\nEdited: formatting",

I have 75 cents. \n  \nWe trade. \n  \nI\u2019m happy. Are you?\n  \nTo answer OP\u2019s questions: what problems can arise might depend on what items are being traded. So that\u2019s a tough one to answer. Should our trade deficit be lowered, absolutely. What is the ideal level, zero. \n  \nA trade deficit need not be measured in dollars, when determining if a trade is mutually agreeable but there has to be a way to adjust over time for all parties involved. For example, if the trade involves an item that is also of value to the holding party, and is a finite resource, the value of the item will increase as the resource gets depleted. \n  \nA big problem that arises are trades made out of a special interest that does not align with the country writ large. When you factor in personal interests, back room deals, etc. it can get pretty messy.\n\nEdit to add credentials: I have very limited knowledge of finance.",

One of the ingredients in the fertilizer I produce is fruit by-products - something that you grow at your farm. \n\nEvery season, you require 5 tons of fertilizer, and I sell this to you. Every season, I require 1 ton of fruit to process and add to the fertilizer, and you sell this to me.\n\nFrom this point, you're able to sell your produce to anywhere you wish since you're able to adequately fertilize your farm with what you buy from me. I'm able to create my fertilizer mixture at a rate that works for the size of my business. \n\nIn this example, I'm purchasing $1,000 in fruit from you as that is all I need to produce the fertilizer mix. You're purchasing $5,000 from me because you require that amount to operate your farm and then sell $40,000 of your produce around the world.\n\nSo, in this example, it isn't just trading cash for cash, as we have different operations, benefits, and profits as a result of our trades. \n\nDoes this analogy help clarify how a trade deficit might play out?",

We get lumber from Canada.  Canada has a ton and already has the infrastructure to create it.  We don't. So we buy it from Canada.  \n\n\nAnother example is gas.  We drill a lot in the US.  We just don't use most of it.  The oil companies make more money by drilling in the US and shipping that oil out and then taking in oil from Canada and refining it for gas consumption in the US.  This makes the oil companies a ton of money and still creates jobs in the US.  \n\nSo where is the upper hand? Just because we have more people?",

One of the reasons for moving *to* the income tax, as I'm sure you know, is that tariffs of the last century were regressive...they shifted the tax burden from manufacturers and the wealthy to the working man. This napkin math also ignores how taxes will affect imports...that is, they will go down drastically. \n\nDo you think Trump is right to float the idea of replacing the income tax with tariffs? Do you think it's wise to shift the tax burden so dramatically onto the middle class and poor Americans?",

A trade deficit is simply importing more than exporting, which doesn't automatically translate into \"exporting jobs\". There are industries that don't have domestic competitors, and goods that aren't simply produced in the US. From smartphones to footwear, from clothes to cocoa, coffee, rubber, tea and spices, etc. etc. Wouldn't a better approach something like CHIPS act, where you lay the groundwork for domestic production before slapping tariffs to everything that people buy? \n\n\\>With Europe, a lot of it is retaliatory because of how high their tariffs are on US goods. Tariffs are how Europe protects its luxury car business for example. Do you think they\u2019re stupid for doing that?\n\nEU has 10% tariffs on non-EU cars, not on US cars. These tariffs are the result of decades old mutual trade agreements, since the Uruguay Round. Lowering the EU tariff on US cars unilaterally would trigger the most-favoured nation clause, forcing the EU to reduce tariffs on cars from all non-EU countries, like China. \n\nThis was part of a much larger multilateral agreement that aimed to reduce distortions in global trade by making tariff schedules more uniform across trading partners, even if in some sectors the concessions went in opposite directions. And most of these distortions before the Round were exactly tariff escalation (where processed goods were taxed more heavily than raw materials) and non\u2011tariff barriers that skewed market access. These policies created an uneven playing field that the Uruguay Round sought to address by setting more uniform, reciprocal tariff schedules.\n\nHow is retaliatory, since it was a mutual agreement?",

Shouldn\u2019t all countries just want zero tariffs for everything forever or are they all stupid?\n\nCountries negotiate tariffs to balance various economic and strategic interests. Zero tariffs might seem ideal for free trade, but there are many reasons why countries negotiate deals that include tariffs. You could use tariffs temporarily to protect emerging or struggling industries, while you invest in them to make more competitive. Two countries may agree on different tariffs for each other on different sectors to level the playing field on the exports/imports they are strong/weak in. They can be a part of a larger deal agreement that doesn't involve tariffs. They can be levied as a political tool to obtain something else, or used as a sanction to weaken a country at war. In certain critical security industries, tariffs are used to as a measure of mutual security, etc etc.\n\nIn the case of EU and cars, tariffs were part of a larger multilateral trade agreement that both the US and EU agreed to.\n\nDoes this answer your question?\n\nIf so, then why the US is retaliating against a mutual agreement?",

Historically, tariffs can be beneficial when used as a specific tool inside a larger multilateral agreement, not as an hammer used to \"retaliate\" against mutual agreements with allies and trade partner.

You don\u2019t have an argument\n\n\"I don't have an argument\" because you're not disagreeing with me, lol. Of course there are many arguments for the renegotiation of previous deals. But these agreements are usually done by inviting allies to a table, talk to them, and reach a deal that it's beneficial to both of them. That's how cooperation between allies usually works. \n\nIs that what is happening? Or it's more like Trump is breaking previous agreements, such as the one who he himself NEGOTIATED and SIGNED during his first term with Canada and Mexico?\n\nThe only result is that Trump is looking like a bully, starting trade wars on made up reasons, breaking agreements he previously made, with no long term strategies to grow domestic production, and huge short term price increases, isolating from allies and indirectly appeasing enemies - to the point that historical allies are actively boycotting american products. \n\nWe agree that tariffs are a tool, we just disagree on how to use them, apparently.",

Canada obviously wants to develop it's mineral sector and would love a reliable customer in the form of the US defense department and the US consumer (for more regular technology).\n\nDo you really think it's better to insult and coerce your way to that than to do it the diplomatic way? Given guarantees that their reserves would be purchased, Canada would be more than happy to sign an agreement freezing China out of their supplies in the long term \n\nI never said it was a neutral position, I said it is a fact that must be dealt with.

You can be upset because you are nervous about an America first foreign policy. I understand why that makes neoliberals nervous because they view supernational orgs and agreements in higher regard than American autonomy.
