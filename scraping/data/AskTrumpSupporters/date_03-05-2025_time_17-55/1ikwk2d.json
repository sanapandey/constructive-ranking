I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,\u201d Trump said in a post to Truth Social. \u201cWe will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!\u201d\n\n> The center acknowledged that its governing statute did not bar the new administration from replacing board members but noted, \u201cThis would be the first time such action has been taken with the Kennedy Center\u2019s board.\u201d\n\nWhy would trump make himself chairman?\n\nOverall thoughts?

Wouldn't a more productive (or common-sensical) default modality be that no taxpayer dollars should be funding waste/fraud/abuse? We all know that entitlements >>>> discretionary spending, and touching entitlements is a political non-starter, but why should that excuse poor stewardship of taxpayer dollars on the discretionary side?
