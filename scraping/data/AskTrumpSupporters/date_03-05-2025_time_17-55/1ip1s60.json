On an individual person level, for someone who has already been hired and is in a role, the only way to tell if they deserve to be in the role is performance reviews and work evaluations. You can harbor whatever misgivings you may have about their hiring, but without seeing their actual performance in the job that is just wild speculation. \n\nOn a broader scale if you want, you can take the Elon approach of layoff too much of the workforce at random, see what brakes, hire back just those specific people needed to unbreak those things with a raise. It is way faster than going person by person through a massive number of people, but it\u2019s very messy, and everyone gets mad at you.",

You're setting up a ridiculous strawman. I'm not insinuating that people look at applications, see the Black box checked and that's an instant hire.\n\nIn fact I am involved in hiring at my company, and one thing I have noticed is there is a requirement to interview X number of \"diverse\" candidates. In the tech world, Chinese and Indian don't count as diverse even if they aren't white, so even if a talented Indian resume lands in my lap, I need to interview not just more Indians and Chinese nationals, because they tend to be the most common applicants, but I need to interview either Black/Latino or female candidates before I can make an offer. Our team has lost out on 2 positions because in both cases we found good candidates that interviewed, passed with flying colors. In both cases we had to go find other \"diverse\" candidates to interview first, and quite honestly, as much as I would like to hire diverse, there were simply no good candidates. One left for a competitor, and another went for another team in our company. I suspect the other team either got lucky and had a diverse pool of applicants or more likely they interviewed another \"diverse candidate\" for the sake of checking that box even if they were unqualified.\n\nYou see, this kind of hiring basically screws things up. You're no longer hiring the best candidate, but having to go through a bunch of hoops in the name of diversity.\n\nAgain I have no problem if an equally qualified Black candidate and White candidate were interviewed. In the hiring decision I would recommend a coin flip, but DEI would bias the hiring towards the Black candidate. Traditional racist hiring would bias towards the White candidate. **What I advocate for is truly racially blind hiring.**",

I think this is where the main difference is. I too would oppose DEI if that was its designed purpose, but I believe it's designed to prevent unfairness in hiring practices, not enable it (the same purpose of the civil rights act).\n\n1. Do you think many people on the left have been misled or are uninformed about the purpose of DEI? \n\n2. Do you think the DEI can be fixed so as to prevent unfair hiring practices rather than enabling it? Or at least build something new from the ground up to replace DEI for such a purpose?",

I can\u2019t find any link that isn\u2019t like a 500 page pdf file, but vocational rehab will pay up to 75% of an employees wages in wage reimbursement for 6 months.  This is specifically for disabled employees, but I\u2019ll explain how that works in my situation.  \n\nSo I was part of an \u201cemployment services\u201d program through the healthcare network where I saw my doctor.  That program was funded by a state grant for workforce development and received money for helping me find a job in the first place.  They got me set up with the VR program AFTER I interviewed for my position as a case manager in their program for housing homeless vets.  VR reimburses 75% of your wages for 6 months.  Then they also received that tax credit for me listed in the link.  The program itself was fully funded by a block grant, where they received more than I was being paid anyway specifically for their case managers and our supervisor.  There were 3 of us and they received $350k for the program just for employees.  I made $30k a year.  Just the VR reimbursement and the tax credit covered my wages and then some, even though they were getting the money for my wages from the program already.  They let me go right at my 6th month after my supervisor left the program a few weeks earlier saying that they weren\u2019t getting enough funding to cover my position anymore.  I talked to my old supervisor about it and he said that was a lie and that they weren\u2019t getting enough basically manipulating as many programs as they could to actually make money off of hiring me.\n\nEdit to add: this same nonprofit is also actively abusing the recovery works grant money and Medicaid by billing both for services it provides through its rehab and sober living house.  I\u2019m personally all for DEI for disabled people and marginalized groups as well as recovery works and Medicaid.  But when taxpayers are holding up huge organizations that are defrauding the federal government with basically no oversight it\u2019s an issue.  Especially when their clients are being done a disservice because they\u2019re hiring unqualified people to do the jobs over qualified ones due to being greedy and wanting to pocket more federal grant money.",

Because if it didn't discriminate and filter out people based on their born characteristics, we wouldn't even need DEI then\n\n\\> and do you have evidence that prior to DEI there was no discrimination against certain candidate groups?\n\nI was talking about open DEI discrimination, of course discrimination would still exist, but it's hidden and it exists now too. For starters, we need to remove open discrimination, people brag how they filter out candidates based on skin color, we must put an end to it",

There is already evidence that when these programs are reduced or removed, today, the same thing happens. It isn't just about active, purposeful racism. It is also about what naturally happens when people aren't pushed to consider people outside of their circles. I am white, my family is white, the people I grew up with are mostly white. I don't purposefully exclude anyone because they aren't white, but I have a natural inclination and preference for people I am familiar with. This is also true for everyone else. People who talk like me, act like me, speak like me.  It just so happens that the US is a majority white country, so people who aren't white are put at a disadvantage by this. \n\nThis trickles down into interviews, school admissions, anything that requires human interaction at all is going to disadvantage the minority members of the population no matter where you are. In a world where there are applicants en masse for every single job on the market, giving a boost to minorities challenges this dynamic. Does that make sense? Is this bad? Why?",

The point is to provide opportunity to those who wouldn\u2019t be able to get in under a solely merit based system. That\u2019s the entire point of affirmative action: it lowers standards for certain demographic groups. That\u2019s quite literally the point of the policy. The issue is twofold: firstly, obviously since jobs are finite resource, there will be some people excluded on the basis of their immutable characteristics because of DEI. Secondly, when you lower the standards for certain groups then you actually reinforce prejustice. Every member of the group supposedly helped is going to have an asterisk next to their name and people will wonder, fairly, if they really got in on their own merit. Think about it like this: let\u2019s say you need to score an 8/10 on the doctor exam to be a doctor. But for the sake of increasing diversity, if you\u2019re black, you can pass with a 6/10. What that means is that while the overall proportion of black doctors will increase, their average quality will decrease due to the laxer standards. Therefore if I\u2019m just Joe Shmoe off the street and I\u2019m picking a doctor, and the only information I have between the two candidates is race\u2026 the logical thing for me to do is pick the white doctor, since they\u2019re more likely to have a higher score. DEI primarily hurts whites and to a lesser extent other disfavored groups like Asians and Jews(mostly because they\u2019re viewed as white adjacent) but it also hurts minorities that would have succeeded without DEI.",

Some components of DEI to me are OK and those words themselves are actually important. The problem is DEI has a huge side of marketing that is like 80% focused on race. You have job hiring posters that focus on putting like 1 person of each race on the poster instead. The marketing is all wrong.\n\nBut I would argue the execution is often wrong too. I work in a company and we're hiring. We've had to pass on candidates because we were told we haven't interviewed enough diverse candidates enough. Okay, but first it's hard to find diverse candidates. I suppose what I've seen some teams do is they just forcibly interview a few female candidates, good or bad, and quickly say \"well we still want to select this other candidate we were ready to give an offer to.\" And so  now you're just checking the box. But for someone like me focused on finding the best candidate, we've had to wait on giving an offer and lost out on 2 candidate. That's bullshit.\n\nIf the problem is that not enough women or minorities are getting into some jobs like STEM, then we need to look at longer term measures in how we can encourage women into STEM or ensure STEM is well taught even in lower income neighborhoods. Requesting interview or hiring quotas is the wrong way to do it.",

Was there a period of time where that existed? DEI is literally designed to implement a purely merit based system. The argument is that if Joe America gets his friends and his wife Susie America\u2019s family to all apply for a job, everyone is going to look pretty similar in age, interests, religion, race, gender, etc. was that the period of time where everyone being hired was purely merit based? What if Joe Brown, who would otherwise be an excellent candidate, applied and the hiring process strongly prioritized employee referrals over any other form of hiring, so he didn\u2019t even get an interview? Is that what you\u2019re talking about when you talk about the mythical era where purely merit based hiring reigned supreme?\n\nFrankly if Trump supporters said that they wanted to do away with diversity targets but retain merit based hiring practices I think that would be a pretty reasonable and centrist stance. If you look at this thread you will see many supporters simply claim white men are more merited to get jobs than any other group, and while I get the sense that you don\u2019t share that view, how confident are you that a \u201creturn to merit based hiring\u201d will be truly meritorious or meritorious only if you assume white men are more meritorious?",

Equality of opportunity looks to ensure that everyone has the same opportunities to make those gains.\"\n\nIs affirmative action equal opportunity or equal outcome?\n\n\"The goal of an Affirmative Action Plan is genuine equality of opportunity in employment.

However, if taken to an extreme it may lead to greater absolute poverty, if it negatively affects a country's GDP by damaging workers' sense of work ethic by destroying incentives to work harder.\"\n\nThis was Ayn Rand's premise in her books BUT the key phrase there is taken to extreme.

I don't have a problem with them and I don't think that's what conservatives are complaining about when they attack DEI.\n\n>\n\n>You mean the targets where you try to have your workforce be more representative of the country?

Again, the civil rights act protects against that. And even if they did, I don't think you should fight discrimination by discriminating against white men.",

I do not care what country you were born in.  The only time I am interested in your sexuality is if we are going to have sex, and unless you're my wife, we aren't going to have sex.  I care if you are the best-qualified candidate for a position.\n\nYes, nepotism happens, but that happens regardless of DEI policies and the like.  It's easier to get a job if you have a friend or family working there already.\n\nBut what I don't want is someone thinking that the best candidate was hired because of their skin tone, country or origin, genitalia, or sexual preference.  I want them to be the best, not the best \"X person of whatever category we need.\"\n\nThere are, in my opinion, obvious exceptions.  I mean, I've mentioned it before, but there's no way I would get a job as a Hooter's girl, or as Cinderella at Disney World, and I'm pretty sure my bad knees would make me not the best choice for the NFL.  And if someone cast me as Storm, I think everyone would flip out, even if I dyed my hair white again.  But those things are a bit different.",

This is because government usually just allows bloat & corruption, not like it's the officers' or politicians' money going to waste, it's yours. Not all cuts are due to DEI. There are also many DEI hire positions specifically about enforcing discrimination, such as certain HR positions & basically anything with gender studies in it.\n\n\nDEI inherently does, it discriminates against who you are allowed to look at forcing a smaller pool of employment.\n\n\nIf the hire is performing better & is not creating social issues or ideologically resisting the civil authority, yes. Merit is important though even more important is making sure the person won't actively work against you even if competent at the job. If the person is actively trying to subvert the removal of DEI or policies, for example, I don't care if he's the best in the world at what he does, he is enabling racist destructive policy against the constitutional authority& must be removed.",

It's just the people on the wait-list that are really suffering. I feel we won't agree on that, though, so one final question: do you feel like top talent is overlooked due to not fitting under the DEI umbrella?\u00a0",

Let's say you need engineers, these numbers are just made up for sake of an example. You have a quota that requires 3 black women, 90% of people applying to be engineers are straight men, of the remainder that are women 70% are white or asian. However you & every other company are looking for the best of 0.3% of the total pool of engineers. What are the odds every company is going to get someone in the top echelons of engineers from that pool?\n\n\nAdditionally, how would you feel in the reverse where companies prioritize white, straight individuals arbitrarily because of ideological preferences?

You sound like a complete idiot with that regurgitated response. Being pro- DEI is the opposite of racist, DEI was put in place to make sure you got a job DESPITE your background. How is that so hard for you to understand? Of course DEI can be abused but that\u2019s not what\u2019s it was in place for, its purpose to prevent racial bias from interfering with jobs.\u00a0\n\nFor fuck sake. Thinking someone only got their job because of their race in their merit is racist. Wanting someone to get their job because of their merit and DESPITE their racist is not fucking racist. Why about that is so hard for your Faux News brain to understand? We both want the same thing, we both want the most qualified PEOPLE of ANY BACKGROUND to get the job. Why do YOU keep making it about race? DEI is does not cause unqualified people to get hired, stupid managers hiring stupid people, that has nothing to do with DEI.\u00a0",
