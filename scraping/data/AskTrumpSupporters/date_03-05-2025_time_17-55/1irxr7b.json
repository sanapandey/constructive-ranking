Does that make you lean in any direction in regards to the validity of the charges?",

You don't think it's at all wrong for the DOJ to drop corruption charges on local lawmakers so long as they push the administration's agenda? Doesn't this sort of greenlight corruption as long as you're a team player for MAGA/Trump? This just seems to me like an incredibly inappropriate way to run your justice department.",
