The answer for me depends on the extend that private charities would otherwise have naturally and more efficiently filled the voice.\n\nThe government doesn't have money - they just seize it and redistribute it. This thing has proven to be a super slippery slope.  There are many examples of profitable companies getting corporate welfare thanks to shenanigans.\n\nThere's also annoying red tape for poor people to get government assistance.\n\nI think food kitchens and cheap group housing for homeless are a good public service.  These are things that don't require means check or much overhead.  No one with good income is going to sneak into a food kitchen to scrounge up a free wheel or spend nights in homeless shelter to avoid having to pay for a hotel.",
