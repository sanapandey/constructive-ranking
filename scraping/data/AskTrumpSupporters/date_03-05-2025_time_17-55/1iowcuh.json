You can have those qualities regardless of your racial background and without any need for DEI programs.\n\n>Should a company be able to hire just black people\n\nImo, yes, unless the company is also funded by tax-payers (including tax-payers who aren't black). It would let me know what company to stay away from (same for a company that only hires white people).\n\n>Should the government be able to just hire black people for a specific job?\n\nImo, no, because the American government is supposed to represent and serve all Americans, regardless of racial background.",

I have shown you an example of a very non-diverse movie being called diverse.  I have also pointed out that American movies portray White Americans at a disproportionally lesser rate.\n\nHowever, just to use a few examples from Disney/Pixar's recent past, Finn's role in the new Star Wars Trilogy was greatly reduced due, apparently, a lack of interest in Chinese moviegoers in seeing Black actors.  Likewise, several movies (I know the new Buzz LIghtyear one was an example) have a blink-and-you'll-miss-it LGBT scene that gets cut for release in certain countries.",

What was once considered a bastion of truth and verification, and a competitive race to present that truth, is now a collection of activist groups being funded by big money to support specific, biased political agendas, under the insidious guise of \"news\". Most TS realized this back in 2015/16, when the coverage of Trump and his candidacy was close to 100% negative - it just wasn't organic. We thought critically, and reasoned that the existence of this man and his candidacy shouldn't incite the amount of blind rage and resistance it did, so what else is going on here? This extends beyond politics, to health (all the lies about the covid response and its origin, changing of definitions), economics , finance, etc.\n\nAs a case in point, take the Amy Robach 2019 hot mic moment. That story would have been one of the biggest this century, but ABC stomped, it, not because it wasn't vetted or incomplete, but because of the damage it would have caused to the back-channel money train.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy\\_Robach#Jeffrey\\_Epstein\\_story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Robach#Jeffrey_Epstein_story)\n\nJust remember, the information you are being shown is being carefully selected and curated. You're not being presented with the information you need to see for your benefit, it's for theirs. Turn off the news.",

True equality. Real equality. I find too many liberals are focused on fake equality and focused on things like sex and race but true equality is found in our constitution. True equality is simple, no human has power over another, that's real equality. Now apply that to issues like guns and the 2nd and amendment. Sure you may feel like you're on the right side by banning guns but your harming equality by giving the government (made up of humans) power over other humans. And yes, even the founders knew some government was a \"necessary evil\" but the idea was to limit government as much as possible so we can all be free and truly EQUAL.",
