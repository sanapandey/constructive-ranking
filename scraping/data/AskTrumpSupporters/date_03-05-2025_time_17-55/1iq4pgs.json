During Kamala\u2019s run when they tried to make her look cool and trendy with the whole \u201cbrat\u201d deal I cringed in the same way. \n\nI understand what they\u2019re going for, I don\u2019t find it appropriate from a presidential candidate or a president. It\u2019s just odd. There has to be some sort of line of decorum/professionalism? I mean the office of the president of the United States is the highest office in the world. \n\nMemes, jokes, funny AI images coming from randos or conservative influencers are funny, from official accounts\u2026 no.",

In my view, leaders should set an example for mature, responsible, measured behavior. Leaders should embody values that I would like to instill in my children, not force me to change the channel when they appear because there is a good chance he's going to do or say something embarrassing or inappropriate.",

You impose yourself on the nation without the consent of her people. That is wrong. If you want assylum apply at an embassy or port of entry, where it is entirely legal. These largely aren't assylum seekers, they are economic migrants. They are not entitled to our nation. If economics are enough to justify assylum 90% of the world is assylum & that is the end of our nation because a nation requires joint culture, values, & social bonds. We wouldn't raise up the 90%, we'd tank our fellow countrymen & families.\n\n\nOh also on \"he who saves his country,\" it is a double entendre. It has two meanings. 1. He who wishes to save his country shall not violate laws, he is doing so through legal means. 2. To save one's country is not a violation of the law. Neither meaning is dangerous.",

It is a shorthand for Trump's intent to use tariffs to push business back into the USA, thus costing China jobs. Short term it costs the USA a price increase, long term it can push specifically steel production back into the USA.

That's not an issue with the President. Your argument seems to be we should just stop talking about people violating our sovereignty. Would you apply this to other crimes? Oh no he's talking about murderers, some people associate murderers by appearance with \\[racial group\\]! Better just not talk about murder problems & not publicize murderers! This is ridiculous argumentation.\n\nThey aren't, Trump is also targeting European illegal aliens, actively. This is a massive bias on your part to assume that. They do make up a much smaller portion & far lower portions of the murderers & gang members so it isn't immediate & they are still being actively rooted out, there have been multiple policies put in place to seek out specifically European illegal aliens.",
