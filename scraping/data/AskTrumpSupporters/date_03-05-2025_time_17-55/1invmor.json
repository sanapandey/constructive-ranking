Had he never said a word against them, it never would have happened.  His case is politically motivated - everyone knows it, even the people who say otherwise.\n\nThe Democrats in particular have a known history of intimidating dissenting voices within their ranks - most former Democrats who leave the party have a story about times they spoke out against influential members of the party.  Even Tulsi Gabbard had a story about how once while Obama was in office, 24 hours after criticizing something he did, she got a call from the White House being told 'how dare you question your President' and being lectured on how it was her duty to stand by anything he does.\n\nIf you mean Letitia James, I don't know much more than you, which is why I'm curious to see where it goes.  All I do know is that if she did do what she prosecuted Trump for, then she deserves the full treatment she demanded he be put through.  Anything less would make her and those who supported her decision hypocrites.",

Indeed, Bove conceded that he had not evaluated the evidence in the case and did not question the integrity of Sassoon and the SDNY prosecutors assigned to the case \u2013 who only a few days earlier had made a submission to the court dismantling Mayor Adams\u2019s claims that he\u2019d been the victim of politicized prosecution by his fellow Democrats in the Biden DOJ.\n\nRather, the dismissal was ostensibly ordered because the indictment was supposedly interfering in Adams\u2019s capacity to assist the Trump administration\u2019s immigration enforcement efforts (a claim Adams himself has denied), and because the indictment was supposedly politically timed. As the SDNY prosecutors point out, the corruption investigation of Adams was opened more than a year before he finally began criticizing President Biden over the tide of illegal immigrants flooding the city (prior to that, Adams was an advocate for the city\u2019s sanctuary policies and blamed Republicans for the city\u2019s being overwhelmed by \u201cmigrants\u201d)\n\n[https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/predictably-trump-dojs-dropping-of-mayor-adams-case-triggers-resignations-by-sdny-u-s-attorney-and-public-corruption-prosecutors/](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/predictably-trump-dojs-dropping-of-mayor-adams-case-triggers-resignations-by-sdny-u-s-attorney-and-public-corruption-prosecutors/)\n\nThoughts?",

If\u00a0you want to enforce them they need to be enforced equally. It isn't. It is targeted, selective enforcement by the neocon/neolib sort of leadership.

Law is heavily reliant on culture, congressmen as a whole are an equal branch of government to the president & supreme court. It is extremely difficult to force this if the collective of congress don't want it so first you have to get a significant portion of the people currently engaged in the crime to endorse ending it. If it was being enforced on non-politicians it would be much easier, as much as I wish it were true that no one is above the law & agree with the ideal that justice should be blind I am not naiive enough to think you can force this through. There is a lot of influence much of Congress can wield to oppose such moves. To really get this to stick & work you'd need to change the culture of the political environment, this is something that will genuinely be very hard to do, it isn't a change we can implement & sustain with a pen stroke & requires extensive vigilance. It will be great if we can achieve that but there is also so much else to work on.\n\n\nIt is possible to do, but it's a herculean task of political maneuvering & social changes needed to make this work. It would burn almost completely through almost any political mandate.\u00a0\n\n\nIt does make me sad this has to be left as is, at least for now, but the task is incredibly difficult & there are other things that have priority. Trivial things like plastic straws you can do with a stroke of the pen on a flight. Creating major systematic changes to the election takes years or decades even of political commitment to actually make work even if the law is on the books already.\u00a0",

The publicization of literally funding antisemitic songs for a rapper in Gaza for 3 mil alone is a huge win in draining the swamp. I'm sorry I'm too busy being overjoyed that we're actually seriously discussing & seeing actual consequences in other areas where we can blatantly announce it like some of the insider trading is now being properly tackled. There are corruption that have higher priority than lying to the FBI, which itself is a corrupt organization at leadership that I have wanted disbanded for years due to its habit of creating terrorists so it can entrap them. I have a constant list of other things to celebrate. The fact that ANY form of audit is actually being performed & I am finally validated on my statements of how the government has been funding protests, funding both sides of wars, manipulating the  public at large constantly through every method possible & destabilizing the lives of average Americans is far more important. I have way too much to celebrate to get stuck in a few details that I find unfortunate but necessary.

Lying to the FBI is criminal but that isn't political corruption. Protecting someone from unequal enforcement is protecting someone against corruption, not corruption itself. His actions of lying to & attempting to manipulate things under oath are indeed bad & principally should be prosecuted, however there are so many members of Congress that openly have done so. The same with how some conservatives are prosecuted for years in prison because they refused to stand before Congress but Schumer did so for multiple times, bragged about it, & got no charges. It is the unequal enforcement that is the corruption. It means if we were to be fair & enforce this we would need to imprison most of the major figures in the legislature, some significant portions of the judiciary, some presidents, some governors, some mayors, all of whom hold major standing. No one has the political mandate & support necessary to arrest everyone from McConnel to Biden to Pelosi to Newsom to Schumer. It is infeasible.\n\n\nIt is a far worse problem that we have unequal enforcement that picks & chooses who to prosecute than it is we have people lying under oath. I immensely dislike the latter, I think it should be enforced, but there is no practical means to do so right now. Selective enforcement is a greater evil.\u00a0",

These are people in positions of political influence who can resist & actively fight back & undermine the entire state. If we did this you would likely be panicking that Trump is the worst dictator in history & imprisoning his political opponents. It is also highly unlikely any of this would work in the first place & it isn't actively harming people, at least not directly. It is a question of cost benefit & the cost is severe the benefit, though good, is minimal.\n\n\nIt's not that we're not catching them. It's like stating we should go into full hot war to protect Ukraine. Is what Russia did to Ukraine terrible? Yes. Should we risk nuclear war? No. Same with South Korea. It is ineffective & more destructive. We know every one of these is doing it but we do not have the political influence to have any high chance of suvvess & enforcing it only when it is politically convenient to you is far worse & actually directly damages the nation much more heavily. Without enforcement you have politicians lying, big shocker, holy crap it's the end of the world. With partial enforcement you select & choose which politicians are allowed to lie.\n\nI'm talking about practicality & real politik. I do not like it, but this is the reality of the situation.",

The hosts asked about allegations laid out by Danielle Sassoon, a U.S. attorney who claimed in a blistering resignation letter that the dropping of Adams\u2019s charges amounted a quid pro quo for his cooperation with the Trump administration. Adams quickly rejected those claims.\n\n>\u201cThink about my attorney Alex Spiro, one of the top trial attorneys in the country. Imagine him going inside saying that, \u2018the only way Mayor Adams is going to assist in immigration\u2019\u2014-which I was calling for since 2022\u2014-\u2019is if you drop the charges.\u2019 That\u2019s quid pro quo. That\u2019s a crime,\u201d he said.\n\n>Adams continued, \u201cIt took her three weeks to report in front of her a criminal action? Come on, this is silly.\u201d",
