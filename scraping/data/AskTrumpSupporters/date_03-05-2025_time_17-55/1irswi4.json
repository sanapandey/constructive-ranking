If Canadians respected Trudeau, he wouldn't have resigned.   Trump never suggested invading Canada.  That's all the left desperate for anything to throw at Trump.\n\nTrump's job isn't to bring Americans together.   His job is to make good on campaign promises.  He looks like he's making a serious effort on more campaign promises in 3 weeks than Biden attempted in 4 years.   So he's off to a good start.",

Trump has referenced and reiterated the 51st state multiple times at this point. In fact, he has referenced taking multiple pieces of land, from Greenland, to Canada, to even Gaza.

That's an opinion, and one that Canadians themselves have debated off and on for a couple centuries.   It's disingenuous to suggestion that voicing that opinion is a signal that he intends on a military invasion.   \n\nGreenland Trump wants to buy it from Denmark.   It's not an unreasonable goal.   \n\nGaza, Trump has proposed the only long term solution which ends the fighting in Gaza.  It is unworkable, because no one will take the Palestinians, but no one else is suggesting anything which has any possibility of happening.   What will happen is far worse to the Palestinians than Trump's suggestion of relocation, and I think it's very sad that Trump is being attacked for what would save lives.  \n\nWhat should Canadians do?  Stop reading lies about what Trump has said, and listen to his actual statements.  Canadian media is flat out lying to their people, and Trump isn't responsible for that.  That's something Canadians will have to choose to fix.",

If so - where does it go then to benefit the American public?\n\nA proper audit of an Government of our size and power cannot be speed run in a matter of weeks and have any shred of a hope of being thorough.\n\nWhen Clinton announced the creation of the National Performance Review with the goal of downsizing \"to make the entire Federal Government both less expensive and more efficient, and to change the culture of our national bureaucracy away from complacency and entitlement toward initiative and empowerment.\"\n\n**Here's some key differences:**\u00a0The review lasted six months, and made 384 recommendations to improve the federal bureaucracy. The implementation of those policies took a lot longer, and some **required legislation to be passed through Congress.**\n\nThey even offered buyouts too! But the buyouts offered by Clinton's NPR ( national performance review) and Trump and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency are not the same. Clinton's buyout plan had overwhelming bipartisan support from Congress, and the law was signed after a review period. Meanwhile, Trump and Musk offered the buyouts\u00a0just one week into Trump's term,\u00a0with no review process.\u00a0\n\nIt took a long time to proper audit and assess where to make changes and how to adjust the remaining workforce. The layoff in total, almost 500k employees. It was done thoughtfully and over time.\n\npeople were also not falsely accused of and being illegally let go for 'poor performance' despite having documentation to the contrary - something that could cripple their career outside of the federal workforce and make them ineligible to ever work for the government again in the future.\n\nI am not against the Government being improved or made more efficient where it can I am against it being done unlawfully and in a manner that just breaks things along the way with no accountability and no communications outlining each step of the way.\n\nIt also bothers me that so many people seem to cheer along unlawful process.",

My question was about why you would think that.  It looks like you think only men, and only modern men, are human.  Others are vaguely human.  Women can talk about how bad their abuse has been, but they work, so maybe that is not a problem (still unclear whether women are human per your list).  Rather than calling you a xenophobic low intellectual person, I asked you what you meant. \n\nAgain.  What do you mean?  Should I assume you are not very widely traveled and probably not very open minded?  That you are likely a white male between 18-45? Possibly have a high school diploma?  \n\nIs the earth flat?

Are women not human, or maybe they live on the underside with the vague non human people?\n\nYou see?\n\nYour comment list is full of unbelievably awful and silly things so I have made a series of assumptions about you.

I figured you meant something else maybe, so I asked you if we are not all human]\n-Feminism, equality, and equity.\nMainly in the sense that we are all the same in ability. Women should absolutely be valued, and I support portions of feminism (like women showing horrifying harassment) [this is where I assumed you meant working women, but maybe not?]\n\n\nHere is what you said to my are we not all human:\n\u201cSure, in some vague sense.\nBut I\u2019m clearly talking about how the modern global man identifies with being human before being their own culture.\u201d\n\nWhat on earth does that mean?  I asked you and you asked me back.  I know you don\u2019t care about what I assumed from what you wrote.  I was trying to give you a chance to explain it.  But maybe you don\u2019t want to?\n\nFwiw, I ask about rights because at a glance it looks as if you think there are people who are not human, following that, have no human rights.  Just tying it together as written and trying to pin down how that would make everything \u201cbetter\u201d.",
