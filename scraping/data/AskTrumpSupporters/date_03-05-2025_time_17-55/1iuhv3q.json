    "selftext": "Why support Israel but not Ukraine?\n\nGenuine question. If we take the premise of not wasting American tax-payer dollars on Ukraine\u2019s war, then what\u2019s the argument to support Israel? \n\nTo me, the argument to supporting either are two sides of the same coin. For Israel, \u201cthe only democracy in the middle-east\u201d against a repressive authoritarian Iran. For Ukraine, we back a democracy against the expansionist Russia. Thus, If American tax payer dollars should not be wasted on Ukraine, then shouldn\u2019t the GOP be equally concerned about Netanyahu? Yet the stance of the party is to remain a staunch ally to Israel.\n\nAnd what makes Zelensky a dictator compared to Netanyahu?\n",

And supporting Ukraine is not particularly expensive.  A great deal of hardware we have given is older equipment, much of which would have cost to dispose of or regenerate as components expired.  It also brought into the glaring light just how under prepared we (and Europe) are to manufacture arms.  Something that occasionally go mentioned but never taken seriously.  Fortunately this has been getting addressed. \n\nRussia fights the US anywhere they can, by supporting Iran, cyber attacks/espionage.  We are not in a conventional war with them, but they are very much engaged in non-conventional war with US.  Isolation, as much as I like the concept, will hurt us in the long run.",

On the first anniversary of the attacks, a protester at Columbia University, marching with a noisy throng through the center of campus, held aloft a sign that included drawings of a paraglider, an inverted red triangle, and the message, \u201cLONG LIVE THE AL-AQSA FLOOD / GLORY TO THE RESISTANCE.\u201d\n\nAt a welcome dinner for new students at an off-campus restaurant, the group was met by pro-Palestinian protesters from their school, chanting loudly on the sidewalk. Herzlinger said the Jewish students were called \u201cbaby killers\u201d and \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nFor weeks, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, one of the pro-Palestinian groups on campus, has taken a harder tone across its communication channels. On Substack, the group has praised the leadership of Hamas, Hezbollah and Ansarallah (more commonly known as the Houthis), all Iranian-backed groups designated by the United States as terrorist organizations.",

Ukraine agrees to some negotiated settlement based on the current front lines, give or take.

No amount of funding will stop this.\n\nMy family has sent people to fight in WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, and Afghanistan. Some were sent home in body bags, others were sent home missing limbs, and others with life long mental health issues. Nobody came home unscathed.\n\nI have 2 nephews in the military. I will never advocate that they should be sent to the other side of the world to die because Europe refuses to send their children.\n\nWhich leaves 2 and 3.\n\nRegarding Palestine there are also only a few outcomes:\n\n1. Palestine regains all its territory. This requires Isreal from simply pulling back and some sort of security agreement that they will no longer aggress towards Isreal. The UN tried to do this and failed, so likely the security agreement would require the US, since Europe is not willing to send their children to die in the region.\n2. Palestine agrees to some negotiated settlement. Which at this point I believe is total capitulation. Isreal will no longer allow Palestine to murder its citizens.\n3. Palestine continues to fight until they run out of people to die. No amount of funding will stop this.\n4. The US takes over the territory, secures it, and sells the prime real estate to US developers. American are offered high paying over seas jobs, and security is maintained by the US military.
