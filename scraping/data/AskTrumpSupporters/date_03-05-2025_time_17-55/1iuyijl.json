Contrast with someone like Bill Gates who is also rich/powerful, but sits on the opposite side of the more representative framework. Neither side is inherently preferable nor predictive based solely on one's wealth/power (though how one goes about accumulating wealth/power absolutely drives inherent preferences and *is* predictive).\n\nBringing this back to the initial post, the \"power elite\" who I believe OP is referring to is the intersection of rich/powerful and centralized power/government control.",

Now, posts criticizing Musk, Trump, etc repeatedly make it to the top of X feeds. Your claim seems like a pure projection of the exact thing that was happening prior to Musk's takeover.",

Protect us from things like BLM & Antifa terrorism and corruption so we don't see a 2020 repeat. Handle Cartel mass rape, human smuggling, mass immigration racket they run with Democrat help so that they can't turn the USA into Mexico style \"politics\". I'd also like to see justice done with the \"Russia collusion\" Hoax.\n\nProbably some of the biggest threats domestically are going to be against Trump supporters and workers trying to clean out corruption, fraud and waste at all levels of the Federal Apparatus. So I want FBI to protect that democratic process of a transfer of power from terrorists who would stoop to using violence to try and hold onto political power. There's a lot of money at stake that evil people are suddenly going to be losing out on. I don't doubt FBI will need to help to protect the will of the people and their agents of the election.\n\nAs for intra-FBI, I hope he cleans it up. Roots out the Democrat Loyalists who hate democracy and think they're above the law and elections. Get it back on track with higher principles than how Dems and past people have ran it.",
