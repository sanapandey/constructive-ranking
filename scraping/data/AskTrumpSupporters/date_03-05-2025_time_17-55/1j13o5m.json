    "selftext": "Obviously there are carry over effects of the previous administration on the current economic outlook, amongst other things. Obama inherited a recession but at a certain point he couldn\u2019t blame Bush for the state of the economy anymore. Trump inherited the wars in Ukraine and Gaza but after a certain point the state of our role in those wars lie solely with his administration. In your mind, how long before Trump can stop using the Biden administration as an excuse for the state of the country?",

Either prices will be down from where they were or they wont.

Last month, Border Patrol recorded about 8,450 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country unlawfully between official entry points along the U.S.-Mexico border, the statistics show. On some days during a record spike in illegal crossings under the Biden administration, Border Patrol recorded more than 8,000 apprehensions in a single day. February's total, which could be adjusted when the government officially publishes the statistics, would be the lowest monthly apprehensions tally recorded by Border Patrol since at least fiscal year 2000, the last period with public monthly data. The final tallies usually don't deviate much from the preliminary figures. Over the past 25 years, the only time monthly apprehensions came close to the level recorded in February was in April 2017, when Border Patrol apprehended 11,000 migrants at the southwest border, agency data show. While monthly data before fiscal year 2000 is not publicly available, the last time Border Patrol averaged roughly 8,000 apprehensions per month over a year was in fiscal year 1968, according to historical statistics.\"",

Corporate investment growth remained roughly in line with previous trends rather than spiking as promised. A Congressional Research Service study from 2019 also found that wage and investment growth did not show a significant long-term boost beyond what would normally be expected.\n\nIn other words the money was used to make the corporations, those running them and those whom held positions in them, richer.

Don Lemon was doing his man on the street interview and asked a Trump voter why they were voting and they said because of the economy, to which he said that economists are saying the economy is doing really well and got laughed at in his face.\n\nWe all knew things were bad, and people were employed desperately trying to figure out how to make ends meet. As tired as the \"price of eggs\" argument is it spoke to the financial pressures being put on the average American. The statistics being flaunted by the government and by the media for why Trump is totally the wrong choice on the economy were absolute bullshit compared to the American experience and voters knew it which is why the economy was the #1 concern voters had.\n\n> Do you give Biden any credit for getting us back to the downward trend started under Obama\n\nMaybe very little if any. Unemployment numbers are a red herring, just like CPI numbers. I look at my bank account and my lifestyle to judge how well things are going. Lower unemployment is irrelevant if people are getting jobs just to survive or making life decisions based on a poor financial outlook. \n\nEven if the unemployment numbers under Biden were fantastic and there was no issue with how it was determined, the rest of his policies resulted in a quantifiably worse economy.",

California, one of the most severely restrictive states in regards to Covid, opened in January of 2021 and announced full reopening by June that year.\n\nWe gloss over things like Biden vowing to end fossil fuels, his energy secretary appearing on Fox and saying that the administration planned to begin the transition off fossil fuel to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the electric vehicle mandate. These things drove energy prices up as oil and LNG producers were hesitant to expand production not knowing if they'd get a return on the investment or be put out of business. When energy costs go up so do prices.\n\nBiden's fiscal policies were also terrible. His Covid relief policies and the infrastructure bill added trillions of USD to the economy and further inflated our currency.\n\nWeak foreign policy and instability increased the cost of imports and exports.\n\nSo on and so on.\n\nEven if at best we could say Biden inherited a bad economic situation and brought things back up it's clear his policies kept us from being where we could have been.

It'd be more accurate to say that market pressures overcame government intervention in oil than to suggest Biden economic policies didn't have a negative effect.\n\nCanceling the Keystone XL pipeline clearly has a negative impact on energy costs. Methane fees have a negative impact on energy costs. Moratoriums on oil and gas leases has a negative impact on energy costs.\n\nI agree the Ukraine war had an impact on global oil and gas prices, and that's something owed to weak Biden foreign policy as well as trade disruption causes by Houthi rebels.\n\n> Crude oil outputs hit record highs in 2023 and natural gas production outpaced Trump\n\nLiterally because the Biden administration started reversing policies that raised energy costs. They increased onshore drilling permits, and producers found methods to increase efficiency rather than expand operations. In 2024 there were fewer active oil rigs but the rigs that were active were exceeding previous production records due to technological and efficiency advances. As it turns out most the industrialized world being forced to not use Russian oil and gas is a real big boon for the competing companies.\n\nBiden was begging oil producers to increase production in early 2022, blaming high margins for lower production and not his policies that discouraged production.\n\nI've said it before and it's something you guys seem to struggle understanding but environment impacts business greatly. Oil producers were slow to return to production because there was uncertainty about the future. When Biden was talking about ending fossil fuels and pushing methane taxes and canceling leases it obviously makes oil producers cautious about overinvesting at the risk of losing their investment. \n\nThe stock market shot up the day after Trump's election because investors were confident in a deregulated environment with a more predictable outlook that would encourage businesses to expand. If you own a business you're more likely to make a calculated risk to expand operations if you don't think the government is going to intervene in your industry in the next 4 years.\n\n> How do you believe Bidens infrastructure policies and Covid relief policies caused inflation across the globe?\n\nI didn't say that global inflation was caused by Biden. There were a variety of factors contributing to global inflation being worse than in the US. For one thing the US had better industry and infrastructure to bounce back from supply shortages that were felt on a global scale. Most countries don't have the domestic energy production the US has and felt the effects of the Ukraine war and OPEC prices more acutely. Weaker currencies than the USD experienced worse inflation due to rising import costs, in part because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 2022. Other countries had similarly broad covid relief expenses but weaker economies than the US to begin with and so had worse recovery. A drop in grain imports from Ukraine made food more expensive globally while the US is a major food producer so wasn't as effected by shortages. Foreign central banks were even slower to raise interest rates than the Federal Reserve was.\n\nThe reason the US fared better than most the rest of the world is because we were already better off than most the rest of the world and are major producers of all the things that the rest of the world imports. Do you really expect the UK, France or Japan to have as good or better results than the US when each of those nations would be among the poorest states in the US if they were made US states?\n\nIt's a testament to the strength and resilience of the US economy, not a credit to Biden's policies.",

You won't even concede to that point so the rest of the discussion is irrelevant.\n\nCovid was not causing problems economically in 2022. It was Biden's day 1 policies and the infrastructure bill that accelerated inflation and led to high energy costs.\n\nYou can't honestly tell me Biden making his policy position a reduction of fossil fuels encourages more production vs a deregulatory environment. You can't honestly tell me that covid lockdowns caused high fuel prices in 2024 when the last lockdowns ended in 2021. Covid was over by December 2020.\n\n> Trumps economy pre Covid really just continued the trend we had seen from Obama\n\nNo, that's another lie being pushed by the left. Obama had the slowest recession recovery in history, Trump policies accelerated the post-recession recovery. Deregulatory environments lead to job growth. Tax reductions lead to job growth. This isn't up for debate; it's what happened.\n\n> and was showing some major signs of slowing in 2019 due in part to some of Trumps policies.\n\nNo, it was due to the global economic environment and the Fed raising rates. The stock market was still at record highs, unemployment at record lows and wages for Americans were rising. Again, everyone who was alive in 2019 knows it was the best economy they'd experienced in a decade.\n\n> I would say I was much better off in 2016 when Obama left office than in 2020 when Trump left office.\n\nBecause democrats pushed extreme covid restrictions that the Trump administration opposed. They tanked the economy just so Trump couldn't run on a strong economy. It wasn't Trump policies that resulted in economic downturn and Trump policies would have accelerated the recovery.\n\n> It\u2019s like saying Coolidge was a better president than FDR \n\nIt's actually a perfect example because FDR policies prolonged the Depression. The Coolidge economy was very strong and contemporaries called it \"The Coolidge Prosperity\". \n\nBiden monetary and fiscal policies, regulations and energy policy prolonged the economic downturn from covid and slowed recovery. In fact I would even object to the use of the word \"recovery\" in this context as the American economy didn't recover under Biden; it stayed below Trump levels.\n\nThis is exactly what I was calling out: using favorable government statistics to push the Democrat narrative in the face of common sense and observable reality. It's insidious and right out of the 1984 playbook, \"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command...\"",

You\u2019re trying to lay all of that at Bidens feet while ignoring any sort of indication that he was successful.

Also, won't the tax cuts for the rich and tarrifing our biggest trading partners make inflation go back up?\n\nWell depends on what we're talking about. \n\nTax cuts on corporations actually reduce inflation (at least consume inflation) as it makes less costs pass on to the consumers.\n\nTarrifs can raise prices to be sure but the effects can be minimized by corperate tax cuts. All Tarrifs are to be clear are a tax, just like any other tax corporations may or may not pass that cost onto the consumers or pay bit the bullet depending on profit margin and competition in their market. \n\nTax cuts on individuals could indeed cause some inflation but the tax cuts most likely to do that are the ones which go to the working class rather then the wealthy as these people most effect the consumer market.\n\nl support the tax cuts for the poor to btw just pointing it out. The pro and con of wealth inequality is tax cuts for the rich rarely effect inflation muchh because the wealth is concentrated in so few highly stable long term investments and thus velocity of the currency is so slow.\n\nlts why housing for instance drastically out paces the inflation of everything else in the economy as thats one of the few things wealthy people actually invest in that effects the normal economy.",

That is not the take of a wealthy Trump supporting businessman I know, who posted the following about how trip deal fell apart: \nyour thoughts??\n\n\u201cLooking back at JD Vance\u2019s berating of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy yesterday about diplomacy with Russia\u2014only for Trump to jump in and repeatedly say, \u201cYou don\u2019t hold the cards\u201d\u2014we actually witnessed Trump losing The Deal in real time, in his office, in-front of America and the world.\n\nThe entire discussion about the Ukraine minerals deal unfolded in the last 10 minutes before the agreement was set to be signed and before lunch. In those crucial moments, Trump made his pitch: Let\u2019s take $500 billion of your minerals, we\u2019ll invest in your infrastructure, sign now, and trust me\u2014I\u2019ll get Putin to a peace deal.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: Trump explicitly ruled out future U.S. weapons support. His entire offer rested on trust me and trust diplomacy. He kept insisting, \u201cYou don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d repeating it so much that Zelenskyy mockingly replied, \u201cI\u2019m not playing cards.\u201d\n\nAnd then came the real moment of failure. Frustrated that Zelenskyy wouldn\u2019t yield, Trump let his emotions get the better of him. In an amateur move, he abruptly told Zelenskyy to leave the White House\u2014blowing a $500 billion deal in just 10 minutes. It could be one of the fastest losses of money in history.\n\nAnd the irony? Zelenskyy\u2019s refusal didn\u2019t just block a bad deal\u2014it awakened Europe and Canada, pushing them to step up and potentially shape a stronger NATO-like alliance that could counter Russia more effectively.\n\nTrump, the self-proclaimed \u201cgreatest dealmaker,\u201d got outmaneuvered\u2014by a former actor turned wartime president. His much-touted Art of the Deal? More like The Art of Losing a Deal.\n\nAmerica lost this round. Europe won. And let\u2019s be real: the idea that the U.S. would ever go into \u201cbusiness\u201d with Moscow is a non-starter\u2014voters would never allow it. So in the end, Trump lost, in his own White House, in front of the world. And that\u2019s the real headline.\n\nAsk yourself this question, who wanted \u201cthis deal more? Trump or Zelenskyy? The answer is Trump, and if Trump can still remember the Art of the deal, \u201cRUSSIA KILLS, and Time Kills all deals. So there you have it. \u201c\n\nHow do you feel about this take, from a fellow deal maker?",

Alot of people on the left were clammering for waaaaaay more stimulous then we actually did (which we saw many european countries do which is why to your point we had lower inflation then them).\n\nThe reason l give Biden more blame for the inflation we suffered is just that he felt the need to do stimulous AFTER the unemployment crisis (and the recession) had passed:\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n\nMake no mistake, we were gona have inflation because of covid stimulous either way.\n\nlf Biden had done less spending though in his first year we may have avoided the HlGHEST inflation rate in 40 years.\n\nThat said tho its probably also fair to give Biden some credit for not spending MORE (as many in his party wanted him to) making inflation worse.\n\n(Joe Manchin probably also deserves some credit in this regard lol.)",

Statistically the danger to most communities comes from folks born here. I get the drug issue however people need to recognize that there is market here for those drugs. Tackle the market and naturally the flow will go elsewhere. \n\nOn the Ukraine issue, yes he pulled aid to Ukraine which was just that, aid. Why isn't aid pulled from Israel.... Our intelligence is just as good as theirs.... The regional conflict between Israel and Palestine will continue long after our descendants are gone, but the Ukraine issue is likely shirt lived if handled correctly. The trump administration threw a tantrum because Ukraine didn't give up their minerals, which Trump would have handed to Russia in exchange for a withdrawal that they wouldn't uphold anyways. \n\nI get the arguments for pulling out of climate accords, I don't agree but I get it. You or I may not see the benefits but on the chance climate deregulation leads to more natural disaster as a result of pollution, then the story may be different.\n\nThe WHO does do things for the whole world, including the US. Their research in virology and prevention helps keep outbreaks to a minimum. \n\nIn terms of government waste, I can agree that the government wastes a shit ton of money but firing everyone is not making things better. A potential way to go about it is to see where the water is and tackle the issue not to fire all the staff lol. An example, everyone knows that our welfare system is horribly abused. Start by looking into folks who ask for welfare and if they can somehow afford a brand new car then cut them off. But\n\nAgain, not rhetorical but how is the government running more efficiently today? \n\n\nI just don't see trump being that good of a president, I'm sorry. Yes, he keeps his word but bad policy is bad policy, no matter the political party.",

My job and persnal finances soard from 2018 - 2021 thanks to Trump era policies, tax reforms, etc.  3. My job vanished thanks largely to the Biden economy (while not a direct action - the economic climate created by his, or whomever was running things for him's policies ruined a good run).  4. The Biden administration went to great lengths to push policy that was and would have been very personally harmful (closing the Keystone pipeline project, and other acts that drove energy prices high, making functional appliances unavailable, attempting to ban gas stoves, plans to expire the Trump tax cuts, raising corporate tax rate to name a few).  5.

Agriculture and construction to name the biggest two. Nearly a quarter of all construction workers in the US are undocumented. Between 40-70 percent of agricultural workers are undocumented. Both of those industries also have substantial workers shortages. What this means is that deporting immigrants will directly lead to increased construction costs and food prices. Immigrants, regardless of legal status, also commit crimes at substantially lower rates than Americans. So to my eyes, there are LITERALLY no upsides to deporting millions of them.\n\nTariffs (a topic Trump fundamentally seems to not understand) are a tax on Importers. They\u2019re a tax on YOU. They will directly raise the prices you pay for nearly everything. You may think they may onshore millions of jobs, but that only works if you also INVEST into the specific sectors you\u2019re trying to bolster. Across the board Tariffs are a net negative in almost every single way and any economist will tell you that. Trump\u2019s agricultural tariffs on China in his first term were an abject failure and resulted in us having to subsidize farmers to the tune of $12 billion dollars to prevent them from going bankrupt. And that was just for a handful of products. Across the board tariffs would almost certainly be RUINOUS. \n\n1 trillion invested into US is purely speculative at this point so there\u2019s no way to comment on that currently.\n\nOil and natural gas production was at an all time high under Biden. I would argue increasing our reliance on and use of oil and natural gas will only serve to accelerate climate change, which will hurt everyone, but I\u2019m sure you think climate science is fake and gay, so I guess that one is subjective lmao. \n\n\u201cstopping people from mutilating their bodies\u201d and \u201censuring men do not enter womens sports\u201d are culture war distractions that quite literally don\u2019t affect your life in any measurable way. \n\nSo again, I\u2019m left wondering, why is it so hard for you guys to point to specific things that unequivocally improved your material conditions? I can very easily do that with Biden. He capped the cost of insulin which was life changing for multiple people I know. He allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices which allowed my friend\u2019s grandmother to finally afford a medication she desperately needed. He raised the minimum wage for federal workers which finally allowed a buddy of mine to afford his own place. Now, I\u2019m no fan of Biden lol, but those are examples of tangible things that I could see and feel in my life.",

In fact the democrat strategy seems to be to let Trump have his way as a few months of his policies will break a lot of Americans livelihood as he continues to siphon money to his cronies in the name of \"smaller government\". Even recent tax cuts are specifically for the rich while taxes will increase for those making less than around 400k (I forget the exact number).\n\nHow long can Republican politicians continue to pretend they have nothing to do with the economy as they continue to gut the most helpful programs and pocket money in a more greedy fashion than Dems?",
