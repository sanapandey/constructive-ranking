The guy himself is a joke from South Africa that came with a silver spoon in his mouth. Once again yes I support major cuts. But not Musk himself as a person. He bought the presidency and is trying to overtake other countries as well. I don't know why this issue isn't being discussed at more lengths than it currently is.",

He does seem to want to help the country but only as far as his own interests take him. An efficient government aligns with his own self interests and the interests of the American people. \n\nIn all honesty can people from all over the world not see how very much government waste there truly is? Id bet good money that a lot of the programs wasting taxpayer money is just money laundering. My only question is where is that money actually going? And to whom?\n\nAlso because there are people who dislike Trump , they dislike everyone who will associate with him equally. Up until Musk joined up with Trump, or bought Twitter, no one truly cared what Musk did for a living , and democrats and liberals gleefully bought his electric vehicles. I think that's why we get these \"do I trust ( XXXXX - insert name here ) \" gotcha questions all the time.",

When have you held 1 million dollars in your hands? The number is actually inconceivable to most people , some have held 5 figures but they have never held 6 figures in their hands much less 7 figures. Billions defies what the average person understands about money , trillions is an oxymoron at that point. \n\nYou need a very big briefcase filled with $100 bills to carry a million. It would be quite heavy. We go through 20 briefcases of money an hour in America. Do you think someone out there might be trying to steal , skim off the top , or even waste money out there in the world that isn't there's? It happens far too much these days especially with trillion dollar debts. You cannot justify waste like that and be good stewards of the taxpayer dollar.",

Are you saying our spending per capita on health is not as high as other developed nations and so we should spend more? Does it worry you that we have had an huge increase in maternal mortality rates?\n\nDo you not think it good to have a global organization that helps countries deal with health incidents such as viral outbreaks?\n\nCan you explain your understanding of soft power? Do you think it\u2019s ineffective or just doesn\u2019t exist in diplomacy? \n\nWe have US citizens suffering, so you are for the increase in health and social safety nets to help suffering citizens? Does that require an increase in federal spending?",

I don't think pouring money into the problem of poverty does anything to reduce it long term, economic opportunities does decrease it. Similarly I don't think the problem with healthcare is that we spend to little on it, I think we spend too much, and if we can focus on making healthcare less expensive, by for instance allowing foreign doctors to practice in the US, reducing the cost of education so that it's easier for more US citizens to become medical professionals, and start scrutinizing our pharmaceutical and insurance industries, and get Americans healthier, we can spend less on healthcare, have better health outcomes while feeding up money to go into other sectors of the economy that will improve our global competitiveness.",

Without the coordinating between southern hemisphere and northern hemisphere health departments it would be much harder to track the mutations in the virus and develop a updated vaccine. \n\nPlus the whole thing is really cheap for a super national organisation, the US was contributing less than 1 billion dollars...

If the pharmaceutical industry wants to make a safe and effective flu vaccine for international distribution it should be on their own dime. If they want to do it with minimal expense they'll form a standards committee on the flu vaccine that will do the same thing since there is little room for competition in the flu vaccine market anyway.\n\nThe WHO overplayed it's hand with the proposed \"pandemic agreement\" and proposing a global lockdown in response to the COVID 19 pandemic which has had disastrous effects on the world.",

We can't just keep taking on debt to compensate for this spending, and it would seem that the country was more prosperous when it wasn't taxing and spending as much, not to mention how in many areas our spending has made places more dangerous, not less, as I'm reminded of our abandonment of military equipment in Afghanistan.",

To some extent it could have hastened its demise, but the demise was inevitable. Genuine dissent does not need encouragement from the outside, and in most cases it actually de-legitimizes it. For instance, if we find that a politician or political speaker receives a lot of money from some foreign country, we look at them with more skepticism because we question if they are representing our interests or the interests of some foreign power. The same is the case for US funding overseas. \n\nHell, TENET media didn't even receive money from the Russian government but by some Russian millionaires, unknowingly I might add, and they were practically discredited by most people for it. \n\nThe communists were doing a good enough job limiting their own growth, and we see a similar pattern with other socialist countries around the world.

But, there were many proxy wars that we did fight in, Korea, Afghanistan (Mujahideen), Vietnam, Nicaragua, Cuba, El Salvador, etc, so there was plenty of hard power that played a role as well. Plus, the US's defense buildup under Reagan definitely had a large role in bankrupting the Soviet Union, and that had nothing to do with soft power or hard power. \n\nBy the way, I'm not saying that we should be in the habit of repeating our hard power moves during the Cold war or repeating the Reagan defense buildup, I cite those examples to show that soft power was not a principle cause of the Soviet collapse, and to the extent it was a factor it was a minor one.",

Which Americans are impoverished due to medical bills incurred during a cancer treatment? Is there not a question of wait times in the US vs other similar single payer nations? Is there not an issue of chronic health issues that is driving up costs of healthcare in the US that other countries don't deal with. \n\nThe pharma companies is an entirely separate issue since even under a single payer system, the drugs and other health services are still bought from the pharmaceutical industry, and Congress can regulate the industry without imposing a single payer healthcare system as they've already done with the cost of insulin. If you read my other comments in this thread I've laid out my position which I think is coherent. Someone else who came in to disagree with it has already come around on my view. \n\nIn my opinion all a single payer system would do is create an incestuous relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the state, and their profits would increase, not decrease.",

Elon runs a social media company that mines personal data and sells it off. Now he\u2019s just been given the mother load of personal and financial information. I\u2019m unaware of any restrictions in place prior to Elon receiving the keys to that treasure trove that would prevent Elon from misusing American\u2019s private personal and financial information for his own benefits. A leak of all this private data would be catastrophic. And anything done to Elon after he\u2019d already done the harm would be too late. Which is why Elon\u2019s detractors are concerned. So is there some intimate knowledge you possess that doesn\u2019t make you worried? Have you heard of some protections in place that others may not have? What makes you so confident Elon won\u2019t do anything nefarious?",

But there were a few fresh faces. \n\nAmong them: Bill and Melinda Gates, who gave a combined $500,000. Republican megadonor and Citadel hedge fund titan Ken Griffin also gave $500,000 to the inaugural committee, more than the $100,000 he gave to Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural committee in 2017. Ahead of the 2020 election, Griffin was one of the largest political donors in the country, pouring more than $45 million into super-PACs supporting Republicans in Congress. Hearing aid billionaire Bill Austin, who with his wife gave $1 million to a Trump joint fundraising committee in 2020, donated $100,000 to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.  \n\n>Do you think it's a coincidence that Trump converged with Musk's opinions on H1B after he started supporting him?\n\nNo I think Musk made a compelling case regarding the weak and terrible work ethic of the younger American generations.",

A real audit is done by neutral, qualified professionals\u2014not by a billionaire and his tech bros playing government.\n\nIndependent means free from control, influence, or bias. Musk is literally running DOGE\u2014he is NOT independent. Musk CANNOT audit something he controls. He\u2019s both the investigator and the enforcer, which means there\u2019s no oversight, no neutrality, and no accountability. A real audit requires an independent party, not the person running the system deciding what gets investigated and what actions to take. This is just Musk policing himself, not an audit. Just because you looked up the definition of an audit doesn\u2019t mean that you know what it entails.\n\nQualified means having the expertise, credentials, and legal authority to conduct an audit. That includes certified accountants, government auditors, and compliance officers. Musk doesn\u2019t have a CPA, isn\u2019t attending DOJ oversight meetings, and is doing this with unqualified people. If he actually knew what he was doing and wanted to get credibility, why wouldn\u2019t he show up to those meetings? \n\nThis isn\u2019t even an internal review because Musk isn\u2019t a government employee. He doesn\u2019t have security clearance and has zero legal authority to access federal systems. If anyone else did this, they\u2019d be arrested as a security threat.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s just Musk and a bunch of teenagers rummaging through federal systems with no oversight, no accountability, and no clue what they\u2019re doing. This isn\u2019t about transparency or efficiency\u2014it\u2019s about a billionaire grabbing power while everyone looks the other way.\n\nElon Musk said, \u201cIf I mess up, we can always just go back.\u201d That might work for a small company, but not for the federal government. This isn\u2019t Twitter\u2014it\u2019s Medicare, Social Security, and national security. If he screws up, people suffer, and there\u2019s no reset button.\n\nSome people seem to think one guy can run the entire U.S. government like a startup. That\u2019s not how this works. The U.S. has over 336 million people and is the size of Europe. Unlike Europe, where countries operate independently, the U.S. is one nation with states that rely on a central federal government.\n\nThere are over 400 departments, agencies, and sub-agencies because running a country this size takes coordination. You can\u2019t just \u201ccut the red tape\u201d and expect everything to function. Government exists because managing something this massive requires structure, expertise, and oversight.\n\nThe proof is literally on X! It\u2019s right there in front of you! It\u2019s your choice whether you choose to see it.",

Despite Tesla\u2019s long-term vision for autonomous driving and robotics, short-term fundamentals have investors cautious.\n\n> Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas joins Morning Brief to discuss Tesla's latest results, citing optimism for growth in the company and uncertainty in the company's near-term outlook.\n\n> He highlights that Tesla missed its 2024 delivery guidance and did not commit to its 2025 growth targets: \"Objectively, we weren't that excited about the results and some of the near-term commentary left us less than nourished. I mean, for first, they basically didn't commit to their 20 to 30% growth guidance for 2025.\"\n\n> \"They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter,\" he says, calling the results \"kind of squishy.\"\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/teslas-q4-earnings-miss-investors-163537869.html\n\n> But gross profits fell by 1 percent, with net profits falling by a huge 53 percent to $7.1 billion for the year, making this Tesla's worst year since 2021, when it made just $5.5 billion in profit. Free cash flow dropped 18 percent during the year to $3.6 billion. Delving into the profit and loss statement, $2.8 billion of that profit came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers, not from selling cars or even supercharger access.\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/teslas-2024-financial-results-are-out-and-theyre-terrible/",

Making fewer calls is not particularly meaningful... as they're all batched together. It's like saying that manually inlining all your function calls into one giant method is simplifying the program. OK sure, you now have only 1 function 'main' - but it's now 1 million lines and impractical to debug or modify... or have multiple people work on it concurrently.\n\nAs well, simplicity is not inherently \"good\" in computer science. Elegance is. A bubble sort is very simple but does not build towards a good program... especially one whose entire selling point is operating at huge scale, such as X.\n\nRPC is an acronym for remote procedure call... RPC call is akin to saying ATM machine. \n\nTaking down a bunch of micro services without understanding their purpose is what broke tons of functionality on the platform... much of which is still non functional to this day (for example, login is super broken, monetization is hosed).\n\nIf you were building a website for a local restaurant... cutting out microswrvices and RPCs is likely a great idea. The use case is simple, and it doesn't need to handle millions of requests per second. \n\nIf Twitters product was simple, it would not be valuable, because it is effectively akin to a BBS circa the 1980s. However, Twitter is actually a very complex product which is simple to use. Not the same thing at all. \n\nPretending complex systems can just be made \"more simpler\" is just an excuse to ignore the difficult bits... and is a logical fallacy that in my experience proficient software engineers are quick to spot and call out... such as the many folks who did so re: Twitter at the time.\n\nThis is the fundamental difference between programming and software engineering... but these days folks with no engineering background or training just go ahead and call themselves \"Software Engineers\" because it isn't strictly illegal to do so (like it is with other engineering disciplines which have certification processes). This isn't Musk's fault (I blame big tech/startups wanting to inflate egos), but he's really leaned into it. It's akin to if we just started calling all nurses Doctors because it'd sound more impressive.\n\nNow... not to shit on folks or gatekeep. Programmers are, in general, much more pragmatic than software engineers... less prone to \"overengineering\" (which just means, bad engineering) and often times _do_ come up with extremely elegant and practical solutions that make shit actually work in the real world.\n\nAnyways. I don't know if any of this is even relevant to the actual question posed in this post... and really isn't even specific/relevant to Musk at this point lol\n\nSo... uh... thank you for coming to my TED rant.\n\nFrom what I've gathered from ex-Twitter devs there was definitely some arrogance in the development mindset.\n\nI suppose my TLDR point is that \"unplug shit until it breaks\" is a hacker mindset that would land _real_ engineers (which software engineers are not) in prison for gross negligence.\n \nDid any of this make any sense?

Batching RPC means much more payload at once. I also want to point out microservice for the sake of microcode is an epidemic these days.

For example when musk raided the data center and used U-Haul trucks, we would think that\u2019s stupid and reckless because in the real would we can\u2019t even deploy a config change without approvals.  I\u2019m not endorsing his way of cutting fats, but I also don\u2019t think his blunt approach is complete bullshit. He can afford to unplug it and cut the crap of the workforce , and then fix the broken state. I did remember there were quite a few twitter outages since his takeover. But so what? It was fixed.  I guess my point is his approach is inhuman, blunt, but it does maximize the human potential and weed out all the entitled, half-ass, incompetent people around us, which I see on a daily basis.  Most importantly, he can run twitter with much less cost.",

Oh god, you are gonna be banned and have to apologize.\n\nTwitch also blocked new accounts from Israel on the day of jihad. Hired the person that is I charge as a chief of safety or whatnot that was fired for antisemitism from a previous job.\n\nTwitch has 0 tolerance against right wing and forgives ANYTHING, like race tier lists, 9/11 cakes, if it\u2019s on the left.\n\nSo, Twitter used to be the same, now it has left wing retards as Hasan and right wing retards as Andrew Tate. It\u2019s perfectly balanced now))) well, I mean both are represented now which is light years better than it was before\n\nTwitter was the same",

But as for a media ecosystem, you do know Fox is by and far the largest MSM source? They pull more than 3x CNN\u2019s numbers. Even if you combine all the other MSM like CNN and MSNBC together, their viewership total is still less than Fox viewer numbers. There is no Left privilege when it comes to media, it\u2019s our own algorithm bubbles we put ourselves into and with the MSM, the right wing has WAY more pull and influence. \n\nSo setting aside the fact there is no left privilege on social media or MSM, how do you feel about my original question? How do you feel about valuing the purchase of a social media platform as saving western civilization instead of more tangible and significant changes like improving the actual lives of Americans through things like better education and making having children more accessible?",

Fine do it through congress then you control both houses.\n\nThe question I have is at what point will people take off their political blinders and set aside \u201cwhat about when democrats did this\u201d and see the truth of something and speak it without trying to justify it because they\u2019re on the same \u201cteam\u201d?",

And how would you define authority\u2014and who gets to grant it? \n\n\nMusk runs SpaceX, a company that deals with highly sensitive technology and national security matters. For him to hold such a role, he must have\u2014and maintain\u2014a very high level of government security clearance. How does that square with the claim that he\u2019s operating without any recognized authority or oversight? Also, hes posting everything he finds on X. Did you know the government was spending 8million on Politico subscriptions? Well, we do now. \n\n\nAt PayPal, he managed a platform handling millions of customers\u2019 data without any major data breaches. Would someone engaged in unchecked, destructive activities with sensitive information really have that kind of proven track record in data security?\n\n\nRunning multiple companies successfully isn\u2019t the mark of a shadowy figure dabbling in conspiracies; it\u2019s evidence of a consistent ability to navigate complex regulatory and operational environments. \nDoesn\u2019t that suggest a level of expertise and respect for the structures that govern data and security, rather than a reckless or malicious intent?\n\n\n> \u201cwith a political and personal background that is unchecked digging through American data and personal information and government files in an effort to destroy them and any part of it he thinks is bad.\u201d\n\nWhere\u2019s the evidence for this assertion? Can you point to any credible source or verifiable documentation that demonstrates Musk\u2014or anyone in his team\u2014engaging in such behavior? \n\nThis claim appears to be less about facts and more a concocted narrative pushed by the liberal media, especially when it conflicts with the responsibilities and scrutiny involved in running companies like SpaceX and PayPal.\n\n\n> \u201cI think we\u2019re fucked as a country when people can\u2019t decipher reality because your side or beliefs might personally benefit from it.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t it more constructive to debate specific actions and policies rather than resorting to hyperbolic, unsubstantiated statements? Extreme language without clear evidence only detracts from the credibility of your argument.",
