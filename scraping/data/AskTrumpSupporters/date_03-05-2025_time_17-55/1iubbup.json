    "selftext": "As a European I am wondering what the image is that Trump supporters have of Europe. Obviously, Europe is not a monolithic entity and even with the European Union there is not nearly as much unity between countries as for example between the states in the USA, but broadly speaking, I have noticed a lot of negative opinions either directly from Trump, or from supporters of his. Now I know that the most extreme viewpoints are often amplified, so I don't actually believe that every Trump supporter thinks that Europe is a 'socialist hell-hole', but I have not seen a lot of nice things being said about Europe. I know this question is quite vague and not very specific, but I am looking for any and all opinions regarding politics, economy, foreign policy, our culture(s), etc.\n\nFor context, I am asking this because Trump has recently spoken out about the war in Ukraine, he has also made many remarks about the funding of shared endeavours and how Europe is not paying enough of a share compared to the USA, and while not Trump himself, Elon Musk has also made many comments about the politics/elections in the UK and Germany for example.",

            "body": "This is a good question, albeit things are going to get nuanced here.  I'll probably veer a little off-topic, but that's to be expected.  I apologize in advance for the wall of text.\n\nAs you've mentioned, Europe is very diverse culturally.  As such, it's hard to judge it as a whole, which is also something I try to bring up about the USA.  The food is largely fantastic, although I admit I'm a bit biased against snooty French dishes that rely too much on presentation.  Nearly every European I've met has been friendly and pretty wonderful people.\n\nPolitically, Europe is fractured, so I'll have to look at the EU in particular.  I have my issues with them--for one, it seems like much of the EU's military defense plan is \"get the US to bail us out,\" and that isn't really working for me.  I think they should commit to a strong united defense force and work towards that.\n\nEconomically, well, it depends.  I haven't read much lately about Greece's economic woes--have they been handled?  But much of Europe seems to have a strong economy, albeit admittedly smaller.  The continent seems to have a higher \"uniform\" standard of living than America does, at least, so that's good.\n\nIt just seems like a lot of people who are very loud online are raising their distaste for the President, and that's okay, but the doomsaying is getting a bit old.",

I've only been to NYC twice, so I don't exactly keep up on the subject of the city, to be honest.\n\nHere, the problem is that PT is really only available downtown and the few stops elsewhere require at least a fifteen minute drive to access a park and ride.  So the system doesn't get used unless you live downtown.  Furthermore, last time I checked, 45 minutes was the average commute time here.  Trying to walk that distance would be...  well, I'd have to leave tonight to get to work in the morning, you know?\n\n>Ok, but you voted for Trump so you\u2019ve supported his healthcare goals.

I'll also point out that voting for a candidate does not mean I support every policy they may bring to the table.",

Thank you for the reply!  \n  \nAmongst Europeans there are obviously a lot of internal opinions about other nations within Europe as well, and making (harmless) fun of things like the cuisine of each country is pretty commonplace.   \n  \nI do think, personally, that it is fair to say that European nations should reinforce their own defenses, but I think that the notion that the plan is to rely on the USA is somewhat influenced by the voluntary and unilateral decision by the USA to build the most well-funded, well-equipped and sizable defense force in the world. In my view, the lack of adequate defense formations in Europe is a separate issue from the USA. Nonetheless, I very much see that as a valid point of discussion regarding the international interplay of defending democracy as an ideology in and of itself.\n\nThe economy within Europe is indeed a difficult topic, even for Europeans, and many countries are doing much worse economically speaking than others. Greece has not recovered from their problems completely, but is indeed heading in an upwards direction.\n\nMaybe a more specific question, if you care to answer: what do you think of how Europe is dealing with the situation in Ukraine, versus how Trump is envisioning to solve the issue at the moment. Does it seem to you like he is blaming Ukraine, or is there another play there? And if the former is true, do you agree? And if you agree, do you think the plans by Trump to for example demand reimbursement of the investments of the USA in the form of rare earth minerals are fair?\n\nAnd what do you think of how J.D. Vance has spoken about the lack of freedom within Germany for example? Do you agree, and if so, which arguments do you think would support that notion?",

I do not mean this to sound glib at all, but while Russia and America might trade barbs, we all know that a war against Russia will be fought on European soil predominantly.  Dissuading that from happening would, logically, be more of a pressing issue for those living in Europe than those separated by oceans.\n\n>And what do you think of how J.D. Vance has spoken about the lack of freedom within Germany for example? Do you agree, and if so, which arguments do you think would support that notion?\n\nI think Germany has some laws that I disagree with in principle if not in execution..  I'm no expert on German law, by any stretch, but some of what is illegal in Germany is something that I feel infringes upon freedom of speech (which, I know, is an American thing).  Would I want to go around waving a flag from the people who killed my ancestors?  Heck no.  But I want people who support that sort of stuff to be able to do it.  It's a lot easier to see them coming that way.\n\n\\[EDIT:  A word!\\]",

Yet when we ask you to simply meet your agreed-upon obligations, you act as if we\u2019re traitors. \n\n* We've disproportionately funded the defense of Europe, while you put it in peril as you weakened your own military, gorged on cheap Russian gas, and gutted your energy security (which NATO itself flagged as Russian [subversion](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/20/russias-quiet-war-against-european-fracking/)). \n\n* And when we repeatedly [pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5MJEMHZZsI) the absurdity of this you [laughed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfJv9QYrlwg) at us and [played dumb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CvQmWoog18).

After a century of American-led reconstruction, defense, and goodwill, you don\u2019t even pretend you would reciprocate.\n\n* You push green policies that cripple industries and raise energy costs, then turn around and buy energy from the very nations you claim to oppose. Meanwhile, you lecture us about climate while relying on our exports to keep your lights on.\n\n* Economically, you're stagnant\u2014zero growth, aging populations, and industries that can\u2019t compete without protectionism, even from [each other](https://www.ft.com/content/13a830ce-071a-477f-864c-e499ce9e6065). Yet you scoff at the American economy while relying on our innovation, our financial markets, and our consumer base to keep you afloat.\n\n* Culturally, you sneer at Americans while your own societies become lifeless, self-loathing, and demoralized. You mock American patriotism but have no pride in your own nations. You openly despise Christianity, while mass-importing Islam and bending over backward to accommodate it. \n\nSo what exactly are we defending? Why should we continue to coddle you while you treat us with condescension and disdain? At some point, the one-sided relationship has to end.

Aren't regulations, when based on the legislations that are voted into existence by democratically elected government representatives the will of the people? For the sake of the argument, because I know that there is nuance, and that neither Europe as a whole nor any individual countries contain only people with the same opinions and interests, let's assume that a decent majority of Europeans is generally happy with the way the law works in Europe - Would that not make it a self-sustaining and functioning system? Now, I concede that this line of reasoning is based on the assumption that indeed, Europeans are happy with the way things are going, which in my experience is more often true than not, but I might be biased. Thus, I wonder then, would you argue that Europeans are in fact not as happy with this as I might think, based on your experience/view/knowledge, and are European governments failing us, or, instead, would you agree that perhaps Europe as a whole might be happy with themselves, and is the issue not within Europe, but with how Europe relates to the rest of the world; say for example, in how they fine American companies - which I guess would indeed make a good case for saying that Europe is exploiting other continents/countries? Or of course, am I missing a third option?\n\nLong story short, do you think that Europe is bad for Europeans primarily, or might Europe be doing well for themselves, but not so much for their global allies?\n\nAnd regarding the innovation that comes out of Europe, I think that it is difficult to compare Europe to the USA, especially regarding stuff like information technology, space exploration, the film industry and defense technology, as there is absolutely no doubt that those markets are dominated by American companies. But automotive engineering in Germany is without a doubt some of the most advanced. Many of the most promiment luxury car brands are also European. Personally, as a Dutchy, I can without a shred of doubt say that the Dutch are the absolute best of the best when it comes to hydraulic engineering. Building defences against rivers and oceans, or reclaiming land, is something that is rarely done on a large scale without consulting the Dutch. Infrastructure, urban planning, medical research, civil engineering, and even more culturally oriented markets such as architecture and fashion are all thriving markets in Europe with a lot of internationally acknowledge success to show for them. Regulation might mean that there will be fewer tech-cowboys emerging here who shoot cars into space for fun, but especially in markets where regulations are valuable to the public interest, for example the safety of people in their cars, homes, offices and on the street, European countries have some of the best industries in the world. Would you say that regulations are still hindering progress to such a degree that, perhaps in the same way as I described earlier, even while we might be content with ourselves, we are falling short of our potential, or perhaps causing more harm than good in regard to the international markets?",

                                    "body": "For the sake of the argument, let's say that people are being jailed in Europe to a significant degree for hate speech which could be argued to not fall within the category of inciting violence or demonstrably harmful to the health, safety or wellbeing of others - Your argument is that Europeans are less free in what they are allowed to say in public. That, I agree, would be a valid reason to argue that Europe is more restrictive on the topic of personal freedom in that regard. But then I wonder, if freedom of speech, which then includes the freedom to be hateful towards others, is the only metric to consider here. In the USA, people are still being jailed or are already serving sentences of sometimes decades for the posession of weed, which in Europe will land you a fine or a few weeks of detention in most countries, not to mention the ones where there isn't even a penalty for it. Within Europe we also have the right to move goods freely across borders, live, study and work across borders (without visa) - Europeans have the right to choose their healthcare provider, regardless of their insurance - We can jaywalk - We can have dual citizenship, etc. Surely, some of these things might be legal in some states, and if you think about it, there will likely be several things banned in Europe that Americans can enjoy freely. But I think the question is not who has the most freedom, but who has the most reasonable freedoms and restrictions, if you are even going to make the comparison in the first place. In general, people who are not doing harmful stuff, are not being actively restricted in their freedom in Europe. In the USA, maybe a little bit more is technically allowed, but on the other hand, breaking the law can land you in far more trouble for far less as well. People serving 10+ year sentences for things that European countries would consider lesser crimes are not uncommon, which is also pretty evident when you compare prison population statistics between Europe and the USA, and it's not the case that Europe is less safe for your average Joe to reside in because of lighter punishments causing more criminals to potentially be free. In fact, I think the USA was ranked 131st in the Global Peace Ranking in 2023, whereas half of the top 20 countries are European ones.\n\nHow would you argue that having stricter laws on what you are allowed to say constitute enough of a impedement to freedom to outweigh other freedoms that Europeans enjoy and/or the relative safety that exists within many European countries compared to the USA?\n\nIf you disagree with or can dispute any of my arugments/reasoning, please do so, because I recognize that my question is loaded with some assumptions and opinions, but considering my point of view, I would be interested in learning how you would place it within your ideas about the topic.",

Skimming through though, yeah I think as Americans we treat free speech as special because it is one of our founding values. Weed is not one, so we don't care as much (and for what it's worth, it is legal in most or at least large parts of the country anyway -- as you acknowledge, to be fair). \n\nAmericans can be dual citizens by the way, not that I consider that a positive. (\"We make it easy to have dual loyalties\" wow, great).\n\nYes, Europe is safer, primarily because the high-crime groups that commit most of the crime in America are not present (at least in the same quantities). It's not because of more lenient sentencing policies or the fact that prisoners sit around playing video games.\n\n> How would you argue that having stricter laws on what you are allowed to say constitute enough of a impedement to freedom to outweigh other freedoms that Europeans enjoy and/or the relative safety that exists within many European countries compared to the USA?\n\nI can say some things are better in America and some things are better in Europe. My argument wasn't \"America is the best at everything, they must copy us 1:1 in order to be good\". I gave examples of things that I consider big problems (immigration being one of them, and it's worse here, so that definitely wasn't the point of my comment).",

Starts in the USA and the euro govts eagerly adopt it\n\n**economy -** too many  bureaucracy and regulations and overall, not much innovation and the future looks schlerotic for the continent.
