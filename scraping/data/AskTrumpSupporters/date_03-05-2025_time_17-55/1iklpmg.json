If it\u2019s true that USAID was investigating Starlink, is it evidence of corruption that Elon Musk is tasked to use the Treasury to defund it and close it down?",

USAID isn't an investigatory agency, why would a foreign aid agency investigate a domestic company?\n\nIn reality, they USAID Investigator General was investigating whether the Starlink terminals supplied to Ukraine were used and secondly id USAID was adequately monitoring the use of the terminals\n\nThe exact wording was: \"The USAID Office of Inspector General, Inspections and Evaluations Division, is initiating an inspection of USAID\u2019s oversight of Starlink satellite terminals provided to the Government of Ukraine.\"  \n  \n\"Our objectives are to determine how (1) the Government of Ukraine used the USAID-provided Starlink terminals, and (2) USAID monitored the Government of Ukraine\u2019s use of USAID-provided Starlink terminals.\"\n\nIt's actually jarring to me to see so many news orgs report this as if Starlink was being investigated - everyone has believed it without stopping to wonder why an organisation like USAID would be investigating a domestic company? They have no fining or sanctioning powers, no subpoena power... It's just so weird to think/believe that. \n\nLink to the USAID announcement below:\n\n[https://oig.usaid.gov/node/6814](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/6814)",

The starlink terminals are tangential to the investigation.  It has nothing to do with Musk,  alleges no wrongdoing or improper profiting (indeed it has no interest in funding of any kind), and the investigation could not reasonably have any impact on SpaceX or Musk monetarily, legally, politically,  or reputationally.

Our government functions by voting to spend money it doesn't have, then voting whether or not to pay, then holding one another hostage over the debt limit to extort pork spending in hopelessly arcane omnibus spending bills, and finally by printing new cash and trying to tax the excess out of circulation.

Nobody in USAID is elected -- so aren't they an oligarchy? Aren't ALL of the organizations you cite later, oligarchy?\n\nNo. What do you think an oligarchy is? Musk has total power over government institutions here and he bought it. This is worrying because power like this should not be bought but held by the people. There is a pretense that he is there to cut wasteful spending but so far he is just unilaterally \"recommending\" to delete these entire institutions. That suddenly apparently do get deleted immediately. The government workers have clearances and answer to independent oversight. You're also completely leaving out the fact that these agencies literally *give* you your SSN number and that this sensitive data is literally part of the functional apparatus between you and the government. It is a necessity in order for these programs to even function. Introducing outside parties with no independent oversight is a breach of safety that any agency has strict guidelines for.\n\nThere are strict regulations in the access and use of this data. Why are you ok with a private citizen having the same access without these safeguards? Want to post your SSN number right here?\n\n>He doesn't make those decisions. He conducts the audit and makes recommendations to the state department (so far; later, other departments, one assumes). He very explicitly is not an arbiter, let alone SOLE arbiter. He's an agent of the executive branch, functioning correctly.\n\nIf Musk does not make the decisions then why are these agencies suddenly vanishing into thin air when he deems it so? Your argument boils down to \"Well Trump says its ok.\"\n\n\n>All of those agencies fall under the executive branch, which power is vested in the office of the President. It's the law.\n\nNo. This is false. Social Security. The treasury department, The department of Education. The FDIC and the CPFB among others\nwere not created by the president. He has no authority over them under the constitution. He is breaking the law.\n\n>Again, he has oversight. 2. Yes, I'm okay with it, hell i wish we ALL had access to how these departments and agencies were spending our money.\n\nOnce again. No. And this is really important to get right. He does not have oversight. Trump is not oversight. Oversight requires independent analysis. Also the simple fact that he literally *bought* his way into this position. Musk is a private citizen with no knowledge or expertise in government systems. He should not wield this power. Government officials answer to congress and the law when handling sensitive information along with bureaucratic checks and balances. There is no check here and no balance. Musk has total power and decides which agencies get to stay and which get tossed. There is no official appointment, no legal framework for what he is doing. DOGE is not an official government entity. There is no way to even apply rules and regulations to it. It is the same as a private group that bought their way into doing whatever they want with government agencies. It is insane.\n\n>I think federal spending has around $3 trillion in fraud, waste, and abuse annually. \n\nThis is a completely different issue entirely from the legal standpoint. Also, proof? \n\nMost importantly Musk is not an elected or even a hired state official. He is a private entity doing this with no governmental oversight or legal framework to do this.",

Power does not, should not, CAN NOT, rest with the bureaucracy.  You put more legitimacy on a G-6 than on the POTUS or his direct representative.

In contrast, the ADL gains nothing by debunking this hoax. In fact, in recent years the ADL has been accused of being too quick to classify incidents as right-wing hate. After all, such incidents help justify its mission. Yet they thought this was clearly not such an incident.",

I have to admit it made complete sense to me because the history books are full of goverments turning corrupt, clinging to power and so on. Now, just a few years later, people of this exact same ideologie are putting more trust in their leaders than anyone else I have ever seen.Some are even saying they trust Elon and Trump \"100%\", so without even being the slightest bit sceptical. How do you explain this change of heart regarding this core principle? Have humans changed so dramatically that power doesn't corrupt them anymore?",

Without those tools, they would have no power to verify that the president is doing what he says he's doing.\n\n>  Biden set the new standard for presidential oversight which is none.\n\nI am not sure what you are referring to.

It does not surprise me that you could not identify accountability.\n\nAccountability is great. That's exactly what I want: the president should be accountable for his actions to the American people. The best way to ensure that happens is to prevent conflicts of interest in his administration. So I'm confused that you claim to support accountability but when given an opportunity to apply it, you reject it.\n\n> Cutting government is corruption? You are not making sense.\n\nPotentially, yes. For example, farmers, food manufacturers, and drug companies would love to have less regulation from the FDA. Wall street and big banks would love to have less oversight from the SEC. Factories would love to [get rid of OSHA](https://www.workerscompensation.com/daily-headlines/legislation-to-eliminate-osha-introduced-in-congress/). So, yes, getting rid of organizations that historically have protected Americans from big business would be a big boon to business, which is one reason why those businesses support political candidates who promise to cut regulation. Taking [millions of dollars](https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68) from a company in exchange for telling the SEC to allow their upcoming merger to go through is one clear example.\n\n> Let me assure you that Trump is not in this for the money.\n\nI understand that you believe it.

What is your basis for this assumption?\n\n> That is malarkey. That's right I said it. Musk has always released his patents to his Tesla competitors. He wants his competition to succeed right along with him.\n\nIt's true that Musk's patents are available for use, with some caveats. However, this is not as [useful as you might think](https://www.vennershipley.com/insights-events/does-teslas-open-source-patent-philosophy-mean-they-are-free-to-use/), and it seems to be mostly a PR move.

That comment doesn't use the word \"shame\" or the word \"Republican.\" They just pointed out that the same people who a few years ago seemed very afraid of massive centralized governmental power are now no longer afraid of it. They asked what could explain such a change in position. I think it's a resonable question. What's your objection?\n\n> Nice try. IGs have no authority over the president.\n\nOf couse they don't have authority over the president. What IGs do is to investigate and report to Congress. The intent is that if there is fraud, abuse, or inefficiency, Congress can find out and potentially restrict funds for departments or programs that are not performing well. As you know, the Constitution grants the power of funding exclusively to Congress. So what is the purpose of firing IGs, except to hide fraud, abuse, and inefficiency?\n\n> Did you call for Biden to be removed or to reveal who was running the government?\n\nLike I said before, all presidents delegate authority. For example, Trump has delegated the takeover of the Treasury computer to Musk. Do you think Trump knows what Musk is doing on a day-to-day basis? At his recent press conference he seemed to not have a clue. So how is it different when Trump delegates to his subordinates versus when Biden does the same?\n\n>  You cannot have a double standard about corruption or competence.\n\nWhat double standard are you accusing me of? I oppose corruption in all its forms. You haven't told me a single example of Biden's alleged corruption.\n\n> Impeachment and removal. The vote and a new constitution are the only reprieve from a bad president. \n\nYes and no. Removal is one form of accountability. As I side, though, Congress provides accountability because they are responsible for the money. If Congress disapproves of the execute branch's use of money, they can take it back. Obstructing or circumventing that power of Congress is unconsitutional and violates the principle of checks and balances.\n\n> Are you talking cocaine in the White House accountability or something more official.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n> And they should. When they directly and intentionally harm a specific human the decision makers of the company should all be arrested, convicted and go to max security prison. That would stop all the nonsense - regulation is not at all accountability. \n\nWhat do you mean by \"direct\"? If a food manufacturer includes an ingredient that increases the risk of cancer of 10% in those who consume it, who is going to stop them? Who is even going to find out? Government regulations protect the consumer by investigating and regulating these things. So an obvious way to be corrupt is to reduce regulations, stop investigations, and take a nice kickback from the manufacturer. Can you see, then, how reducing the size of the government can lead directly to corruption?\n\n> Biden was not there in any kind of capacity to allow.\n\nBiden was president for four years during which time the IGs continued to operate as normally. Whether Biden directly allowed them or whether he delegated that authority to a subordinate is not relevant. That follows the normal rule of Congressional oversight. Why should Trump be exempt from IG oversight when Biden was not?\n\n>  Fraud is a crime and a lot of people in that Biden White House should go to prison for fraud and endangerment.\n\nI will again ask you for a specific instance of fraud from the Biden White House.\n\n\n>> If so, then, why did he create the Trumpcoin? Why did he release a brand of sneakers? What is the purpose of the Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (DJT)? \n\n> None of that is corruption or incosistent with Trump before politics. \n\nYou said that Trump is not in it for the money. But yet he continues to enter several scammy, manipulative money-making ventures. So he certainly seems like a guy who is motivated by making money. So I'll ask again; why are you so sure that Trump is not in it for the money? Do you think he created Trumpcoin just to improve people's lives?\n\n> The left did not hate Trump beyond the standard wealth envy bullshit until he won the presidency. \n\nThe left, I think it's fair to say, hated Trump since he falsely claimed that Obama was born in Kenya, which was well before he became president. New Yorkers have hated him even longer than that, because of his abusive real estate scams. Of course, they hated him after he became president because the power that goes along with that allows him to damage many more people's lives. Same goes for Musk: he was fine as an eccentric inventor, but when he revealed himself to be a conspiracy-believing racist nutjob, people's opinion changed. None of that, however, explains why **you** trust Trump so much, despite all that he's done.\n\n> What makes you think either of them is getting a free pass? \n\nI've asked you several times why you think Trump evading Congressional checks and balances is okay, and each time your answer has basically been \"because I trust him.\" I call that giving him a free pass. If Biden was doing the stuff that Trump is now doing, I (and every Republican in the world) would say that the president is claiming unconsitutional power and that there needs to be limits in line with the checks-and-balances.\n\n> There is no corruption to support.\n\nThat's a bold assertion. Trump's attempt to illegally shut down Department of Education and USAID have been halted by courts. Musk, at Trump's behest, has been given access to sensitive records of nearly every citizen. There's no provable corruption, but there is definitely reason to be suspicious.\n\n> What would you have me do \n\nObviously **you** can't do anything. Neither can I. But it's a question of what you think should be done. I think Congress needs to assert itself and reclaim the power given to them in the Constitution. Trump is not a king, but he's acting like one. That bothers me, and it bothers anyone with an understanding of the Constitution. I'm curious why it doesn't bother you.\n\n> you will no longer govern in the shadows.\n\nWho is governing in the shadows? Courts? Congress? That's hardly the shadows.

That comment doesn't use the word \"shame\" or the word \"Republican.\" They just pointed out that the same people who a few years ago seemed very afraid of massive centralized governmental power are now no longer afraid of it. They asked what could explain such a change in position. I think it's a resonable question. What's your objection?\n\n> Nice try. IGs have no authority over the president.\n\nOf couse they don't have authority over the president. What IGs do is to investigate and report to Congress. The intent is that if there is fraud, abuse, or inefficiency, Congress can find out and potentially restrict funds for departments or programs that are not performing well. As you know, the Constitution grants the power of funding exclusively to Congress. So what is the purpose of firing IGs, except to hide fraud, abuse, and inefficiency?\n\n> Did you call for Biden to be removed or to reveal who was running the government?\n\nLike I said before, all presidents delegate authority. For example, Trump has delegated the takeover of the Treasury computer to Musk. Do you think Trump knows what Musk is doing on a day-to-day basis? At his recent press conference he seemed to not have a clue. So how is it different when Trump delegates to his subordinates versus when Biden does the same?\n\n>  You cannot have a double standard about corruption or competence.\n\nWhat double standard are you accusing me of? I oppose corruption in all its forms. You haven't told me a single example of Biden's alleged corruption.\n\n> Impeachment and removal. The vote and a new constitution are the only reprieve from a bad president. \n\nYes and no. Removal is one form of accountability. As I side, though, Congress provides accountability because they are responsible for the money. If Congress disapproves of the execute branch's use of money, they can take it back. Obstructing or circumventing that power of Congress is unconsitutional and violates the principle of checks and balances.\n\n> Are you talking cocaine in the White House accountability or something more official.\n\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n> And they should. When they directly and intentionally harm a specific human the decision makers of the company should all be arrested, convicted and go to max security prison. That would stop all the nonsense - regulation is not at all accountability. \n\nWhat do you mean by \"direct\"? If a food manufacturer includes an ingredient that increases the risk of cancer of 10% in those who consume it, who is going to stop them? Who is even going to find out? Government regulations protect the consumer by investigating and regulating these things. So an obvious way to be corrupt is to reduce regulations, stop investigations, and take a nice kickback from the manufacturer. Can you see, then, how reducing the size of the government can lead directly to corruption?\n\n> Biden was not there in any kind of capacity to allow.\n\nBiden was president for four years during which time the IGs continued to operate as normally. Whether Biden directly allowed them or whether he delegated that authority to a subordinate is not relevant. That follows the normal rule of Congressional oversight. Why should Trump be exempt from IG oversight when Biden was not?\n\n>  Fraud is a crime and a lot of people in that Biden White House should go to prison for fraud and endangerment.\n\nI will again ask you for a specific instance of fraud from the Biden White House.\n\n\n>> If so, then, why did he create the Trumpcoin? Why did he release a brand of sneakers? What is the purpose of the Trump Media & Technology Group Corp (DJT)? \n\n> None of that is corruption or incosistent with Trump before politics. \n\nYou said that Trump is not in it for the money. But yet he continues to enter several scammy, manipulative money-making ventures. So he certainly seems like a guy who is motivated by making money. So I'll ask again; why are you so sure that Trump is not in it for the money? Do you think he created Trumpcoin just to improve people's lives?\n\n> The left did not hate Trump beyond the standard wealth envy bullshit until he won the presidency. \n\nThe left, I think it's fair to say, hated Trump since he falsely claimed that Obama was born in Kenya, which was well before he became president. New Yorkers have hated him even longer than that, because of his abusive real estate scams. Of course, they hated him after he became president because the power that goes along with that allows him to damage many more people's lives. Same goes for Musk: he was fine as an eccentric inventor, but when he revealed himself to be a conspiracy-believing racist nutjob, people's opinion changed. None of that, however, explains why **you** trust Trump so much, despite all that he's done.\n\n> What makes you think either of them is getting a free pass? \n\nI've asked you several times why you think Trump evading Congressional checks and balances is okay, and each time your answer has basically been \"because I trust him.\" I call that giving him a free pass. If Biden was doing the stuff that Trump is now doing, I (and every Republican in the world) would say that the president is claiming unconsitutional power and that there needs to be limits in line with the checks-and-balances.\n\n> There is no corruption to support.\n\nThat's a bold assertion. Trump's attempt to illegally shut down Department of Education and USAID have been halted by courts. Musk, at Trump's behest, has been given access to sensitive records of nearly every citizen. There's no provable corruption, but there is definitely reason to be suspicious.\n\n> What would you have me do \n\nObviously **you** can't do anything. Neither can I. But it's a question of what you think should be done. I think Congress needs to assert itself and reclaim the power given to them in the Constitution. Trump is not a king, but he's acting like one. That bothers me, and it bothers anyone with an understanding of the Constitution. I'm curious why it doesn't bother you.\n\n> you will no longer govern in the shadows.\n\nWho is governing in the shadows? Courts? Congress? That's hardly the shadows. They are supposed to govern as two-third of the government, not as toadies to a king.",

[He forgot how to pronounce \"Yosemite\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwcploTZbKA), he repeats himself, [he shows up to a town hall and just dances](https://as.cornell.edu/news/trumps-abrupt-decision-play-dj-sign-accelerating-cognitive-decline-says-cornell-expert).

What evidence do you have that the IGs were not doing their job?\n\n> What is the point you are trying to make with this. .... Trump is fine and I am not mad about Trump being like Trump has always been.\n\nI think my line of questioning has been pretty clear all along: there is lots of evidence that Trump is motivated by greed and power, and at every turn you are willing to ignore that evidence based on an unshakeable *personal* trust in him. Would you agree that's a fair characterisation?\n\n> just like the challenges to Roe v. Wade.

There were numerous attempts of Congress exercising their authority to reject a bill supported by the president, for example the [bipartisan immigration reform bill](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-collapse-of-bipartisan-immigration-reform-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/).\n\n> New Yorkers gave him the Ellis Island award and many others.\n\nThe \"Ellis Island Honors Society\" gave it to him, for his work on real estate development projects.

Also congress does not have the authority to usurp the presidents judgement on matters of national security.\n\n>And if Congress instructs the executive to create and fund a department or program, isn\u2019t that law?\n\nNot unless that department is created as an enumerated power in the constitution.

If veterans are treated badly it will hurt recruitment - National Security.\n\n>So are you saying the executive shouldn\u2019t have restraints on its power?\n\nThe executive is in place to have the power to act quickly day to day. Congress is place to act more deliberately and slowly and create the permanent law of the land. The president sends troops to a situation and the congress responds with a declaration of war or not when all the facts are in. Congress is not doing any of that anymore but that is beside the point. \n\n>While all three branches have their powers\n\nWe have talked about the other two so the checks and balance role of the supreme court is to determine if congress passes a law that is contrary to the constitution. The court should not interfere with the president issueing EOs that internally direct the executive. Finding out where the money is being spent is something all presidents should have been doing. Cutting government is unprecedented but now is the time to set that precedent.",

And how you would know, given his utter lack of accountability to the public?",

Or that maybe Egypt can fund its own tourist advertisements.\n\nYou keep saying 'unaccountable' as if there's no one to stop him from breaking the law, as if the administration isn't reviewing what he's doing, as if the media isn't telling us what's happening, as if this would be any different if it wasn't elon.\n\nIf this was some random lawyer, instead of elon, there'd be very little story here.\n\nThe left keeps pumping elon as the antichrist. Ok- but it's not really very effective because it's not persuasive, the left doesn't like him (any more- they used to LOVE his electric cars), and the not left think he's fine.",
