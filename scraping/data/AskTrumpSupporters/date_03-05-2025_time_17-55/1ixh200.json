It's easy enough to think you are an essential employee, but it's hard to determine that from the outside.\n\nThere's something you'll hear companies talk about all the time regarding the \"bus number\" or the \"lottery number,\" if they are feeling charitable.  It boils down to \"how many of your employees have to leave to render your company unable to perform?\"  For a great deal of companies, that number is *one*, but it's one particular employee.  You know, the little old lady who is an administrative assistant or whatever, but has been with the company for 20 years, knows how to run everything, and has it all figured out.\n\nSure, her pay rate is way off the scale for the position, but that's because she knows everything.\n\nOr the IT Admin who is the only one who actually knows how the undocumented and slapdash code actually works.\n\nTo give you a bit of an example, many years ago, one of our P&E guys developed a rather complicated Excel spreadsheet that would allow the company to create estimates far more easily than otherwise.  So, of course, he was made redundant.  But he was the only one who knew how to alter the spreadsheet when costs changed.  Suddenly, they had to hire him back, with a substantial pay increase.  They asked him to train other people how to modify the spreadsheet and his response was that he would require an even greater raise for that, because why would he work himself out of a job again?",

I live in a city in close proximity to multiple national parks, and the main effect I've noticed from the layoff is that a few trails have closed, and the ones that are open have cut their hours. Do you think the people cut from non office jobs (e.g. park rangers) were actually cut for performance reasons, or was it just part of a blanket cut?\n\nAs a side note, do you think the number of federal employees has increased drastically over the past e.g. 50 years? Or are the current DOGE cuts just something that have always been required?",

Tone can be somewhat difficult to convey over text.\n\nI think your personal experiences are coloring your opinion here.  That's entirely fine, and I get it.  I do not live near any national parks, to my knowledge, nor am I a big hiker sort of guy--to be honest, I use a cane a lot of the time and I don't do well on uneven ground, so I've never really looked into it.  As such, I'm woefully ignorant about what a Park Ranger actually does, outside of watching Yogi Bear as a kid.\n\nBut to answer your question about the numbers, there are, apparently, over three million Federal civilian employees currently (or at last counting, as per Google).  That's a bit of a shrinkage from the 90s, where it peaked at 3.4 million, but if we go back to 1939, it was less than half of either number.  That would imply that yes, the number of employees has been growing over the past 50 years (I know, 1939 is a lot more than 50 years ago).",

Since then it has remained pretty constant, with small fluctuations. However, our population has almost tripled since the 1930s, which makes the proportion of government employees currently the lowest in US history (this was pre-DOGE) at 1.9% of the total workforce. \n\nConsidering this, how confident are you that blanket job cuts will be a net positive, and won't lead to understaffed agencies and potentially churn (like rehiring workers back after a few months)?",

As someone pretty solidly left leaning, I've always understood the conservative's view that we need to address our national deficit. But government employees have stayed roughly the same for so long and constitute such a small part of the overall budget compared to things like entitlement spending, tax breaks, military equipment etc. With this in mind, I guess the sudden obsession over headcount has been very surprising to me?\n\nI think what I'm missing is that if you have a gut feeling about something, it's hard for you (or me) to convey the reason for that belief to each other. Thanks for answering my questions anyway though, there are basically no Trump voters in my city so this is basically the only way to hear average people from the other side lol.",

There's a TON of posts out there of Trump supporters having lost their Federal jobs... like I said, anecdotal and they're not all saying they regret their vote, but the general sentiment is that their own firing was a mistake as they weren't involved in anything DEI, they believed they did good work etc. \n\nHere's a recent example that's been in the news: [https://www.yahoo.com/news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-184353241.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fox-news-host-jesse-watters-184353241.html)\n\nSo my question is; do you think the Trump campaign accurately broadcast their intent? I'm inclined to say that they sort of did but if so, why do so many Trump supporters seem blindsided by his actions when it affects them directly?",

Hunter served on a burismas board, which is an energy company in ukraine (interesting, right?) When the company was being investigated for corruption, Joe biden demanded the prosecutor be fired, or ukraine wouldn't get previously alloted money (sound familiar? it's essentially what democrats impeached trump for). In the end, joe biden got the prosecutor fired that was investigating his corrupt son and his corrupt sons energy company. Here is a video of joe biden bragging about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXA--dj2-CY\n\nWe know from the laptop that the bidens routinely were taking bribes from all over and hunter was complaining about having to kick 10% up to his father. We had first hand witness testimony regarding this (tony bobulinski). HOWEVER the feds, having this laptop for a year, and knowing of its existence, went to social media companies like twitter and facebook, and told them a russian disinfo campaign was going to come out in the fall and denied that it was even real. They signed a public statement regarding this knowing it was false in the middle of an election campaign, and this lead to old twitter banning a new york post story of this and censoring any link sharing of it, even in dm's. An unprecedented action that never happened before or after. Other social media censored this true story too, and 15% of biden voters in 2020 said had they know about all this, they would not have voted for him.\n\nI didn't read the rest of your post because it's clear you have little clue about anything, and If I responded to everything you said I would be here all day.",
