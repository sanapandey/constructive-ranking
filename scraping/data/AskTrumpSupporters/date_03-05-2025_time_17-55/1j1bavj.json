Too young to vote? \n\nIf you used to be left or center, what would you say was the first or most significant thing that made you change your outlook? Was it personal experience or policy related?\n\nDid poor treatment from the left influence your affiliation at all?",

            "body": "I had a few moments of \"radicalization\". \n\nFirst, in college, I had a good friend kicked out of school on a false rape allegation. I know it was false because I was with him at the time of the alleged assault. He was not allowed to present a defense or witnesses to the school. This event changed the course of his life dramatically. It made me question the left orthodoxy of \"rape culture\", \"believe all women\", \"reclaim the night\", etc, and then subsequently the underpinnings of feminism, toxic masculinity, and gender politics in general. This large pillar of the liberal worldview was shown to me to be faulty - and that led to me to question the rest of it. This experience led me to distrust academia and \"experts\", especially on social issues. \n\nThen, I watched media character assassinations of outsider political candidates happen over and over. First it was Ron Paul, then it was Bernie, then it was Trump. Over and over I'd see a negative headline, click the link, and see for myself that the headline was lying. Once or twice is a mistake. Ten times is a pattern. A hundred is malicious intent. This caused me to distrust mainstream media and \"journalists\".\n\nFinally, in that same 2016 campaign season, I saw both the DNC and RNC do everything they could to keep out the outsider candidates - Bernie and Trump. The DNC was successful. I had always thought that no matter differences in opinion, these central political organizations fundamentally wanted to represent the will of the voters. Turns out, that was a lie. This led me to distrust the political establishment class and the \"deep state\".",

I feel similarly about everything you mentioned. \n\nI guess what I'm most curious about is have your other views changed to closer align to more of the rights' positions? Or do you feel they are simply less important to you now than what you mentioned above? \n\nFor example, I get called a TERF and transphobe by the left because I think we should be more sympathetic to people who struggle with accepting trans people. I get called a racist because I think that some people have racist tendencies due to where or how they were raised and it doesn't mean they are bad people. Plenty of other examples of how I am no longer a \"perfect\" liberal and people on the left vilify me for it, while the new right has been much more welcoming. But even then, I can't bring myself to ever support Trump because I disagree with him so strongly on so many of his positions.",

I didn't grow up caring about illegal immigration - but that was before the floodgates were open. Now, its a much more serious problem than before. \n\nPeople forget that Trump was - and still is - different from \"the right\" as it has been for decades in America. He's an alternative to the churches and moralism and \"save the children\" of the Regan era, and an alternative to the interventionism of the Bush era. \n\nWhat don't you like about Trump? I genuinely think that on most issues, many nonsupporters have a false impression of what Trump stands for.",

Income inequality and wealth distribution are shocking, and I don't believe that there's any evidence of \"trickle down\" economics working, or benefitting the lower and middle classes. I believe that the strongest economies and societies are borne from ensuring the fragile populations are supported, stabilized, rehabilitated, and that is a better and more logical long-term use of our resources than catering to the wealthy. \n\nI support more regulation on corporations and the wealthy elite, closure of wealth tax loopholes, progressive taxes on luxuries and gambling, and the addition of new tax brackets that include higher taxes considered for people who earn over 1m, 500m, and 1b.\n\nI believe that non-salary money in politics is corrupt, full stop. I believe that politicians should choose to inspire unison, rather than sow division in their constituents and in foreign policy. I believe that our leaders should be held accountable for lying to us. \n\nObviously, all of the above means it's rare that I find a politician I actually support. I'm used to making concessions when voting, but Trump represents just about everything I would trust and hope for a government to regulate. He has enormous conflicts of interest that I already believe he has abused to further his self interest as a business owner and corporate legacy, and even if there are more than a couple of things he says or does that I support, I can never see myself getting behind him until I believe that he cares more about the American people as a whole (this includes people who don't support him) more than his self interest and/or the interests of his business network.\n\nQuestion so this doesn't get removed?",

My personal stances matter much less to me than knowing that I, people who agree with me, *and* people who don't agree with me have the freedom and options to live how they want when it doesn't directly impact anyone else.\n\nPeople should be able to get abortions if they want. People should be able to marry whoever, or however many people, they want. Do whatever you want to your own body, call other people what you want, and request that others call you what you want. None of this is government business, in my opinion. Maybe tension will be caused between certain groups of people, but we've lived all of human history with personal, individual, ideological differences and learning how to navigate them has never been best accomplished by an authority. \n\nI support DEI, I support abortion and women's rights, I support men's rights, I support LGBTQIA+ rights, i support gunowner rights, I support illegal immigrant rights because I support human rights. I also, maybe controversially, I support people who *don't* support those rights, and believe all of those people should have the protected right to disagree with me and share their opinions. What I don't support is legislation that makes it illegal for someone to do something that does not directly impact another person's life, liberty, property, or pursuit of happiness.   \n\nHope that answers your question? I have some issues with some of Trump's stances, but for the most part I don't have much of a problem with his actual policies on social issues. I have a problem with some of his *statements* or personal choices, but that mostly contributes to me just disliking him as a person rather than thinking he is unfit or dangerous. That part primarily comes from his economic and foreign policies.",

You and I may have different views on some of them, but we're talking about if Trump and Bernie are aligned on policies for them. \n\n- Minimum wage: I've seen Trump say he'd be open to raising it but also say he doesn't think a federal minimum wage makes sense, and that having it about as low as it is makes sense in LCOL areas. That is in direct opposition with Bernie.\n\n- Climate: In what way do you see Trump and Bernie having the same policies here?\n\n- Universal Health Care: How does Trump align at all with Bernie's proposal for Medicare for All? Trump just keeps pushing repeal and replace, but never gives details about what the replacement is. \n\n- Campaign Finance: Can you share anything about Trump supporting campaign finance reform and doing away with Super PACs? Being against Citizens United?\n\n- Paid leave: Trump has signaled he's in favor of paid leave, but he's only ever made some changes to the Child Tax Credit and signed laws around government workers getting paid leave. That's very different than Bernie wanting to extend it to all private and public workers uniformly. \n\n- Infrastructure: How can we possibly do this while simultaneously cutting every government agency that would play a part in it? While it's true that Trump talked about improving infrastructure and did enact changes in this regard, do you think that he and Bernie would have a similar approach overall? For example, a lot of Trump's \"wins\" here were in support of the fossil fuel industry and rejecting renewable resources. \n\nThe two of them seem like they're at odds on so much. But, in your opinion, that isn't the case? Is the a gross misrepresentation of one of them I've made or some similarities on these keys points I've overlooked?",

Not so much in actual politicians, but let's be honest:  I am seeing left-wing rags promoting \"MAPs\" (because calling them chomos is rude or something) and going from \"love is love\" to \"You have to use whatever terms I want when you speak about me when I'm not around.\"  We are being told that we are on a stack based on our skin color and our genetalia, but yet somehow the genetalia thing doesn't matter if you just say it doesn't.  Until it does.\n\nWe have had programs quite literally designed to discourage certain demographics from seeking education and leadership and we have lauded that as progress.\n\nSorry, I'm done with that.",

That is a *major* concession because we're just assuming everyone who was killed by someone using a non-stated firearm was killed by someone using a rifle, and we're conflating shotguns with rifles.\n\nI also genuinely believe the \"personal weapons\" category (which I think is ridiculous) is extremely low, but hey, I'm just using a source on a few seconds of Google.\n\nSo, why is gun violence so prevalent in America?  Who is committing these acts of violence, and why?  Do you, for some reason, think that making it harder for me to purchase a firearm is going to make me kill less people than I would otherwise?\n\nI'll give you a hint.  I have killed precisely as many people as I would ever want to.  That number is\n\n**ZERO.**\n\nI do not own a weapon to harm anyone.  I own them for hunting, fishing (trust me, if you catch a tarpon, you're wanting a firearm), farming, and foraging.  The absolute worst thing I have done with a firearm was with a BB gun at like five years old where I turned when my friend yelled and bonked him in the nose.  I know, horribly irresponsible.  I should have known better (I mean this with all sincerity), but I just turned and when BONK!\n\nIt seems to be a \"left\" position that making things worse for law-abiding citizens will lead to peace.  Gee, I wonder why people commit murder, since it's illegal?",

Technically, I do support abolishing the police, but that would be the last step; let's start with reducing welfare first.\n\n> when taxes are implemented, regulated, overseen and spent properly...\n\nPlease do not interrupt this as an argument, I am simply sharing my political worldview. You felt the need to include \"properly\" when talking about taxation and using taxed income. This means that you know it is possible that your system of taxation could be improperly used. In an ancap, it is not my job to figure out how everything will work, that's like predicting what company is the next Amazon. \"Without the government, who will pave the roads?\" I don't know, but someone will make a lot of money solving that problem! You have to create a complete system that has checks against corruption, and access to taxed money is the ultimate temptation toward corruption. To draw it to the extreme, to illustrate the point, communists always claim that it'll work this time because they will do it right. (I have no reason to think you are communist; again, this is clarifying my point of view, not initiating a debate.)",

I believe taxes should only be used to pay for very specific things that are in the interest of public good, typically to create societal standards and invest in long-term preemptive benefits for all people in a society. Things like access to healthcare, education, transport. Making all of these things free for all people ends up, perhaps counterintuitively, being both more economically beneficial and more cost-effective than leaving them to the free market. \n\nWhile I absolutely believe that our current tax system, and most tax systems globally, is improperly used, I think that private companies are equally -- if not more -- guilty of civilian exploitation. Do you believe that? (Sorry, I know you didn't initiate a debate and I don't want one either, I just think this is super interesting.) Leaving Healthcare to private companies, for example, has been nothing short of a disaster that has made many people exceedingly rich while many others get sick and die and others still are forced to finance the predatory insurance and companies and big pharma. \n\nI agree that road paving could and should be privately run, as well as road maintenance. But there should be a public, cost effective fallback for people who live in areas deemed not profitable enough for paving investments.. otherwise the people living in those communities will inevitably become a financial drain on the economy due to the subsequent lower levels of education and employment. \n\nI think simplicity, regulation, and transparency,  are the answer to eliminating corruption in tax codes. It's very easy to hide things in 5,000 page documents that no one can afford to, or would want to, look over. Simplify it, make it publicly accessible end-to-end, and introduce a number of third party oversight companies with varying interests.. and it becomes extremely difficult to take advantage of, for as long as the people remain informed.\n\nAnyway, it's neat to meet someone who I agree with so much, but whose convictions have led them in a very different direction.

There has always been a tension between the \"live and let live\" mentality of the libertarian-adjacent/free market crowd and the moralistic governance promoted by social conservatives. I really enjoyed the first Trump era, to be honest. He threaded the needle of taking the best parts of both camps and appealing to a broader base compared to historical Republican candidates/party leaders. \n\nHis embrace of LGB Americans was particularly exciting for me as a gay man. Finally, we had a candidate that understood the message Log-Cabin Republicans had been sending for decades: gay Americans that love liberty, the Constitution, and our nation deserve a place in the party of freedom. I am so proud to have supported the first President to enter office supporting same-sex marriage, the first to have appointed a gay man to a cabinet-level position, the only President to have led an international coalition to decriminalize homosexuality across the world, and the President to make history by making Scott Bessant the highest-serving gay public official in American history. Even better, these weren't held out by the administration as groundbreaking advancements; they're just the right people for the job or the right policies to take. As Secretary Bessant said, he wasn't chosen for the job because he was gay, but because he was right for the role. We are Americans first, and gay people second. That's awesome. \n\nAfter 2020, he's grown a bit too comfortable cozying up to the pro-union, pro-fiscal/industrial regulation side of what most people deem the \"New Right\". Seeing a union fatcat take the RNC stage and rail against right-to-work laws to the cheers of the crowd was very jarring. He's watered down his pro-life position, too. The Cotton/Hawley/Vance wing griping about \"corporate greed\" and wanting to limit credit card interest rates always make me double check that I didn't accidentally tune into a NPR segment with Elizabeth Warren.\n\nObviously, I have my problems with Vance when it comes to domestic policy, but I like him more than I dislike him, especially as a VP focusing mainly on foreign policy.",

What about pregnant women diagnosed with cancer in the first or second trimester, where sure, you could make them wait to get chemo till the baby was viable to birth, but at a significantly increased risk to their own lives and long term survival? Does the calculus change if the woman already has living children that need her? Fundamentally, how high does the risk to the woman\u2019s life have to be before you think she has a right to choose her own life? Great, 100% chance of her death is enough for you. What about 80%? 50/50? Heck, 25%?

Who should bear that cost? Child support kicks in after birth - should the woman pay for childbirth alone when she did not want this pregnancy? What compensation is due a woman who was raped, who has hyperemesis gravidarum (vomiting multiple times a day through pregnancy to the point most women with it can\u2019t hold down a job, fairly common), who suffers a first or third degree tear or episiotomy during childbirth (fairly common, can permanently change your quality of life/enjoyment of sex)? \n\nWhat do you support in terms of workplace protections for pregnant women? Currently there is no state mandated maternity leave in which your job is protected and you get pay in many states. Even when there is, do you know how hard/expensive it is to find a daycare willing to take a 6 week old or 3 month old?\n\nI just think a lot of men - particularly men who don\u2019t have a partner who has gone through it - don\u2019t have a very nuanced understanding of physically what goes into pregnancy and childbirth and early childcare and yet think even without nuanced information they should get to make these choices for women\u2019s bodies. Did you even know what ectopic pregnancy was before Roe was overturned? How about molar pregnancy- do you know what that is?\n\nFinally, are you aware the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. is double the rate in other developed wealthy countries? If you plan to force birth on grand scale, does that strike you as a problem that needs fixing, or those women that will die bearing children they didn\u2019t want, whose deaths were preventable, are an acceptable sacrifice?

It happened very suddenly without warning, and I had an emergency visit.

In addition to that you might be paying for prescriptions, annual checkups, preventative care, etc.\n\nBy todays economy, you would still have chosen to veto insurance given those (rough) estimates?",

If I had to pay for health insurance back then I'd have never made it work.\n\nFood stamps when I was a kid, birthday presents were the only presents, wasn't able to get dental work until mid 20s and as a result almost every tooth I have has fillings with many crowns and one missing all together, had to beg and plead with a hospital to help cover my unexpected expenses for other medical issues in my early 20s (uninsured), avoided going to the ER (also uninsured) after getting into a car accident (I was a passenger) in college and as a result have had back pain and mobility issues all my life. It wasn't until I got my first job as a software engineer that I got proper insurance through work. I have nothing to prove to you, and I'm not trying to compete with anyone else's suffering. I just want you to hear me. I understand what that's like.\n\nI'm not suggesting that the penalty or the monthly payments are reasonable. But when I couldn't afford to pay my medical expenses *someone* did. The hospitals that took care of me when I did eventually go had to absorb their losses by inflating the operating costs for everyone else. Do you think that's fair to people who *can* afford their treatments?\n\nEven if you take on payment plans with low or no interest, those are essentially long term loans that are given at a loss to recoup some of the expenses. \n\nDo I think any of this is right? No. I wish we could streamline medicine better so that our dollars would stretch further. \n\nYou're absolutely right, of course. If you're a teenager and barely have a minimum wage job or are in school, how can you possibly cope with payments thrust upon you?\n\nIf I gave you the impression that I believe that everyone should be able to afford payments or penalties *because*, I don't. I'd much rather subsidize low or no income young adults that don't have a family plan (age cut off is 26 iirc?) to fall back on.",

Bernie was more appealing to say, a white, midwestern, union steelworker while the current \u201cleft\u201d is more aimed at minority groups and privileged, over educated, white collar white folks who want to be social justice warriors without actually having to get their own hands dirty.  I think that difference is part of what pushed away the democrats traditional base and many of us felt betrayed by the party for not listening to the majority of us.  That\u2019s why so many people have switched sides after 2016 and 2020.  It\u2019s sad because I ultimately would vote for somebody like Bernie again over Trump any day.  But as of right now I think the only hope we have for reviving the party is having somebody like Andy Beshear run, someone who actually will work with republicans to get things accomplished rather than obstructionism and identity politics.",

I didn\u2019t like Trump.  But I didn\u2019t like the alternatives in 2016 or 2020 either.  I wrote Bernie in on both of those because I couldn\u2019t support the direction the Democratic Party was heading or how I perceived Trump to be.  The things he says or does (at least the way they\u2019re portrayed by the media/left).  But over the years I think I\u2019ve come to understand him a bit more.  I kind of see a disconnect between what he says, what many of his supporters say it means, and what the left say he means.  The guy isn\u2019t a racist bumbling idiot who wants to be Hitler like the left thinks but he also isn\u2019t some family values, conservative poster boy like many of his supports think he is either.  A lot of the times you see him making big, kinda radical statements it is because he\u2019s setting himself up to negotiate.  He\u2019s like someone selling a car and asking a ridiculous price for it, so that when you talk him down to a price that\u2019s still above KBB value it feels like you won.  A lot of us see that and want to see what he actually does with full context.  The knee jerk reactions from the left, usually totally out of context, really irritate a lot of us.  There are people who have killed themselves over what the media said he was going to do in 2016 and it never happened.  Gay marriage was never repealed.  Trans folks were shipped off to concentration camps.  He didn\u2019t let Russia just walk into Ukraine and take it.  Up until Covid things didn\u2019t really fall apart or anything.  He didn\u2019t repeal Obamacare.  So a big part of the support I see really is just a reaction to how the left is acting and how the democrats alienated so many of us.  Trump also appeals to a lot of people like myself for the same reason I like Zelenskyy.  He has balls.  He also at least appears to be willing to actually work with others and listen to advice rather than just being obstructionist like the Democrats and Republicans have both been for years.  The fact he has neo-cons like Rubio in his cabinet, as well as former democrats is a big change for our country in my opinion.  They may tow the line publicly but I believe that in private they are a very diverse group politically.  But he absolutely doesn\u2019t allow for public dissent from his own administration.  But in private I suspect that he has surrounded himself with a lot of differing opinions that more closely aligns with average Americans than the left has since Obama.",

The single biggest factor for Trump's victory was that voters ranked the economy as their biggest issue and their faith in the incumbent government on the economy lowly. Incumbent governments typically don't stay in power when the electorate had low faith in their economic policies.\n\nI say that as a warning to my fellow Trump supporters, too. I think the average voter doesn't really care about gender this or that, or about DEI, etc. So at best we could say the Democrats' position on social policy didn't help them as much as they'd thought.\n\n> the hole in that theory for me is that I would then expect that there are lots of Trump supporters who don't really support a lot of what Trump does\n\nThats a reasonable assumption but even if we presume it's true - the Democrats are really that much worse. The Democrats pick issues that have a 80/20 support and take the 20% side. For example massive spending cuts to the government are popular and yet the Democrats are literally singing in protest about it.\n\nTrump's approval is at its highest level, even veering positive, while the Democrats' is at a 16 year low. And the Democrats keep digging that grave while Trump policies still stay generally favorable. This is how many were pushed Trump to begin with: he floats a good idea, Democrats demonize it as the worst thing ever, and the guy who just wants the America he remembers back feels isolated. Deportations, for example, are a very popular policy but the Democrats are defending illegal aliens to such a degree they are trying to coup NYC because Eric Adams is cooperating with Trump on immigration. \n\nI'd also point out that the 2024 Trump campaign was incredibly moderate. His platform is essentially a 1990s Democrat platform, and many of his ideas like strong immigration control and protectionist trade, were championed by his detractors on the left. He managed to turn the Republicans into the big tent party and include things Americans have been begging for like intelligence community reform via Tulsi Gabbard (a former Democrat congresswoman) and food and health reform via RFK Jr (a literal Kennedy). The reality that the left is grappling with is that Trump has popular policy positions for a wide variety of topics so even if you didn't like his Ukraine position, for example, you like that his HHS secretary is going after our toxic food supply. The traditional Democrat propaganda machine in the mainstream press is shattered. Joe Rogan had more of a say in viewers impression of Trump than CNN and MSNBC's biggest star Rachel Maddow gets fewer viewers in the key demo than your favorite streamer or YouTube.\n\n>  I would expect a lot more criticism about basic things like expectations of dignity and class in a room with other world leaders.\n\nThis is another point of projection, I think. \n\nPeople like the way Trump speaks to world leaders because it is bold and direct and underlines his America First rhetoric. For example the row with Zolenskyy in the Oval Office has gotten a lot of criticism from the left saying Trump and Vance humiliated themselves and that they were put in their place but a recent Halperin poll found 62% of Americans found Zolenskyy offensive even if only 49% thought Trump and Vance had a stronger argument.\n\nIf you take personal feeling out of the issue and watch the entire exchange between them it's hard not to have the takeaway that Zolenskyy was acting childish and petulantly and Trump sounded authoritative and serious about America's position and Vance sounded reasonable. The same can be said for many interactions, such as Trump's strong attitude towards NATO; many Americans have felt that the US has been carrying Europe's defensive burden for a very long time.\n\nI think the thing to remember here is that Trump and the Republicans won in a landslide. The Democrats' position that everything Trump does is terrible didn't just not work, it failed utterly and obviously. That clearly means there's an appetite in the American populace for Trump policies that the Democrats just don't understand. And the more the Democrats completely miss the popularity of Trump policies the more they're going to push people into his camp. A huge reason for many embracing Trump is that the left attacked them for centrist positions, and the right embraced them.\n\nAs Cenk Uygur said, if you disagree with the left 5% they kick you out and call you names. If you agree with MAGA 5% they tell you to come over and join the party. \n\nIn fact that's a great example of why so many seem so positive on Trump: Anna Kasparian has changed her stance on leftist criminal policy after experiencing the negative effects they've had in California and was harassed, insulted and abandoned even by people she considered friends. She took umbrage to the use of \"birthing person\" in place of \"woman\" and despite a career as a progressive leftist media personality she got pilloried by the gender ideologue wing of the left. Now there are pro-Trump spaces joking about her turning conservative and secretly voting for Trump in 2024 even as she remains a progressive and opponent of the Trump administration. This suggests to me that Trump supporters as a whole are more willing to find key issues of commonality that ruminate over the areas of difference.\n\nFor example, I really wish Trump had backed the ban on TikTok and think allowing it in the US is going to have extremely negative effects in the future but I really like his immigration, economic and budgetary positions so I'm not going to criticize him over a small disagreement when the alternative is so much worse.",

I couldn't possibly agree more with it, spot on. \n\nYour points about my assumption and projection are heard and well taken. I think that regardless of how other people feel or vote, I still cherish respect as a value and think that our president is as much an ambassador and international representative as he is head of domestic policy. I don't accept the \"he started it\" argument as justification for someone in that position to behave so embarrassingly, and that applies to all of them -- Trump is not alone in my criticism this. I don't think any of those 3 men 'won'or came out looking better. If I had to pick a worst, it would be the guy who asked why Z doesn't wear a suit. It's all just incredibly silly, and all 3 of them seemed to me like bickering teenagers in a parking lot rather than elected leaders of entire sovereign nations. I'm probably getting to an age where I'm old and out of touch, but I am just so sad that this is where we are arriving and that it's become the new normal. \n\nAlso, regarding TikTok I had a laugh to myself because when you mentioned it earlier I assumed you didn't agree with his decision to ban it. I am going to be conscious of checking my assumptions and instead ask what the most likely or impactful negative consequences you foresee are? \n\nDo you have the same fears for Meta, Google, X, Snapchat, or any other social/tech platforms?",

The most negative outcome I could imagine is a young person today with a TikTok grows up ti become someone in a tangentially important space like a government office or a secure military facility and Chinese intelligence has everything they need to blackmail or subtle brainwashing.\n\nBasically they wouldn't do it if it didn't work.\n\n> Do you have the same fears for Meta, Google, X, Snapchat, or any other social/tech platforms?\n\nI do not trust any of these major tech companies with the amount of power over perception that they have.

Even Trump himself is a former Democrat and holds many liberal ideals.\n\nI had been drifting away from the left for years before I finally abandoned ship.  Their increasingly aggressive and divisive rhetoric was getting to me, and as time drew on, I found myself less and less convinced by the entire 'calling everyone we hated Nazis' deal.\n\nWhen I actually started questioning left-wing rhetoric, I was immediately turned on by my friends and fellow lefties, who accused me of \"being duped by right-wing propaganda.\"  The problem? I wasn't watching right-wing news outlets or influencers or anything.  I came to my disappointed conclusions ENTIRELY on left-wing rhetoric.  The left themselves gave me all the tools I needed, and presumably, them as well, which lead me to believe it's not that they \\*couldn't\\* see my point, but that they didn't \\*want\\* to see it.\n\nI've lost friends to this shit.  People I once thought cared about me turned on me in a heartbeat and forgot I existed just as fast.  I learned real fast who my actual friends were.\n\nNow I watch as people I once thought reasonable and level-headed go into meltdowns every time Trump does something - even when it's something they would have cheered under Biden or a hypothetical Kamala Harris Presidency.",

You're not allowed to disagree, to have nuanced views, on any left-leaning matter, because the slightest bit of disagreement makes you bad.

Seeing the woke on Tumblr,, at the time called sjws, be so hateful racist towards White sexist towards men etc and just seeing that sick cult ideology and how it stood against everything I believed in, made me conservative. Which which was really just sticking to my liberal values, nowadays it still just promotes classical liberalism in most cases. Then Trump came and was unapologetically proamerica, pro-normal s*** and anti-woke by his very existence. And I was in. Ted Cruz was actually my first choice but he lost the primary",

The gender ideologue component of the Democrat Party is most certainly not comparable to center right European politics when you consider that gender affirming care for minors has largely been restricted and prohibited in western Europe while the American left is becoming increasingly of the bent that it is essential medical care that should have little legal restriction.\n\nThe American left is also much more pro abortion than Western Europe, backing abortion up to birth whereas even in France where they recently made abortion access a constitutional right they have a 14 week restriction. \n\nOn immigration I'd argue that the American left actually goes further left than the European left, given that in Europe immigration concerns mainly center around refugee status whereas in the US the American left backs a full unlimited immigration policy. For example I'm not sure the UK or France has \"sanctuary cities\" for immigrants whereas NY governor Kathy Hochul is trying to remove NYC mayor Eric Adams for cooperating with the Trump immigration policy.\n\nI think the \"American left equals European right\" is more accurate for the Bush administration.",
