As an outsider looking in, the news and the discourse seems to be getting more and more escalatory and hateful from both camps, so I wanted to make a thread that focuses on some positives - maybe there's even some common ground between TS and NTS in this regard.  \nSo: What do you love or appreciate about the US? Places, mindsets, traditions, food, music, nature, things you did here, etc. Whatever comes to mind!",

            "body": "There was no grand historical process that predestined America to exist \u2014 you could easily imagine this chunk of the continent to be another post-imperial hispanophone/francophone relative backwater. It was because of a few key decisions that it wasn't. The one that jumps out at me is when Henry VIII decided to secede from the Church. It meant England had capital (freed up from dissolved monasteries) to build and launch vessels to the New World. He could have just... not done that, and England would remain a peripheral European state, and English a small, quaint language.\n\nThe Spanish model had been to send a few men to the New World who interbred with already existing populations to create an intricate caste system. The Anglo model was to send families. The English people who settled the continent within the first century were a \\*highly\\* self-selected group who would have been above average on a number of different metrics \u2014 intelligence, a sense of independence, sticktoitiveness, etc. This made fertile ground for the belief that a man would conduct his affairs not because of a fear of legal consequence but because of an inner sense of Christian honor. I think this survives in theory up to the present, and I believe it's why markets were able to be so successful here. We have benefitted tremendously from that value.\n\nI find that things like the First and Second Amendments make foreigners scratch their heads a bit, but it's because of the founding stock of this nation that such laws would even make sense. The amendments are an affirmation of our independence and of the idea that *a man will make his own way*. He will speak, and he will defend. This was a country that expanded over the hills and rivers of an untamed continent, faced by threats on all sides. It did not spring out of millennia-old hamlets in feudal duchies and kingdoms.\n\nMy great-grandpa was born in the 1880s in a sod hut out on the then-frontier of Nebraska \u2014 had to get to town on a horse-drawn cart. He died attending meetings around the world in a 747. Because of what his countrymen did. Because of the nation our Founders (both at Plymouth and at Philadelphia) created. I feel very grateful for that.",

It looks at the 4 English groups that settled America (the Puritans in the NE, the Virginian Cavaliers, the Quakers in the Pennsylvania area, and the Scotch-Irish in Appalachia). \n\n*Fire and Blood* by Fehrenbach gives you a good overview of Mexican history, which reflects much of early Spanish colonization. \n\nFor Henry the VIII\u2019s impact, take a look at *The Growth of the American Republic* by Morison and Commager.",
