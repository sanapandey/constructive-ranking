If we can crack that as a reliable energy source we'll have the potential to completely solve energy needs world-wide, curb climate-impacting emissions, desalinate enough water to sustain humans without needing to shed blood over it, and tons more besides.\n\nHowever, the thing I'm writing about that I find interesting isn't just the big-picture things that fusion power could do, but a small problem it would also address. We're in the midst of  helium shortage that will be absolutely final, and as sad as this is for party balloons and some computer components, the biproduct of successful fusion reactions? The \"waste\" it generate?\n\nHelium.",

If we run out of Helium we have to either give up deep scuba diving or only dive hydrogen mixes and while they work that doesn't mean they make me feel great (and I'm really not sure you really want to be diving hydrogen in the 50-100m range).",

            "body": "I hit fifteen years of marriage with my wife on Thursday!  That makes me pretty dang happy, but it's only the half time, in my opinion.  Let's just say in another 15 years, I will have been married to her for as much time as I have not been married.  Wish me luck!\n\nJob search is still ongoing.  Luckily, I can fall back on unemployment.  My lost wages claim is being processed, but I'm pretty sure the waterpark is going into bankruptcy, so we will see.  At least it's helping while I'm dealing with getting screwed over.\n\n**Question:**  As mentioned earlier in one of these threads, I've taken a shine to Magic again.  Went out last night for a brief time (wife had a girls' night, so I wanted to make sure I was home in time to take care of the dogs) and I had a lot of fun.  We are currently playing EDH, and the new bracket system is a little confusing in some ways--just how many tutors is \"few?\"  What counts as a tutor?  Etc.  But everyone seemed to have a good time, everyone was very nice, and the absolute worst thing that happened was people making mistakes with decks they were unfamiliar with.  I, admittedly, am just there to play the game and socialize.  I'm not going cutthroat unless someone decides to offend me.  I just want to let my legitimate businessmen do legitimate business.\n\n**Recipe:**  Hoo boy, let's have some fun with this one.  Since I know the Mods have been working very hard lately, I'm going to give out a recipe for the one thing they deserve, but they never get:  HOT POCKETS!\n\n* Two packages of puff pastry\n* 1 pound ham, chopped fine\n* 1 tsp each rosemary and thyme\n* 1 lb. Mozzarella cheese, diced\n* 2 eggs, beaten, with a little water added\n* Flaky salt\n* (Optional) 1/2 lb goat cheese, diced fine\n\nCombine the ham, cheeses, and most of the herbs.  Season to taste.  Take the puff pastry and make, well, Hot Pockets.  Crimp with a fork and then brush with egg wash, then top with flaky salt and the leftover herbs.  Bake at 350F (the F stands for FREEDOM!) until golden brown and delicious.  Serve with a bearnaise sauce if you think you've deserved it.",
