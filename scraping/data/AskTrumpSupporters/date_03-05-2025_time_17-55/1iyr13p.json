Arab can include a wide range of skin & hair colours  and features, just like being Jewish can, and both traditional Jewish and Arab looks are Semitic (that word means the region, not just Jews in particular.)\n\nDo you think Palestinians, who have no money to speak of, will be able to afford to live in this resort for the wealthy? Do you think they would pass security checks or that they would bear no resentment towards the people partying, drinking alcohol, and having pre/extramarital sex on the corpses of their people?\n\nIf the Palestinians don't agree with this, how is this an appropriate solution?",

I would conceivably withhold aid,\"\n\nTrump literally states he would move the Palestinians off the land, not allow them to return, use aid as a means to get Jordan and Egypt to settle them, and you think some Arab kids in his AI video is better evidence of what is being implied here?",

How good everyone would look is up for debate. But it's basically posturing, trump is saying \"well if you can't agree to any reasonable solution, and you won't play nice, how about no state? I like resorts, and quite frankly, I want to build one in Gaza, and I probably could come to think of it.\" It is an unreasonable solution presented to unreasonable people, and either it will make them act more reasonably, or it won't and things will be right where they were before.

The video cropped out Elon waiting for his son to catch up, waving him on, cheering when he caught up, and them leaving together. Someone on this website thought it appropriate to remove as much context as possible to make Elon look like a bad father. Reddit ate it up. Similarly, on r/law, a video was circulated yesterday purportedly of trump starting to restrict firearms at the federal level, and explicitly framing it as new executive actions. Comments abounded about how the administration was going to use \"mental health\" justifications for stripping liberals of their firearms. Absent from the video is the context that this was from 6 years ago and the laws trump signed then have been the law for years at this point, this was not some new action or betrayal of the 2A community. I can remember when trump was criticized for eating his steak with ketchup. It really doesn't matter what Trump does at this point, it will be spun into a negative, or when that fails, simply ignored.",

It is plan promotion for the sitting President of the US to build a hotel in a current warzone we are providing the ammunition for. So to me, it muddies the water on what the end goal is here  & feels as though the only exit involves the President's *personal financial gain*\n2. The video includes only Tesla vehicles & no other American car companies. In which the CEO of that company is his current employee. This shows obvious bias + $TSLA has been crashing since the beginning of the year and speculation that TSLA will be involved in the rebuild of this city could effect share price.  Again, muddies the water ethically (to me).\n3. Elon walking the beach w/ money falling. Again, federal employee + financial incentive for result of water. (Ethical grey area to me)\n4. President of US Statue in Gaza? Why? I would like to be American-first, why are we promoting the spread of US outside our borders.\n5. I do not like the idea of the sitting President posting + promoting AI-generated content *at all*. It sets a dangerous precedent, as we enter an era where AI-generate content may very soon be indiscernible from live footage.\n\n  \nDo you think any of these issues ( I have ) with the video are valid? My concerns are not necessarily just of President Trump, but of the President of the US (in general) posting this.",

No one is coming here to pat President Trump on the back.\n\nTo me though, I wouldn't say the video is a dumb internet meme though, his words carry weight as you said. To me, he lost the privilege of 'meme-ing' (or however the kids say it) when he became President, he can pick the hobby back up in 4 years.

It's insanely ridiculous.\n\n> Do you think this is acceptable for the president to be posting?\n\nWhy not? It's not like last week when he was jokingly insinuating he was a monarch. That I found kinda rude; just given our colonial history even if it was tongue-in-cheek. Just a bit tone deaf when we're about to celebrate 250 years since the yoke of imperialism was shrugged off. This? It's both hilarious and very on-brand for Trump *and* fits in his broader plan to get the region to step up unless they want him to crater the area and build a mega hotel with trans strippers and free sky cash.\n\nIt's not like the hyper-socially conservative muslim middle east is super pumped for a hedonistic Western capitalist pleasure town a-la Vegas on steroids in their backyard complete with American military to keep the place safe. Something tells me the more trolling he does on this the more it makes the muslim world anxious and makes them want to force a solution on their terms.\n\n> Would you like to see him post more of this type of thing, or less?\n\nProbably more if they're as funny as this one and further his negotiating position. Less if they're just more riffs on this since the joke will get stale pretty fast.\n\nThanks for posting it I hadn't seen this since I don't go on other social media sites, so pretty funny to see what's going on over there.",

If they were made part of the US, then that falls under focusing on domestic issues instead of foreign affairs.  Would be fine if the majority of the citizens in those locations were happy with the arrangement, and at least Greenland the population is small enough that we could certainly make it worth it for them.  I think the US has better things to focus on, but could certainly be a good investment in the future, so why not at least explore the possibility.",

He wants to resettle them in Jordan and Egypt.  Under his plan, the Gazans would be removed and moved from Gaza to other countries in the region.\n\nAs another point, there is no reason to accuse posters of lying and then ask rhetorically if that's a good thing to do.  We can make our points with less snark, and thereby improve the quality of the discussion.",

Was that Trump or Biden?\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/a-timeline-of-donald-trumps-creepiness-while-he-owned-miss-universe-191860/\n\n\"On the heels of the damaging videotape on which Trump and former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush salivated over Days of Our Live actress Arianne Zucker, and joked about sexually assaulting women, came allegations that Trump entered the Miss Teen USA changing room where girls as young as 15 were in various states of undress.\n\nMariah Billado, Miss Teen Vermont 1997 told BuzzFeed, \u201cI remember putting on my dress really quick because I was like, \u2018Oh my god, there\u2019s a man in here.'\u201d Three other teenage contestants from the same year confirmed the story.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not offer a response to either story, but in a 2005 appearance on Howard Stern\u2019s show, Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. \u201cI\u2019ll go backstage before a show, and everyone\u2019s getting dressed and ready and everything else,\u201d he said. His position as the pageant\u2019s owner entitled him to that kind of access, Trump explained, seemingly aware that what he was doing made the women uncomfortable. \u201cYou know, no men are anywhere. And I\u2019m allowed to go in because I\u2019m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I\u2019m inspecting it\u2026 Is everyone OK? You know, they\u2019re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that,\u201d he said.\"\n\nOkay, next round! Who made the following comments about his own daughter, at points when she was underage - was that Trump or Biden?\n\nhttps://forward.com/schmooze/357185/7-creepy-things-donald-trump-has-said-about-ivanka/\n\n\nDuring a Feb. 27, 2013, interview on The Wendy Williams Show, Trump was asked what he and his daughter both consider their favorite things. Trump answered, \u201cI was going to say sex, but I can relate to [golf and real estate].\u201d\n\nWhen a host asks how Donald Trump would feel about his daughter posing for Playboy, he says that \u201cIvanka posing for Playboy would be really disappointing\u2026 not really. But it would depend on what was inside the magazine \u2026 I don\u2019t think Ivanka would [do a nude shoot] inside the magazine. Although she does have a very nice figure. I\u2019ve said that if Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps I\u2019d be dating her.\u201d\n\nOn The Howard Stern Show, way back in 2003, Donald Trump had this to say about his daughter Ivanka: \u201cYou know who\u2019s one of the great beauties of the world, according to everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka. My daughter, Ivanka. She\u2019s 6 feet tall, she\u2019s got the best body.\u201d\n\nDuring a 2015 interview with Donald Trump for Rolling Stone, reporter Paul Solotaroff praised Ivanka Trump. The soon-to-be president\u2019s response? \u201cYeah, she\u2019s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren\u2019t happily married and, ya know, her father\u2026\u201d\n\nIn an early draft of a piece by Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen, he purportedly wrote that \u201cPresident-elect Donald Trump once asked, \u2018Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?\u2019 \u2014 but the quote was quietly removed before the syndicated column was published.\u201d\n\nAccording to The New Republic, \u201c\u2019Aides said he talked about Ivanka Trump\u2019s breasts, her backside and what it might be like to have sex with her, remarks that once led [former Chief of Staff] John Kelly to remind the president that Ivanka was his daughter,\u2019 Taylor, who served as a Department of Homeland Security chief of staff under Trump, wrote in his book.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-creepiest-most-unsettling-comments-a-roundup-a7353876.html\n\nWhen Donald Trump was watching his 16-year-old daughter Ivanka host the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant, he turned to the then-Miss Universe and asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you think my daughter\u2019s hot? She\u2019s hot, right?\u201d\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what technique of goalpost moving and hand waving you'll employ to explain how all of these are somehow made up or taken out of context. By all means, surprise me!",

You did exactly what I said you would do, to a T. I brought up several valid points about trump being, at best, a total disgusting creep and at worst an admitted pedeophile after you accused Democrats of supporting creeps and pedos and you had to outright ignore, twist and straight up lie about every single point I brought up. So the projection you're detecting here is just your own, sorry. It really is as simple as that. Thanks for playing though! I know cognitive dissonance can be hard.",
