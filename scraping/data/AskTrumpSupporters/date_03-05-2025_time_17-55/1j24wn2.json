You spend more than the entire OECD and by a long shot- more than double many European countries per capita. So the question should be why are European countries and Canada more efficient and productive with their healthcare spending, while achieving far better outcomes.\n\nAs for other social policies, the US can afford them all. Your political system blocks them, or butchers them to make them so inefficient that they have justification to cancel them. Have you not been following Congress over the last 20 years?\n\nIf you are blaming the lack of social programmes and policies on Canada and Europe then you are truly lost.",

You have no access to their internal thought processes. You've chosen one (or been programmed with one) that turns them into cartoon villains and prevents you from dealing with complex ideas such as competing interests, cause-and-effect, trade-offs, etc. It's just good guys vs evil guys.\n\n>the most part progressives who want people to get more help when they're struggling and want their society to improve and progress\n\n...so long as they are completely insulated from the negative \\*real-world consequences\\* of their ideas, and they don't have to sacrifice or pay any cost for their pharisaical moral posturing. \n\n>\u00a0rather than regress or stick to the status quo?\n\nProgressivism has been the status quo of the US since 1933. It has been the status quo of the elites since 1912. Your worldview requires you to believe you are the plucky rebels, though it's completely divorced from reality.\n\n>Just look at his inauguration where he was flanked by billionaires,\n\nYes, a handful of billionaires have joined Trump. Money goes where the power is... big surprise. Where do you think they were when Biden was President? On the whole though, billionaires lopsidedly support the Democratic Party. (Which makes sense, since Progressivism has been the status quo since 1933.) Look at any electoral map and see how the wealthiest areas vote: they are ALL dark blue. It's not even close. The Red areas are not the wealthy areas.\n\nWhat I'm saying is not wild, because it aligns with reality. Again, your worldview requires you to be divorced from reality.",

I am an American living in Germany, there is absolutely no will to send troops to Ukraine from Europe.\n2. Some negotiated settlement. Russia holds are the cards since neither the US or Europe has the will to send their children to fight for Ukraine. Perhaps some sort of security guarantee could be paid for with mineral rights since they have no money.

Nobody over here sees the tariffs as a benevolent \"bargaining tool\" or feels that Trump has any interest in staying allies with them. You can laugh at that and call the rest of the world sensitive snowflakes, but the fact is that Trumps actions and words are alienating the rest of the democratic world and instead appealing to the autocracies of the world, specifically Russia.\n\nTo end with a question - do you believe that the US should maintain a relationship with it's allies, or do you think it's better for the US to carry on with it's isolationist policy?",
