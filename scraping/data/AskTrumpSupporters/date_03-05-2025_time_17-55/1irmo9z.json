Contraception?\n\n7.  Abortion?\n\n8.  Incest?\n\n9.  Homosexuality?\n\n10.  Transvestitism?\n\n11. Transgenderism?\n\n12.  Polygamy?\n\n13.  Age of consent/statutory rape/pedophilia?\n\n14.  Masturbation?\n\n15.  Paraphilia?\n\n16.  Beastiality?\n\n17.  Other forms of sexual immorality?\n\nSome of these were *huge* issues in the past.  The Supreme Court officially legalized miscegenation, abortion and sodomy.  Then, the Supreme Court reversed itself on abortion.  Which means that any of the above could be open either to liberalization or to restriction/prohibition in the future.\n\nWhat are your preferences with regard to the above activities?  If you want laws, then what should those laws be?  Laws governing human sexuality vary widely across the planet.  For example, some countries permit homosexual marriage, while others impose a death sentence on homosexuals.\n\nAnother example of variations in sexual laws: https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-11/10/content_280236.htm\n\n>A Singaporean police sergeant has been jailed for two years for having oral sex in a country where prostitution is legal but oral sex is not, a newspaper reported Friday.\n>\n>The Straits Times reported that the 27-year-old police coast guard sergeant landed in court after a 16-year-old reported to the police that she had performed oral sex on the man.\n>\n>She was above the age of consent and agreed to perform the act, but oral sex is against the law in the city-state, the paper said.\n>\n>\"The act by itself is an offence. It is not a question of consent or no consent. Even between consenting people, it is an offence,\" criminal lawyer Subhas Anandan told the paper.\n>\n>The maximum punishment for the offence is life imprisonment.\n\nIn most of the USA at present, prostitution is a crime, but oral sex is fine, although the \"age of consent\" is a tad higher in many US jurisdictions.",

            "body": "1. I think that pornography is generally harmful and not a good thing, but I am not for the government interfering in citizens' lives where there are no victims. I am against how socially acceptable it is and the negative impacts it comes with, but would not support government action taken against it as long as the participants are consenting adults and nobody is injured.\n2. My views on prostitution have flip-flopped some over the years, I'm still struggling with a firm stance on it. I think overall it is wrong and devalues intimacy, but I am often swayed by the argument that outlawing it causes more harm than good by trapping victims of human sex trafficking since they're afraid to go to the police once they're prostitutes, even if it is against their own will. If it were to be legal, I would want there to be a lot of regulations around it to ensure that everybody participating is doing so of their own will, and regular STD testing required both for the prostitutes, as well as clients being required to show a clean STD test taken within a certain amount of time beforehand.\n3. Adultery is horrible and wrong, but should remain a civil matter. It should be dragged through the mud socially more than it tends to be these days, for both men and women cheaters, but I don't like the idea of criminal penalties.\n4. What consenting adults do on their own private time is none of my, or the government's, business.\n5. Interracial relationships/marriage are perfectly fine and should not be restricted by government or society.\n6. Contraception is a wonderful thing and should be used by anybody having sex who doesn't want a child. That being said, it does not absolve one of responsibility if a child should still come of it despite the use of contraceptives. Realistically, we're never going to stop human beings from sleeping with each other, even in situations where they probably shouldn't. So I see no cons to making sex as safe as possible.\n7. I used to be pro-choice (despite most of my ideology being republican/conservative), but that has changed in recent years. I think that abortion is overall a bad thing and would love for it to be wiped out completely, but if I were in a position to make policy about it, I would likely adopt something similar what most of Europe does - a very limited time-frame (usually around 12 weeks in Europe, I usually just say the first trimester for simplicity) and after that it is illegal outside of exceptional circumstances such as rape and/or incest. Abortion in general is a terrible thing in my view, but even the thought of very late-term abortions are abominations and should be punished harshly, particularly for the doctors who perform them.\n8. Incest is wrong and has a high likelihood of being very damaging for any child, should one be born from it. It should be illegal with harsh punishments up to where there is significant risk of birth defects, and after that point should be unacceptable and shamed socially.\n9. What consenting adults do on their own private time is none of my, or the government's, business.\n10. I think that cross-dressing and the culture surrounding it is generally harmful to society, and should not be as well accepted by society as it has become, but I would not be supportive of any legislation against it in and of itself. I believe in a free society with minimal government intervention, except in cases where there is somehow a victim involved, so legislating what somebody can wear would not align with my values.\n\nEdit: Comment was too long, continued below.",

                    "body": "11. Much the same as #10 above, but I think that much of what we're seeing recently is a mental health crisis. Many of the people involved have legitimate mental health issues that they need professional help with, and giving way to their delusions rather than being honest with them is not helping anybody. \n\n12. I think that polygamy is generally wrong and should be socially discouraged and not legally recognized (e.g., no polyamorous marriages), but other than that, again, what consenting adults do on their own private time is none of my, or the government's, business. \n\n13. Age of consent should either remain where its at, or be raised by a couple of years or so. Any form of sexual assault/contact towards a child under 12 should carry the death penalty without exception (so long as it is proven without a reasonable doubt); above that varies by the age of the victim and perpetrator/case/severity, but should still be penalized harshly in cases where the adult was knowingly engaging in such a way with a minor.\n\n14. No opinion really, masturbation is a personal thing where the government absolutely should not be involved in any capacity. Should it somehow be an issue, it should be handled in-house among family. The only exception I can think of would be something like public masturbation, which of course falls under public indecency. Overall, not an issue to me. \n\n15. There are many different kinds of paraphilia, and my thoughts on it varies by case. Overall I think that they're negative, but if its only consenting adults involved and nobody is getting injured or killed, then that's their business.  \n\n16. Beastiality is horrible and should always remain both socially and legally unacceptable. Aside from it just being gross, animals cannot consent.\n\n17. I'm not particularly interested in government being the morality police. If no children are involved, and nobody is getting injured or killed, and everybody involved is consenting, then it is none of my, or the government's, business.",

Prostitution? - Do not like it but the reality is that it exist.  An area of abuse by criminal organizations.  Also an area than needs intense government regulation. Would like to see more prosecution on the demand side and the criminal supply side.  I can see a case for legal but regulated.  Not an area for the Fed, but reserved to the States.  Well, the Fed should be involved in trafficking.  \n3. Adultery? - Valid justification for divorce. \n4. Sodomy? - Private interaction of consenting parties. \n5. Miscegenation? - I had to look this one up, never hear the term before.  This is fine. \n6. Contraception? - Support.  All for air dropping condoms into areas with high births to young single moms. In fact, I am willing to spend my taxpayer money on free vasectomies to anyone who wants it.  \n7. Abortion? - Tolerable in the 1st trimester, hard no in the 3rd.  Not sure where to draw the line in the 2nd. \n8. Incest? - Illegal.  I believe Game of Thrones explained why.  :-)  \n9. Homosexuality? - Not the governments business. \n10. Transvestitism? - Not the governments business.  How you choose to dress is up to you. \n11. Transgenderism? - That is a you issue.  If you want to transition, that is also up to you.  But it is not an operation the government or health insurance is compelled to provide. Also opposed a transgendered person in sports of their non-birth gender.  \n12. Polygamy? - Opposed to the legal recognition.  How three people choose to live is up to those three.  However, the third is not getting any legal support.  ie no claims to inheritance, three party tax returns, ect. \n13. Age of consent/statutory rape/pedophilia? Fine the way it is.  18 is considered an adult. Yes, it is arbitrary but I don't know of a better way. I know some States have a lower age, but I will leave that to those States. \n14. Masturbation? - Not the governments business so long as it remains private.  \n15. Paraphilia? - Also had to look this one up.  Is this an issue?  \n16. Beastiality? - Illegal\n17. Other forms of sexual immorality? - So really it comes down to consent, not forcing on others and not involving children and animals.",

I'm fine with pornography existing and being age-limited.

Put what you want where you want it, as long as everyone is consenting.\n5. This is another one of those things that I don't get.  My sister once spent two years mapping out our family tree.  How far back does one need to go to figure out what race they are?  Is it just by looks or what?  What if you're married for 40 years and find out one of your ancestors was of mixed race?\n6. I don't particularly like abortifacients, but that's just a me thing.  And I fully admit, I haven't used contraception in years.  I've also been married to a wife who, quite literally, cannot have children.  Use what you want.\n7. I think abortion is a tragedy, and one that should be avoided most of the time.  That's not a moral thing, really, so much as \"Dude, you can tell me the condom broke or whatever, but chances are, you were doing something wrong.\"  I think they should be legal and safe, within reason, but I think that, barring health crises, rape, incest, etc., people shouldn't need to get one.\n8. This one always gets me.  I find it weird and I'm very opposed to the \"grooming\" aspect of many such cases, but I also have heard about long-lost cousins who were in a relationship and realized they were related, etc.  Ultimately, if it's two consenting adults, I suppose it's none of my business, but still, it seems icky.\n\n(This got too long, sorry!  Will comment the rest.)",

In which case, then yeah, I'm going to have an opinion on the subject.\n2. 10.  What you want to wear, outside of public indecency laws, also has nothing to do with me.  I may think you look silly, but that doesn't matter.\n3. 11.  Here's a sticky one.  I do not care.  If I've known you as Betty, but you want me to call you Al, I'm okay with that.  It's your body.  However, I think that it's important that someone be of \"sound mind\" to begin transitioning and that they are open about it when it comes to relationships.  I also believe that physical truths are truth--if you have an outie, I don't expect a lesbian to want to do the horizontal tango with you.\n4. 12.  Don't care.  It's a weird legal issue, which is part of why I think the government should be out of marriages.  I've met several polycules (not quite the same thing), and those have severely tainted my views on things, but I am also adult enough to realize that just because they failed doesn't mean it's always horrible.\n5. 13.  **HERE IS THE BIG ONE!**  As mentioned above, all of these points tie into this one.  As long as everyone involved is of the age of consent, I don't really care.  I would support a national age of consent law, because things are really strange, and I would support some sort of Romeo and Juliet law to allow younger couples around the age of consent to not go to jail.  I think sometimes here our commitment to ensuring that children are not abused winds up destroying innocent lives--think about the kids who get busted for child pornography because they sent a naughty pic to their SO.  I could write up a lot about this, because I find the notion of the magical minute ridiculous, and I think it's strange that I could theoretically be drafted to go off and die for my country before I could buy smokes, but still.\n6. 14.  Just don't do it somewhere I can see, okay?  And if you must do it in a public restroom, be quick about it and clean up your dang mess!\n7. 15.  This encompasses such a wide range of topics, so let me use the scientific definition.  If we are talking about disorders, I want people to be treated.  But for most uses of the term, people are just talking about kink.  Nothing wrong with getting a little kinky.  But if I walk into your apartment and you have a swing, a rack, and an assortment of toys on proud display, I'm most likely going to excuse myself shortly after.\n8. 16.  No.  Just no.\n9. 17.  I don't know what sexual immorality is.\n\nUltimately, I have five issues with someone's sex life, preferences, whatever:\n\n1. Is it with me?\n2. Is it with my wife?\n3. Is everyone consenting?\n4. Are there any kids involved (see point 3!).\n5. Do I have to see it?\n\nSo long as all those questions are answered satisfactorily, I don't care.",

But I don't really understand the difference between one being immoral and illegal and the other one being acceptable. \n\nWhy do you think that is? What's the practical difference between a guy getting a BJ from his boyfriend or his sister? Is incest a mental illness?",

I hate it/it should be banned and those participating should be given light consequences and pointed to a regular job.\n\n3. I hate it/I don't really think you could make it illegal so I'd support social consequences like shaming and accountability. \n\n4. I see it as sinful and wrong/I think it should be socially discouraged and addressed when it's found out. \n\n5. I believe this is about interracial marriage, I'm fine with that and think it should be allowed socially and legally. \n\n6. I don't like it and generally think it shouldn't exist, primarily because I don't think they're even safe for women to be using. The idea of contraception is something I think everyone should be against but we aren't there yet as a society to do that. \n\n7. I hate it and it should be illegal because it's murder. Which is already illegal but people like to pretend abortion isn't murder. Abortionists should go to jail, period. \n\n8. I hate it and it should be illegal if it's an adult and minor situation, I think following pedophilia laws would work. If it's  two adults, I'm in favor of social shaming. \n\n9. I don't support it and think it should be socially shamed. I don't think legal consequences would work. \n\n10 & 11. I don't like either and neither should exist in public life. I wouldn't jail people for it unless they involved children or vulnerable people. Outside of that, I'd just support social shaming. \n\n12. I don't like it and it should be illegal. I don't care if the adults are consenting, that's gross and the children will suffer. \n\n13. Age of consent should be raised to 20 in my opinion. As a 22 year old, the idea that as a high school senior I could go into sex work or be sleeping with some old man and it's supposed to be fine because \"she's 18, she's an adult\" is beyond insane. Statutory rape and pedophilia should both be treated with the death penalty unless the adult was duped by the minor, which does happen. \n\n14. Don't like it/ it's a private issue that individuals and/or families should address. \n\n15. Hate it/ it should be privately addressed by an individual or their family. As a society we should discourage it and punish it accordingly, depending on what it is. \n\n16. Beastiality should be completely illegal and punishable with jail time.",

It's not simply a matter of seeing something harmless and saying \"that's gross\". Lots of bad lifestyles effectively require not just tolerance, but active subsidy.

We have laws, we tax them, we have all sorts of regulations on advertising, etc. We certainly don't treat smoking cigarettes as something to be proud of or alcoholics as a marginalized community. There have been decades-long campaigns to get people to stop smoking and at the very least to stop binge drinking. \n\n> Homosexuality is not the issue, especially when you consider that heterosexual couples engage in many of the same sex acts.

Beyond that, I don't know what your point is. Your comment is written as if we don't have data on this. Rates matter!",

Which means it needs to be respectful and with the context of marriage, which means they would have children. \n\n>Furthermore, why would legal consequences for things such as homosexuality not work?

When I actually understand how they work then I'll say something. \n\n>Why do you see sexual immorality as worse? I\u2019ve asked this and you\u2019ve only said it\u2019s easier to spot, never why it\u2019s worse.\n\nSexual immorality is often depraved. Beastiality, rape, incest, pornography, sexual assault, and homosexuality are all sexual immorality. These things, in varying degrees, indulge lust and that is wrong. Before you attempt to say this no, I am not saying that gay sex is the same as rape or beastiality. I'm saying they're both forms of sexual immorality. \n\nGiven those examples, I'm personally more concerned about sexual immorality as a category. When it comes to greed, I'm less upset about that because that's more of an individual issue as far as I'm concerned. If someone is hoarding money because of greed we should influence them to have a more open heart, but I'm not going to be as upset about that as I would with sexual immorality. \n\nAgain, caring less about one doesn't mean the other doesn't matter. If you think they're equally bad, great. I don't and I'm fine with that.",
