The cuts start on pg. 34. The article does take a bit of a leap when interpreting proposed cuts from, say, the House Committee on Agriculture as cuts to Medicaid. More realistically, it would be a reduction in SNAP benefits, school lunch, and food distribution programs.",

Without seeing the Ways and Means proposal, there\u2019s no definitive proof that those changes will entirely benefit the wealthy. \n\nSuch a claim should probably best be stated as a projection of what they will likely contain, based off of similar past tax reform supported by Trump and the types of conservatives that currently staff the committee. Those tend to not look that great for low and moderate earners compared to high earners. Such a projection wouldn\u2019t be ridiculous.\n\nOf course, trying to point at left-leaning media and criticize them for imprecise language and gross generalizations smacks of the pot calling the kettle black, given the administrations own careless rhetoric on a number of issues.",

Filers who earned $50,000 to $100,000 received a tax break of about 15 percent to 17 percent, and those earning $100,000 to $500,000 in adjusted gross income saw their personal income taxes cut by around 11 percent to 13 percent. By comparison, no income group with an AGI of at least $500,000 received an average tax cut exceeding 9 percent, and the average tax cut for brackets starting at $1 million was less than 6 percent. (For more detailed data, see my table published\u00a0[here](https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/measuring-the-effects-of-the-republicans-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-on-personal-income-taxes).) That means most middle-income and working-class earners enjoyed a tax cut that was at least double the size of tax cuts received by households earning $1 million or more. **What\u2019s more, IRS data shows earners in higher income brackets contributed a bigger slice of the total income tax revenue pie following the passage of the tax reform law than they had in the previous year.\"**",

Truly an anomaly.\n\nSo in your view - even if we lowered taxes for 100% for people making under 50k - that would a 100% price decrease - from 2.3k to 0 - that would still be bad policy and wouldn't speak to the economic situation of Americans if those same Millionaires saw a .8% decrease in their taxes, and had their taxes lowered by 2.5k. That's your position?\n\n>You think that first individual feels like those changes benefited them more than the millionaire?\n\nYou tell me - with the situation I just mentioned, you think that the millionaires making 2.5k more a year benefitted more from a .8% cut than people under 50k having their taxes cut to zero? C'mon Man! This is such a bad take lol. People who are living below the average wage in the US already pay super low taxes, and I'm happy to lower them more - but pretending like the overall amount is what matters and not the percentage amount is just silly. \n\nDo you also think that a Billionaire losing a million dollars has the same impact as a person in poverty going a half million dollars in debt?

That\u2019s the standard supply-side argument: cut taxes, and businesses will expand, investment will increase, wages will rise, and tax revenue will grow.\n\nThe problem is, there\u2019s no guarantee that happens at the scale needed to cover $4.5 trillion in lost revenue, even with $2 trillion in spending cuts. Historically, tax cuts do lead to some growth, but not enough to fully pay for themselves--especially when they primarily benefit high earners and corporations, who tend to save or invest rather than immediately spend their extra money.\n\nAnd beyond that, what happens when you abruptly turn off massive swaths of the federal government to make up for the shortfall? Economic instability isn\u2019t exactly a recipe for growth. Investors and businesses thrive on predictability.\n\nDo you disagree? How would you interpret this in a way that doesn\u2019t overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy?",

It doubled the standard deduction and child tax credits, so anyone making 12-24k didn't have to pay taxes anymore.  The next few brackets saved 15% on average, gradually decreasing until about 100k where it was a 9% reduction.  Top one percent saw a 5% decrease.\n\nThe 'for the rich' part was a cut from 39.6% to 37%, a token five percent decrease.  But since the top 1% pays 50% of the income taxes, they get to multiply the difference by 50 and claim that most of the cuts went to them.  The result is idiotic [statements](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/2025-budget-stakes-high-income-tax-cuts-price-hiking-tariffs-would-harm) like \"Households with incomes in the top 1 percent (who make more than roughly $743,000 a year) would get tax cuts averaging $61,000 a year, compared to only about $400 for households with incomes in the bottom 60 percent (who make roughly $96,000 or less).\".  The first group is still paying 37% of their income, versus 0-3.4% for the latter (bottom half).  They also like to declare that lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is a 'tax break for the ultra wealthy', even though 60% of stocks are held by pension funds and retirement accounts.  Pretty much every source ignores tax credits, wherin many at the bottom pay no taxes at all, and get tens of thousands in free money on the basis of having kids; real tax rates would be on the order of -50% in many cases, particularly among the poorest.  TCJA increased this effect substantially.\n\nAnother trend I noticed while sourcing this is that they've started rolling in the hypothetical cost of tarriffs, and [discarding](https://itep.org/a-distributional-analysis-of-donald-trumps-tax-plan-2024/) any benefit from the TCJA altogether, and spinning it by association as trump giving away money to the rich, and raising taxes on everyone else.",

It\u2019s all of our jobs to demand a higher standard of scrutiny than that, since no one hoarding power or wealth tends to telegraph themselves all that plainly.\n\nIm not satisfied that the budget appropriately  reduces \u201cwaste\u201d in a number of the areas it kinda yada-yada-yada\u2019s its way through.

It sounds nice that we could just wave our hands and solve everything with a singular plan, but we have tried this time and time again ([Trump\u2019s last attempt)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-promised-his-tax-cuts-would-boost-wages-by-4-000-but-most-workers-saw-few-gains-study-finds-f778dec3)) with beyond poor results that do little for most of us. Meanwhile, the Committee on Ways and Means is given free license to increase the deficit by $4.5 trillion. What\u2019s that for exactly? Where\u2019s the proposal that those expenditures will do anything for our growing income disparity?\n\nWhat (if anything) are you personally looking to see cut, and why, from these committees beyond \u201cwaste\u201d?",

We are in a super tough spot financially as a country and one of the things that I like about the Republican/DOGE response is that they are the only party that SEEMS to be making some effort at addressing the expense side of the ledger.  \n\nThe thing I hate about the Republican/DOGE response is gaslighting the uneducated voters by not being upfront about how much this is going to hurt. \n\nWe have a financial cancerous tumor right now, but if we assume that social security and Medicare is political suicide, then the only way to balance the budget and excise the tumor imo is to make cuts that are going to fucking hurt, and hurt a lot of people. There\u2019s no way around this.  \n\nUSAID is a drop in the bucket, but low-hanging fruit because the average American, to be frank, doesn\u2019t give a fuck about any of those programs getting funded.  Democrats need to seriously wrap their head around what people care about today if they have any hope of winning seats.\n\nI think the education funding stuff you mentioned is another low-hanging fruit and something that absolutely is not a \u201cmandatory service\u201d. \n\nWe have seen very clearly that once the government started backstopping student loans guaranteeing they wouldn\u2019t default and also not allowing citizens to discharge their student loan debt via bankruptcy, the cost of going to college has fucking exploded.  Way outpacing inflation.  \n\nDemocrats always virtue signaling about wealth and income disparity, why is it never discussed how destructive it is to make it easy for 18 year olds to take on 6-figures of debt for bullshit degrees that have 0% chance of getting a job that gives an ROI on that investment? We know compounding interest is the most valuable tool for wealth creation and we are saddling millions of Americans with an inescapable debt early in their lifetime when it has the largest impact on their ability to compound their wealth in their life.  How is that helping anyone?",

As compared to *current law*, the bill reduces spending by $2T and allows for an additional $0.5T in tax relief. \n\nSecond, claims that the law only benefited the wealthy are false. Like, insanely false. A couple sources below, but another is elementary math. The text of the bill is public \u2014 you can see the changes to individual tax brackets, the standard deduction, and the CTC for yourself. Just do the math for a person making $50K, $100K, and $200K using the marginal tax rates and standard deduction under pre- and post-TCJA rates and see what you get. To answer your direction question, the expiry of the TCJA would increase my tax bill by around $2500/year. \n\nOn spending: I am for deep cuts to federal spending, far beyond $2T over ten years, to all major categories including discretionary spending, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. My chief criticism is that it doesn\u2019t go far enough. A good baseline would be to restore spending to 2013-2015 levels of 20% of GDP, which amounts to a ~800B real spending decrease per year. \n\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/data/all/federal/congressional-budget-office-shows-2017-tax-law-reduced-tax-rates-across-board-2018/\n\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/finance/584190-irs-data-prove-trump-tax-cuts-benefited-middle-working-class-americans-most/amp/",

That's a 25% tax increase on the working class if Trump had lost in November.\n\nThe next bracket from $63,100 to $100,500 also goes up 3 percentage points on an expiration from 22% to 25%. That's a 13% tax increase on the middle class if Trump had lost in November.\n\nThe top tax bracket > $609,351 would see it's rate go up 2.6 percentage points back to 39.6%. That's a 7% tax increase on the upper class if Trump had lost in November.\n\nAs you can see, the tax cuts overwhelmingly favor low income Americans. Where the fake-news bug bites you is that they discuss the topic in terms of absolute numbers, that in absolute dollar savings the upper classes come out ahead. What they leave out, is that the top 10% of earners pay 72% of income taxes. The bottom 50% of earners pay <3% of the federal income tax in absolute dollars, so while a 25% cut can mean a lot on an individual level it's not a big slice of the national income tax.",

I asked that OP for a source on the Tax Breaks for the wealthy claim, and the best evidence someone cited was that the TCJA tax cuts would be extended- the issue there is that TCJA income cuts primarily affected the MIDDLE CLASS - \n\n[https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/584190-irs-data-prove-trump-tax-cuts-benefited-middle-working-class-americans-most/](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/584190-irs-data-prove-trump-tax-cuts-benefited-middle-working-class-americans-most/)\n\n\"[A careful analysis of the IRS tax data](https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/measuring-the-effects-of-the-republicans-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-on-personal-income-taxes), one that includes the effects of tax credits and other reforms to the tax code, shows that filers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $15,000 to $50,000 enjoyed an average tax cut of 16 percent to 26 percent in 2018, the first year Republicans\u2019 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect and the most recent year for which data\u00a0is available.\n\nFilers who earned $50,000 to $100,000 received a tax break of about 15 percent to 17 percent, and those earning $100,000 to $500,000 in adjusted gross income saw their personal income taxes cut by around 11 percent to 13 percent. By comparison, no income group with an AGI of at least $500,000 received an average tax cut exceeding 9 percent, and the average tax cut for brackets starting at $1 million was less than 6 percent. (For more detailed data, see my table published\u00a0[here](https://www.heartland.org/publications-resources/publications/measuring-the-effects-of-the-republicans-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act-on-personal-income-taxes).)\n\nThat means most middle-income and working-class earners enjoyed a tax cut that was at least double the size of tax cuts received by households earning $1 million or more.\"",

There is also an argument that increased investment will lead to higher wages in the long run. The theory is that the lower corporate rate and temporarily expanded business expensing will spur investment in the United States, leading to more capital, and more productive workers. As worker productivity rises, firms will boost wages. All of this would happen gradually over the long term.\n\nHowever, the evidence for this story about long-term growth is weak at best. According to two leading economists, one liberal and one conservative, annual GDP growth might rise by 0.02 percentage points over the next decade. So far, corporations are using their added profits primarily to buy back shares and boost dividends, not to invest. In addition, rising productivity in recent decades has not been fully shared with workers, suggesting a less competitive economy than many assume. Finally, deficit-financing means that middle-class households will likely be hit with big tax increases or spending cuts later and interest rates will rise in the interim as government borrowing explodes. While revenue-neutral, pro-growth tax reform (rather than costly tax cuts) is possible and desirable, the TCJA falls far short of this standard.\u201d",

I will note that the economic dip the US experienced as a result of the pandemic was much smaller than other countries, and we recovered to pre-pandemic GDP levels before Biden even got into office. That either says something about the resilience of the US economy, or it is a statement on the TCJA helping to keep money circulating within the economy which eased the pressure of the pandemic and allowed us to boost back to recovery faster.

For tax year 2024, the standard deduction for single filers is $14,600 and $29,200 for married up from $6,500/13,000 pre TCJA.\n\nIf you are single making about 15k your tax went to literally zero, you saved 100% percent. Married making about 30k, same. Married making 60k, you likely saved around 20%. If you have children, you benefitted more, since the $1000 per-child credit was doubled. Rich making a billion, you saved around 2.5%, which ain't bad either, but not as good as 20%.",

(see Figure 2) The middle quintile of the income distribution received 8.2 percent of the benefit of the business reductions and 11.2 percent of those from the bill as a whole.\n\nThis is the footnote for #5, pointing out the corporate equity loophole, as far as I\u2019m understanding it:\n\n> While corporations initially pay the corporate income tax, economic research finds that, in the long run, the impact of the tax falls on owners of capital and, to a lesser degree, on workers. The TCJA\u2019s corporate tax reduction disproportionately benefited the wealthy because the wealthy disproportionately own corporate equities. In the last quarter of 2023, for example, the top 1 percent of the income distribution owned 49.4 percent of the share of corporate equities and mutual funds.

CPA here. Estate tax exemption doubled. Corporate income tax rate was cut substantially.

It makes it more practical and viable to actually realize a profit in the USA, which most large corporations no longer do, to avoid paying the corporate tax. Equities holders benefits somewhat, indirectly, since more profit = more money for buybacks.\n\n> Top personal rates came down several points\n\nFair, but rich people broadly don't pay these rates.

The corporate tax doesn't affect them or the wealthy. Stock buybacks are executed with the after-tax profits.

Perhaps they like the current system of unlimited government handouts better, but that\u2019s beside the point. \n\nWe can have all the things we used to have in true 1950s, the only reason we went away from all those policies was the government started  focusing on genociding whites, promoting \u201cdiversity,\u201d and giving handouts to every unproductive non-white person in every way they could. Now there is no real American nation left at all. \n\nWe don\u2019t have a war now because the nation has been neutered and cucked. \u201cImperialism\u201d made America great. There is no shortage of evil to fight in the world, but when half the country is filled with weak weirdos who simp for Gazan terrorists, you\u2019re never going to have a unified country capable of waging and winning a righteous war.",
