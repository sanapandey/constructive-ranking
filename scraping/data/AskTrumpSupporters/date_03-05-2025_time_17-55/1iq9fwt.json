That is the basis of his decision to drop the prosecution - because he was targeted in the same way by his political opponent.\n\nThe entire \"democratic\" machinery ignoring Biden's corruption in Ukraine then letting him pardon himself without much resistance is what should concern you. If the laptop wasn't real, it wouldn't need to be censored by every single social media company and media outlet like how China censors mentions of Tiananmen Square. It's dystopian, your double standards.  \n\n>  Is this really so surprising to you? How can you continue to support this naked erosion of our constitutional norms?\n\nI don't give two shits about some emotionally charged statements disguised as questions anymore. Nobody in 47's admin does either, see the interviews with Margaret Brennan pathetically trying.  \n\nI'd be more receptive to such questions if such noise was raised from your side when the Biden openly stated that he would ignore the Supreme Court. That time has passed now. We're going full steam ahead with Project 2025.",

How is all three branches being captured by one political party and passing all of its agenda any different than authoritarianism? \n\nBut well maybe this is inevitable and this is how the cycle of power work. Bipartisan consensus by the voter is always blocked through gridlock and big money in politics.

Just firing people and doesn't know what their jobs are or what the department does. I vaguely know someone who worked in the pentagon before they retired and he would talk about how expensive things were just because the government was buying it. We need a complete over haul.

I have worked and my father has worked in defense acquisitions on both sides of those tables. \n\nSome examples: during our occupation of Afghanistan, all the forward operating bases needed basic equipment to make the outpost livable. They needed toilet seats. Call them $30 at Lowe\u2019s. Well that toilet seat needed to be shipped the Kandahar air base, put on a truck, and driven through hostile territory. And, if at any point, that toilet seat was lost, stolen, blown up by an IED, the contractor had to replace it at no additional cost to the government. Also consider how much you have to pay a person to drive unarmored trucks through hostile terrain with active IED threats. All those and thousands more costs get worked into the bid price of that toilet seat and the contractor has to charge $150 for it to cover all the requirements that the government puts on the contract. \n\nAs another example, I was part of an expeditionary unit that was tasked with being capable of being deployed anywhere in the world within 72 hours and being capable of operating in remote and austere locations. We of course needed computers to perform our mission and a basic Dell or HP laptop costs $800. But we may be working in a tent in the desert, or on a barge in the tropics, or in the polar north. Our laptops had to be rugged enough withstand working outdoors in basically every environment on the planet. A laptop like that is going to be expensive. And **all** of our equipment had to be able to meet that requirement. \n\nIt\u2019s not necessarily corruption, it is usually just a case of the DoD having a 0% failure requirement to meet its mission and to achieve that, it is going to be expensive. \n\nJust think about this, if something were to happen, about 90% of our ships, planes, tanks, and soldiers would be able to operate and fight tomorrow. For every other country in the world could field even 50% of its military strength within 24 hours notice.",

The CEO took paying the bills away from my supervisor for our dept and gave them to me because he never paid anything on time. \nI notice one photographer (who.happens to be her friend) is getting paid triple the other photographers. I did the input of the web work (not actual design/Java whatever that is). The friend was charging us for every click of their camera. So he'd turn in a bill for a few thousand of dollars and we'd be able to use a small percentage. BUT other photographers would turn in only their good pictures and we could basically use any of the ones they gave us. But because he was friends with the hack we used him the most. So we were basically paying for their friendship. That's the kind of thing I'm talking about NOT what you said that makes sense. Anyone that isn't an IDIOT knows you have to pay for transport etc. Im talking about nepotism and good old boy network. That stuff is what we need to look at.

This is the entire crux of the charges he was convicted of and they have nothing. The very idea that anyone could be convicted of the specific charge Trump was convicted on without first being convicted on the crime(s) allegedly being covered up is ridiculous. The charges should have been a lower degree misdemeanor, and the statute of limitations had already passed anyway.

I think most people would agree that illegally breaking into those shops and stealing food can be justified, despite being clearly illegal.\n\nAs for the relevance of the quote to Trump's agenda, it depends on whether you believe we are currently on fast track to plunging off a financial cliff because of zealous overspending and waste - and that DOGE might save the day.\n\nPersonally, I think there are a few good remedies for the judges pushing back against DOGE.\n\n1. If you think it's an illegal end run around congressional powers, write your congressman and ask them to impeach Trump again.  Don't hold your breath.\n\n2. appeal to congress/senate to get legislation passed to give DOGE explicit powers.. though individual judges might still rule against it.\n\n3. Appeal and be patient - work way to supreme court if needed.   As bad as our deficits is, we're probably doomed either way.  If DOGE savings are a way out, a few months probably won't kill us.  Not good precedent to just ignore a given judge's ruling.",

There isn't anyone on the Democratic stage that has ever claimed Donald Trump was going to \"kill everybody\". Complete straw man.\n\nFrom that, then--it wouldn't follow that they would have a moral AND legal AND humanitarian obligation to stop him or that stopping him would mean they have to do it in an extra-judicial way. He can be a fascist who stands up many authoritarian policies like a Hitler, even parrot the bigotries and scapegoating of people like Hitler, hurt many people in our communities or nation or beyond its borders, even kill a lot of folks... and that might grant the Democrats a moral obligation to stop him. \"Legal obligation\" wouldn't mean anything, here--nothing compels them by the law to. \"Humanitarian\", also maybe.\n\nFrom that:\n\n>It just kind of shows the fact that they don\u2019t believe their own rhetoric that they simply let him become president -\n\nIt doesn't, though.\n\nIt shows that they can believe it enough to do everything within the bounds of legal power and process--so as to preserve the nation or salvage the institutions of the nation after he must leave office. It might MOTIVATE action: voting, donation, organizing, protest, criticism, legal obstruction, civil disobedience, even. It does not, however, necessitate them doing things \"by any means necessary\". \n\nIt sounds like you're mistaking, entirely, the criticisms of the Democrats and marrying that to a straw man of hype about how unless they are undertaking \"any means necessary\" as opposed to legal means, they can't have believed the things they ACTUALLY believed. Rather, you'd prefer they believed things you CLAIM they do (like \"he's going to kill everybody\"--which is pure nonsense, there is no serious voice on the left that has ever proposed that) and then judge them for not taking actions based on that false understanding of their stance.\n\nDo you have anything, anywhere that substantiates the idea that the Democrats of America both (1) believe Donald Trump will kill \"everybody\" and (2) won't take the actions available to them to stop that. Any source? Anyone with any serious, large platform, even?",

Namely its laws and its constitution?\n\nRegarding your claim that 90% of citizens in the United States were of Northern European ancestry, and your claim that \u201cLiberals\u201d ruined America, statistically speaking the majority of those liberals must have been from that 90% - which means that the people you claim are Americans did not and do not want the same things you do.\n\nSo then who are these people you claim represent the America you want? An America which doesn\u2019t adhere to the American legal system, or its constitution, and wants to override the will of the majority of other Americans who lead whatever changes you blame on Liberals?\n\nBy your own claim, you like white people. Aren\u2019t white people directly responsible for what you don\u2019t like about America?\n\nHere\u2019s [FDR in 1940 discussing America\u2019s dislike of the dictatorships spreading through Europe, and the threat they pose to the United States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIJm8Hp4Xe0). Doesn\u2019t it appear to you there was a willingness by the president and the people to support a resistance to those dictatorships long before America became directly involved in the war?",

To deliberately avoid explaining what you think and why?\n\nThe groups you include in Anglo-Saxon certainly don\u2019t sound small or specific, or easy to identify outside of one general marker: white skin.\n\nIs that the very obvious marker that you\u2019re choosing not to identify?\n\nIf I\u2019m misinterpreting that, please clarify which groups who don\u2019t have white skin fit your classification, and why they fit, but not others?\n\nYour remarks on WW2 contradict themselves. In the video we see FDR warning of an impending credible threat against the US. That threat resulted in a direct attack on US forces, which was the reason for joining the war. To warn of a threat and then react upon that threat being realised is not propaganda, it\u2019s an honest estimation, a clear warning, and a logical result. What alternative was there? To ignore Pearl Harbour and hope for the best?\n\nIs there a culture anywhere that was run by white people that didn\u2019t eventually become liberal, get overpowered by an opposing force, or collapse in on itself?\n\nIs it possible that white people just aren\u2019t very good at maintaining the sort of system you think should be in place?",

Teaching children who live in the state or notifying immigrants of their rights is no more criminal or negligent than reading someone their Miranda rights.  Moreover, the States are not funded by the federal government to perform federal law enforcement.

I never argued that anyone was required to Help deport people, and when I referred to those who were \"obstructing justice\", I explicitly was not referring to the people who are doing nothing. No, I was obviously referring to people like the governor of New Jersey who publicly admitted to harboring illegals in his home. I was referring to the various teachers on Tiktok who were vowing to arm themselves to fight off ICE if they came for their students. That IS obstruction of justice.\n\nThat being said, I figure that the people (you and I) are the best arbiters of what quantifies as \"saving the country\".  And we may disagree with each other. But at the end of the day, the validity of Napoleon's quote is heavily dependent on the context of the situation, the perspective/consensus of the people, and the intention of the quoter.\n\nPersonally, I don't care what party someone is aligned with. I don't wish to identify with or align with either party myself. For me, if the context or larger consensus is that there is a legitimate threat against the nation, and the actions the leader wishes to take are indeed necessary to curb that threat, then he is supposedly justified in his actions\u2013 whether he be Republican, Democrat, Communist, Nazi, Radical Centrist, whatever lol. Conversely, if there is no legitimate threat or if he is not truly acting with intention to save the country, then perhaps he would not be justified in his actions. But whether or not he is justified, and whether or not he is held accountable in the case that his actions are not justified, lies in the perspective of the people and what we choose to do about it (support him, or arrest him, or defend him, or revolt, etc.). So, if he were to \"break the law\" and we collectively chose to support him, then I think it'd be fair to say that that law was essentially nullified by our response, at least in the context in which it was broken. Alternatively, if the people go against him and decide to enforce the law after all, then he will have indeed broken the law due to the people not perceiving his actions as \"saving the country\".\n\nIn the current context, I do believe we are under threat and that we are in a dire situation, and I hope the President does whatever it takes to save our country. And I believe (or hope) enough of the country shares this sentiment that he will not face too much pushback in doing so.\n\nAnd in the case that we had a President whom I believed to be overstepping his authority in the name of a disingenuous claim of \"saving the country\", I'd just hope I wasn't the only one who saw through him and I'd hope there were enough of us to do something about it.",

And the process to remove those laws in through the judiciary or legislation?  You can refuse to follow a law or engage in activities that are contrary to it, but you're breaking the law at that point.\n\nIn the case of Trump, he may refuse to enforce laws, or may break laws.  That's his prerogative, and he exposes himself to impeachment and other checks.  But this quote suggests that he's not actually breaking a law as long as he doesn't agree with it.  Does that rationale apply to anyone else in the country?",
