    "selftext": "I'm trying to understand something about our current social discourse. Many Trump supporters proudly embrace being \"colorblind,\" stating they don't see or judge based on race.\n\n While the Civil Rights movement didn't eliminate racism, it demonstrated society's capacity to evolve beyond racial discrimination.\n\nMany Black and Brown American scholars have written extensively about these complexities and nuances and their perspectives are particularly valuable on this topic, \nI however want to focus here on how we use these spacific terms in our discourse.\n\nThere remains a fundamental agreement across society that discrimination is wrong.\n\nWhile there may be justified cases where society withdraws civility from demonstrably dangerous individuals like convicted violent criminals or terrorists, there remains a broad consensus across political lines that unwarranted discrimination and prejudice are fundamentally wrong.\n\nThis concept of being \"colorblind\" gained prominence during that era and is often cited by conservatives.\n\n What interests me is why this principle doesn't extend further.\n\n If someone can learn to look past race and treat everyone equally, what makes gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or physical abilities fundamentally different? \n\nThe capacity for acceptance exists, so why are we becoming increasingly divided on these issues if being \"blind\" was fundamentally about avoiding prejudice?\n\nThis leads me to question our current debate over DEI and being \"woke.\" I've noticed we might be using these terms differently.\n\n When conservatives say \"colorblind,\" they typically mean treating everyone fairly without prejudice.\n\n When liberals say \"woke,\" they often mean being conscious of inequities to prevent discrimination.\n\nIt seems there's a disconnect: to some conservatives, being woke is perceived as abandoning blindness and embracing prejudice. \n\nTo liberals, being blind appears as willful ignorance of existing problems. \n\nAre we perhaps arguing for the same ultimate goal(ending discrimination) but years of discourse have trained us to seek disagreement rather than common ground? \n\nHave these terms lost their original meaning, instead becoming vessels for projected political alignment?\n\nIs there truly a distinct woke or colorblind culture, or are these concepts primarily products of internet discourse, amplified by polarizing algorithms?",

            "body": "A lot of your post relies on the most charitable and completely benign interpretation of the word 'woke' imaginable, then treating opposition to wokeness as if it means opposition to your particular definition. Surely you can see the problem here! People don't hear 'woke' and think \"care about inequality\" or whatever, they hear \"woke\" and instantly translate that into \"discrimination against Whites\", racial double standards, tearing down statues, policing language, etc. \"Woke\" isn't this abstract thing; it's tied to policies, values, and narratives that people find repulsive. \n\n> When conservatives say \"colorblind,\" they typically mean treating everyone fairly without prejudice.\n\n.\n\n> When liberals say \"woke,\" they often mean being conscious of inequities to prevent discrimination.\n\n> It seems there's a disconnect: to some conservatives, being woke is perceived as abandoning blindness and embracing prejudice.\n\nThere's not actually a disconnect between conservatives and liberals. The disconnect is between you and the people on your own side, as they say the exact things you are trying to downplay or deny. Conservatives are accurately describing what \"woke\" liberals believe. People like Ibram X Kendi don't leave much room to the imagination; they explicitly call for present discrimination as the remedy for past discrimination. (Note: MLK did too, so conservatives citing him are of course completely wrong). \n\nAgain, it doesn't matter how you try to clean up the liberal view here in order to make it rhetorically palatable to non-liberals. We aren't unaware of the things that liberal race activists want...we've lived through them. We are frankly past the point where you can just win the debate by redefining terms. You have to actually reckon with the policies that you support. Your entire post, thoughtful as it is (and I mean this as a sincere compliment, it is far more interesting than other threads posted lately!), is heavily centered on an abstract discussion about \"woke\" that legitimately does not matter.\n\nWith all that said: being colorblind as a principle is dumb. People should have views informed by evidence, preferences, tradition, interests, etc. I honestly think that treating colorblindness as the ideal is a problem because it's bad rhetoric and terrible policy. If you actually take 'colorblindness' as an ideal seriously, you are literally just a globalist and you must oppose nation states. It should be anathema to anyone that's actually right-wing (other than people who say it because it serves their interests without actually believing it).",

Sort of like saying that \"conservatism\" means fascism, because Franco was a conservative. Because I don't understand why I have to reckon with politics I don't actually support just because I agree with the original definition of the term \"woke\" which was coined for recognizing unequal treatment? Why do you decide what politics I support and are tacked onto the term \"woke\" after it was defined almost 50 years ago?",

Yeah, I've spoken to liberals on reddit who say we need class-based AA. They are powerless and irrelevant, and they vote for the aforementioned group without hesitation anyway. \n\nHere's my view: the people you are talking about are either irrelevant or they are just lying about their views and do in believe the exact things I'm attributing to them anyway, so I don't think I need to really worry about applying the \"woke\" label too broadly. In any case, I think I generally do use somewhat more precise language than that. I only used \"woke\" because that is the literal point of the thread.",

If you said \"everyone on the right wants to drastically cut the size of government, eliminate medicare, social security, medicaid, repeal the CRA, etc.\", I would say no, that's libertarians. In your case though, I'm not even describing some small part of your coalition, I'm describing the dominant faction. That's what I was alluding to earlier when I said AA was the \"unambiguous position of the democratic party and liberal intellectuals for my entire life\". If you don't have a name for the dominant faction, I genuinely think it is insane to act like I'm unreasonable for lumping you guys all together. You lump yourselves together!\n\n> But you\u2019re asking people who agree with the original term to reckon with completely different policies.

Kind of the point of the sub. I am aware that many of the far-left views on race are unpopular even on the left -- but the problem is they have institutional power and in 50 years, every liberal will believe them anyway. That's just how these things go.",

Your analogy about Nazi Republicans is about policies that they don't support, whereas what I'm saying about \"woke democrats\" is about things they support *and have implemented*.\n\nIn order to make a real analogy here, we'd have to have a system in which Republicans passed eugenics laws, removed Jewish people from institutions, did this for decades -- and then after that, I wondered why you'd call me a Nazi when I say those things are bad and don't support them (but keep voting for them anyway).

When was that *not* the case? I recommend reading a book like Caldwell's Age of Entitlement to get a feel for the other side. It makes much more sense why a concept that was divisive from the start remained that way as opposed to thinking that we were all in agreement and then got off track at some point. You weren't necessarily saying that, but it comes across that way. \n\n>  What specific policies or approaches do you think could address discrimination without creating new forms of it?\n\nI support freedom of association and don't consider 'discrimination' to be a problem that the government should concern itself with. Once you grant that idea, you're basically just saying \"there should be a powerful bureaucracy, inevitably controlled by leftists, that gets to impose its views on every business and institution in America\". Bad idea in principle, certainly bad in practice (see the aforementioned book).",

Ultimately, I don't agree that discrimination is immoral (it just means \"a non-consensual interaction didn't occur\") and beyond that, even if I did, I would still trust the market more than the government to actually sort it out. That is to say, I could understand being opposed to e.g. \"no blacks allowed\" hiring practices being widespread, but I find it crazy to sue firms just because they don't have the right demographics, or because they used IQ tests, etc. I consider the last several decades an experiment.

Studies have examined that these biases tip the scale backwards, despite folks' awareness, or \"wokeness\" to the injustice.  For example, many here say that when hiring, employers should just look at all the candidates equally and pick the best one (not one where race, sex, etc. plays a part in the decision). However, studies show that \"employers are less likely to call back job applicants with Black-sounding names when presented with identical resumes.\" Thus creating an inequity before the applicant evaluation process even beings.\n\n 1) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=4490163](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4490163), \n\n2) [https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561) .\n\n  \nIn a world where these implicit biases are real, and observed in easy to replicate studies (take identical resumes, change the names, assess how employers handle those resumes), how can we \"act in a non-racist way to oppose that from happening in the future\"?\n\n  \nIf anyone here is brave enough to look into a chilling mirror, you can find out what your implicit biases are by taking one of many very simple Implicit Bias tests (designed to ensure you react without thinking, so your \"gut\" is answering the question): [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html) \n\nYou can examine biases related to all kinds of things: sexuality, skin-tone, weight, religion, race, genders-career, weapons, age, disability, etc. - you might think you're not biased, but we all are.

I posted the papers themselves, which state the same things in less \"plain language\".  Happy to quote from there if it's more instructive.\n\nI didn't say racist, or anything else re: hiring, I was simply trying to point to our \"implicit biases\" (subconscious reasoning) that guides our \"reactions\" to things.  But, it doesn't seem like you're interested in engaging in a discussion about addressing the affect of implicit biases on people's decision making.\n\nI find the pivot from \"it's quite possible to be aware of past injustices, be opposed to those injustices, and still act in a non-racist way to oppose that from happening in the future\" to \"Life is unfair, and certain people will be treated differently based on immutable characteristics\" a bit of a 180.  The point is to create a more fair country, no?  One where everyone is given the same chance to succeed.\n\nI agree that scales should be balanced... but, after 200+ years of folks being prevented from participating in fair democracy, just because we've abolished slavery and we've had a black president, doesn't mean the scales have magically swung back to balance.  They're still very much tilted (and maybe slowly balancing) but tilted non-the less to those that have had 200+ years to amass wealth, property, and power.\n\nIf a bully is given permission to punch you in the face every day for a year, and then one day is told to stop (but he still wants to punch you) - and you still have a busted nose, and look like shit from being beat up, are you going to feel like that's \"fair\" and the the scales are balanced simply because he's no longer allowed to punch you?",

So I'm not going out there calling people a comrade just because I read it.\u00a0\n\n\nTankies are a real problem and I'm not blind to them and that area of extreme.\u00a0\n\n\nMarx's writings, like any theoretical work, should be approached with critical analysis.\u00a0\n\n\nJust as scientific theories require peer review to validate their findings and expose potential biases, relying solely on one person's perspective whether Marx's or anyone else's limits our understanding.\n\n\n\u00a0A comprehensive evaluation requires examining multiple viewpoints and critiques. These nuanced topics come to my mind when I see Marx mentioned but I realize, to conservatives of differing minds and ideologies of mine they see it differently and I do value different insights on topics.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't believe in absolutes, except that complex situations always have nuance. Refusing to examine these nuances leads to bias and prevents genuine understanding.\n\n\nWhich brings me to your use of the word, I notice you're using the term quite differently almost as a general descriptor rather than referring to the specific economic and social theories Marx proposed.\u00a0\n\n\nCould you help me understand your interpretation?\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0I'm curious about how you're connecting Marxism to discussions about identity and social characteristics, as this seems to be quite different from Marx's original economic theory about class struggle and means of production.\u00a0\n\n\nCould you elaborate on how you see these concepts relating?\n\n\nSimilar to how the term 'woke' has taken on different meanings in today's discourse, I've noticed the same happening with 'Marxism.'\u00a0\n\n\nThis observation actually inspired my post I'm trying to understand how we reached a point where our shared vocabulary has become so contested, with words carrying such different meanings for different people.",
