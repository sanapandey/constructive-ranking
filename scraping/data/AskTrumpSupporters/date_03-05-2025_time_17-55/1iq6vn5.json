Guess my Mexican card is still activated!\n\nAlso, the party is apparently for a six-year-old and it is Deadpool and Wolverine themed.  That seems a bit odd to me.

Still waiting on the back wage claim, but I understand those take time, and that it's hard to squeeze blood from a stone.\n\nMy wife is not having the best of days.  For one, her phone isn't charging correctly.  It's insured, but to get a replacement, she has to send it in, and she's in a position where she needs her phone for work.  Luckily, it is charging on my wireless charger, but that annoys her because she likes to scroll through her phone in bed at night.\n\nFor the other thing, she dropped the bottle of wine she was looking forward to for tonight and it broke.  I have offered to go out and get her another one, but she's being sulky.  We will see what happens.\n\nWent out and played Magic last night.  I had an absolute blast.  It was fun.  I'm hooked.  Going again next Friday.  Hopefully I'll get the last few cards to \"upgrade\" my deck by then.  One just came in today, so that's a good sign!\n\n**Question:**  I sincerely wish I married my wife earlier.  We will be hitting fifteen years of marriage this upcoming week, but we were together for three years beforehand.  She's the best thing that's ever happened to me and I am so happy she's mine.\n\n**Recipe:**  This is solely because of something that I found that made me bounce around and grin in a very disconcerting way (according to the wife).  The local grocery store had matsutakes!  So, this is a steak dish, with a side of seared matsutake mushrooms and some roasted potatoes.  Pretty simple, really.\n\n* Steak (I'm using two NY strips)\n* Butter\n* Matsutake mushrooms, sliced lengthwise, but pretty thick\n* Garlic\n* Thyme\n* Oregano\n* Rosemary\n* Small potatoes\n* Salt and pepper\n* Olive oil\n\nSo, I lied a little bit.  The potatoes are going into an air fryer.  It's just easier that way.  Cube them, drizzle them with a little bit of olive oil, season them up, and pop them in.\n\nMeanwhile, get a cast iron ripping hot and throw in a little bit of butter.  Season the steaks on both sides and then give them a good sear.  Add more butter plus the garlic and thyme and lower the heat.  Baste the steaks with the butter, then remove and let rest.\n\nThen toss in the mushrooms and give them a good sear in all that beefy fatty buttery herby deliciousness.\n\nPlate and serve.",
