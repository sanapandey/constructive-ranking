I think we had a really good meeting. I think he is a qood person, we started discussing trade. I think we should have trade between Russia and USA, two great countries. We had a great meeting yesterday. He is a terrific person.\"\n\nEdit: why the downvote?  This is straight forward no BS, not a troll response.  I really can just stop you know.  I can easily shut down and just give trolling answers like \"Who says Putin is bad?  You're mischaracterising him !\".\n\nfYI  the TS you guys make fun of are just trolling to get you mad.  There are fewer and fewer of us who still wants to repair the divide, but at this point I'm starting to understand why we are where we are now.",

We should have a neutral policy. We should work with them when it's in both our interests. You can't get rid of Russia, and you can't turn them into a liberal democracy.",

A policy in Russia's favor would include some kind of aid or support.\n\n>How much of the US would you sign away if we were invaded by China?\n\nNone. But if we can't defend it, it's not signing away. It's just a military loss.\n\n>We can all want peace and still acknowledge the way to get that is for Russia to retreat back to their borders\n\nWho's going to make them do that?",

But any other conclusion is naive or ignorant.\n\n>So if you\u2019re all about actions with neutrality, we are  currently looking at undoing our sanctions\n\nThat would bring us closer to neutrality.\n\n>Doesn\u2019t it seem like we\u2019re just giving Putin everything he wants right now?\n\nI don't know what all Putin wants except what he has expressed. He wants full control of the four oblasts Russia annexed, including areas they don't currently occupy, he wants a commitment that Ukraine won't join NATO, and he wants a new election in Ukraine. Except for NATO membership, none of that is within our power or authority to concede. We can't give Putin everything he wants because we don't control everything.",

It's fine for Americans to believe it, and I certainly think we can be the best, but it is bad diplomatic posture and just leads to stupidity. The first person to act like this was Woodrow Wilson and he was rightfully despised by other world leaders for it. The only reason why some countries put up with it was because they needed help rebuilding after WW2 and they weren't going to decline endless free money. \n\nWe are also really hypocritical historically about it. We will ignore the human rights and politically oppression of our \"allies\" while vilifying our \"enemies for it. \n\nRegardless of our values and how much other countries align with them, it's in America's long term interest to not have hostile diplomatic relations with Russia. Plus, Putin is old, he will die in a few years, let's not do things that will make Russian people despise us for decades. \n\nThe Wilsonist idea that America is supposed to act as some beacon of democracy on the world stage needs to die.

It is okay to humiliate Z on TV and call him a dictator although this is factually completely incorrect, while Putin is a great guy.  I do not expect Trump to insult Putin but just show a little backbone because only thing that Putin actually understands is real strength and actions that show strength (not fake flattery).   Right now it looks a lot like Trump is desperately trying to become friends with Putin and in his desperate attempt is trying to deliver whatever his hopefully-soon-best-friend would appreciate (e.g. criticizing Z, stopping aid to Ukraine despite strong opposition from European allies). Only to find out later that the best friend was always a mortal enemy and just playing with him, waiting for the right moment to stab him in the back. I am worried that once that happens,  US would not have allies to rely on anymore because the attempts to reconcile with Russia have pushed actual allies away from the US.",

I ain't one of those TS.\n\nI like (sarcasticly) how we claim the left is name calling when Trump did it first. Biden is such a weakling and a meek president but he is also talking shit?  No, you can't have it both way, fam.  Man up and tell it like it is cuz you just made TS look like hypocrites.\n\nI have no answers for you on that front.  I also want to know from my fellow TS too - why twist the facts?  Tell the truth and just let the chips fall where they fall.\n\nPeople like that shouldn't vote because they have no idea why they are voting.  \"I love how Trump make up names for people\" is the dumbest reason to vote for him.\n\nThen they steal talking points from people like me who DOES look into these topics.  How do I know it's stolen?  Because being happy to meet someone I can talk to at my level, the more we talked the more I learn they actually only have a surface level knowledge of the subject (Ukraine, Isreal, trans, the economy, tariffs, how Congress and SCOTUS works, how laws are actually passed and/or enforced, etc).\n\nAlso would like to say Fox and Newsmax are dumb, and make TS look dumb.  Podcasts are just the same dude bros but with a camera, mic, and advertisement money.  They really need to STFU.\n\nIt would be nice to have right wing news network that don't rely on anger bait.\n\nI'm still embarrassed about that whole green M&M thing.  I have NO idea why other TS here don't comment on that.  Too embarrassed to bring it up?  Well I'm not.

Syria, Iraq, Yemen, had nothing to do with the Soviet Union. I wouldn't blame the Soviets for Afghanistan, even though there is a lot of blame to go around, because Afghanistan was unstable and full of civil wars and coups before they even got involved. Personally I blame map drawing for this, you're not going to form a united country in an area with so many geographically specific religious and cultural groups which have very engrained beliefs and priorities. The Afghan identity is fabricated by Europeans with pencils and a map and not by the people. \n\nEastern pressure how? Many of these states, even prior to the Soviet Union, had a close relationship to Russia and were skeptical of western countries. This is true even religiously, as these countries are mostly eastern Orthodox while western Europe is Catholic/Protestant. I would point to the example of the lack of Schisms in the Eastern Orthodox Church as a strong example of Eastern hegemony. To further prove this, look at Poland, the country with a historically hostile relationship with Russia and eastern Europe, that is mostly Catholic, has been the most enthusiastic NATO and Western supporter. There is a reason why Zelenskyy has had to ban the eastern Orthodox Church in Ukraine in his attempt to forge a \"Russia free\" identity for Ukraine, ignoring the irony that at one point Kyiv was the capital of the Russian Empire. Can we at least agree that there are factors outside of just Russian influence that would make attempting to integrate Western values there difficult and slow? I ask because these issues are nuanced especially if you understand the history, and should not be boiled down to simple narratives such as \"Russia evil\".",

Just to name a few, use nerve gas to assasinate defectors on UK soil, crack down on his political opponents that lead to arrest, poisoning and ultimately the murder of Navalny, shooting down civilian airplanes (MH17), invading a country and torture and murder of prisoners of war. How much worse does it have to get before you would treat him like a villain?\n\n>The intent when Russia declared war was to decapitate the Ukranian leadership and install a friendly dictator.\n\nIs that not evil?",

That has a dictator, that Trump idolises, who routinely gets anyone he doesn't like thrown out of tall buildings? \n\nI'm sure you understand context - the UK is militarily no threat to the US but it does have nuclear weapons. As does France. Conventionally not a threat but could wipe a number of US cities off the map if it came to it.",

What is also obvious is that Trump seems like most of the time he governs conservatively which is the direct opposite of a dictator like Putin. So I think it's clear Trump is a stark difference in comparison to Putin and Trump knows this.\n\n\nIn my view, Trump probably realizes exactly what Putin is, a brutal dictator. But Trump has been trying to make a deal with Putin both with trade and the war. So he likely talks good things about Putin to flatter him and get closer to him in order to wield that influence to make a deal.",
