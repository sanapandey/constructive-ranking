Depending on your authenticity and context is how it will be perceived. Most people here look at how Trump and Musk have spoken along with their actual actions and treat it as hyperbole and obviously exaggerated. Others opposing seem to take everything at face value and often have pearl clutch reactions. I don\u2019t personally like it but I\u2019m not going to have the same reaction about it when I know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nI would add that I think Musk really believes this but doesn\u2019t have any intentions of following through with action. Is just furious about them as a whole with how much they\u2019ve lied about him, Trump, and everything else. These things could definitely lead to legal action but very doubtful if any of it would ever lead to actual prison time.",

X is a newish social media open to anyone, anywhere, to come on and post mostly whatever they want. If anything X would be more like a broadcasting company if we're drawing analogies to MSM but it's not purely apples and oranges. To not see a difference is disingenuous. \n\nSo I guess we have to draw the line in the public square and do what we can to have our government to me detached from trying to have control over major media.",

Because of this material constraint, it cannot, by definition, be a right but is relegated to being a \u201cprivilege\u201d (whether that is fair or not is a whole different story; I personally think it would be best if there were no WH press corps, if participation were virtual, and questions were randomly selected/upvoted by viewers before being presented to the WH). Therefore, the executive branch has the power/responsibility to select who does or doesn\u2019t get into that limited set of seats. If someone is basically knowingly trolling the WH and not willing to play by their rules (even in seemingly small ways) there is no guarantee that they\u2019ll play by the rules when it matters more or could have greater impact and so it\u2019s OK for the WH to use their (entirely subjective) discretion to exclude such bad faith actors. In fact, someone making more noise about having been excluded from a WH which they clearly despise (whether justified or not) is a pretty good signal that they would have abused this privilege in greater ways in the long term.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the White House has tried to limit press access by those press they deem less than favorable. Look at: https://www.rcfp.org/white-house-attempted-shut-out-fox-news-reporter/#:~:text=Despite%20the%20administration\u2019s%20pledge%20to,Feinberg%20on%20Thursday\n\nObama\u2019s White House tried to exclude Fox News from a press pool to question \u201cexecutive pay czar\u201d (who was very importantly in charge of \u201coverseeing\u201d executive pay of companies receiving post-2009 financial crisis federal bailout money; which I would argue should not have been given out at all, but I digress). The Obama White House\u2019s \u201creason\u201d for trying to exclude Fox from this was that it wasn\u2019t \u201ca news organization\u201d \u2014 yet the same could be said by opponents about MSNBC, for instance\u2026",

Even in such an unprecedented media-darling scenario as Obama\u2019s presidency, he felt the need to try to exclude Fox from things early on (and to try to engage in logical gymnastics to justify so, read some of his quotes on it where he tries to say Fox is \u201cdifferent\u201d because it\u2019s akin to \u201ctalk radio\u201d). Fact is, though, the level of disconnect between the journalistic community and the US executive branch is at an unprecedented level, and so the WH exercising its (fully allowed and legal) discretion in such a way is not at all surprising and certainly not a reason to fear for our democracy.",

However, I may be wrong but it does seem J6 protestors (and yes some of whom I admit were promoting violence and likely belong in jail) and other Trump apologists were only targeted (massive encouragement of seeking them out online and turning them in; investigative efforts) after and directly by Biden-appointed officials and other key Democrats.

Reddit would have no reason to not finish off discussion about an \"insurrectionist felon\" if that happened.\n\n> All of this information is available to us.\n\nThe West came scarily close to Great Firewall style censorship in the 3 years between 2020 and 2022. You couldn't tweet or even DM (!!!) the Hunter Biden article on any major social media platform. What was being said then? Oh, these are private companies they can do whatever they want. \n\nEven for those under the age of 25 (I'm somewhere quite close) who went through the COVID propaganda, only a few realize the extent.   \n\nAll of the discussion around what is freedom of speech or not is arbitrary, even if an AI decides in \"non-partisan\" manner due to biases and data poisoning in training. But most of us (perhaps not on Reddit; certainly on X and in the law) draw the line at kids.  \n\nWhich is why we ultimately need great people to uphold the system and I don't think there has been a single perfect human, including Trump & Musk, but the duo are quite close to my ideal ruling class, and I will prefer pushing for transparency and openness instead of privacy. I do not believe that CBS releasing the unedited footage and paying a fine infringes upon their freedom of speech, especially due to election time rules that prevent a monopoly...these laws are designed to prevent domestic propaganda and aristocracy.\n\nI also think social media companies rely too much on Section 230 to do whatever they want (prime example: Reddit) with this site being a far left forum masquerading as a public square type site.  \n\nWe gave power to private companies to operate public town halls instead of government owned crap. There needs to be accountability for the big companies. Now I could buy CBS shares and ask for accountability but thanks to ETFs and institutions in Wall Street, retail shareholders have almost no say in the company - shares are useless.\n\nThe Soviet Union fell; The British Empire shrank - you're betting too much on people being on autopilot and relying on 1A/2A to be weakly defended, 250 years isn't enough to say if 1A/2A will be enough to keep America afloat.  \n\nI would also be outraged if Elon messed with the Democrat X accounts during the election. I think he did OK with just removing checkmarks from coordinated trolls who were posting grotesque poop images in response to the Indian H1B debate/MAGA civil war in December. \"Too far\" or \"Not enough\" is arbitrary and I trust in the people to uphold the judgement.\n\nI like freedom and meritocracy; but they eventually lead to monopolies - that need to be broken up to preserve both. The tree of free market economies must be renewed from time to time with the ashes of a monopoly being broken up. Self preservation takes priority over 1A, but 1A ranks pretty high too.",

You can always log out and run to Truth Social.\n\nSo are bakeries; yet they cannot refuse customers on the basis of their skin color or sex and tell people to go to the bakery on the other side of the street.  \n\nFree market capitalism does not override antitrust laws or other common sense laws like RICO or Civil Rights Act. My argument is precisely the fact that Big Tech abused Section 230 to influence an election and curtail 1A rights of many people. I am proposing similar \"rights\" for the internet, not arguing about current laws.   \n\nPeople did in fact build alternative tech to help move away from the likes of Twitter and Reddit in 2020/2021. The two registrars and hosting providers, Epik and Tucows, were attacked by the various institutions down to the DNS level.\n\nThey and their infrastructure (private property) were criminally attacked but received no support from law enforcement (while Hollywood gets to force DRM on every device and pursue pirates internationally with the support of the FBI and Interpol)\n\nThe internet as it is known today (IP, DNS) was funded and maintained by the Department of Commerce and Department of Defense and various government contracts and recently NTIA. So I do believe that the government itself attacked private people's 1A rights when these hosts were taken down using infrastructure and institutions that were funded and led by the government until Obama handed it over to shadow figures.     \n\nWhile Reddit itself is private property, I believe it is a violation of 1A rights when such alt-tech infrastructure is attacked using various institutions. Tucows (current registrar for Truth Social) was blacklisted by USTR, for example.  \n\n\n\nRegardless, I'm really not too worried about Big Tech anymore, all of them are on Trump's side.\n\nQuite an ironic comment coming from the side that wants Medicare for all and leaves X. What will you do when Elon Musk bids on Reddit and Trump's FTC rubber stamps the hostile takeover? Hopefully you'll cry about it on BlueSky instead of posting violent threats against Musk, right?  \n\nWhat will you do when BlueSky is forced offline because of its affinity for far left pedos?  \n\nThere's a reason why Cloudflare still hosts and protects controversial sites despite getting so much flak for it - they know that if they become too political - the Obama era handover of the stewardship of critical internet infrastructure to private companies will be under intense scrutiny.  \n\n> NetChoice decision means curating, compiling, and moderating a feed is a First Amendment-protected activity.\n\nI agree, and TV channels/Radio shows also have the power to curate their programming. Yet [the FCC rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule) dictate that election candidates must get equal time on radio and TV. The optic fibers and radio waves carrying internet data pass through the same land and air as radio and TV signals, no? \n\nI just think that the reasoning behind the Equal-time rule would apply to certain social media sites that function like public spaces (Currently, that would be X, Reddit, Facebook and Instagram).  \n\nThe internet as we know it exists today in the current form and not anything like what North Korea or China have is because of the general respect for freedom of speech. \n\nBut don't cry when DOGE, Trump and Musk figure out that they need the VeriSign contract + IANA + ARIN to take over the internet and shut down far-left terrorism sites like RiseUp dot net and other Antifa crap. The internet infrastructure is mostly PPP and not as private as you think. There's nothing in the constitution preventing the government from putting these \"private\" internet infrastructure organizations until Congressional oversight.",

It's also why a company like Cloudflare treads cautiously when they actively continue hosting sites like \"PDW\" and 4chan because they can easily be served an antitrust lawsuit - which tech companies are not immune to.   \n\nAlso, these are international platforms and are not limited to the jurisdiction of the US. If Trump takes a page out of the globalist manual and tells a \"freedom alliance\" of Meloni, Modi, Milei, Orban, etc. via a private email server to force these platforms to prevent censorship in their algorithms - then these companies will be faced with the choice of developing a significantly different algorithm and experience for different countries. Even with pro-censorship leftist countries, as you saw with Vance's speech at Munich, America holds a significant amount of power due to its unique position as the security provider and global reserve currency printer.  Vance is also [invested in Rumble](https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-j-d-vance-invest-in-rumble-video-platform-popular-on-political-right-11621447661), the most popular of these free speech alt tech platforms, so there is a significant threat to the status quo of Big Tech.\n\nRegardless, my reply was mainly concerned with the state of censorship that goes beyond these Meta, Reddit, Twitter or Section 230 and mainly is concerned with antitrust laws and the sanctity of the internet infrastructure that is controlled by VeriSign, IANA and ARIN along with many other private companies that use significant amounts of public infrastructure as well as large infrastructure companies like AWS, all of which have some contracts and understanding agreements signed with the government when they were given stewardship without Congressional oversight, over the infrastructure that was built and funded by the DoD, NTIA and NSF. \n\nAnd the law enforcement agencies that discriminate against these \"alt tech\" platforms when investigating coordinated cyberattacks and other attacks on their business - that harm their business and private property - affects the alt tech's companies' rights. \n\nI am hoping that Musk [wins his lawsuit](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/01/nx-s1-5283271/elon-musk-lawsuit-advertisers-boycott-new) which would have much more influence over internet censorship than any Section 230 lawsuit could, due to the financial power of cancel culture that caused the entire censorship slope. Conservatives did not have the resources to fight antitrust lawsuits, as in the case of [Gab](https://slate.com/technology/2017/09/gab-is-suing-google-over-antitrust-and-it-has-a-point.html) or [Parler](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310873/parler-amazon-aws-lawsuit-antitrust-hosting-free-speech) but given what has happened in the EU to Big Tech, it's likely going to influence the Supreme Court and the general public against Big Tech abusing antitrust.

Other countries were getting [their own](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koo_(social_network)) alt tech movements started until Musk bought Twitter.  \n\nI am personally not worried about these platforms so much anymore because Rumble, Gab and other alt tech companies fought back and established alt tech infrastructure while X and Meta self-regulated. Idiots like Warren did threaten their business by harming crypto with lawfare from the SEC but that got sharply reversed with Trump.  \n\nThe biggest loser here is $TRUMP/Truth Social which lost a significant amount of relevance due to Musk buying Twitter and undoing the very reason Truth Social was created. But it's a meme stock now so maybe it will survive like GME did.  \n\nBy the way, you have some serious issues if you are using Pushshift to alert you any time \"Section 230\" is mentioned on Reddit because your comment history certainly looks like it.

It's a private company, get over it (and Section 230 is basically the Constitution bro get over it).\n\nI mean, firstly, they're public companies and I'm not quite sure that BlackRock's Larry Fink and others voting on behalf of all the shares owned by ETFs and retirement funds would represent the decision of all the shareholders - but some actions have to be done in self preservation before China buys up some shares and completely fucks America over. The way American share ownership is set up, it effectively hands over control of public companies and shareholder votes to a few people in power. The owners of these companies' shares are being suppressed of their voting rights.  \n\nTikTok was not banned because of any reason other than them deciding to go along with Free Palestine. Once the Ds got in power, they realized that Xi is not out to help them but to divide the country so antisemitism is back on the menu. I'm not quite fond of the ADL but the rise in antisemitism after October 7 causing the Dems to support a TikTok ban is the most ironic thing to happen.\n\nI don't think people should be allowed to drown out protests with deafeningly loud loudspeakers in a public square. The internet infrastructure is effectively public square - as I mentioned in my other replies to another person in the same parent thread - a lot of internet infrastructure was in fact publicly owned and managed by governments until Obama gave it away to shadowy organizations. Registrars deciding to block you or the RIR refusing to allocate an IP address for your data center would be \"private\" organizations effectively censoring people like China's great firewall. Even though those systems and infrastructure are built on DARPA/NSF/NTIA money.  \n\n> You must be new here.\n\nNo I'm well aware, I have lost 75% of my karma that I got from occasionally commenting on normie subs since October 2024. I probably have 10-20 or so comments left on this site in general.  \n\nMy point is that it would not require too much to happen for your commenting rights on here to be taken away. You're on really thin ice.",

CBS fact checked a SOTU address in i wanna say 2018? Not sure.... one of the fact checks was a Trump claim that something like 1 in every 5 women crossing the border in migrant caravans was r*ped during the crossing. CBS boldly proclaimed that actually, it was only 1 in 3 -- evidently not realizing that this was in fact worse, and made Trump\u2019s argument stronger. Eventually, of course, they realized the error and corrected it -- not by changing the language to say \"fact check true, if anything it's more than that!\" but by deleting the fact check altogether.  Nothing which favors Trump or his policies can be allowed to exist. They play the hardest hardball they can manage on Trump, and their idea of questioning Biden is \"What flavor ice cream do you like?\" Add in deceptive editing, zero coverage on Biden's decline, live, hostile interrogation in one interview and gentle, off-the-air nudging in the other, and now an anchor who will argue (on air!) that the problem with Nazis was they had too much free speech? They're a garbage rag. CBS is producing propaganda. \n\n>How do you think this editing process is any different from any other news channel, say your preferred news channel, and in what way? \n\nI hope it's different,  but then again, y'know.... find me someone who isn't doing it. Fox? MSNBC? CNN? CBS is the one we're talking about, but there isn't a name in legacy media I trust. \n\n>If Trump is making this issue such a big deal that he is suggesting prison sentences for its staff, wouldn\u2019t it only be fair he have unedited footage of his interviews released?

Whatever the case may be. I've only seen the one clip of the Trump raw interview footage, that's hardly enough to lock anybody up, but whoever thinks it'll help their case, presumably, would present it, assuming any kind of hearings or discovery ever happened.",
