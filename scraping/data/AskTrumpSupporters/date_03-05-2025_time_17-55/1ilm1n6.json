    "selftext": "Vance posted on [X](https://x.com/JDVance/status/1888607143030391287) the following: \"If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.\"\n\nDo you think this is a violation of the separation of powers that puts the executive above all? Do you think this will lead to a constitutional crisis? What are your thoughts?",

He didn't say \"If the executive does something unconstitutional\". He explicitly said \"the executive's legitimate power\". If the executive did something they weren't allowed to do, it wouldn't be their legitimate power, and the judicial would have the right to intervene.",

There\u2019s no way you didn\u2019t know that this still ISNT A REAL DEPARTMENT. Only an act of congress and make a new department, and that has no happened. How does this not concern you?\n\nA judge can stop an action if they feel like it breaks the law, that\u2019s how they do the \u201cinterpretation\u201d. This is constitutional and NORMAL. All they did is stop it until a court and decide exactly if it\u2019s allowed or not, and this is what you should want to happen to stop a branch of government from getting too powerful. If a higher court says it\u2019s okay, then it\u2019ll move forward.

This is how they check the power the executive branch. If they were unable to stop a motion by the president, how do you think they can make sure the president is not doing anything illegal?\n\nI understand it\u2019s your opinion, and I\u2019m not trying to be rude either, but it\u2019s just not correct. The courts have ALWAYS had this power. I mean the Supreme Court blocked bidens bid to cancel student loans multiple times, and while \u201cmy side\u201d was upset, we weren\u2019t saying it was illegal for the courts to do that.\n\nIt\u2019s checks and balances. Trump is letting a non-senate approved unelected official of a department that has not been approved to exist access sensitive information of the American people.

It is like if a random marshal or FBI sargeant blocked a member of the Supreme Court from accepting legal cases or law records. It seems a blatant violation of duties & high likelihood the motivation is a defense of corruption to allow the scrubbing of files.\n\nIn the case of the spending freeze, that is arguable, though I lean heavily on it being legitimate order of the president I could see a potential argument.

We all know their is massive waste in the government and investigating it is clearly needed. But instead of carrying this out along legal channels Trump seems hell-bent on granting Musk access so he can shut down programs he doesn't like and steal our personal data.\u00a0\n\n\nLike why is Musk moving all our data to a private server? In the past Republicans had a huge problem with private servers for just emails but now that it's a billionaire and our sensitive information suddenly everyone is fine with it?",

If that were the case, why would whoever you suppose controlled the outcome to Biden\u2019s advantage (without any evidence to prove it occurred), chose not continue to control the outcome of elections?\n\nHave you read the [report about trump knowingly lying about the 2020 election](https://www.justice.gov/storage/Report-of-Special-Counsel-Smith-Volume-1-January-2025.pdf)",

One thing I admire on either side is consistency - not changing one\u2019s opinion because one politician or political team took a stance. So my broader clarifying question would be, it feels like Trump sews doubt in our institutions that had public trust not long ago. Or at least had indifference. In just the last days it\u2019s been\u2026gotta get rid of (like demolish or defund completely and immediately), the consumer protection bureau, US AID, the free tax filing system, FEMA etc., before he goes for the next agency/institution - which do YOU think are problematic/deletable and which do you think are important? And if Trump/MAGA say otherwise tomorrow, will that change your mind? (Like I predict he will randomly go after the NTSB or FDIC and then lots of MAGA will suddenly be convinced that agency has to be deleted and defunded immediately - when nobody was really anti, angry at or distrustful of that agency ever before.) Do you see this pattern? Genuinely curious. And would you mind sharing what you see as important to remain intact in our national government?",

That\u2019s the whole point here - we do not have people with complete, unchecked power in America (or at least, we shouldn\u2019t). \n\nAlso, did you know that this is a preliminary injunction meant simply to pause action until the court is able to review the case? Vance here is suggesting that the courts have no authority to act as a check on other branches of government which is on-its-face ridiculous in America, but also, getting so heated over a standard administrative step like this makes it pretty clear that it\u2019s not about the ruling. He\u2019s just trying to rile you all up to be mad about another judge. \n\nIs that breakdown helpful?\n\nEdit: to anyone reading, you know and I know that the response below doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why on earth would the fact that the treasury secretary is a senate-appointed position or the fact that he was acting on an EO from the President mean that the judiciary can\u2019t also weigh in on the legality here? It makes no sense. TS know this, but obviously they and Trump are more interested in someone with the power of a king, not of a president. I\u2019m not going to waste my time arguing about this obviously very odd claim that the judiciary has no business looking into the actions of the president and his appointees (even if you don\u2019t think anyone is doing anything wrong here, what if the EO was even more blatantly illegal or the senate even less interested in protecting their own sphere of influence?)",

How do I know what you mean when you said 2+2 =4?\n\nSo there\u2019s no way to cite any law ever, so even when SC deem affirmative action as illegal, college can still implement affirmative actions, because they can have different interpretations? Why should anyone follow the law ever?\n\nCus in this conversation I\u2019m explicitly saying there is a law on the book that literally says president can\u2019t do X and there is a court case even before that law that said the same exact thing.  \n\nyou\u2019re saying both the law, and court case are up to interpretation then why should President follow any law ever?\n\nEven before that I\u2019m asking very basic fundamental question about the difference between executive order and bill passed by congress and that answer would literally answer the question in its simplest form. \n\nAlso noticed how you went post modernist on me when it comes to this court case but when it comes to Roe you think it\u2019s a nice invention, suggesting that you think there\u2019s a correct way to read the law and the court over reach with Roe.

No not everyone flip flop. People flip flop when they don\u2019t have a moral axiom. But if you know what your based belief should be, you don\u2019t flip flop on your logic. Your belief can change based on new information but your internal consistency and logic shouldn\u2019t change. This is just wrong.\n\n2. That is explicitly what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m saying Trump is violating the law when he\u2019s impounding funds that are written into law, and you said that\u2019s my interpretation. But you refused to say why my interpretation is wrong you just say they\u2019re subjective. So I\u2019m saying I\u2019m so everything is subjective then president shouldn\u2019t follow the law ever if this is the only response I\u2019m getting. \n\n3. You don\u2019t think understanding the difference between an executive order and a law is important in understanding how a law can be reversed and who have the power to reverse these laws? \n\nIt\u2019s weird because I feel like you\u2019re purposely not engaging in what seem to be straight forward civic questions because you either know the logical conclusion and you don\u2019t like it so you are avoiding it like the plague or you don\u2019t understand how US constitution works?",
