Genuinely curious, not trying to be smart. \n\nYes I do understand the Laken Riley act. The troubling language is the following: \n\n\u201cThis bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain certain non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who have been arrested for burglary, theft, larceny, or shoplifting.\u201d\n\nThis is a huge slippery slope. The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause provides that no state may deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. This act not only is unconstitutional, it is playing INCREDIBLY loose with how/when law enforcement confirms your legal status. \n\nIf someone is ACCUSED of a crime, and isn\u2019t able to immediately produce sone sort of ID, they can be detained without due process. This is a problem, wouldn\u2019t you agree? And even if you disagree, can you see that it is literally unconstitutional?",

Are you actually interested in reading wiretaps, transcripts, things that the Tates have admitted themselves, hearing what former friends have said, US court rulings to stop the Tates naming victims openly, among other things? Also, the Tates very evidently lie about a lot of things but we\u2019re supposed to believe them over Romanian court? I could talk about how poor prosecution rates are for sex offences and I could ask you how many rich and controversial people you know who are accused of them, but I\u2019m concerned you\u2019d rather sealion as opposed to having an honest talk.",
