For example, it is legal to bribe a valet to park your car at the UN Embassy in Egypt but it would be illegal to bribe an Egyptian politician at the UN. \nThe reason why bribery is outlawed in the USA is because it only encourages treatment for wealthy US nationals that wouldn\u2019t get that kind of treatment in the target country. The purpose of the FCPA is to even the playing field for US companies doing business overseas while discouraging foreign government or entities from influencing US policy. Repealing the FCPA will allow US companies to bribe any foreign official for any reason and it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to disclose the nature or details of the transaction at all. This will make Middle Eastern governments much much more powerful.",

The exception allows the prosecution of those who violate the spirit of the law, i.e. those actually bribing foreign officials instead of those trying to navigate through the red tape.\n\n>TS do not actually answer questions anymore. They\u2019ll address a small part of what\u2019s asked, indirectly.\n\nI understand your frustration but there is a flip side to that coin. I've been participating in this subreddit since 2016. I've found the best way to answer questions is to be as short and concise as possible. The more details I give the more NSs try to exploit those details to take the discussion down paths that stray way off topic in an effort to find some kind of gotcha. The result is a pointless back and forth that goes nowhere and achieves nothing and is a big waste of time.\n\n>Can you answer my questions from before please?\n\nWhen I answered the one question, in my mind it invalidated the other two since they were both based on a false assumption. So I did not answer the others. Actually, I just didn't understand your third question about foreign interference. Feel free to restate it.",

I'm not asking about if the impeachment was warranted - that's a rabbithole. But if a President was impeached for foreign interference, then the optics aren't favorable by pausing foreign corruption enforcement. What are your thoughts on this?",
