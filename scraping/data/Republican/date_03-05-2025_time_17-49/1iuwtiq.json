The scales were tipped in Trump's favor by people in the middle because of his campaign promises of resolving kitchen table issues that the previous administration exacerbated or created in the first place. \n\nInstead of working on those issues, he's been steadfast on renaming bodies of water, threatening trade wars with neighbors and allies, made outlandish claims about annexing territories that have nothing to do with the US, parroting Russian talking points about Ukraine, undoing woke shit (I'm ok with that) and the border issue (also ok with that.) I know it's only been a month, so I'll give the man time, but he priotized things that had no bearing on the cost of living or improving the lives of the working class that he swayed from the Dems, instead focusing on dumb shit. MAGA camp thinks they have Carte Blanche to do whatever they want, but if they keep up with the wack rhetoric and neglect the middle, they're going to lose in the midterms and/or the next presidential election.",
