Especially with the ever increasing rate of executive orders at a regime change.  Obama had a ton, then Trump, then Biden, then Trump again, and they seemed to compound with every change of hands.  I suspect the Democrats have another organization pushing them in a direction like the Project 2025 organization has since Bush, and seem to have more direct access with Trump 2.0.  We need to get the lobbies and PACs out of government.",
