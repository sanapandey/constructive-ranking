Come on - your employer has a valid reason to want to know what illnesses you have been vaccinated for.\n\nThis is a silly hill to die on for a health care-related job.",

What happens if it turns out that batch 385 of some vaccine contained a contaminant?  They need to be able to trace everyone who received that batch.",
