And in this sense, his amicable relationship with Putin and Un is phenomenal. Russia is a large nation with a large army and nuclear weapons, North Korea might have a bark worse than its bite, but they are still unified under him, albeit through intimidation, fear, and manipulation. \n\nEven if he is publicly stating that Ukraine started it, he\u2019s saving them. Russia has the means to absolutely wipe Ukraine off the face of the map, if they were so inclined. Through these negotiations, he is letting Russia talk a big game, but hopefully giving Ukraine the opportunity to still thrive. If it\u2019s to be believed, we have given the Ukraine plenty of financial and military support to feel safe and secure moving forward while they rebuild, hopefully stronger.",

He even has said Zelensky wasn't as hawkish on Russia as he should have and blames him for Ukraine not joining NATO.\n\nDid you, per chance, confuse Poroshenko with Yanukovych? That's the one who got overthrown in 2014 and now lives in Russia. Poroshenko replaced Yanukovych.",
