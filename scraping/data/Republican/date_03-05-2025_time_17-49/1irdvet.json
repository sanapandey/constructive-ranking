I'm heartily in favor of funding scientific research. This is limiting lab and equipment expenditures, a necessary part of that research. \n\nI'm not saying there aren't issues with the NIH that should be addressed. For one, there's loads of studies that we fund and the results arent made public. Publicly funded research should be required to be published. But this isn't addressing that. \n\nIf there's corruption, or conflict of interest issues, wouldn't requiring greater transpiracy of funds be the solution? And firing those that abuse it? Not this? \n\nIf its that we don't want to waste money on pointless studies, wouldn't a crack down and more clarified policy on what research can be funded be the solution?\n\nThe only other argument I've seen is that universities are cutting themselves a portion of this money. But do we know that, and if so, how? I've seen a couple of comments on YouTube videos from people allegedly in university administration positions saying the funds from the grants are razor thin and well accounted for. Not a very official source, I know -- where else can I look into that?\n\nDoes anyone have a good argument in favor of this?",

And firing those that abuse it? Not this?  \n\nThis exact argument can be made for a wide majority of the other cuts that are being made, but as you said:  \n\n>  I\u2019ve been on board with cuts and investigation the Trump administration has been doing.\n\nSo the question really is, what specifically about this makes it unique such that it should be exempt? Why is this individual program special?\n\nThere are two arguments in favour of these cuts:\n\n1. Accountability. Regarding inefficiencies, Administrators and politicians, and everyone involved in these programs have had years and years to work on this. And done nothing.   \nWhy is it only when the discussion to cut funding is presented do discussions of improving efficiencies and reducing waste are brought up? Why was there no accountability when funding was allocated. Why have these administrators allowed these budgets to be wasted on things that only now are being rethought?   \nThey have shown that they are not willing to be responsible and accountable to the fund allocated, and so they should be cut. Giving them more money in exchange for promises that **this time** it will be used properly doesn\u2019t fly with me.\n\n2. In deciding what should be funded and not, shouldn\u2019t that be decided by the market and the people? The government is not perfectly representative, especially when one considers the effect and influence of lobbyists, and special interest groups, and all manner of voices.  \nThey end up not being the voice of the people, whichever side you fall on, roughly a third of all people voted for one side or the other (or neither) and that\u2019s not representative.  \nThe market is the true authoritative source of what people want (people spend money on the things they want and need, no one is out here spending money on things they don\u2019t want)\n\nFunding will come through various channels that desire the research for goods and services that people will buy.\n\nIf people are so inclined and invested in a particular research, there are charities, and other organisations that people can donate and invest money into.\n\nThis way research is directed into things that people want. Not what the government decides what people want.",

If there is a research category that is not profitable, or well-marketed as a charity, like a preemptive treatment that would lower profits of responsive treatments, it could still help people a lot and they might still want it. That's why we elect people to represent us in government and decide what might be good to provide through government services that the market does not provide well for. The purpose of the revolution was not the taxation, but the lack of representation. Out representatives in Congress are supposed to cover this for us. \n\nCongress has mandated that the government should provide funds for certain points of research. If you want that to change, you have to do it through Congress.\n\nIs this research something Congress has tasked the executive with doing? That's not rhetorical. I don't really know and I don't have time to look it up right now. But that is an important question that is necessary to ask before we start saying that this research isn't efficient so the executive should cut it. Or that it isn't representative of the market or **the people**.",

That's supposed to be the value of experts in the Executive Branch, it removes the need for Congress to act as an expert on technical matters involving regulations, research, and other specialty knowledge areas. \n\nWhat we're uncovering is a massive amount of abuse of discretionary spending, and a need for more direct Congressional oversight.\n\nColleges and universities are far from politically isolated or underfunded. If this research is truly important, they can make a case to their congresscritters for direct appropriation of funds, or accept that government pork giveth, and government cost-cutters taketh away.",

                            "body": "I\u2019ve got 2 points of discussion, one theoretical, and one more practical.\n\n1. theoretical:\n\nIt brings out a good question where I can\u2019t quite place where Republicans, or indeed conservatism lands in general with regards to research.\n\nI see a lot of claims of small government and less taxes. The reality is that if research is funded by congress, that comes from taxes.\n\nWhy should a person pay for research (through taxes) that may not affect them or benefit them? Just as the argument against universal healthcare, the government should collect less tax, and I can use that money to invest or contribute directly to research that I personally want to endorse, not something that is chosen (by several of degrees of separation) by a majority I may not agree with?\n\nYour argument that it was not about taxation but representation, yes. But since the election uses the electoral college and not a proportional system, we may end up with still an imbalance in representation. The solution that is brought up frequently in conservatism is smaller government, less impact on people\u2019s lives, and allow people to make more direct individual decisions. Allow the collective to be decided by the free market, rather than through representatives, with whom there is a complicated and corruptible accountability to the voter. Again, the issue of lobbyists on politicians pushes us further towards taxation without representation. \n\nIf an elected politician is beholden to a lobbyist, and acts in accordance with that, rather than the will and mandate of those that elected them, that is the definition of taxation without representation.\n\n2. Practical. (I\u2019m not an expert in US political law, so I may be mistaken, please feel free to clarify)\n\nYour point about funds being designated by Congress is really the crux of the issue. Either this applies to everything, or nothing. Lots of the cuts that are being brought up are from Congressional appointment. My cursory reading is that, for example, USAID programs were authorised in the Foreign Assistance Act. OP said that they support the cuts in general.\n\nSo there lies the issue. If they support the cuts to congressional approved funds in some areas, why are research budgets different.\n\nPersonally, I completely agree with you, the change should absolutely come through congress and congressional oversight. They should be responsible for managing budgets, and holding to account, and basically doing what Trump, Musk, and DOGE are doing. They are the representatives of the people. \n\nBut that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. And cuts are seemingly being made to congressionally approved funds.\n\nIn my view, you either have to be for or against. You can\u2019t be for some cuts to side step congress because you agree, but then against others that you disagree with. \n\nIt also opens a very dangerous door. If this is allowed to go ahead, and the President is allowed to simply ignore congress and make cuts to whatever they like, how does that work when the situation is reversed? When a Democrat (or other) president may come into power. If the precedent is there, then what is there to stop them?\n\nHypothetically, if we allow the president to make cuts to congressionally approved funds, what if there was a very strong anti war president, who decided to cut military budgets? There is no argument that there is waste there, so even if you tried to constrain this power to only cases of fraud or abuse, it could still itself be abused.\n\nEither you follow the law or you don\u2019t.\n\nMany people are too caught up in \u201cwinning\u201d. Celebrating these cuts and inefficiencies (most of which is taken on the word of those involved, another reason this should be done by congress). Few people are considering the precedent and impact this could have in the future",
