I believe YOU decide what is important.\n\nBut there is one thing I think is crucially important that so many of us here (including myself at times) miss, and that is thinking about things more historically and more the way an artist might understand the flow of history. We need the nitty gritty, we need details, we need to look at the laws, the treaties, the minor incursions... we need to zoom into history with a microscope and view all those smaller (though serious and important) details.\n\nBut we also need to pull ourselves back and view history from a broader perspective. If you are a Christian who is familiar with Biblical history (and I encourage you all to be), one thing you will see is the ebb and flow of evil and good through time. When you see history this way, you can often see what is coming and be amazed as the details fill in towards that end. So very often this has brought the proper context to help me understand moments like the oval office meeting with Trump, Vance, and Zelenskyy.\n\nI think this particular episode of Andrew Klavan's show is so critically important because it contextualizes that event in a way that connects to history so easily, that you will understand the impact of it.\n\nHis argument (which I would go as far as to say is simply true) is that just like in WWII, we are in a world with a growing and serious existential threat. While Russia is undoubtedly bad, they have shown us historically that they are not the world domination type. Nor are we. We want to be sovereign to ourselves, and we are willing to compete, and we are willing to dominate markets and territories insofar as we need to to ensure we have the ability to be self sovereign in the face of threats like Russia and China. Russia is largely the same as us, they just do so in a messed up way as compared to us (obviously we are not perfect at this). China is not. China at this point in history wants domination of everything. They are self-sovereign, but they want more.\n\nRussia always strikes me as Cain-like and we are more like Abel, and they are more Esau-like to our Jacob. In the Esau and Jacob story, Jacob is righteous (though imperfect) but Esau is just this kind of angry kid who loses his birthright. For time, the descendants of Esau dominate the descendants of Jacob, but that reverses.\n\nRussia will not be a vassal to China or anyone else. Trump knows this; Putin knows this - that in the face of China, we will need each other. That does not make us friends, that does not make us respect each other. But when China moves, if the US is defeated, then Russia will be, too. If when China moves, if Russia is defeated, it may be that we are defeated, too.\n\nThere are other countries at play. I think India will play an important role. But right now, if you look at what is happening with this historical perspective and what happened in WWII, it seems Trump is trying to help cool the tensions between Russia and Ukraine because Ukraine either doesn't see or doesn't care about the threat that China is. China is a worse threat than Russia is to Ukraine and Zelenskyy doesn't seem to see that.\n\nSo to those who hate how Trump and Vance handled this meeting, please consider this. China is coming, they are poised. It is possible we can legislate and make moves that will keep them at bay, but right now they are preparing for war. Do you want to appease them like the UK did with Germany? Or do you want a leader who recognizes this threat and is trying to help everyone take some time to prepare but ending what amounts to a little spat compared to what we could see in a third world war?",

Trump is a flawed person (like all of us) but he is the only treating China like the threat it is. See you take the other historical approach, which is think that anyone you don't like is Hitler. The problem you run into with that, is that that perspective is... fucking stupid. Even among dictators, they do different things. You think there is a singular pattern towards tyranny and there isn't. There are patterns, yes. But good and bad leaders often do many similar things because leaders have similar jobs. Lincoln and Stalin both believed in the rule of law. Are they the same? Based on your logic they are. Based on reality they are very different.\n\nStop being pathetically obtuse and learn from history. Your historical knowledge is basically a meme.",

We have needed a strong alpha leader for decades now, but the brainwashing and indoctrination of the populace through the public school system, the higher ed system, Hollywood, and legacy media has produced citizens that were weak-kneed and unable to stomach grown-up decision making.\n\nWhile I am thrilled with the election of President Trump, I believe this is just a speed bump on our way to communism, Marxism, or socialism. Unless we completely change the public school system, and the higher ed system, we will lose the war on the road to serfdom.",
