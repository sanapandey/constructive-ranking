If everyone chose to not respond they can\u2019t just fire the entire federal work force.

They send that list to management and ask them to dismiss anyone on the list who doesn't have a valid reason for failing to respond, such as they were on official business visiting a tribe in Africa, undercover as part of a an operation to take down cartels, or whatever.

This is not what I voted for by wanting to re-elect Trump. Removing government waste doesn't mean firing federal employees at the lowest levels for simply showing up and doing their assigned jobs. The idea that a GS-9, GS-11, or GS-12 has any authority to do anything other than what we are told to do is laughable. If the President wants to remove career bureaucrats from government that are promoting fraud, waste and abuse, start by firing the GS-15s and GS-14s who are the policy makers and the leaders; not the worker bees who are given a task.",
