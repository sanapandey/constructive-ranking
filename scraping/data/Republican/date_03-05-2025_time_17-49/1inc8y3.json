    "selftext": "First of all, we are being inundated, just like every time Trump wins or is impeached, or is shot at, by trolls, by curious left leaning folks, and I assume by bots.\n\n**Do not engage them. Report them.** I have seen too many posts or comments upvoted that a republican wouldn't upvote, or at least they wouldn't if they knew what was happening with that comment.\n\nI just banned a user who came in saying something that SEEMS righteous, but was an underhanded trashing of the right. \"We shouldn't label or call the left names, that is leading to divide.\" It sounds kinda nice, civility is important. None of us want war or violence or anything of the sort. But to come in here and act as if we are the uncivil ones indicates to me that you are either\n\n* a lefty posing as a Republican to bullshit us and try to underhandedly sway us in a pathetic, passive aggressive way\n* a Romney-esque Republican who has appeased the left far too much over the years while criticizing his own party far too much as well\n* or a Republican who doesn't have any idea how bad the USAID stuff is because you are listening far too much to media that has largely been coopted by the Democrats.\n\nBy the way, we do expect our users to be civil, but we also give our users some latitude in our sub because this is our place to discuss politics with fellow republicans. I would not expect people in the democrat subs to refrain from referring to us in derogatory ways. But still, there are lines, and if our users cross them, we will ban them.\n\nFolks, we try really really hard not to draw lines and define what a Republican is. The party is a large umbrella. There are libertarian republicans, there are republicans who are very conservative socially, there are republicans who are gay. There are Republicans who believe in abolishing the Fed, and ones who just want to reform it. There are republicans who are Muslim, Asian, black, hispanic even trans. And I have to give a special 'thank all' to all those minorities for voting Trump. It is so hard to go against the stranglehold the Democrats have had on minority voters for so long, I can't imagine how it feels to vote Trump when your whole family and everyone around you is saying you're a traitor or something. But you had the courage of your convictions and that is amazing.\n\nThere is room in the Republican party for so much. We are a huge umbrella.\n\nThat said, we have to draw the line sometimes. There are obvious lines. Like if you are a Republican Socialist.... sorry, you are not a Republican. I don't even care if you're legally registered republican. Socialists do not fit under our umbrella. We will ban you for espousing those views here.\n\nIf you are for mutilation of minors and are technically a republican, we will ban you for espousing those views here.\n\nWe have a rule that says \"No leftist talking points\" and we have that not because we are scared of leftist views (I mean look at how hard leftist views are failing ALL OVER THE WORLD... they're bad ideas). We have that rule because Reddit is 90% left and we hear their views all the time. There views are inescapable. We couldn't live in a bubble on reddit if we tried. I was just blasted on a design sub because someone posted what they thought was a clever design and it was basically a \"Trump is Hitler\" sign and I said \"Can this sub of all subs be non-political? Is that possible?\" I wasn't banned but I was told that when fascists aren't endangering our rights, then maybe they wouldn't HAVE to get political. Such wieners.\n\nThis leads to another reason for that rule. We were largely forced out of the \"neutral\" spaces long ago. Subs like r/politics, r/news, r/worldnews. They are all run by leftists, and they are swarming with leftists who will down vote and berate anyone who comes in with even just a mildly conservative or pro-Republican idea (or in my case just a pro-neutrality comment). So we were largely forced out except for those \"Republicans\" who the hardcore leftists like because they say things that the lefties think are reasonable.\n\nIf you are a \"Republican\" who blames us for the bad rhetoric when for over 40 years we have been called Racists, Nazis, and bigots and for much of that time we took it in stride, then you are so deluded, you are not a Republican and we can't have you here because you are espousing leftist talking points.\n\nIf you are a \"Republican\" who blames us for the tension when we were being skipped over by FEMA for supporting Trump, then you are not a Republican and we can't have you here. You'll be banned for leftist talking points.\n\nIf you are a \"Republican\" who says \"Hey guys, let's chill and stop saying the Democrat party is corrupt as hell for using the FBI to target our candidates, for using the IRS to target conservatives, for pressuring their buddies in banking to not do business with conservatives, for using USAID to funnel money to the Democrats, for using the presidency to garner favor with China, for getting their buddies in big tech to censor us for challenging the Covid narrative (which we were literally right about on every count), for supporting and funding the BLM riots which destroyed so many small business and property\" then you are not a Republican and we can't have you here. Those are leftist talking points. And they are also absurd.\n\nWe consider people who blame us for the tension to be anti-Republican and spewing leftist talking points. But we do understand that some on our side do not help the situation. We will ban those who do so dangerously, but will we not ban people for using the typical names we call the lefties in our circles.\n\nWe don't expect users to lavish Republicans with praise, you can disagree with Republicans, you can call out Republicans for wrong doing, but do so with respect to your fellow republicans. And for Pete's sake, do not paint a false equivalency that the left and right are just as bad right now.\n\nI would ask our users again to help us by reporting those users and calling them out.\n\nMany of them will have comments that are upvoted because the lefties love swarming our sub, especially when they have so soundly been beaten.",

But do not mock or belittle people who are in support of Trump.\n\nParties shift their tactics and their goals and even their core ideologies, they do so because they are political entities (which is one of many reasons why Washington warned against them). Political parties are not the ideals that you and I believe in. They are a network of people with many different ideals who have come together to amalgamate and negotiate a platform that we can all vote for together. The Republican party does not align with my ideas perfectly, it never has and it never will. But it has always been the lesser of two evils, and often I have seen it as the one force for good. There are certainly good people in the Democrat party but I think that party is not a net good.\n\nThe Trump absolutists have a space here. They are Republicans. And I'm sorry to be harsh, but if you do't like that, you should leave. They must follow the rules as anyone else.\n\nI am not a fan of unions at all, when Trump invited them into the mix, I cringed. But here they are and I will respectfully disagree with them when I need to, but if they are willing to stand up to the the insidious corruption of the Democrats that has more and more been coming to light, then I'm all for that. The whole country needs to call out what has been done to conservatives. The whole country needs to call out FEMA passing over Trump supporters. I don't think our side is as angry about that as we should be, that is sooooooo fucked.\n\nFurther, I don't know any Trump absolutists. I know a lot of people who voted for change and then got scared when change came and immediately got nervous and kinda turned on Trump. And people like me said \"Wait, this is going to be good. Let it happen.\" Is that what you think a Trump absolutist is? Because I hear people talk like that and it sounds like they didn't really want change, they wanted to complain. Change often takes time and it's often scary. So if you want to define what you mean, go for it. But still, they are republicans and you need to respect them when you engage them here rather than belittle them like the left has. They stood up and if they didn't, we'd have Kamala. That deserves some respect.",

Im not trying to cause discontent, just trying to voice what some who join this subreddit might think when it comes to what it means to be \"republican\"",

For example, a card carrying Republican who is also a socialist. It is the policy of this sub that they are not a republican even while being registered as one.\n\nI laid out a few other examples.\n\nI also pointed out some suspicious behavior like acting like a Romney republican who doesn't really have nice things to say about Republicans while still claiming to be one. Will a person be banned for agreeing with Romney on things? No, but if I see nothing but criticisms of Republicans in all your history and one of your comments is flagged as anti-Republican, what am I supposed to do as a moderator? I don't have time to take you aside and say \"hey man, could you say some nice things about us?\" We are not insecure assholes who need our asses kissed. I'm strictly talking about data and being able to determine if a user is a person here to just criticize us in bad faith or if they are a genuine republican with some concerns about a couple of Trump's policies or Dan Crenshaw's sudden wealth. \n\nDoes that make sense? From a moderator's perspective, we get a lot of comments reported, many of which are Republican comments made by republicans that sound pretty anti-Republican. If in reading your comment it sounds like you are just trashing the party or a particular republican and I have no indication that you are just really poorly articulating a problem you have with the party or that person, then I'll ban you.\n\nPeople are incredibly bad at stating a criticism these days without using language that TRASHES them. It isn't hard, but so many people seem incapable of it or they're just unwilling. If a user can't find a respectful way to disagree with another republican, then they end up sounding like the majority of reddit who treats us like shit. \n\nI can't understand how so many of our users who claim despise how the left acts and how horrible their rhetoric is then turn around and use rhetoric that is just as awful on their fellow Republicans.\n\nWe will not tolerate that.",

Some of our mods have been banned for long periods of time, mostly for just speaking rationally about trans issues.\n\nYou just see the surface and then call it hypocritical without having any idea what we see. And I get that, because you don't see what we see unless we take time to show you.\n\nBut again, I think you comment is unfair. Yeah, there's vitriol thrown around everywhere, but what is thrown at Trump is clearly worse than what Graham or McConnel receive, and again, I have personally banned people who just unreasonably trashed those people. Further there are far fewer lies about them to contend with. So if someone spews a lie about a politician, I'm going to ban it or call it out, there are so many lies about Trump that are mixed in with so many comments. There aren't a lot of lies about Graham and McConnel.\n\nSo to imply the rule is being unequally applied or to go even further and say there's hypocrisy is the kind of unfair criticism that we really don't appreciate.

They pushed us out of the open forums, and then they swarmed here. So now we don't allow leftist views so we can have a place where it's just us Republicans talking. I can't emphasize this enough, we hear you literally all over the internet, we can't escape you. The hyenas you tried to escape, they came after us worse than you. Do you get that?\n\n>If I say I support an honorable veteran\u2019s right to receive gender-affirming care because they served this country with honor, will I get banned?\n\nIf you're saying tax dollars should support it, yes. If you're just saying a veteran has a right to mutilate their body, no. \n\nYou are equating us to the left. Do not do that. We want you to be able to say whatever crazy stuff you want. I even believe racist thought should be protected speech, because it should be answered by good speech. BUT this is our sub, and we do not want to hear leftist garbage here. Jeffersonian Liberal thought? Great, we have Jeffersonian Liberals under our umbrella. They are not leftists who are socialists, communists, open border, terrorist sympathizers. \n\nThe left in general, but primarily the leftists (if you don't know the difference that is part of the reason for these rules) didn't just ban us from their subs. They banned us from neutral subs. They banned us from Twitter and YouTube and they said if we don't like it we should start our own, so we did and what did the left do? They blocked the app from all the market places. Do you understand the difference between wanting a sub for just Republicans and preventing your political opponents from creating a competing social media site? You are free to question and criticize and espouse whatever views you want all over reddit. It is simply that here you can't. Do you see the difference between that and the left trying to shut down rumble, trying to remove our ability to compete with alternatives to Twitter (which was controlled by the left at the time)? Do you remember how there was a free speech alternative to Twitter before Elon bought Twittee and the left pressured Apple and Samsung both to keep it off their app stores? Do you remember that?? Because that is anti free speech, that is the hyena like behavior you're talking about. We just want to be able to talk among ourselves a bit. This sub does not exist for you, it is for us and there is nothing wrong with that. We hear your views everywhere, we will engage with you all over the town square, except here. \n\nWe get so many people like you comparing us to the left for simply wanting to be able to talk among ourselves. We created a sub for that purpose, your side took over the neutral subs and shoved us out. Do you see the difference? If you don't then I can't convince you, but that is what happened. I don't think you realize how bad it was.\n\nThis is a sub for Republicans. We respect thought that is not under the republican umbrella but is still reasonable... leftist thoughts like the ones I mentioned are not reasonable. But as someone who left the left, are you aligned with the right? This is a right leaning sub, and this is made for us not for you if you are not Republican. Find a sub that serves you.\n\nWe have wanted to try and let this be more open, but then we are inundated and the left swarms our sub... the hyenas come. And well meaning folks come too. We'd love it if it were just the well meaning liberals who come, but the hyenas ruined for you here too. The hyena behavior you are talking about, the behavior you are trying to escape attacked us too. So we had to batten down the hatches and make this a place just for us, because if we let the well meaning folks in, the hyenas will follow, and it's not always clear who is a hyena who sounds kinda nice at first and who is a genuinely well meaning person.\n\nThat is the point. If you wanted this to be an open space for you, the hyenas you were trying to escape ruined that for you. Not us.\n\nEdit: mobile typos and clarity.",

What people like you discount is that the south splitting off was suicide for themselves and a death sentence for the north.\n\nAnd one of his biggest criticisms was declaring martial law when people were avoiding the draft. We later ruled that you can't get in the way of legal military proceedings such as a draft in Schenk vs. The US. That is what Lincoln was responding to, and again, if the country divided, both the Union and Confederacy would have almost certainly fallen.\n\nSo fine, disagree with his tactics, it's okay to bring up those historical facts, but to call him a tyrant? That's way too far an accusation and shows little respect for our party. That is what we mean by Reagan's 11th. If you can argue someone is a true tyrant, that would also be acceptable, but to call someone a tyrant because he did things that literally saved the north and south (whether the south realized it or not) is just not cool.",

The European powers may have wanted to intervene on the side of the Confederates for the supply of cotton and thus it seems unlikely they would have taken over the Northern half of the country. \n\nI'm not arguing against legal military procedures. I think the government should have asked the newspapers to not print military tactics. What I find that Lincoln gets almost no push back for is the blantat abuse of the 1st Amendment when he ordered his postmaster General to cut the circulation of newspapers that criticized his administration or war efforts. Several Northern papers published peace articles suggesting the South had every legal mean to secede from the Union.\n\nDisunion or Secession, before 1869, was an implied right left to the States and several Americans and foreign visitors observed that Secession was legal and if the country could not agree, then the political binds that unite should be broken in order to try again. \n\nFurthermore, Woodrow Wilson and John Adams signed modified Alien And Sedition acts. Can we call these two men tyrants? One isn't a Republican, but one of the worst progressive leaders in America. Is it okay to call Wilson a tyrant then? \n\nFinally I'll determine which individuals I show respect too regardless of their political party. I'd much rather support Presidents like Calvin Coolidge and Eisenhower. I have little time for men who decide what rights I can and can't exercise, such as Wilson and Lincoln. If I so deem it that I want to register a complaint or grievence with the government, and provided I'm not calling for violence, I have every right to speak and the government can't do a damn thing to silence me.",
