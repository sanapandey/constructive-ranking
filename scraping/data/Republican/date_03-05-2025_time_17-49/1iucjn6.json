But the proportions are just not the same. \n\nWe would shut that shit down in a conservative sub. \n\nAnd then look at the riots when Trump was first elected. Now I'll grant that there were provocateurs in the midst, likely some feds, and then you had Antifa mixing in with the crowds. Antifa is very left, and most of the participants in those riots across the country were on the left. Both sides have crazies, yes. But if we took all the crazies on the right and made them fight all the crazies on the left, the right would get destroyed because there are just sooooo many more crazies on the left.\n\nThose riots were all over the country. Even if you count J6, the left's riots were all over the country and lasted days, and then they did it again with Floyd. J6 involved a large number of feds AND Pelosi has admitted that she botched the security. She admitted that Trump offered something like 10,000 troops and she blocked it. \n\nSo again, I agree with you in part, but we are quite tired of the \"both sides\" thing.",
