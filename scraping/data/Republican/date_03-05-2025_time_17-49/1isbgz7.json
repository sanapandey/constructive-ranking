And 76 years after FDR, we were subjected to the attack on our Constitution by Barack Obama and his \u201cpen and a phone.\u201d Another 12 years, and  we were subjected to the greatest attack on our Constitution of all with the election of Joe Biden. Every attack on our Constitution has come from Democrats, who will do anything and risk everything to impose their world view on the rest of us.",
