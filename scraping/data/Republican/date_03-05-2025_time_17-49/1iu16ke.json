He comes in multiple times a week for dialysis, in addition to other frequent illnesses.  No insurance.  No papers.  All on the taxpayer dime.\n\nYes he is sick, but he is sick because he didn't take care of his own body.  At least people like that should be taken back to their own country to receive treatments there.",
