It seems there is a lot of horn tootin' going on about all the great work DOGE is doing to expose government waste. However, no one has reported/shared/explained how this is going to help Americans. Does anyone know? \n\nGroceries and inflation is still up and nothing appears to be happening to curb it.  I know it is all Bidens fault, I got it.  Libtards bad!  But Biden isnt President anymore Trump is and he told Americans he was going to fix it right away. So far all I see are problems being exposed with zero effort put forth to fix them.  \n\nHow does this help Americans? How does this Make America Great Again?",

But I have noticed a few things that reassure me he's not as dangerous as the media makes him out to be:\n\n1) If anything he is doing was certain to cripple the economy, then the stock market would've tanked already. Investors are on top of that shit.\n\n2) The smear campaign against Trump is absurd. When a Democrat trims the budget, they're laying off employees; when Trump does it he's firing them. Also, why is everyone complaining that Elon wasn't elected? When has a cabinet member ever been elected?\n\n3) Everything with Trump is about negotiations. Everything he says and does is about getting something he wants or something he thinks will be good for the nation. So people need to stop panicking every time he opens his mouth.\n\nGo ahead and tell me where I'm wrong. I'm always keen to learn something new. But from where I'm sitting, TDS seems to be at an all-time high.",
