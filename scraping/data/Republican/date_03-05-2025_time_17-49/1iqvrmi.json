Canada is disadvantaged in this regard because their national defense relies almost entirely on our military and their economy has been heavily backed and subsidized by the American economy.\n\nAll of this while the Prime Minister feels like he needs to stand up and try to act tough and bite the hand that feeds.  Personally I'm happy to cut all medical subsidizing to these 'Universal Healthcare' nations who depend on us and reroute that money back where it belongs, in helping the American people.  \n\nIn the meantime I'm more than happy to make mutually beneficial deals on things like minerals, oil, food, and other trade goods with Canada and Mexico.  I just want my home country to stop being the one always left with the short end, just because we happen to be the bigger and more prosperous.",

Australia has massive iron mines and we're fully capable of refining and forging steel.  So I'm sorry but the \"you need me\" arguments hit more like a vindictive girlfriend more than they sound like something from an economic or business partner.\n\nAmerican industries and our economic might still make up the massive backbone of the Canadian economy, and I think Canadians should want a little more economic independence in the sense that a recession in the US shouldn't be totally crippling to Canadians markets.  Canada shouldn't be so reliant on our good graces that if our government stopped subsidizing yours you wouldn't lose healthcare overnight and suffer a massive market dropoff.\n\nI'm not arguing for the dismantling of trade deals and economic and defensive partnerships with Canada, I'm simply arguing that if these partnerships are going to exist, neither side should walk away feeling taken advantage of.  Per capita isn't a relevant metric, neither is GDP, because I'm not going to give up more just because you can't offer up more.  Business has to be a fair and mutually beneficial venture, and concessions should be easy to handle and agree upon.\n\nWhen your Prime Minister starts issuing tough guy nonsense to a country who can steamroll him in 10 hours economically, militarily, and socially, it's obvious that partnership isn't respected, and adjustments need to be made.  Simple.\n\nI'm not arguing for a trade war, a hot war, or a culture mind you.  All I want is to be able to look at Canada and not see a welfare state dependent on my tax dollars while I see my fellow veterans homeless in my streets who can't get the help they need.",

Trumps main talking point recently is threatening our sovereignty. Thats not how you treat an old friend. We were on track to kick the liberals out and replace them with a more US friendly conservative government. Trumps blustering has put the liberals back into the race again. His rhetoric is just driving Canadian nationalism and solidifying the status quo.\n\nTrump needs to just shut up for 3 months, let us have our election. Let the conservatives take power and then we can negotiate. His constant yammering and tweeting is not helping anything.\n\nSure, you can replace those goods from Canada. But at a great cost. Most of our industry is literally a few miles from your border. All the transportation infrastructure is already there and highly efficient.  How is importing steel from Australia going to help your inflation situation? Its going to cost a lot more to ship and still have 25% tariffs. Also, Trump is isolating you guys not only from Canada, but the rest of the developed world. Youre not getting better deals from the Aussies or anyone else for that matter. You do need us if you want to keep your prices down. That is what the average Trump voter wanted above all.\n\nIf anything we don't need the US long term because we can sell our goods to anyone, including china who is begging for resources. Being in your shoes as a buyer of those goods is a whole other challenge. Also, no one is going to want to buy Americas expensive goods if the current administration continues to isolate themselves from the international community. There is nothing you guys make that china can't for half the price.",

Anyone with a limited understanding of economics can see there is a difference between China and Canada. For one thing Canada buys per capita waaaaay more from the US than you guys buy from Canada. Also, the things you buy from Canada are critical resources like oil, energy, potash, minerals, etc. Which you then turn into products like cars and iphones which we buy from you.

The last 8 of those years the fentanyl based drugs I was using came from NY. The guy in NY got all of his supply from Canada. To say it's virtually nothing is crazy. That same guy got caught in Buffalo with 300 kilos of fentanyl. We're just not going to agree on this because you want to claim you know better. Please don't act like you know how this affects US citizens because you don't my friend.",

Thousands die every year from OD here. Its the same problem as you guys have, possibly even worse in places like Vancouver.  Im sure some of it makes it over the border. However, its peanuts compared to what is coming over the southern border and Canada already has a task force in place to cut down on trafficking. Lets agree to focus on the real problem, which is China who is manufacturing and exporting fentanyl to destroy the west.",
