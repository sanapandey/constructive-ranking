There are other genes that affect male development, but the fact is that if those genes fail, are inactivated, produce faulty products, or are not present default fetal development is female.",

When we have influence in other countries, that help gives us sway. And it is cheaper than having troops everywhere. If we aren\u2019t sprinkling aid around, then China or other countries can gain more influence, have access to resources, and gain more global power. USAID is only 1% of the total budget, so one could argue the influence and control, maintaining stability are worth it.\n\n I do agree we need to rethink how we spend the money, and make sure the programs are legit, or cut them if needed, but that requires a scalpel to gut what is waste, fraud, and abuse. But now we are taking a chainsaw to our own government. I would have thought a 3-6 month audit, instead of immediate blind. cuts and firings. I\u2019m really concerned how this affects things down the road. And doctors and nurses who are getting resources cut in local cities in the US, because of cuts to health care etc.",

This would look like week long isolation after entering, screening, and facility\u2019s that prevent cross contamination of people entering the country with people flying domestically.\n\nEven without running the math it would be exponentially more expensive to prevent the illness from spreading here, then to just cure serious threats globally, or at least within any areas that our influence can. This isn\u2019t to mention the fact that curing it is more effective, and less likely to fail catastrophically, and creates less opportunity\u2019s for mutations to happen that make such illnesses more transmissible and better at slipping through detection.\n\nLong story short, this increases the odds of pandemics by a significant percentage, and puts the USA\u2019s global and domestic interests at higher risk from even things as simple as a family going on vacation.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of trump, but I did my best to keep this post as fact focused and objective as possible.",
