Overall, Russia has clearly been an aggressor and committed some serious atrocities including these camps, but also their treatment of war prisoners and dissidents within their own country. Putin has clearly staged elections and ignores many human rights with his staff and citizens, who clearly sees as subjects. Zelensky though has extended this war irresponsibly and taken actions that resemble dictatorships. He's been squandering money and puppeting the EU. \n\nI will also add that I don't think Trump is handling the situation that well, and making an enemy of Ukraine is missing a big opportunity for a strong geopolitical position against Russia. On the other hand, his swift action to end the war is best probably for Ukraine and it's citizens long term and the US's Treasury.",

It's not a good rhetoric for other NATO allies who also consider Ukraine an ally. It's just gonna make deals on the negotiations table with countries he plans to impose tariffs on harder. A complete isolationist strategy generally doesn't pan out well ( see Herbert Hoover, note that most politicians during that era were isolationist)",

The best way to combat that is with knowledge and unity (unity is a whole different topic though lol).\n\nImo, the best way is learning about history. See what specific actions led up to different historical events so you can identify the potential consequences of what's happening right now. That, and consume news sources that are biased in different ways as well as ones that are as unbiased as possible (verifiable sources, emotionless language, don't have an angle, etc). Actively discuss your views with people who think differently, if possible. That way you get as much of the full picture as you can.\n\nBut yeah. There are issues you guys bring up that I would never know about if I didn't intentionally seek them out. If you like reading news maybe try the app Ground News, it shows you the % left/right coverage of topics and blind spots for both sides. I don't like subscription models but it links to a lot of different publications, which is helpful for staying informed.",

He is telling them the cold hard reality, that the days of the United States paying for everything are over. And, it's time NATO countries do what Bernie always loves to squawk about...\"Pay their fair share\". It's called tough love. \n* Let's not pretend that Zelenskky isn't a dictator. He has killed, jailed, and otherwise silenced opposition leaders, journalists, and even banned certain Christian churches, notably the Russian Orthodox Church along with several other Catholic denominations. According to the AP, \"criminal proceedings have been initiated against over 100 clerics of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church for alleged war-related crimes\". What are those \"crimes\"? \n* In 2022, Zelenskyy banned \"any activity\" by eleven Ukrainian political parties. The ban included the largest opposition party called *Opposition Platform - For Life* which held more than forty seats in Ukraine's national parliament before the ban.\n* Zelenskyy forcibly took control of all television channels in the country and turned them into a single entity that his people described as \"a single information platform of strategic communications called United News\". Zelensky said the measure was necessary to combat Russian misinformation and \"tell the truth about the war\". \n* Trump told the truth to Europe that this war is a direct result of Ukraine trying to get into NATO, yet, they pretend it's anything but. \n* European's are quick to criticize Trump and America's role, but want The US to take the lead, pay for everything and take the risks. At the same time, the European people have ZERO appetite for getting involved in a war with Russia. However, they will be more than happy to have American soldiers go in on their behalf.\n* European leaders are angry at Trump for trying to broker a peace deal, but, none of them want to step up to the plate and help broker a deal. \n* If Trump is able to get these two countries to make a peace agreement, both sides will be a little unhappy. It's not going to be a one-sided pro-Russian deal. \n* Creating a peace deal is in *everyone's* interest. If the US and the EU continue to fund this proxy war against Russia, it's eventually going to escalate into a full scale war that could cause untold deaths. Russia isn't going away.",

They thought they could take Ukraine in 3 days, instead it took them 3 years already. Zelensky also taking passports and forcing any man to fight. This whole war is disgusting. \n\nSince Ukraine was left out of negotiations and was offered no security whatsoever, Putin now just got free reign to take whatever he wants more.\n\nAnd FYI I\u2019m Dutch, voted right and we currently already are in hybrid war with Russia. Don\u2019t know if you remember, but in 2014 while they were annexing Crimea, they shot down a civilian Dutch plane taking 196 lives. A few weeks ago I was watching TV and the signal turned bad for a day. Turned out Russia attacked our satellites.",

This is literally 20,000x worse and I\u2019m supposed to believe we can\u2019t compromise because Putin started it.
