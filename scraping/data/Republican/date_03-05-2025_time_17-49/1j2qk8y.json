If you don't get veteran benefits checks out fast enough, if you don't comply with federal transportation regulations, if your schools don't abide by Title IX decisions, if you don't comply with any number of executive orders or executive agency decisions, you will have your funds turned off. Probably literally every state has at some point had their funding for something turned off and but on probation, or withheld until compliance. The number of Redditors on political subs like this admitting that they literally have no idea how the adult world works is hilarious.",
