He did say that, but he said he would not apologize, he would not cede territory to Russia, did not support lifting sanctions, and he would not sign unless it included membership in NATO. After France, UK, and Ukraine talked about a 30-day ceasefire today, that the UK said went well, he also said he would not sign it. I can't imagine how he will have any support after he rejects every offer placed before him.",

He legitimately needs security guarantees to protect the Ukrainians.\n\n\u201c\n\n\u201cIn the years following Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion of Ukraine, Russia-led forces reportedly used children to perform armed duty at checkpoints and to serve as fighters, guards, mailpersons, and secretaries, as well as informants and human shields. Following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, media highlighted new reports of Russian forces using Ukrainian children as human shields. Observers also reported Russian authorities used Ukrainian children as informants to gather information about the location of strategic military objects, such as checkpoints and transportation routes, and used Russian children, including orphans and children with disabilities, to sew clothes and bandages for Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine and to make tactical stretchers, mobile stoves, and trench candles. Russian authorities expanded efforts to militarize Russian children and Ukrainian children in Russia-occupied territory in Ukraine. The government publicly announced there were approximately 10,000 \u201cmilitary-patriotic\u201d clubs in Russian schools, and the Ministry of Education reportedly announced it piloted a mandatory course in schools that included classes on drones, practice using live ammunition, and excursions to military units. Observers reported Russia-associated military associations and clubs, registered as non-profit organizations, continued to routinely prepare Ukrainian youth in Russia-occupied areas of Ukraine for conscripted service in Russia\u2019s armed forces; some observers reported Russia-led forces conscripted Ukrainian youth as young as 16 years old, some of whom may have participated in fighting. In February 2024, observers reported Russia-led forces created new camps for Ukrainian children in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukraine, where Russian-occupation authorities taught children to use firearms. In November 2023, Russia-led forces announced a new \u201cprofessional military orientation\u201d for students in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine. Experts reported Russian authorities placed thousands of Ukrainian children in \u201cre-education\u201d camps in Belarus, Russia, and Russia-occupied territory in Ukraine; in some cases, instruction included military education and training. All children placed in these camps remained vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, including human trafficking. As in previous reporting periods, the government provided support to the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group, an armed group that unlawfully recruited and used child soldiers in the Central African Republic (CAR). Media previously reported the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group kidnapped boys in CAR and exploited them in forced labor in mines.\u201d\n\n\n[source](https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-trafficking-in-persons-report/russia/)\n\n\nWith respect to who started the conflict: \n\n\u201cPutin believes that Russia rightfully deserves a sphere of influence in its \u201cnear abroad.\u201d\nKennan never convinced President Bill Clinton or his Russia adviser, Strobe Talbott. **And the remarks of Secretary Baker or NATO leaders could be discounted because they were never part of a treaty or formal agreement. But Putin nevertheless claims that the West betrayed Russia in the post-Soviet period because much of Eastern Europe, in fact, joined NATO. And this is at least part of what motivates his aggression now.**\n\n**In any case, this putative betrayal does not carry the weight of a violation of a formal agreement, a violation of which Putin himself is guilty. By signing the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in 1994, the Russian Federation promised not to threaten or use military force or economic coercion against Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. As a result of this and other agreements, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons and acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear state. It is now paying the price for trusting Russia to honor its international commitments.**\n\nShift in Ukrainian Public Opinion\n\nDuring my tenure in Kyiv, State Department\u2013sponsored public opinion polling never showed a majority of Ukrainian public support for NATO membership. **Private sector polling showed that as late as 2012, only 28 percent of Ukrainians wished to join NATO. Not surprisingly, pro-Russian sentiment was stronger in the east, but the largest plurality was for neutrality. The 2014 Russian seizure of Crimea and the fomenting of a violent separatist movement in eastern Ukraine sharply shifted Ukrainian public opinion.** A poll by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation in June 2017 found 69 percent supported joining the alliance.\u201d\n\nThe rest is very informative, but I\u2019ll leave it at this. \n\n[source](https://afsa.org/about-afsa)",
