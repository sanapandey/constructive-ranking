            "body": " I lean conservative in most of my beliefs, and I fully support Ukraine\u2019s fight, yet the most common excuse for pulling out of this war is the money we\u2019ve spent, which ignores the strategic and economic advantages we\u2019ve gained.\n\nRoughly 90% of the aid funds stayed within the U.S., meaning much of that money went right back into circulation, fueling our defense industry, boosting our energy sector, and strengthening our financial markets as global uncertainty drove investors toward U.S. assets. Beyond the economic benefits, we\u2019ve battle-tested modern warfare strategies, stress-tested our logistical capabilities, and gained invaluable insight into large-scale peer-to-peer conflict.\n\nWhile the cost may seem high on paper, the return on investment in security, global positioning, and industrial strength is undeniable. Abandoning Ukraine now would be an act of strategic incompetence that weakens our influence, emboldens our adversaries, and throws away everything we\u2019ve learned and gained. The Trump administration would be making a grave mistake by pulling back.\n\nMuch of this feels impulsive, and I can only hope that isn\u2019t reflected in their upcoming decisions. If we are to abandon Ukraine and withdraw all support, I hope we\u2019re wise enough to recognize just how detrimental it could be to us. This isn\u2019t just about them\u2014it puts us at a very real disadvantage.",

At the same time, it\u2019s also one of the reasons I lean conservative. While we may broadly align on core principles, we aren\u2019t uniform in our beliefs, and there\u2019s a lot of independent thought within the movement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party tends to prioritize cohesion above all else, often abandoning logical reasoning in favor of whatever direction the majority wants to take. And honestly, I don\u2019t say that to be facetious\u2014it makes sense from a strategic standpoint. But from the countless conversations I\u2019ve had with liberals and Democrats, the mindset often feels more hive-like than individually reasoned.",

Nearly 90% of the aid stays within our borders, fueling American jobs, strengthening our defense sector, and reinforcing our global economic position.\n\nAs for Europe, they are contributing significantly, far more than most people acknowledge. The EU and its member states pledged over $100 billion in military aid, with commitments continuing to grow. But leaving Ukraine to fend for itself isn\u2019t just Europe\u2019s problem. A Russian victory would destabilize NATO\u2019s eastern flank, embolden China, and create long-term security risks that we would have to deal with later, likely at a much higher cost.\n\nThis isn\u2019t charity brother, it\u2019s an investment in our own national security and economic strength.

In the end, both being failures.\n\nThe truth is Russia will never be a trusted partner. But to let them collapse would risk the creation of several small nuclear powers, potentially worse than the Kremlin now.\n\nThe US should be very wary in its relations with Russia.

It\u2019s indeed very tragic. However, beyond those words, it is realized by both Europe and the United States that Ukraine prior to the invasion of Crimea is internally a \u2018fragile democracy\u2019 and that remains still true today. You can go as far back as 1991 and see it was always in a fragile state. It\u2019s not limited to just Russian influence via oligarchs.\n\nNumerous times it was suggested by the US that Ukraine had major corruption issues, economic mismanagement, and an internally weak government. This can be seen throughout their history of post independence from the Soviet era. This is not to condemn Ukraine or belittle it. But, it is to shed light on their volatilities and reserved nature that most presidents have shown towards Ukraine historically even if relations have been good overall. We would have to deal with that risk.\n\nRemember, Obama didn\u2019t even push back much against Russia after the annexation of Crimea occurred (via the \u2018Polite People\u2019) in 2014. Russia was removed from NATOs Partnership For Peace. \n\nMy concern, is that while, reflecting on the meeting, I see it from both sides. On one hand, some Americans were disappointed to see the diplomatic optics play out on the cameras (which every pro-DNC commentator finally got something to jump on). However, how often has anyone seen negotiations play out publicly? But also, perhaps much more important than sheer optics, what is the end game of continuously supplying Ukraine into a stalemate with Russia? No one seems to answer that when they critique the president\u2019s handling or any previous president\u2019s actions on this issue. If you heard the entire sit down, Zelenskyy passed insult to both Obama\u2019s and Biden\u2019s administration in terms of helping Ukraine settle this war.\n\nSo, while I respect your concerns pertaining to the optics of American foreign diplomacy (which has historically been far from perfect), diplomacy is a two way street. Eventually, Ukraine is going to need money to repair itself. If a sustainable cease fire is to occur, followed by a withdrawal of Russia, having an increased business relationship with the US, as opposed to Russia forcefully taking over and capturing resources, would not only benefit Ukraine but create a greater importance globally. As opposed to it just being a geopolitical football between Russia and Western Europe, as it currently stands.\n\nOnce again, this doesn\u2019t represent a position of excusing Russia from its actions but it does stop and create an opportunity for Russia to withdraw from Ukraine (minus Crimea). Otherwise, what other choice does the US or European allies have other than supporting evasive measures on behalf of Ukraine?",

Before you dismiss, let me explain.  \n  \nA reasonable and responsible Federal income tax is actually a good thing in a representative government. If the government does not need my revenue to survive, they no longer need me. The government has no reason to be accountable to me or the rest of the people. Try going to a store and making serious complaints about it, and then tell them how you've never spent a dime there and see how quickly you get walked off the property. If you don't pay, you don't matter.\n\nThe other side of your argument that I take issue with is that the American people will have the price of those tariffs baked into the goods and services we import, and the finished goods we try to sell to other countries will have reciprocal import tariffs that will elevate the price of our goods. These things do not cancel each other out though, as those other countries do not have tariffs with the other regions of the world that make products that compete against ours. Their businesses and consumers can simply order products from non-tariffed nations. China, Canada, and Mexico, the three places Trump wants to tax likely accounts for 80% of the products we import. We have no non-tariffed alternatives.\n\nThe arguments I've seen for tariffs are based on simplicities, when there are obviously many nuances. Americans pay the tax on tariffed imported goods, I don't know why the President keeps saying the contrary, either he doesn't know himself (unlikely), or it's not supportive of his narrative (much more likely).",

As far as me talking about that ever, I didn't really care about Ukraine until about 3 year ago when I got to know some Ukrainians. I have a friend over there that has had to flee his home and was able to return months later. He tells me what's really happening over there, and unless you are seeking out this information, you do not know what the situation is for these people. I didn't really care what Obama was doing except I did know that Putin was stealing land from an independent country and knew it was wrong, but there are a lot of wrong things in the world.

The goal is to keep defense up until Russia has nothing else to throw at Ukraine or until he is politically non-viable in Russia and he is removed. Putin was seriously humiliated when Ukraine took Kursk Oblast.\n\nThe Russian people have this contract with Putin - you can do what you want as long as we are safe. They have been looking the other way until Kursk shattered the safety assurances they were relying on.\n\nUkraine is never going defeat the Russian army through might. They must resist and make the war as costly as possible for Russia and Putin and the army will eventually collapse.\n\nRussia is committing slow suicide. I've always seen this as a game of who can survive the longest. The Russian economy is slowly grinding to a halt, and support for Putin slowly weakens. At some point the works will be gummed up too much for it to keep this up. The sanctions have crippled Russia. Ukraine, a country with no navy, has somehow sent a good portion of Russia's to the bottom of the sea. Russia is committing more and more of its budget to the war at unsustainable levels.\n\n> We can't attack Russia directly because it will start an escalation that may start WW3...not going to risk WW3 so that Ukraine can gain its territory back.. just not sorry.\n\nI don't think anyone has ever suggested we have direct conflict with Russia. The WW3 risk for supporting Ukraine with equipment, weapons and financial aid is overblown. There have been a dozen \"red lines\" where Putin has rattled his saber and done nothing. Russia is a paper tiger. In 2023, [they started calling 70 year old military retirees back to duty](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-extends-eligibility-military-call-up-by-least-five-years-2023-07-18/). Ths is not what someone in a position of strength does. Russia is stretched thin. They had to recruit North Koreans to fight for them, and it ended really badly for them.\n\nHolding the line is the cheapest way to take a chess piece off the board, to secure Europe's future, and to dismantle the remnants of the Soviet war machine.\n\n> I would be in favor of part of the ceasefire is that those who want to move to Ukraine controlled Ukraine can do it. \n\nRussia has kidnapped women and children and killed Ukrainian POWs, I doubt they have any interest in a peaceful evacuation of anyone.\n\n> We will most likely be picking up the tab for rebuilding the country with perhaps that coming from the mineral rights proceeds.\n\nI think that is a lucrative opportunity. The Ukrainian population is highly educated and would be very capable of working with us to build out the mining infrastructure to access their minerals. The bullets need to stop flying first.",

They need us; we don't need them. Yes, they should \"kiss our ass\" - or, in less vulgar terms, bow, kiss the ring, and obey.  That is the *least* respect we are due for the years of blood and treasure we spent after Zelensky started a war to feed his ego.\n\nThat was the problem with Joe - I think subconsciously he knew he *personally* didn't deserve respect, so he didn't demand other countries show America respect. He was a pathetic insecure man who hid behind the formalities of diplomacy because he was afraid to use America's strength the way it should be used. He knew he deserved to be dominated, and Zelensky, like America's other enemies, took full advantage of his submission.\n\nAristotle wrote that the \"great souled man\", the man worthy of emulation, strikes a balance between arrogance and humility.  The arrogant man values himself too much. The humble man values himself too little. The great souled man has proper pride - he knows his value, he shows respect to his superiors, and he demands respect from his inferiors.  \n\nPresident Trump knows his worth.

Or a congressman.\n\nIrrespective of the virtues of the person, they hold authority by virtue of their power and position and deserve respect *because of their power and position*.\n\nZelensky should have submitted to President Trump for the same reason every federal worker in America is now submitting to CEO Musk and sending him five bullet points a week - because he has the power to ruin their lives if they don't. And the stupid and arrogant who think they don't have to submit to power are being weeded out of federal government, just like Zelensky and his arrogant cronies are about to be rooted out of Kiev by Russian special forces.\n\nThe nail that sticks out gets hammered down. And arrogant fools who think they don't have to obey those above them learn their place the hard way. \n\nIt's not about monarchy. It's about reality.",

Our strength also stems from our identity \u2014 a nation founded on liberty, limited government, individual rights, and the rule of law. Our style of governance fiercely protects our right to think freely, to debate, and to challenge authority within the bounds of our civil liberties. When political dissent occurs, the American way isn\u2019t to crush it into submission. That is not liberty and freedom. We are a government by the people and for the people. These are the principles that America has historically worked to protect, and project to the world.\n\n\t1.\tLiberty and Self-Governance. Our founders rejected the idea that power for power\u2019s sake entitles anyone to respect. Instead, they built a system where legitimate authority comes from the consent of the governed \u2014 and this consent is earned. That applies at home and abroad. When we work with allies based on shared interests and values, we strengthen that respect.\n\n\t2.\tMoral Leadership. We are not an empire. We are a the world\u2019s most powerful democratic republic with a moral responsibility to stand for something greater \u2014 freedom to be self-governing, freedom to vote, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equal protection under the law, the right to bear arms to protect oneself against personal attacks and governmental tyranny, the pursuit of happiness, a belief that all people are created equal, among many others. We are the shining city upon the hill. This moral leadership has always been a key part of why America commands respect globally.\n\n\t3.\tThe Dangers of Arrogant Power. Our founding fathers, especially conservatives like Washington and Adams, warned against the arrogance of unchecked power. They knew that demanding respect through fear alone was the mark of tyrants and autocrats, not leaders of a free-thinking and self-governing people. True strength comes from a virtuous posture and principled action\u2014 not coercion and humiliation of our citizens or allies.",

We jumped into the deep end without knowing what was in the water. \n\nLook at the reasons too for why Ukraine can't join NATO - corruption was part of it too. \n\nZelensky shouldn't be suspending elections in his country. His people need to voice their concerns and if they want to work out some deal with Putin. It's obvious that throwing billions of US dollars in military equipment isn't going to win anything.",

            "body": "Here\u2019s a write up/point of view I align with and believe is very accurate with respect to the fiasco that unfolded yesterday:\n\nMany of you probably watched what took place between Donald Trump and Zelenskyy tonight. Whether you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican, you might be thinking to yourself, Oh my God, Donald Trump just screwed up.\n\nHowever, as a lifelong practitioner of martial arts, strategy, and philosophy, let me explain the difference between what you believe you witnessed and what actually happened.\n\nDonald Trump has been under constant political persecution since the beginning of his first term. Over time, he has learned to be patient and calculated.\n\nTonight, Zelenskyy was invited to the Oval Office. However, both Trump and JD Vance knew exactly what Zelenskyy was going to do\u2014he would use this opportunity, in front of the American people, to make a power play. Both Trump and Vance anticipated this.\n\nWhen Zelenskyy began appealing to the emotions of the American people, JD Vance stepped in, accusing him of disrespecting Donald Trump. This was brilliant strategy. It\u2019s important to understand that Zelenskyy is trying to gain access to NATO.\n\nTrump knew this but could not allow it to happen. If Ukraine joins NATO, the U.S. would be bound by NATO\u2019s collective defense agreement\u2014an attack on one is an attack on all.\n\nNow consider the larger implications: Ukraine and Russia despise each other. If Ukraine were to become a NATO member, any future skirmish between them would obligate the U.S. to enter into direct conflict with Russia. This would mean World War III. And if that happened, China would have to choose a side\u2014they would almost certainly align with Russia.\n\nSo what you witnessed tonight was a setup. Trump and JD Vance knew that the only way to achieve peace was to strategically align, at least on the surface, with Russia. Why? Because Russia would never sign a peace treaty if Ukraine were admitted into NATO.\n\nThis is why Trump dismantled Zelenskyy\u2019s argument. And when Zelenskyy, seeing his play failing, tried to backtrack and offer a treaty, Trump refused.\n\nZelenskyy\u2019s real intent was clear\u2014he would not agree to peace unless security guarantees were in place. But what was he actually saying? That NATO must accept Ukraine. However, Russia would never agree to peace, knowing that NATO, their historical adversary, would surround them.\n\nZelenskyy, Putin, and Trump all knew this. Zelenskyy, thinking he had Democrats\u2019 support, believed he could make this bold move on live television. But Trump and Vance saw right through it and outmaneuvered him.\n\nThey knew that, in the short term, Democrats and the media would try to use this moment against them. But they also knew they had two years before midterms to prove their strategy was the right one. So they held their ground\u2014brilliantly so.\n\nNow, Zelenskyy will have no choice but to back down and accept Trump\u2019s terms. But here\u2019s the genius part\u2014Trump is actually protecting Ukraine without dragging the U.S. into war.\n\nBy negotiating a mineral deal, Trump ensures that Americans will be involved in Ukraine\u2019s mining industry. This prevents Russia from launching an invasion, because attacking Ukraine would mean endangering American lives\u2014something that would force the U.S. to respond.\n\nTrump played both sides like a master chess player. In the end, Zelenskyy will have no choice but to concede, because without U.S. support, Ukraine cannot win a prolonged war against Russia. And once U.S. companies have mining operations in Ukraine, Putin will be unable to attack without triggering massive international consequences.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate Donald Trump. In this game of chess, he\u2019s 10 moves ahead of everyone.",
