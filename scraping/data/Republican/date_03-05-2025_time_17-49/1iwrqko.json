We also had a black controller who was one of our best controllers, yet he had to work there for 10 years as FP&A before he was promoted to a controller position. All while a young white man went from FP&A to VP position in 4 years. In fact, the black controller had to train him when he came on. Also, almost the entire leadership (with the exception of 2 women) were white men. Some were great at their job, some were pretty aweful and heavily relied on the women who worked under them. \nThis is a large, international company. But each location is managed separately. \n\nAnd yes, like you said, some hire minorities and women just to appear diverse.\n\nThe idea of DEI is good and needed. It's just not working.
