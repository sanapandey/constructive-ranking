We have enough crime as it is, I want to do our best to ensure the folks coming into America are good people.  I think most of them are, but not all.  We have to protect our citizens and if even one American citizen is the victim of a crime at the hands of someone who is not documented....that is one too many.",

Illegal immigrants do pay taxes and most likely will work.  But it's the criminals and the ones that *don't work* that take resources rather than contribute  to our society.  That is a big problem.   \n\nSocial safety nets are a scarce resource, and they need to be allocated to the most needy *LEGal American Citizen*  not some person that wants to take advantage of the American system as a parasite.",

Many that don't contribute to the underground economy, which is still economy. \n\nThe key question is, do they contribute NET to the economy?  They pay many taxes as we all do, sales, indirect property tax through rent, if they have a green card, income tax withholding (although most do not hit a rate where they actually pay, and many get a refund.)\n\nOn the other side, they cost a certain amount, each resident of the US does.  Emergency health care, fire and rescue, police, and of course education.  Water and infrastructure.  And honestly we are all supposed to be chipping in on defense, roads, regulatory agencies, all of that government overhead.\n\nSo is it a net contribution or a net cost?  I don't have reliable numbers but just jotting on the back of envelope it comes out pretty much a wash.  Now if they are not working, are sending amounts of money out of the country, or increasing crime, that is obviously a loss for those.",
