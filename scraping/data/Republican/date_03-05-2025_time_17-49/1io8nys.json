He called out Prince Andrew for it in a Bloomberg interview. Then, in the Republican debates, Hannity asked him about Bill Clinton, and he responded with Epstein and the Island. The media loves to throw up the pics of he and Epstein from the 90's trying to make the connection that Trump was also involved but if he was he wouldn't have been calling it out the way he did. There is also a clip of the prosecutor from the first Epstein trial, who is also the attorney for the victims currently, talking about Trump banning Epstein from all Trump properties because Epstein attempted to assault an employees 14 yr old daughter. \n\nIn my mind, that's why I trust him. He has been going after these people for a long time. Long before most of us knew what had been going on.",

I\u2019ve been super conservative, so really very few politicians I agree with everything, since before I could vote.  I learned years ago that the media lied to us in ways most people don\u2019t get.  I\u2019m not going to state those.  That said, I like Trump for his stance on the media, but he also gets results too.  My personal opinion as to why the left and others hate him is that he has no government or military experience before the presidency, and he\u2019s the only one ever that\u2019s been elected with that \u2018achievement\u2019.  That\u2019s my opinion though.  I really like that he does what\u2019s good for the country.  So many politicians, on all sides, and at all levels, do what they think their constituents want, or what will help them get elected or noticed for a higher office. In fact, that\u2019s the norm in US politics.  Trump is a rarity in doing the opposite. If you do what\u2019s right the voters will care and like it.  That\u2019s my opinion anyway.  He does what\u2019s right for this country and people.  Yes, some don\u2019t like it, but he gets results and that\u2019s what counts.",

He has his douche personality that he uses when fighting for something and when he wants to be in charge, but its the equivalent of trash talking in sports.\n\nRegardless of policies and whether they're good or not, I truly think he just wants to be a better president than every other president. I seriously think that's his goal. Like it's not about him gaining power and money to feel like a tyrant. Maybe he would like to be a king, but not for the sadistic pleasure of crushing people down, but more for the notoriety and respect. He lives in a mindset where profitability and financial progress is how he measures success of a nation, and with financial success comes the means to make life more enjoyable for the average person. He wants to be the person that takes the wheel and saves the day.\n\nDebating policies and how to get to an end goal is obviously a whole different conversation and if you got qualms about that, that's fine. But the people who think trump is the devil have definitely misinterpreted his motives and how his brain ticks. \n\nAnd for the left, if you can't identify your opponent properly and don't understand them, then you will continously lose when it comes to elections. Its like fighting in ufc and training to fight a heavy kickboxer, but the opponent isn't a kickboxer and is an elite grappler and wrestler, so you keep getting your ass handed to you because he keeps throwing you down and putting you in an arm bar. And then in the fog of insanity you say if only you could have blocked a few kicks you could have won the fight, bit the dude never threw a kick at you, so you're making shit up and excuses that make no sense in why you lost.",
