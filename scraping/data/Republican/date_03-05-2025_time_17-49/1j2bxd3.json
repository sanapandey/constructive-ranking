            "body": "Tariffs are tools. They can be used to protect critical domestic industries\u2014something we do, and so do others. However, the cheapest goods usually come from free trade. Increasing tariffs raises the price of goods, which inevitably leads to inflation.\n\nTrump's reciprocal tarrifs are being used as a bargaining chip, employing a \"you tariff us, we tariff you\" strategy in the hope that the other side will back down and lower their tariffs. But that\u2019s not always the case. Other countries might be protecting different industries than we are. For instance, one country may impose tariffs on beets because they care about their beet industry, while we have no interest in ours and didn\u2019t impose tariffs. In this case, reciprocal tariffs would simply lead to higher beet prices in the U.S. because the other side won\u2019t back down. In other areas, it\u2019s possible people will back down\u2014but it\u2019s uncertain.\n\nRegarding the 25% tariffs within North America, I see this more as a different bargaining tactic. In many ways, it reflects the \"Madman Theory\" of negotiation, which you can find a recent summary of here: https://youtu.be/AGO1gvNgG6k?feature=shared . Ultimately, the outcome will depend on what other countries do. If all the threatened tariffs remain in place, the economy could suffer so much that Trump will become politically unpopular and may have to back down. What\u2019s concerning to me, however, is that while Trump may extract short-term concessions from allies, he might be sacrificing long-term relationships with them. I worry he\u2019s focusing too much on short-term gains rather than the long-term impact.",

The first order effect is externally sourced income, and that\u2019s fine, but the two larger consequences in my mind are pressuring companies that left the US to return (or bring in foreign companies, or even just make space for new domestic companies), and also as an economic leverage tool to create better long term trade deals related to import/export ratios with various countries, or natural resource rights, or any other trade benefits trump can come up with.

I understand Trump wants to go in and get it done while he can, but his moving unilaterally and so quickly is potentially damaging our economy unnecessarily, and will have repercussions.\n\nHere\u2019s my little example of a first world problem:\n\nWhen Trump first announced the Chinese tariffs late on Friday night the US Post Office didn\u2019t know what to do about the parcels coming in from China. They had no time to plan and didn\u2019t have the customs documentation in order and decided to send them all back because they hadn\u2019t paid their ten percent. I had the CPU for my water heater mixed up in this mess, and what should have only been a few days without hot water ended up being a few weeks and very stressful for my family.\n\nThis could have been completely avoided with a little planning. Im actually still mad about it. Why not clue in the post office and wait a few weeks to work out the details? Or go through Congress and get something done that can\u2019t be overturned by the next president? Republicans have the majority in the house senate executive and Supreme Court.

Which the tariffs were then returned and placed on us. This deepened the Great Depression substantially. The whole world was in economic ruin because of the amazing America that we are!

For decades, countries like China have hit our exports with heavy tariffs while we let their goods in cheaply, gutting U.S. manufacturing.  \nTariffs encourage companies to bring production back home, strengthen national security by reducing reliance on foreign supply chains, and help level the playing field in trade. If done right, they could finally shift the balance in our favor and put American workers first.\n\nThe downside is that tariffs can raise prices on imported goods, and businesses relying on foreign parts might pass those costs onto consumers. Some industries could take a hit if other countries refuse to lower their own tariffs or find loopholes to avoid ours.  \nWhile tariffs push back against a rigged system, they don\u2019t guarantee other nations will play fair, and there\u2019s always the risk of short-term economic turbulence.",

Let\u2019s take Canada for example, we have a great relationship with them in trade, mutual defense pacts, and so many other great things! However, in raising tariffs, we are, frankly, pissing them off. Which might damage our relationship and may end our mutual defense pact and other national securities that we have in place to benefit both of our countries. Is that relationship worth damaging for these tariffs? Apply the same thing to other countries as well, Germany, France, Great Britain, etc.\n\nIt\u2019s fine by me if we have America hit the reset button. I would LOVE it if we could truly be self sufficient, but in all reality, who is leaving their jobs to go harvest fruit for minimum wage? The only way they would is if they offered more money. If they offered more money, their cost of operations would go up. If that goes up, they need to increase the cost of the product so that they, at the very least, don\u2019t go into debt. We consumers have to buy that product. The same thing goes for the other industries. Hitting the reset button would be amazing, but we have got to figure out what to do to be self sufficient first before we cut off our imports.\n\nI\u2019m also nervous for a tariff war. If we raise our tariffs, then the other country will raise their tariffs, then back and forth until something is settled. Which wouldn\u2019t matter if we were self sufficient, but we\u2019re not. Additionally, I\u2019m nervous that we, the people of the United States, will not be benefiting from these tariffs, but rather Big Businesses will be.\n\nSo to ask my question again, does it worry you that these tariffs might damage our relationships?

First, for months he claimed that our businesses would be paying the tariffs. That had already been shown to be wrong, and he repeatedly lied about this either indicating a major misunderstanding on his part or just a frank desire to lie to us. \n\nAfter it became apparent that we would be paying, he then said that it\u2019s not a big deal we don\u2019t buy many things from them anyway, like the Canadian argument. However, notice how we are already talking about using our national forests for lumber, because we got major construction materials (lumber, concrete, etc) from Canada. \n\nThen after we were told it wouldn\u2019t be that bad, the stock market began falling and suddenly it was just \u201cBiden\u2019s bad economy\u201d, despite the earlier rallies when the tariff threats were considered bluffs to be a \u201cTrump Rally\u201d indicating that he is absolutely willing to take credit for the economy when it\u2019s good but cry like a child when it\u2019s not. \n\nNow we are at the point where not only will we pay more, but it isn\u2019t going to be good for a long time, and we should in fact be proud of having to pay more. All for getting manufacturing back to the US, which is hilarious given that it will take likely a decade or more to even begin constructing these manufacturing lines, only for us to also then pay more after the fact for American labor and equipment. \n\nNone of that equals a better economy for us, none of that equals cheaper groceries for us. None of that equals lower housing costs. \n\nIt is a pure fallacy of huge proportion that doesn\u2019t even make sense if you question it a tiny bit. Which is why it only makes sense that the man who has spent his life on pump and dump easy investments might not have the greatest grasp of world economics.\n\nAnd you knows that\u2019s not all that bad, I don\u2019t care if my president knows every single thing or subject.
