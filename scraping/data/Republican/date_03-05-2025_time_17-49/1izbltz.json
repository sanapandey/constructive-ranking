All forms of government are throttling the economy. I once heard a liberal say that taxes are necessary to control those things we don't want in society  (petroleum, alcohol, cigarettes, etc.). My question for him was, if that's true, why do we have income tax? As far as the debt, the federal government should have to negotiate a fair resolution to the debt with the share holders, it's citizens.  Until they actually are held accountable they should be held to the most basic budget possible. But hey as long as they make the evil business man pay their fair share what difference does it make?",

The wealth disparities in this country are horrendous. Do I think all wealthy people are bad? Not at all. In fact, my husband and I do pretty well and pay a high tax rate, especially compared to the national averages. We will benefit from the Trump tax plan, and I still think it's gross.

It isn't a question of how we pay for all this, but WHY are we paying for all this. And bigger than that, why is it being paid for out of our income? The whole thing is upside down. Why do they need 60% of my income? None of us know where our money goes. Our social security is collected,  why do we get back pennies on the dollar for what we've invested? Why are government workers exempted from social security?  The solutions will only come if they ever actually get transparent with the public.",

It makes no cuts to subsidies for highly profitable industries, it makes massive cuts to blue collar small businesses and farms that are \u201clifeblood \u201c operations, and it guts programs for the USDA, VA, and Small business associations.\u00a0\n\n\nOn the operations side, federal workers are covered by a 5000 page contract. Among other things, they can\u2019t just be fired in mass with no notice. The process is called a reduction in Force,RIF. \u00a0Anything else is illegal. In short, any person fired under a RIF gets to play musical chairs with any employee less senior\u2026. So, all those firings that weren\u2019t RIF\u2019d will be overturned in court and rehired. It\u2019s required by law. All lost wages will be back payed with penalties. Those employees may then be RIF\u2019d . If Trump RIF\u2019s 300k people, it actually affects ~1M people (re:musical chairs) All of which are eligible for severance. They are then paid out at the higher rate regardless \u00a0of the paygrade of the position they assume, and get all benefits assigned. Anyone who is unemployed as a result gets paid unemployment by the federal government government, it is self-insured. \u00a0The contractual requirements are for up to 3 years.\u00a0\n\nSo the \u201cdrain the DEI swamp\u201d just means that those gs13 employees will get a 6 month paid vacation until a court overturns it, then get paid a $120k per year salary while taking a -~$80k lower their federal job, as well the person they replaced \u2026and on and on. And then get 3 years of unemployment unless they are hired at a commensurate level and anyone impacted by a RIF gets preferential hiring over anyone else.\u00a0\n\nSo Trump just inflated the salaries across the fed by 1-3 paygrades, cut the cheapest lowest level new hires, and created a situation where were existing federal employees are more entrenched then anytime in history while being paid more for less work than at anytime in history.\u00a0",

Also almost 1/3rd of all the positions targeted so far were self funded-aka your tax dollars don\u2019t pay for it. If they don\u2019t do the work, the work isn\u2019t billed and permits aren\u2019t issued- think new oil wells and mining sites, or new FDA drug trials. \u00a0 You may take the pure libertarianism approach of removal of those regulations, but personally I don\u2019t want a conglomerate mining company deciding to strip mine the blm valley next to my ranch without detailed studies showing the ends justify the means and it won\u2019t just become a cesspool to be cleaned up by more tax dollars after the company evaporates.
