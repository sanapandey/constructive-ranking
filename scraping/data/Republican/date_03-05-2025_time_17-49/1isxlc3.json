The bureaucracy is answerable to the president, not the other way around.  Nor are they a 4th branch of government.  Trump is asserting the president\u2019s right to exert authority over the branch for which the constitution vests him with authority.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t a coup.  It is the first steps of *undoing* a coup by unelected bureaucrats.",

The point of these agencies is to effectively administer the function of the government they manage. If you install a white house liaison and add extra purity testing steps we're literally adding more bureaucracy. This batch of orders in combination are way more involved than we're used to and I expect growing pains.\n\nThe wording even notes that Trump can have them interpret the law however he wants, even if he breaks the law. Given Trump can't be held accountable it's extremely hard to find out what happens if Trump's interpretation is wrong.\n\nThis is like using a jackhammer to carve marble. His EO and plans to implement them have no immediate transparency and have already affected important federal jobs and nonprofits. \n\nI don't really have an issue of a liaison being there though\n but how this will be implemented affects millions of lives.",

                            "body": "The idea that some agencies are truly independent and free from presidential oversight is a myth. Yes, the President may only appoint officials in certain agencies and might have limited power to remove them, but that doesn\u2019t mean these agencies operate in a vacuum, untouched by the executive branch. They still exist within the presidency\u2019s constitutional authority, and their decisions, budgets, and priorities are all shaped by White House influence.\n\nThe term 'independent agency' is more about structure than actual autonomy. Congress may give agency heads some job protections, like staggered terms or limited removal conditions, but that doesn\u2019t mean the President loses oversight. The White House still controls appointments, budget approvals, and policy direction. Courts have repeatedly upheld that the President must retain some level of supervision, even over so-called independent bodies.\n\nIn reality, no federal agency operates in total isolation (minus perhaps black budget groups which I assure you will not be audited by DOGE.) The President may not be signing off on every decision, but to suggest these agencies act without any presidential influence ignores how the executive branch actually functions. Come on, dude.... They are part of the system, and at the end of the day, the person sitting in the Oval Office is still the one at the top.",
