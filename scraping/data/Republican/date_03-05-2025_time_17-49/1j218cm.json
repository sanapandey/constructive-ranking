I think the stuff should be provided, but it does need to be earned to some degree. \n\nIf you want healthcare, food, education, basic human needs, then you need to work. You need to have a job.

I live in CA which recently increased minimum wage. The local fast food franchises couldn\u2019t afford it, so we as a state lost many jobs state-wide as those businesses shuttered and in some cases, whole chains moved out of state. I don\u2019t blame them. So now those people have no jobs. CA is so incredibly expensive. I make a low 6-figure income, which would be a nice single income in most states, but on CA, I can barely afford rent, much less buy a home. So much of our taxes are spent on homeless/drug/illegal immigration services, which our far-left Democrat policies only worsen. Oh, and our schools are terrible.",

So in my opinion what youre seeing here is a past map of registered voters. I would say today it is even more red then when this was made. Nyc now shuttong down following la with its stores. Libs and their absurd laws ruined these places. Perfect example they are attempting to pass a law right now in CA that you cannot defend yourself during a home invasion. Not just guns but ANY form of attack or defense while being robbed or attacked in your own home and you too will go to jail. Wtf is even the point of this? When will the woke culture truly wake up?",

                    "body": "It\u2019s also clearly why the electoral college is mandatory. In rural communities there\u2019s a strong sense of individual ownership yet a real sense of care for your neighbors. People are friendlier, you\u2019re on a first name basis with everyone, and know each other at a more intimate level. You keep to yourself but aren\u2019t afraid to go out of your way to help someone in need. \n\nHowever in a city, there\u2019s no sense of ownership or responsibility because everything you do in a city has been outsourced to someone else. You don\u2019t own your apartment, you hire people to fix your stuff, your groceries come from the shelves in a supermarket, trash magically takes care of itself, hell you don\u2019t even rely on yourself to go places: the city is a self sustained cycle and you\u2019re just along for the ride. I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s anything wrong with that either, as any town grows you\u2019ll see more and more public services added to the roster and it\u2019s a nice \u201cluxury\u201d of living amongst other people.\n\nBut this comes at a cost: Once you get to a certain sized city, the concept of ownership evaporates. Basic responsibilities go from being yours to being everyone else\u2019s. And this collectivization mentality of \u201csomeone else will take care of it\u201d is why towns become blue after reaching a certain size. With no sense of direct ownership of your surroundings, it\u2019s easy to outsource responsibility to your community to local elected officials, who will happily enact taxes, levy fees and fines, introduce permits, etc. in order to justify the cost of maintaining the self sustaining environment of the city. \n\nIt\u2019s an inevitable fact of urbanization. So if we only had a popular vote system, then the people in major cities, who almost always have a collectivized mindset, would almost always win out against the people who don\u2019t simply because there\u2019s more of them in tightly concentrated areas. As much as I hate the term, the electoral college is basically \u201cequity\u201d for rural communities, giving them proportional representation to offset the hyper concentrated collectivist ideology that dominates cities",

Obviously, that would never happen\n\nOut of the 5 \u201csmaller\u201d states you listed, two (Vermont and South Carolina) are completely ignored during electoral races because they\u2019re uncompetitive. Another two you mentioned, North Carolina and Georgia, are hardly \u201csmall\u201d \u2014 in fact, they\u2019re both in that top nine biggest I mentioned earlier\n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but your argument seems to be: The voters in small states have their voices heard through the electoral college\n\nBut how many small states are ever actually appealed to by presidential candidates? Not Wyoming, Vermont, Alaska, the Dakotas, Delaware, Rhode Island, or Montana, the 8 smallest. Even the few competitive small states, like NH and NV, barely get concessions from presidential candidates because of how few EC votes they have. Compare that to a large swing state like PA \u2014 the main reason presidential candidates are afraid to talk bad about fracking\n\nI think it\u2019s a shame when voters don\u2019t count. Under the EC, the vast majority of small states voters don\u2019t count, like all who live in the 8 listed above. Same with the 6M voters Trump won in CA, the 4M he won in NY, and the 5M Kamala won in TX\n\nThe only voters anyone tried to actually win over were the six or so swing states \u2014 a tiny fraction of the population. The rest of us got ignored and will again in 4 years\n\nAlso, for full transparency, I\u2019m a progressive, so if you want to discuss this only with other Republicans in this sub, I\u2019m happy to shut up",

That leaves the swing states where the independent voters are the ones they want to win. Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and others are the prime targets with large electoral votes. In 2016, Clinton mistook her hold on Michigan and she didn\u2019t campaign there. Trump\u2019s campaign convinced enough independents to win the state and the electoral votes to win the election. In 2024, Trump was more making a point when he campaigned in California. He knew he wouldn\u2019t win there but look at the success, even against a California Democrat. The Democrats had two strikes against them. First, they did not articulate policies that would convince voters. They  relied on continuous name calling and trying to convince voters that Trump was a threat to democracy. I think that tactic got so old that voters could play speech bingo. Second, they did not have a good candidate. Harris was already a proven loser in 2020, not a single primary vote. In 2024, everyone with half a brain could see that Biden was cognitively impaired and Harris was instrumental in covering for him until he was exposed. It was too late for a primary so the DNC just appointed her as their candidate. No delegate voting at the convention, just a done deal. Take it or leave it. The American people respect the democratic process of elections. The DNC and Harris circumvented the system that\u2019s been used for decades. The DNC would have made a better choice if they had declared an open convention and had their delegates choose the candidate. The DNC was overconfident that Biden would be the candidate and scheduled the convention for the last possible time. Almost too late to have state ballots changed. Harris spent nearly a month after the convention to actually campaign. That idle time registered with the independent voters who want a candidate to articulate their position and policies and give them a reason to vote for the candidate. She spent a lot of money buying endorsements from Hollywood celebrities instead of shaking hands with farmer John and Miss Susan from 3rd grade. All in all she proved to be a bad choice for a presidential candidate. Is it surprising that Trump felt confident enough to enter the lion\u2019s den of California to hold a rally. Had Biden remained as the candidate, Trump may have won California since even everyone could see how bad off Biden was. We\u2019ll never know.",

The multiple states with few EC votes all combined will not win an election alone, even when combined states with similar electoral votes. It\u2019s the EC votes from the swing states that determine the outcome of an election. A candidate has to choose which state to expend campaign funds in. Does he or she spend campaign money in states where the reasonable outcome is already favorable, or does the candidate campaign where the election could go either way and try to convince the swing voters to cast their ballots for him? These states happen to be the some of the most populous and contain many voters on the left and many on the right. The largest portion of the voters in these states are independents and swing their vote from election to election, depending on which candidate is more convincing. The candidate can potentially have a positive influence to gain voters, others have a negative impact. The \u2018Never Trumpers\u2019 will never cast their vote for him. People who believe that Kamala was a DEI pick for VP and then for presidential candidate would never vote for her. Either way, candidates will go to the swing states to convince voters. A small state has a disadvantage in luring candidates since the number of EC votes is small.  Too small of a gain for a high cost in campaign funding. The opposite applies to large states where the presumption is that one parties candidate will win. Why spend campaign funds when the likely outcome is against you? If the candidate does appear in that state, it\u2019s more likely that down ballot candidates could use the endorsement.",

Our founders were not interested in a system where we had pure mob rule. Safeguarding the rights of the minority, those counties with 3 people in them? That was part of the design. \n\nAnd let's be frank. Those red states don't really have the power to force much onto the blue states in the current system. That is the beauty of the system as it has been. The threshold for truly advancing such policy is high. Blue states are still free to enact liberal laws. Our system just makes it harder for those people to force the red states to also have liberal laws. \n\nSo yes, those counties with 3 people might not be as densely populated as those blue counties. But that doesn't mean the people in the blue counties should be given the right to trample over them. And that is the real point of this map.",

Historically, ideologies undergo a major shift the further out you get.  People often don't seem to realize the sheer size of this country.

What you share about the EC is modern, contemporary ret-conning of the purpose of the EC. The EC was a practical solution to a few issues but in short I\u2019ll list them here in no particular order: \n\n1) elections were to be regulated and ran by the states, therefore there was concern about using popular vote for the only nationally elected office \u2014 compromising a single state\u2019s election process could ruin the entire election by say inflating the popular vote in that state; \n\n2) the EC was necessary to give southern state electoral power from their slaves (extending from the 3/5 rule think about how their labor pool in theory would *never* be able to vote so relative to northern states using free labor, a popular national vote would dilute southern power); \n\n3) there was practical concern about the time it takes to process the votes and administer the election because this was a time pre-dating even telegrams. But this is not longer a concern in a modern information era that we live in; \n\n4) the electoral college gave small states a bigger representation in the vote for president relative to the larger population states because of the fact every state had 2 senators. But note this does nothing to prevent cities from outvoting rural areas \u2014 it only advantages low population states at the expense of large population states like California, don\u2019t forget in 2016 Donald trump received more votes in California than all of the votes cast in Indiana (Mike pence\u2019s home state). \n\nThe idea that it was about big cities outvoting small rural areas doesn\u2019t make sense for that time period. They didn\u2019t have the same disproportionate population concentrations as we see today. \n\nFor reference NYC in 1790 had a population of 33,000 which included rural areas per Wikipedia (linked below), while the country had a population of 3.9 million. Today 8.8m people live in NYC and USA population is 331.5m. NYC is the biggest city per census records in 1790 and 2020. \n\nTo do that math for you, 0.8% of the country lived in NYC in 1790 while 2.65% live in NYC today. The founders simply did not live in a time where they considered the problem of cities outvoting rural areas. Unless of course you consider the southern salve-owning aristocrats who did in fact have a big vested interest in the electoral college. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_populous_cities_in_the_United_States_by_decade\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=us+population+2020&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS878US878&oq=us+population+2020&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDMwNzRqMGo3qAIAsAIB4gMEGAEgXw&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8",
