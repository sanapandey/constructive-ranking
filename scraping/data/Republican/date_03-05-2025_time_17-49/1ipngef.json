Certainly makes me think of being lean, flexible and agile, like a small business or startup. For a population of > 340 million, I did the math and 100,000 IRS agents are .00029% of the population. So it seems proportionally small, yet they handle a large volume of technical accounting (tax season) every year. I guess I thought it would be beneficial to ensure the IRS is efficient so the federal government's revenue can be high enough to crawl out of the deficit.\n\nBut now I'm curious to learn more from you about your perspective. Can you provide more context? Just want to make sure I understand even more, thanks in advance if you have a chance to share more.",

Then we could use tax revenue to tackle the federal deficit much faster than if we shrink the government revenue. \n\nOn a related note, I pay my taxes every year and have been fortunate to never miss my dues or have outstanding taxes to pay. But I have known folks who refused to pay their taxes for many, many years. As in, $10k+ worth in unpaid taxes. So what does this mean for me? Does it mean I should avoid paying taxes if others are doing the same? Not saying I would. But my point is, how do you manage this in a society where some people are cooperative and some people are selfish?",

The cuts to federal personnel are likely to weaken the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to bolster the IRS, though to what extent remains uncertain.\n\n>The tax agency grew by about 10 percent last year, as its ranks swelled from roughly 90,000 employees in fiscal year 2023 to 100,000 employees this fiscal year. The IRS has said publicly that personnel critical to the tax filing season are ineligible for the \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d plan that encouraged federal personnel to quit. That has fueled speculation that the cuts to IRS personnel will be concentrated among the agency\u2019s tax collection staff, which could reduce the amount of revenue brought into federal coffers even as Musk calls for a reduced deficit.\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n>\u201cStripping the IRS of resources is a windfall for those who like to game the system, and those are the most sophisticated and richest taxpayers.\u201d\n\n  \nHere,\n\n>Congressional Republicans are likely to welcome DOGE\u2019s changes to the IRS. On Thursday, Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Missouri), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote a letter to IRS\u2019s acting commissioner blasting the $80 billion funding increase for the tax agency, among other measures.\n\n>\u201cPresident Trump has shown in his first three weeks that he meant what he said during the presidential campaign. Our government has not been working effectively for the American people, and it needs to change,\u201d Smith\u2019s letter states.\n\n>Congress had given\u00a0[the IRS $80 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/06/inflation-reduction-act-irs/)\u00a0over 10 years through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, but[\u00a0Congress rescinded $20 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/12/26/irs-funding-cut-20-billion-shutdown/)\u00a0of that.\n\n  \nHere,\n\n>IRS employees cheered the Biden administration\u2019s funding boosts, which yielded almost immediate performance and IT improvements.",
