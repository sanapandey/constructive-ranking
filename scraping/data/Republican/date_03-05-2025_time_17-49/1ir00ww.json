His showing at the Daytona 500 is much more than his watching a race.  Just like it wasn't just watching the Superbowl.\n\nBelieve it or not, it is his showing the leadership of paying attention to things the public considers valuable to them.  It is his bonding with the people and is a proven and effective tool of leadership.\n\nBy showing the public he values what they value, he is better able to lead.  Some people go to class the learn such leadership, others are born to teach that class.  He didn't go to school.",
