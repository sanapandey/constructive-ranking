For those of you who don\u2019t know, medical school admissions is an extremely vigorous and competitive process. High academic capability along with other meaningful experiences must be demonstrated. The average cost of medical school attendance over 4 years is $240k. Should I be able to get student loans from the government in your opinion?",

I don\u2019t see an issue getting paid a high salary once training is over, living extremely frugally, and paying back the loan asap. Gotta do what you gotta do",

($1K+ of interest accruing per month, this is before you pay anything on the principal.) We have a shortage of doctors and medical professionals. Not all doctors make massive salaries, hospitalists, pediatricians, etc. are hugely needed but they aren't making as much as cardiologists, etc. The cost of education is no longer reasonable.",

In all likelihood, the result of that process in a free and fair market would be an interest rate tied to the earning potential of the resultant degree path and your personal credit score. I'm uncomfortable with the idea that the government is currently making it possible for people to get mountains of debt to pay for a degree that won't get them a job.",

Furthermore, unfortunately the job market isn\u2019t in such a place where a graduate with a music/ theatre/cinema degree is more likely than not going to be in a place to repay the loan. I have much more confidence in an engineer or a physician due to their average salaries to pay back their loans. I wouldn\u2019t be saying this if a music major made 250k out of college",

And if you do, you pay them back via public volunteer service.\n\nThe government should be investing in its citizens (education), and its citizens should be giving back (in form of taxes or service).",

I honestly believe they should put a cap on every dollar of financial aid unless the school agrees to some standard of pricing. \n\nRight now, a lot of colleges, even state schools, are so expensive that even pell and full loans can't cover them. I don't believe any educational institution charging this much should qualify for federal aid from students. We are talking over $27,500 per year. \n\nYes, you could take loans, pell, scholarships, and self pay to pay more than that. However, I think it is criminal and shouldn't be allowed to happen with our tax dollars. Education is so expensive because of the access to easy/free money.",

And, honestly be absolutely certain this is what you want, I also know many doctors who regret going to medical school, and some actually say they would have a happier life as an RN.
