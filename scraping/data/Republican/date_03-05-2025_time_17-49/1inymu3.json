Been seeing too many folk comfortably wiping their behinds with the foundational political structure of our country lately. \n\nApparently people think they\u2019re pro America while actively weakening our country, pro freedom while supporting others abusing their powers, pro democracy until democracy is inconvenient, pro republic until their chosen representatives need to be held accountable and pro military while ignoring the constitution those troops swore their oaths on (amending/changing it is fine, but straight up disregarding it or twisting its intent is wildly unAmerican).\nShameful.",
