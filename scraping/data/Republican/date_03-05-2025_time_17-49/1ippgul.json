He was the biggest shitbag while a man as an 11A, and as soon as he decided to be a girl, he became a poster boy for trans bullshit and was made into some kind of \u2018hero\u2019. And I cannot stress this enough, the WORST soldier I ever came across as a man. The absolute worst. But again, became a \u2018hero\u2019 when he cut his dick off.\n\nFor anyone curious, this is the shitbag himself. I can say without a doubt, he did it to further his career and save himself from being barred reenlistment. Because he was HORRIBLE at his job. Dude was the most wannabe \u2018alpha\u2019 womanizer weirdo you could imagine. 100% never acted feminine or anything of the sort. \n\nAfter he transitioned and became \u2018famous\u2019, his brother did the same thing. Both were unsuccessful officers and now both are successful because of gender politics. \n\nhttps://modernmilitary.org/2022/03/womens-history-month-transgender-day-of-visibility-pride-profile-maj-kara-corcoran/",
