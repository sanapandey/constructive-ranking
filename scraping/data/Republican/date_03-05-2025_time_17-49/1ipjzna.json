It turns out Trump & Musk didn't create shit\u2014Obama did\n\nObama created United States Digital Service (USDS) in 2014 to provide a bureaucratic patch job to fix the Obamacare website after it launched as a flaming pile of shit \n\nFast  forward to 2025, Trump rebrands it DOGE (United States DOGE Service) and keeps the acronym, keeps the funding, but gives it a whole new mission: \n\nto Find the Receipts\n\nIt is legally untouchable because it was already fully funded and operational\n\nTrump invokes 5 USC 3161, which allows him to create temporary hiring authorities\n\nDOGE teams get embedded inside every single federal agency\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Each team consists of a lawyer, HR rep, zoomer nerd, and an investigator and they all report to DOGE, NOT the agency they're embedded in\n\nTrump invokes 44 USC Chapter 35 which governs federal IT and cybersecurity oversight.  Since USDS was originally an IT oversight body, DOGE now has full access to all federal data systems\n\nFinTwit goes apeshit\n\nExecutive orders are written to block legal challenges, includes language that overrides conflicting executive orders\n\nEO orders every agency to comply, refusing means they violate presidential authority\n\nNOTE: congress (@SenateDems and @HouseDemocrats can't defund it because it's not a new program, just a repurposed one @TheJusticeDept can't sue for overreach because Trump used existing laws exactly as written @TishJames and @SDNYnews are trying to file legal challenges, but they run into standing issues because DOGE operates within existing frameworks\n\nTHANK YOU? @BarackObama literally built the perfect Deep State IT backdoor\n\nTrump & Musk essentially just hacked the system and took the admin controls\n\n@Musk now has legal oversight of every major agency's internal systems and the Deep State can't stop it without rewriting multiple federal laws\n\n@realDonaldTrump team legally outplayed the system and there's nothing anyone can do about it\n\nBecause\u2026 Obama created DOGE",

Except for maybe some of the potential cybersecurity problems we've had with the DOGE website so far or whatever.\n\nWhere does DOGE get the ability to get budgetary oversight? Do they need to be given that authority explicitly?",
