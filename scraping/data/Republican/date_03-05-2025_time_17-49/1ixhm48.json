If a position sites vacant for too long, it typically gets reorganized to fill a vacant elsewhere; and the branch that lost that seat almost never gets it back. \n\nMost individuals filling critical positions end up doing the job of 2-3 people, solely because it's hard to recruit qualified people into civil service or it's hard to create a second job to help take things off that person's plate. And if you're lucky enough to have enough uniformed personnel in your Command, they take on the extra workload but are wildly untrained in what they're expected to do and almost always fail at producing quality work.",

Trump\u2019s 5,400 DoD layoffs in February 2025 targeted probationary hires, those with less than two years who lack full job protections, not seasoned staff, aiming to trim untested personnel. Taxpayer money could arguably prioritize veterans\u2019 care, border operations, or weapons systems over sustaining every payroll slot.\n\nNew jobs don\u2019t always take an \u201cact of Congress,\u201d commands can reallocate existing billets or tap contingency funds, as SOCOM did post-9/11 with supplemental appropriations. And billets aren\u2019t lost \u201cforever,\u201d the NDAA has restored critical roles, like cyber positions in FY 2023, when strategic needs align with funding. Your \u201c2-3 jobs per person\u201d complaint? DoD\u2019s 2024 workforce assessments show key roles increasingly rely on contractors, up 15% since 2021, and temporary hires, while STEM civilian hires rose nearly 10% since 2022. If people are drowning, that\u2019s often on mismanagement, like poor billet assignments flagged in GAO reports, not just raw staffing levels.\n\nAnd if uniformed personnel are \u201cwildly untrained,\u201d that\u2019s a leadership shortfall, TRADOC\u2019s training pipeline produced over 180,000 soldiers in 2023 alone, showing capacity exists. Trump\u2019s cutting redundant overhead, not hollowing out defense, his admin spared border security and nuclear modernization from reductions. The DoD isn\u2019t crippled, it\u2019s just facing a long-overdue reckoning with decades of bloat, per GAO audits since the 1990s",
