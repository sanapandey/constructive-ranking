I can tell you that a lot of the compound bottles and/or SDS state some level of toxicity and not to injest. \n\nMy personal opinion is to take the ones that could cause severe impact or death and avoid the ones that wouldn't affect you or cause mild illness.

It's more of an option now than a flu vaccine. \n\nTrump turned the whole pendamic into a political argument. He was telling everyone that it's no big deal before scientists had a chance to figure out what kind of virus COVID is.",

Got told by ER nurse I was COVID+. I asked how since I had had it less than 3 months prior. When I saw the actual report I was showing positive for COVID antigens.
