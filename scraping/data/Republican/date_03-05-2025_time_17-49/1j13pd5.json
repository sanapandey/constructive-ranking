They all had breakfast with Zelensky. He got advice from Nuland, Blinken & Rice to go hard with Trump.\n\nThe WH had the mineral deal signing table set up with a planned press conference & lunch.\n\n\nTrump & Vance got Zelensky quite quickly in front of the cameras for the ritual humiliation, far to quick, in fact, for much of a discussion on why he wasn't signing.\n\n\nI think someone tipped off Trump that Zelensky wasn't going to sign....now bearing in mind Graham immediately fell in right behind supporting Trump & criticising Zelensky I  wonder whether he was the source that tipped off Trump",

President Trump and VP Vance were polite, patient, strong, and resolute.  They calmly laid down the law and demanded the respect America has the right to demand.  And when Zelensky defied their authority like the spoiled child he is, they imposed consequences.  \n\nAnd yet the poison of liberal indoctrination has made leftists incapable of seeing the objective truth in front of their own literal eyes.  \n\nAnybody who watches that video and *isn't* filled with patriotic love for President Trump and his America should lose the right to call themselves American.\n\nThe only way it could have been better was if CEO Musk joined in \ud83d\ude06",
