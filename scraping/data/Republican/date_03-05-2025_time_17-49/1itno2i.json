    "selftext": "There was a recent Trump meme that many of you found distasteful while others saw it as him owning what the left calls him anyway. I don't particularly like the meme myself, but if they're going to call him a despot and if he is going to keep winning for us, then I don't see much of a problem with him owning that \"king\" title as a joke.\n\nBut that is not why I'm talking about this.\n\nA user recently posted this meme in our sub. The user seems to likely be a troll who believes that Trump is literally involved in a billionaire coup to install a fascist government. This is a stupid take, it flies in the face of reality, though we should always be on the lookout for such things.\n\nBy the way, I was going to leave the meme up and just lock the thread, because looking through the user's history it was mostly benign, and then I found a comment that showed me who they were.\n\nThe user compared Trump to Smedley Butler who was involved in a planned coup of wealthy elites (including Prescott Bush - George H.W.'s Grandfather - this is true) to overthrow the government to install a fascist  government. Smedley would have been used to arrest the current government at the time (this was under FDR) and I believe he was supposed to be the dictator - What a name for a dictator, huh? He also railed against military involved overseas among other things. The comparison is quite faulty considering many things, like how so many billionaires are against Trump and for the Democrats. But the left, they hear \"billionaire\" and think evil immediately and then create conspiracies, and unfortunately there is some real history that acts as fodder for it. Look up \"Business Plot\". And while the history is likely distorted by the left, it is not untrue.\n\nAnyway, the user posted that meme as a troll. I am disappointed to say that it worked.\n\nWhile much of the thread was full of non-Americans, leftist, moderates who hate Trump, people who keep commenting in r/antiwork and r/democrats who will always come and start trouble, our own argued with each other with a vitriol that the left deserves, not our own.\n\nThere were two sides. Those who immediately trashed the president for this meme are the most noteworthy (but I'll get to the others). And by trashed, I mean those who completely decontextualized it, some with longer comments that were nicely written, and some that said little more than \"This is dangerous\". And this is coming from someone who is absolutely concerned about authoritarianism in any party.\n\nThere were also our own who sometimes feel like they are trolling with how ride-or-die they are for Trump. And this is coming from someone who fucking loves Trump right now, even looking past this meme and what I consider to be an error on his dealings with Ukraine recently.\n\nAnyway, there was quite a bit of arguing between these two types of our own.\n\nNow, the motive of trolls is not always simple. But regardless of their conscious goals, discord and fighting is the result. They either sow doubt in you as an individual or they encourage infighting with their tactics.\n\nAnd what's worse is that they often use legitimate things that we *should* look at to do so. I don't know about you, but I would gladly talk about that meme rationally if a fellow Republican told me about it, but if some asshole troll throws it in my face, I'm not going to want to talk about it.\n\nThat is part of this, that is part of why trolls are such pieces of shit. We can have such conversations and should have such conversations, but on our own terms and when WE deem it a problem, because you know that they see many things as problems that are not.\n\n**Be aware of these things**. This used to be known as subterfuge but now it is just normalized internet discourse. It's not okay. Temper your arguments, check suspicious activity, check your own use of logical fallacies (because these bad discourse habits are ingrained in most of us and we don't even think twice about it), and remain as civil as possible, especially when talking about hot button issues for us. The left is fractured now, they want us to fracture, too.\n\nLastly, it is a logical fallacy to disregard an argument based simply on the person who made it. That said, knowing who is making posts and comments and understanding their intent for bringing up their point is totally valid, especially when the user in question is just making a post and not necessarily commenting themselves, like in the case of the recent post. So when you see posts that piss you off, go ahead, look through the history of the user. I had to go pretty deep to find out about that user.\n\nI will post a screen shot of the taken down post for your reference with the user's name blacked out (that is if I'm not too boomer-ish to do so... I still use old reddit pretty much all the time).",

Notice that they chose flair that indicates they are a conservative when it doesn't seem they are. \n\nAgain, he has posted in the past about Trump being Smedley (according to him), he has free Palestine comments, he has said Israel is fascist.\n\nI would love to actually tell you his name, but it's not worth it.",

There was an investigation via congressional committee that eventually recognized the validity of Butler's claims on the matter, though the news cycle, once again controlled by the rich and powerful of the time, had moved on by then. \n\nAs a two-time Medal of Honor award winner, amongst other honors bestowed upon him, he was one of the most decorated U.S. military heroes of all time. He also spoke out against business interests of the elite influencing military operations in his book [\"War is a Racket.\"](https://www.heritage-history.com/site/hclass/secret_societies/ebooks/pdf/butler_racket.pdf) He was a true patriot and an exceptional human being by all accounts. I first learned of him in Marine Corps boot camp and then more through research later in my life while attending college. He is a personal hero of mine. \n\nI realize you were merely commenting on how some troll attempted to inject him into some misguided propaganda here, but I felt compelled to elaborate on this remarkable historic figure a bit more here as I believe his contributions to our great nation warrant the effort.",
