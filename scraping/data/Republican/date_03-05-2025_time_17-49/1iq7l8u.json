That is the left STILL trying to blame Trump for Biden\u2019s failures.\n\nAnd I hope people realize that the Biden failures are not really about Biden, but about the Democrats behind the scene who were really running the country into the ground.\n\nIt just shows me that Democrats, no matter who, will run the country into the ground if in control again.",
