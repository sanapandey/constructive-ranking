You'll find your question holds little weight when you remember you're posting to a right leaning sub and get answers that reinforce your own viewpoint.\n\nI'm active in lots of subs and quite frankly I don't see the need to discuss politics outside of the overtly political ones. I have posted about my political ideals in other subs and it's a mixed bag. My advice: keep politics here or on any other political subs and just enjoy life. It literally isn't worth it to get worked up into a frenzy about what the collective left does or says on Reddit. Reddit isn't reflective of the USA",

I wish it could be used to have rational discussions, but that\u2019s not the case unfortunately.  If Reddit represented the \u2018true\u2019 opinions of the American Public, we\u2019d have no conservatives or Republicans in this country, ever.  And not in any state or jurisdiction.  And it wouldn\u2019t be just liberal\u2026I hate to think of it.  But Reddit is bad, and seems to be twice as worse as the prior Trump Administration.  \n\nThe fact is (at the moment) what Trump has done remains largely popular with the American people, and resonates in some numbers not seen before as Trump has the highest approval rating he\u2019s ever had (granted it\u2019s only been a month but still).  Also the American people have the highest opinion of the country being on the right track ever (I think it\u2019s from Rasmussen).  EVER.  So he has historic numbers right now.  Of course it remains to be seen what the rest of his term looks like.  But yes, Reddit is terrible, but despite this negativity Reddit is projecting, that\u2019s not how the country feels.\n\nAnd also, contrary to Reddit\u2019s opinion (because I am one personally) no one \u2018hates\u2019 government employees.  I\u2019ve listened to prominent conservatives and read articles.  They (and myself even as a fed) think government is too wasteful and needs to be cut, as well as our government spending.  That\u2019s it).  But try telling that to Reddit and it\u2019s like talking to a brick wall.",

There are liberals foaming at the mouth lurking in these subs as well just waiting for the 10,000th chance to call a normal person either \u201cracist\u201d, \u201cfascist\u201d, \u201cnazi\u201d, or all of the above. It\u2019s what they live for. I mean shit, you can find them calling for mass violence, which I pointed out and got downvoted into oblivion for doing so. r/whitepeopletwitter and even r/pics is a cesspool of liberal hive minds posting and saying vulgar and violent shit quite often.",

I said my piece as I usually do, and I was banned, but I followed all the community rules. Reddit is for sure anti-free speech if you're not Liberal. X is the last genuine social media for freedom of speech.\n\nYou can say whatever you want about anyone at all, that's your right (as stated by the same person who banned me), but only if your view doesn't oppose the mods on any subreddit. Ridiculous. See the pic for a laugh about how hypocritical this person was.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3avrmh4vecje1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ebbce1d56a7cf153cebe4286f29758de1e42ab7",

I try finding the first non-leftist comment in practically every thread and it takes about 10-20. \n  \nA number of subs unrelated to politics have been overrun by leftist.  One I particularly enjoyed was discussing personal finance, typically under 100 upvotes on a post.  After the election it\u2019s been post after post of something trump did is a constitutional crisis, and how Magats are dumb, racists, and having regrets.  2000 upvotes.  No mods.  I ignore it now. \n  \nThe centrists and right get brigaded and downvoted just for stating facts.  I\u2019ve personally been falsely reported (the Reddit equivalent of swatting) on multiple occasions because I dared post something contrarian with evidence.  If it weren\u2019t for subs like this which are somehow intact, I\u2019d leave altogether.",
