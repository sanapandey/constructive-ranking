As if Trump\u2019s admin might\u2019ve been expecting others to be more frightened. When in reality it\u2019s almost half of their own country who seem to be scared. Without allies, USA military hegemony weakens, which although might be a good thing in the long run for a multipolar world (giving autonomy to other growing powers), I can\u2019t wrap my head around how are everyday American citizens going to benefit from this. Hope this comment doesn\u2019t get me banned, as dissenting thought seems to be censored everywhere nowadays\u2026",

The US isn't looking to source USA military hegemony from other countries - the USA has essentially been paying the bill to secure the world all by itself and will continue to do so. But in the past, Europe and others have lived parasitically off the USA, and this ends now.\n\n> how are everyday American citizens going to benefit from this\n\nAmerican citizens no longer have to watch as Europe freeloads on their dime, and they will keep more of their money inside their own borders. Europe has a certain arrogance about the existence of its expensive social programs, which have only been afforded because of America's security guarantees, and now Europe will have to face the true bill for its policies, which will include the bill for sufficient regional defense.",

If the economy slows, the government may have to borrow more, increasing debt. \n\nRemember JPow and his printer go brrr? \n\nPlus, if other countries retaliate with their own tariffs, U.S. exports WILL suffer, further hurting growth and making debt harder to manage. \n\nSo while tariffs generate revenue, they can also indirectly contribute to higher debt if they weaken the economy\n\nThe mere fact of thinking that any piece of this great puzzle that we call society isn\u2019t linked to the rest of the overall economic and geopolitical conditions is obtuse to say the least!",

In practice, allies often reacted with unexpected resilience and pushback. For example, when the United States imposed tariffs on close partners (like Canada, Mexico, and the European Union), those countries retaliated with their own tariffs and sought alternative trade arrangements instead of capitulating. European allies also worked to **\u201cTrump-proof\u201d** their policies: after the U.S. quit the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, European leaders pledged to uphold those agreements without Washington\u200b[govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-116SPRT44275/html/CPRT-116SPRT44275.htm#:~:text=%01%20International%20allies%20and%20partners,their%20dependence%20on%20the%20United)\u200b[reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/europeans-work-to-save-iran-deal-and-business-after-trump-pulls-out-idUSKBN1I90D1/#:~:text=The%20European%20Union%20said%20it,as%20Tehran%20meets%20its%20commitments).

U.S. tariffs and a narrow, transactional approach **\u201calienated U.S. allies and partners\u201d**, to the point that some allies halted cooperation in certain areas\u200b[govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-116SPRT44275/html/CPRT-116SPRT44275.htm#:~:text=%01%20President%20Trump%27s%20narrow%20and,the%20United%20States%20in%20a). Traditionally close partners started **ignoring U.S. objections** when they felt American actions undermined their interests\u200b[govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-116SPRT44275/html/CPRT-116SPRT44275.htm#:~:text=%01%20President%20Trump%27s%20narrow%20and,the%20United%20States%20in%20a). Many allies openly questioned how Washington\u2019s behavior under Trump differed from the great-power pressure tactics of strategic rivals like Russia or China\u200b[govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-116SPRT44275/html/CPRT-116SPRT44275.htm#:~:text=%01%20President%20Trump%27s%20narrow%20and,led%20them%20to%20halt%20or). Instead of simply acquiescing, U.S. allies pursued their own course: **hedging against U.S. unpredictability by forging new trade deals and security partnerships that reduced their reliance on Washington\u200b**[**govinfo.gov**](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CPRT-116SPRT44275/html/CPRT-116SPRT44275.htm#:~:text=%01%20International%20allies%20and%20partners,their%20dependence%20on%20the%20United). For instance, the remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership went ahead with a multilateral trade pact without the U.S., and European nations explored greater \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d in defense. These responses suggest Trump officials miscalculated \u2014 expecting loyalty and compliance, but catalyzing a resolve among allies to become more self-reliant and to push back against U.S. demands.\n\n...",

He as well as most French President's love creating problems and then solving them to look like a hero and will never not try to keep wars going despite calling for peace.  He reminds me of Chriac. \n\nIn 2006 during the israel hezbollah war.\n\nChirac at the UN:\n\n\"We call on israel to immediately end it's unprovoked hostility in Lebanon and demand it not attack syria.  The world can't stand by and allow israel to ignite a flame of destruction.   We will be drafting a UN resolution to consider sanctions should they be needed.  Israel can't invade a Sovereign nation with impunity\"\n\nHOWEVER.   Lol ---> \n\nIt was disclosed that on that very same day ---->\n\nJacques Chirac contacted Prime Minister Ehud Olmert via a secret channel and informed him that France would support an Israeli invasion of Syria, and would consider it a personal favor to overthrow Assad and occupy it.  In exchange,  France would protect Israel at the UN and increase military purchases from Israel and smooth things over with the rest of \"modern Europe \". \n\nMacron is the same way.   He's obsessed with keeping former French colonies in chaos.\nSo long as the Russian Ukrainian war drags on, he will be able to maintain enough domestic support to stay relevant.\n\nI trust Putin,  the ayatollah & China more than macron",

Because of selling oil to Europe and the Eastern world, they're better off financially than before the war, despite American economic sanctions. Their military production capacity is going full swing. Russia is also an enormous country with massive resources and population that can keep the war machine going for quite some time.\n\nHave you been fooled by media propaganda telling you that we've been close to victory these past two years? That's simply not true. Ukraine would have lost the war in a matter of months, perhaps weeks, if not for US intervention. We have poured nearly $200 billion dollars into this conflict with nearly nothing to show for it.\n\nEvery penny of that money is borrowed. America is already nearly bankrupt with 36 trillion dollars in debt. We simply can't afford to continue to bankroll this war which has very little benefit to American citizens.\n\nWould you rather risk a nuclear war by sending ground troops?",
