If we need a few points to the federal to assist with maintenance costs, do that. Just don't let them exceed like 7% or 8%.  \nWhile we are at it, return borrower protections too so that the threat of bankruptcy raises the risk to the lender and they are less likely to grant some 18 year old $80k over 4 years with a 12% rate.  \nColleges aren't really the problem in my opinion. They play their part but I see it as the colleges only responding to supply and demand issues. Higher demand for college education (backed by nearly unlimited student loans) equals lower supply of seats in classrooms making universities jack up the price to either increase revenue or turn that into more space to accommodate more students. Less demand would have the reverse effect. We just have to decrease the demand which would need to come from the workplace realizing it doesn't need a college graduate for every little position and for 18 year olds to either not be able to obtain loans to afford college or for them to realize they don't need that college degree for a good job (which is back on the workplace to remove those barriers).",

Had I known what my student loan debt feels like now back then, I would have learned a trade. It is insane to allow 18 amd 19 year olds sign $80k loans. \n\nI went to learn, I didn't party much or pick a terrible major, but it was terrible for me. I lived with it.\n\nI'm not looking for a handout but there are a lot of people like me who were not adequately warned about debt and who were literally told that we need to go to college and it'll work out. And the government subsidized loans basically guaranteed the loan. And the banks were happy to give them out because the government would honor them if we defaulted. \n\nI would argue these loans were predatory and wrong. I'm not saying handouts are the answer, but I was failed, and many like me were failed by our parents, our schools, and our government. \n\nIt would be nice to have some help in some way. Like why couldn't the government refinance our loans and make them interest free? Screw the banks that took advantage of the youth.",

Some of us were interns. I interned for free for a year before I started getting paid federal minimum wage, which at the time was only $5.15 an hour. Due to my experience as an intern, I was able to gain employment out of college, making only 30k in an HCOL area during the 2009 recession. I slowly moved up the ladder and, just within the last year, started making 150k, plus whatever I make on rental properties that I used the VA loan to purchase. \n\nI was actually fortunate because I joined the military and used the GI Bill, where they covered 30k of my college, but I still racked up an additional 30k in student loans. I'm still paying it back because I chose to defer my payments and racked up over 10k in interest. \n\nWhat I suggested isn't a new concept. When I was interning for the VA, I worked in the vocational rehabilitation department for disabled vets who earned benefits that would get them employable again. They were assigned a case manager and the vet was required to provide them with a training plan that would lead them to employment in their desired field of study. They would put together a package that would identify a suitable career path with proof such as job prospects that would make them employable in their area. Before the package was approved they had to do substantial research on their chosen career. This could be applied towards Federally backed student loans.",
