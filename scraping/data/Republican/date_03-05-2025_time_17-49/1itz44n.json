Since we don't live in an ideal society there are safeguards in place to prevent such leaks. I find additional surveillance(like the proposal above) to be authoritarian. \n\nLet's suppose the leaks are stopped with the new surveillance, does Secretary Noem repeal said measures or would she keep them in place during her tenure? If she would remove them after the leaks stop, I'd happily eat crow, but as we've seen with almost every government program, once they have room to grow roots it's very hard to remove them.",

The way they ask the questions and get the person to talk the polygraph taker can eventually give enough info to prove they are lying or telling the truth. In the documentary I was watching some people would actually admit to doing whatever they were questioned about because they thought the polygraph would give them away if they didn't. It was fascinating. Most of it was about infidelity cases but they said a lot applies to criminal stuff as well. With criminal cases they said they sometimes can get enough info from the possible criminal's answers (or just what he says to the examiner) to get a warrant they couldn't get before due to lack of evidence.",
