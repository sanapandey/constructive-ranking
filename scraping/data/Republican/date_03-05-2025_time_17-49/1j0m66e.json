It will be difficult for her to find a nursing job in the future, if for no other reason than the liability she faces.\n\nShe has also violated the nursing hypocratic  oath and, if reported to the state, possibly lose her nursing license.  Not to mention her malpractice insurance.\n\nShe is practicing discrimination,  and her employer could very well be sued by any patient who went to her facility, or now, by would-be patients who placed their health at risk by feeling forced to try another facility out of fear this person would not treat her.\n\nNow that I think of it, there are interesting possibilities for class action lawsuits out of this.\n\nEdot:  Fixed autocorrect error.",
