            "body": "The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 prevents the president from freezing funds that have already been appropriated by congress. President Trump has said that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional and has broken it (via freezing funding, closing agencies created and funded by congress, etc.) to pressure the Supreme Court to review it, in hopes they will overturn it.\n\nPresidents breaking laws to pressure the Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of laws is a common strategy for presidents going way back. Recently, President Biden did the same with the student loan forgiveness plan, which the states challenged in court and was found to be unconstitutional.\n\nHowever, the Impoundment Act is not new and has been upheld by the Supreme Court since 1974, although the current Supreme Court might rule differently.\n\nThinking about the downstream consequence of the president having impoundment authority. Doesn't the government essentially become a newsroom where the president is the Editor-in-Chief and has ultimate power over messaging? This being in contrast to the framer's view that Congress and the President should be independent and competing so that powers do not become over-centralized? \n\nSure, congress can still pass bills, but the president can render them meaningless by deciding to not fund them. And congress can't veto impoundments, so there is no longer a checks and balances for the Legislative branch against the Executive. It seems like this would further amplify favoritism, way beyond what currently exists, where the president's favorite districts get the most funding, and the unaligned might get none at all.\n\nThoughts?",

So the executive must spend money allocated to the executive no matter how wasteful. This is lead to the insane growth of the bureaucracy. \n\nIt was a terrible experiment that has cost known trillions of YOUR money. The waste must stop to save the Union and eventually the world.",

However, our Supreme Court is stacked to get things done in a unilateral way. If it gets to that court I don't have confidence they'll honor the law and will try to let Trump seize the purse.\n\nIMO impoundment is absolutely unlawful, Nixon proved that.\n\nNot to mention congress already fought and carved out the spending for the programs. If Trump wants to lawfully cut spending he should try to work with his party to implement these cuts during the drafting phase, and not after.\n\nI don't think his administration is clean enough to handle this power either, or any administration.",

Further, the president doesn\u2019t have full autonomy. He can\u2019t spend money Congress doesn\u2019t give him. But to force him to spend money he deems unnecessary, wasteful, etc, is, well, not a smart way to run any organization.",

I don't really understand why he'd need full control, that's not particularly democratic.\n\nTwo questions so I can get your thought process:\n\n1. What about the current appropriations requires immediate Executive action?\n2. There have been multiple failures these last few weeks because of his attempt to top down manage cutting spending. Including the link above with over 1,000 park staff being an example. What about this approach is panning out to be smart?",
