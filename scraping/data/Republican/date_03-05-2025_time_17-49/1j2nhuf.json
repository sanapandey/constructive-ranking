I\u2019ve never asked anyone their political views, religious views, or ideological views. I could care less, I\u2019m mainly looking at cash flow and collateral.\n\nAuditors are always checking files and looking over everything.\n\nFinancial institutions make money off loans, commercial loans have the best margins. I\u2019m guessing cash flow issues, or collateral issues, or slow pay history could be involved with those stories. But, you never hear the full story on why. \n\nThis also only applies to huge banks of $10billion in assets, so if you don\u2019t bank with a national bank, this will likely change nothing for most. \n\nAt the $10 billion mark a whole lot more regulations are applied to a financial institution in general.",

                    "body": "The only \"debanking\" that I'm aware of that consistently occurs and impacts many Americans is in the cannabis industry. Over 500,000 Americans work in the cannabis industry which is legal at the state level for medical or recreational use in almost all 50 states, yet these companies do not have access to the federal banking system due to cannabis remaining illegal under federal law. As a result, these companies are forced to operate in cash making them huge targets for armed robberies, and the americans who work in this industry cannot use their employment for any \"proof of income\" check such as to get a mortgage or to rent an apartment. \n\nDoes this bill address any of these concerns?",

I guess the senate wanted to keep the focus on \"federally legal businesses\" instead of trying to bridge the gap between businesses that are legal at the state level but operate in violation of federal law such as cannabis. I think this bill is needed but I don't really know how big of an issue \"debanking\" really is outside of cannabis.. like are people really getting debanked on a mass scale for being Christians or for having conservative beliefs?",

It's been held up in legal limbo ever since. I'm surprised DOGE hasn't taken a look into the DEA yet.
