If trying to persuade people to let other people live their lives the way they want is a problem for you I suggest you take a good long look at yourself and ask yourself how you would feel if you were in their situation. Use some empathy and sympathy for once. If you have to compare it to something you do and imagine people trying to take that something away from you even though it affects no one else. Maybe that would help you understand. You don't have to think the way anyone else thinks but don't try and take choices away from others just because you don't agree with it.",

Children aren\u2019t allowed to smoke, buy alcohol, drive vehicles, get a tattoo, and many other things. So why should they be allowed to make life altering decisions when they are children? Parents are supposed to protect and teach their kids not to do terrible things. Protect them from themselves in a sense. \n\nOf course that\u2019s all I\u2019m talking about. Don\u2019t make it anything more. And again, you said it \u201crarely happens\u201d. But it does happen! just like murder. It rarely happens, but it does happen. And of course you would agree. Murder is bad. And so is this. That\u2019s the problem I have. \n\nCan you and I at least agree that children should not be having sex change surgery?",

I'm christian and I don't even know what you mean by saying that. \n\n>How you twist freedom is what so many Americans are concerned about.\n\nThe definition of freedom is\u00a0the power or right to act, speak, and change without restraint or hindrance. What I am saying is not twisting freedom. It quite literally is freedom. To be able to choose what people want for their life which has no other negative effect on anyone else.\n\n>To what end will you convince yourself it\u2019s \u201cfreedom\u201d letting kids make decisions like that which end up having a bigger impact  on their lives than they would know.\n\n Every choice comes with its own consequences, good and bad. Anyone has the freedom to assault someone but the consequence of that is getting arrested. Anyone has the freedom to get a tattoo, the consequences of that could be good and bad. However when it comes to a personal decision like gender reassignment surgery it is up to the person whether the consequences are good or bad. They might regret it later on, they might not. I can guarantee you they thought about that and talked about it with their doctors, parents, etc. Keep in mind all those teenagers are almost adults. Even if they do regret it later, all we can do is educate them on the process and what it looks like after. Which is what happens when they talk with their doctors and parents. Even society teaches them what it might be like after they go through with it or if they don't. Some, maybe even most of these teenagers were born intersex. You don't know what they go through emotionally or physically. Either way you have no right to tell them they can't get the surgery they want for the betterment of themselves and their lives. All we can do is educate them and they can choose. \n\n>To what end will the left go when most of America don\u2019t agree with them\u2026 we are finding out. No more. We find that many of them have major resentment to God or Christianity in general.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many people agree or don't agree with them. Freedom isn't based on what people agree on the most. It's based on the ability to make choices as an individual freely, specifically choices that affect no one else negatively. Same thing goes for homosexual people. Christianity has repeatedly attacked people just trying to live their lives. Why do you think they have major resentment towards a group of people attacking others for who they are. God created all people right? God loves all people right? That means he created and loves homosexuals and intersex people. Yet Christians will scream in those same people's faces that they are going to hell. Or they are an abomination. God and his son would never do that ever. When God told Moses to write the ten commandments there was no commandment against homosexuality, no commandment against people being who they wanted to be. And if you think that if Jesus was here right now standing in front of a homosexual or transgender person, he would call them an abomination or say they are going to hell for who they love or who they want to be. I highly suggest you take a good long look at the relationship you have with him.\n\n>Good manifests but unfortunately so does evil, you can twist and justify these wicked things\n\nTo finish this off I have one question for you. What is so evil about someone being who they want to be or loving who they want to love? Reminder: neither of those negatively impact anyone in any way.",

Typical liberal moving the goal post when their shit post don't work. Go troll somewhere else. \n\nThe lawsuits you are talking about were filed by Steele and others that either dropped suit or had their case dismissed. That pretty much means that everything that was said regarding the Steele Dossier being wrong was correct. The fine paid by the DNC shows it was political. Also, the Trump Russia collusion that the democrats impeached him for was based on the Steele Dossier. Without that, it was just a political witch hunt. A sitting senator just said on CNN that we are having Trump Russia collusion 2.0 right now. It tells you how out of touch people are with reality.\n\nNot to even mention the FBI surveillance of a presidential candidate. Almost all of that information was suppressed before the 2020 election and even liberal Zukerberg said as much. If you believe none of that mattered, then Kamala would have won the 2024 election. People are waking up to the political games played by media.",
