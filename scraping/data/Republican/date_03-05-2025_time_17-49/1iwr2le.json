This madness helped fuel MAGA as well as compel many Independents to vote for common sense (which unfortunately they saw as the opposing side, which has no monopoly on common sense).\n\nNow the Democrats are giving much of the extremist woke left the cold shoulder, perhaps seeing what that alliance had fostered, costing them the House, Senate, and presidency.  Even Jon Stewart and his cadre are speaking out about the absurdities of the woke radical left and their rainbow fairytale illusions of life.\n\nI see much of the blue returning to Congress in 2026 and if Trump continues to support Russia and ostracize the US from the rest of the civilized West, the presidency as well.  The pendulum has a tendency to swing.",
