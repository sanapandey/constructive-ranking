I don\u2019t agree with illegals just using them to escape or evade police nor would I agree any protections exist for churches/clergy who break the law in aiding or abetting. But there is a long standing tradition and acceptance within western culture that a churches sanctuary is a thing that exists. Legally, no there isn\u2019t anything enforceable, but I think most guidance still says to exercise restraint when working on sensitive areas, which includes churches. This would reasonably preclude a raid into a church, but may instead mean a cordon around a church, with presumably the church providing religious counsel before those seeking refuge turn themselves in.",
