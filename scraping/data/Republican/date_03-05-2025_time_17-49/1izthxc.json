I'm not sure what FBI requirements are but for regular law enforcement it's pretty often. So many hours a cycle. It would serve a really good purpose to spend a couple of days every cycle or hand to hand combat tactics.",

Their firearms requirement is pretty minimal. It would seem having them spend time regularly engaging in the physical aspects of their job would be a good thing.",
