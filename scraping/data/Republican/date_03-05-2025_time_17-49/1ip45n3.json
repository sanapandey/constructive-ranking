Looking into if the OP is a concern troll. \n\nIf you haven't learned that the media can be deceptive in the past few years and still just rely on titles to form your opinion, then you should get of the internet and go outside. Thank you to those who challenge these titles.\n\nEDIT: In looking into this the user's account is very weird thinking that the US should ally with China and Russia.... very suspicious and banned because that is not a republican point of view and seems a little astroturfy...",

He is mostly implying that Russia isn\u2019t going to give the land up because they lost a lot of people taking it.\n\nThe entire NATO strategy in Ukraine was that they believed that Russia was going to give up.  Now that Ukraine\u2019s male population is severely depleted, the only way to continue the same war of attrition is to send US/Canadian/European troops.  The Canadians and Europeans have been bad mouthing military service for decades, so they aren\u2019t going to be able to persuade their young men to enter the meat grinder.  Maybe they thought Kamala would send hundreds of thousands of Americans to die or lose limbs.",

They have more peoples in Putin wants to keep the land, he should keep throwing his people into the blender until they finally wear Ukraine down or the Russian people overthrow him. \n\nWe should be doing only one thing. Telling Russia to retreat back to its original borders and leave Ukraine alone. \n\nBut if we do that, Trump cant justify trying to invade Canada to essentially do the same thing.",
