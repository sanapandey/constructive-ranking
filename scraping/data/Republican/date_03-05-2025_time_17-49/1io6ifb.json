So, basically the freedom I believe is the most just is: the government protects very basic rights like speech, property, and such, prevents violence, theft, rape and such, and protects the country itself by manning borders and having a strong military.\n\nOther than that, people should be free to do as they please.",

Freedom by my definition is the ability to speak, act, believe, and pursue opportunities to provide for oneself so long as one isn\u2019t hurting others.\n\nExample, in Michigan it\u2019s unlawful to walk down the sidewalk with an open drink. Why? Why can\u2019t my wife and I sit on a sidewalk bench with drinks while people watching? Disorderly behavior is a problem, but it\u2019s we\u2019re not doing that.",

Why are you late? Where were you until 3am? Where are you going? Who are you going to be with? \n\nThat is not freedom. I enjoy never being questioned about anything, it\u2019s a beautiful thing.
