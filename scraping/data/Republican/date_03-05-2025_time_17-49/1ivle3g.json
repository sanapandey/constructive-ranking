Even if you disagree with his viewpoint, the evidence he presents allows you to understand his perspective.\n\nHis writing is insightful and intelligent and his recent response to Nial Ferguson is a great example.",

The only clips folks ever share around are his DEI comments, haitians eating pets, and other absurd statements. Which is part of the territory of surviving the Trump administration.\n\nThese negotiations are being handled in a way I fear could be appeasement given how often Trump glazes Putin. However, I don't really know, given how chaotic Trump is if he's just reading the vibe of the room and glazing Putin for this negotiation. I know reclaiming that land is unreasonable, but if Trump can keep Ukraine intact it's a great start.",
