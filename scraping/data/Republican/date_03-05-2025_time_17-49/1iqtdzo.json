    "selftext": "EDIT: Based on an heavily brigaded post that gained a record number of comments for our sub in just a few hours and some of the comments I saw there from people claiming they are Republicans (the brigade was largely from Europeans, Canadians, and the left though), I feel I need to put this back up. END EDIT.\n\nI covered leftist talking points in the last announcements (and I'll take that down once it seems the leftists, trolls, and bots have abated for the time being), but I wanted to discuss what it means to break our anti-Republican rule, along with our Reagan's 11th Commandment rule... because they are basically the same rule.\n\nI'm going to go through some common complaints we get from banned users and how to avoid being banned like those users.\n\n-**I was just stating a fact. What, FACTS aren't allowed anymore??**\n\nFacts are allowed. They have always been allowed and even encouraged. But if your fact is laced with commentary, then it is not longer \"just a fact\". Here are some examples.\n\n* **Fact**: The sky is blue.\n\n* **What gets you banned**: The sky is blue, you fucking fascist.\n\nTake note, because many do not notice the subtle difference between these two comments. Many who write something similar to the second comment will frequently in modmail say \"I was just stating a fact!\" This is so common, it's not funny.\n\nHere's another one:\n\n* **Fact**: Musk and Trump are uncovering a lot of fraud. While mistakes are being made, they are also being corrected, and Musk only has the power to report findings, not make final decisions.\n\n* **What will get you banned**: Musk and Trump, man... these guys are running amok. I'm deeply concerned about how Musk is just firing people.\n\nDo you see the difference? One is a fact, one is commentary and kind of half fact and half untruth. Many users do not see the difference. Be a user who does.\n\n-**Just because I don't suck Trump's dick means I'm anti-Republican! I have been registered Republican for [X number of] years!**\n\nThis is one we get a lot. You must understand that we are a large umbrella. There are MAGA Republicans. There are Trump supporters who love Trump for this time in history but want to see leadership arise that is a bit more conventional as a leader and a bit easier for moderates to swallow. There are Republicans who absolutely hate the current president and the direction of the party.\n\nWe don't care what category you fall under. What we care about is that you show deference to fellow party members.\n\nIf you don't like the memes of Trump, fine, but don't trash people who do. And if you think it makes us look bad, I would just point out that the left has called us racists and bigots for literally decades and we took it in stride. They memed us in the media constantly before memes were even a thing.The character assassination attempts they did to Trump, they also did to Romney, to McCain, to Bush Jr., to Bush Sr., they accused Clarence Thomas of rape just like Kavanaugh. This is the left's M.O. and it has been for longer than I've been alive, arguably since before the Civil War.\n\nYou don't have to like the memes President Trump posts or that we on the right are making and posting. I don't particularly like them myself. But to trash fellow Republicans for it, without giving any understanding to the fact that the left have memed us and called us racists and bigots for decades, is disrespectful to your fellow Republicans.\n\nYou can argue it makes us look bad. But do so with respect.\n\n* **What's acceptable**: I don't like this meme and doesn't think it helps our cause, but I can see why people find it funny and find it to be a valid answer to what the left has done to us for decades.\n\n* **What's not acceptable**: The MAGA's who suck Trump's dick love this shit, but it makes us look bad.\n\n*I would say to all the users who worry about looking bad to the left*: I know you care about looking bad to the left, but how about looking bad to your fellow party? Comments like the one just above make YOU look bad to ME and many of your fellow Republicans.\n\nShow respect.\n\n-**[Insert Prominent Republican's Name] is a piece of shit! He's a traitor to the party!**\n\nI am a Christian first, a member of my family second, an American third, and a Republican lower on the list. I hope all of your have a similar hierarchy. Political parties are not the be-all and end-all. \n\nPolitical parties are tools to pool votes in a coalition to create a platform that a large number of people with many varying views can get behind and vote for in the face of another party that is doing the same with views we largely disagree with. They have value in the situations, but I kind of hate that they exist.\n\nThat said, being a sub FOR the party (although we are not affiliated with the GOP in any official capacity, we are just fellow Republicans), we do need to show deference to the party, we need to respect the party, we need to respect the umbrella, and we need to respect the individuals in the party.\n\nI am not a fan of Romney but I respect that he is a Republican. So if I criticize him, I might have a little fun, but I won't just trash him. **Keep in mind, would you rather the left win, or have a [insert Republican you don't like]?** In my case, I'd rather have a Romney than an Obama.\n\n* **What is acceptable**: Romney doesn't feel all that Republican to me these days and I really don't like how he keeps breaking from Republicans on so many issues, to the point I'd call him a RINO. But he's a strong business man and I'd take him over Obama any day.\n\n* **What is not**: Fuck that loser Romney. He's a RINO piece of shit. I don't trust him.\n\nDo you see the difference? One way criticizes while showing solidarity with the party, the other way is making it difficult to have any solidarity because it's so disrespectful.\n\nWe need solidarity. That does not mean we accept \"traitors\" if indeed we have any, but that does mean that we do not treat our fellow Republicans like crap. We don't throw them to the wolves unless it is clear we must. We don't cast them aside unless the allegations against them are credible. If they are indeed a RINO, show the receipts, but be respectful.\n\nMatt Gaetz is a prime example. The right thing to do was to cut ties with him, but not before allegations were credible enough (especially knowing the left has made so many false accusations before). And also it should be done with the understanding that a lot of senators and congressman of all parties have likely been in a similar situation but just haven't been caught. He shouldn't have done what he seems to have done and it's inexcusable, but it also seems like a political targeting. Both of those things can be true at the same time.\n\nWe don't jump down a Republican's throat at the first accusation of impropriety, we let the facts come out and then deal with it appropriately. Getting hysterical about it from the first moment would lead to us not having Clarence Thomas or Brett Kavanaugh on the bench. We wouldn't have Trump. And think about how many it worked on. It worked on Romney, it worked on Bork (look him up), it worked on so many others. This is the left's MO. They tried to get rid of Hegseth because of a tattoo and baby clothes. Don't buy their hysterics, let the facts come out.\n\nI hope this clears things up.",

I do not have the time nor the power to view every single article that comes into our sub. We work to restrict some sites that have proven to be quite dishonest with their \"facts\", but even good sites can be wrong, and even bad sites can be useful to talk about.\n\nThe way this is supposed to work is that an article is posted and we READ the article, we fact check the article rather than rely on fact checkers for us, and then we discuss the article: its veracity, perhaps its omissions, perhaps the bias and so on. Then in discussion we correct the errors or maybe point to better articles. That is how we get to a deeper conclusion. And that largely happens here when we are diligent as users.\n\nIf you want all articles that suck to be banned, we don't have that power (nor time) and I don't want that power. If you want every article to be perfect and without any flaws, then I don't know what reality you are living in.\n\nThe 4th estate only works well if the people who are consuming the media the 4th estate produces actually analyzes and critiques their media rather than just accepting it or rejecting it..\n\nSo in short, YOU have responsibility in all this as well. We try to remove objectively bad articles because of their dishonesty, and we try to leave articles we may not like but tell the truth. But the quality of the discourse is heavily reliant on the people doing the discourse. \n\nSo you should explain why and article is bad or good or somewhere in between. You should actually read the article and not just the title. You should see if you can find a better article if the one posted is terrible or dishonest.\n\nThat is how this works, that is how to be an informed citizen and not just someone that is fed what the media wants to feed you. If you just want to be fed, then why even discuss anything? We have a huge problem with that in the world today and it is hard to not just want to be fed (myself included).\n\nEDIT: typos and altered to not sound quite so defensive.",

That is not a safe space unless an individual using it never hears other points of views. There have always been clubs where likeminded individuals can come, but others cannot. And there is nothing wrong with that. It is always incumbent on the members of such clubs to make sure they are informed as individuals.

I think there are better ways to go about it, how exactly, I don\u2019t know.

I just don\u2019t think they are the best solution to the problem. By only looking at the drug seizure statistics, and comparing that which comes from the US to Canada, yes, that wouldn\u2019t be a particularly fair reason to impose tariffs, but there are more reasons as to why they did. So once again, I don\u2019t support the Canadian tariffs, but I\u2019m not completely against them.\n\nThese issues include lack of militarization and uncontrolled immigration, especially when we don\u2019t have very good border security at the north.\n\nMy original comment may have made it seem like I\u2019m against the tariffs; that\u2019s not partially true. I just don\u2019t think the are the best solution (they are better than nothing though). The reality is Canada needs to be held somewhat accountable for these issues among others, some way or another, especially when they haven\u2019t shown any real interest in fixing them. So how do we hold them accountable?",

They also haven\u2019t shown an interest in militarizing, which is particularly an issue due to the ice caps melting. They don\u2019t hold the military strength to secure any trade routes, especially with Russia and China as primary contenders there. They also don\u2019t want to become a US state, and haven\u2019t shown any intent to accommodate US military operations further north.\n\nSo in the end, i stand by my saying that I don\u2019t support the tariffs on Canada, but I also think it is a better solution than just doing nothing.

I just don't like the meme-like behavior that is coming from the current party because of details like this.  At face value, one would believe that fentanyl from Canada is a huge problem, and we need to strong-arm them.  In reality, Canada should be strong-arming us to stop it (if the expectation is tarrif threats).  I don't think the current method of negotiating with the world is the best way to ensure American dominance because it is going to push them away.",

The non-sequitur quality of their comment is intended to take one thing I said (that we accept facts) and isolate that little bit out of the entirety of what was said so that they can troll by posting a fact that promotes their belief that Republicans are fascists (without saying it directly... though they implied it much more heavily in other comments). \n\nThis is a common tactic of trolls. It's also a suspicious account, likely a ban evader. I like that you responded in a reasoned way, but it's best to just report and move on.\n\nEDIT: by the way, we often remove comments of banned users (though we'd generally and philosophically like them to stay) because users will often revise their comments after being banned as a final gotcha or to appear like they didn't break the rules.",

This is one of the reasons why I get annoyed with science, not because it doesn't give us great insight, but because it inadvertently (or sometimes the people in science do this on purpose) they assert a new reality when the older reality is true as well. In other words, it is true to say \"snow is white\" because it is . That doesn't mean that statement is false in another context. Snow is not white when you look at it through a microscope. Snow is also not white when you look at how light refracts and reflects through it and you consider that white light is actually all colors of light.\n\nAll of those things are true, but snow is also white. \n\nWhat you said is true, but the sky is also just blue. How it appears is not invalid. It is still factual. Science uses the appearance of things to help determine deeper truths, the appearance of something doesn't stop being true when you look deeper.",
