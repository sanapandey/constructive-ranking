Is there another source investigating how these funds were used? \n\nI don\u2019t enjoy seeing how millions of our tax dollars are being spent on silly programs. \n\nIf eliminating these programs brings suffering to people around the world, then that\u2019s not our problem. It\u2019s their fault for not having a developed country right? \n\nIt\u2019s time to help the people in America first. Do people think Trump should get rid of more social programs in the US too? No more social security, Medicare, etc? \n\nRun the government like a business, America will be rich and it\u2019ll help everyone.",

Emergency humanitary aid Im for (within limits). Preventative programs to teach and prevent future emergencies - thats where things can get messy in the details.",

Granted we need to get the fraud out of that. Being fat shouldn\u2019t make someone eligible. Multiple generations being on welfare starting at 18 needs to be investigated. I don\u2019t think we need to get rid of our programs, but make sure the fraud is investigated and prosecuted. But the silly programs abroad, yeah, cut that 100%.",
