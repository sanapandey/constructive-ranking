Because it\u2019s not just rich people who can boost our wealth who can come over, but also the not-so-beneficial rich people like mafia leaders. It\u2019s pretty unlikely, and the pros of this ultimately outweigh the cons, but worth thinking about",

Meant to encourage wealthy foreigners that are going to come here to create jobs and support US businesses.\n\nThis costs way more so it gives more direct money to the government but doesn't have those stipulations on investing in US businesses, so with a bigger initial investment we're just hoping/assuming that they will support US businesses when they get here. This version, unlike the current one, also doesn't require the immigrant to hold a US job.\n\nThis version makes it easier for bad actors to get into the US--feels like a downgrade because it strips all of the assurances from the EB-5 program just to get more money upfront.",
