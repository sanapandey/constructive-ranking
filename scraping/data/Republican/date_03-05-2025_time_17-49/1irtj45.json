The system automatically banned me because of my choice of words (somehow).\n\nI've noticed that commenting systems are also rejecting posts for using some of the favorite snarky comments that people like to make.  For example, the one about Mr. Sajak and his role in helping people get the solution of the wheel of fortune game tiles.",
