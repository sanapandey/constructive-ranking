For context, Indeed has this [Guide to Operational Auditing](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/operational-auditing) and it seems pretty systematic and well organized. When reviewing the guide, it makes me wish it was clearer how DOGE is identifying waste. On top of this, I wish it was clear how DOGE concluded that terminations would resolve the issue.\n\nFor example, in a business, if a project isn't going well, management will determine where to move folks to increase efficiency. i.e. a restructure. So I have also been wondering, if there was waste identified, could there have been a minor restructure to better leverage resources? How did we determine in so many instances that folks needed to be terminated? I'm not saying downsizing is bad 100% of the time. Just thinking about how it could be more transparent to the American public so it was clear what the North Star is. Otherwise it just seems pretty indiscriminate to me.",

That is what embezzlers and fraud artists count on, that nobody will check because it is too big. The WAPO essentially acts as the public relations/propaganda arm of the Washington establishment, and not surprisingly has a vested interest in keeping things hidden. The argument on immigration reform (despite only 1% of us crops being harvested by undocumented persons) is that if we deport people, who will pick our crops -- yes, some farms will be hurt, but that ignores the correction of a massive injustice, at emancipation it was if we end slavery who will pick our cotton, and yes, farmers were hurt, even some innocent ones who owned no slaves, but in order to solve a massive injustice. To focus here on the .000002% who might be temporarily inconvenienced or even upended to bring justice to a system that is so filled with fraud (while not wanting to report on that) is pretty gross, and pretty standard operating procedure for the Post, NYT and LA Times.",

For example, Washington Post, Fox News, The Hill, Joe Rogan interviews, Brietbart, etc. The benefit is learning more information about the same topic across sources. The main constraint is scalability - realistically, I can't do that with every article I read. But that's my personal philosophy. Definitely curious to learn what news sources you'd recommend, I'd be happy to add them to my list.\n\nI agree with your comment on immigration reform. While industries would be hurt, it would allow us to take the next step. Which is figuring out how to \"course correct\" after relying on undocumented labor for so long. Also appreciate the connection to slavery and how the history of the end of slavery raised similar questions for the folks that relied on and benefited from enslaved labor.\n\nTo your point, I would be curious what impact this RIF has had on unemployed federal workers. For example, foreclosures, car repos, paying for daycare? As in, what kind of issues do folks face in this economic climate? How long are they unemployed for? Raising these questions because it would be interesting to learn from a data science standpoint what actually happens. Maybe nothing would happen at all and folks would find a job pretty quickly. Which to your point would make this a very brief chapter for federal employees.\n\nAlso, to your point, probationary employees (200k) make up 0.0005% of the population. It is a fraction of the general population. I can definitely see how it would indicate that the issues the article raises are relatively insignificant. But I shared the article because it's a different angle on the administration's goal of shrinking government. For me, it's obvious that shrinking the government will save money. And it's also obvious that it will save tax payers like myself, money. But are there unintended consequences? That's what is interesting to me. Ultimately that's why I shared the article, to kick off a discussion and thoughts. So thank you for sharing your thoughts.",

But ultimately it's a gift article so anyone can read it for free.\n\nHere's one quote I found interesting,\n\n>The Federal Aviation Administration let go hundreds of technicians and engineers just weeks after a midair collision miles from the White House killed 67 people, eliciting promises from Trump officials to improve air safety, workers said in interviews. FEMA, which handles the nation\u2019s natural disasters, is preparing to fire hundreds of probationary employees, according to four people familiar with the situation who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The agency is already stretched thin responding to fires in California and floods in Kentucky. And the administration terminated scores of employees who work to bolster the nation\u2019s nuclear defense, only to realize its error and start reversing the firings.\n\nHere's one,\n\n>Internal communications from the Office of Personnel Management obtained by The Post appeared to tie the performance directive to Trump\u2019s plans. In a message sent Friday to agencies, an OPM employee wrote that, because of Trump\u2019s mandated hiring freeze, probationary employees \u201chad no right to continued employment. \u2026 An employee\u2019s performance must be viewed through the current needs and best interest of the government, \\[in\\] light of the President\u2019s directive to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\u201d\n\nhere's one,\n\n>Some employees said the proceedings seemed rushed, the details botched. Termination letters at Education listed the wrong job, or the wrong start date. A legal help number offered in a notice sent to a Small Business Administration employee led to the voicemail for an apartment building, not a lawyer. Some firing letters seemed copy-pasted from a form and left out the name of the agency where employees worked.\n\n  \nhere's one,\n\n>One Transportation Department worker found out he was fired on Valentine\u2019s Day just after putting his children to bed, as he sat down to watch a movie with his wife. An Agriculture employee discovered he was terminated the morning after attending an ex-partner\u2019s funeral. A Natural Resource Conservation Service employee was cut\u00a0months after the government paid $20,000 to relocate his family to North Dakota.\n\n  \nhere's one,\n\n>Luke Graziani, a disabled Army veteran, was five weeks from completing his probation year on Friday, when he logged into his work computer at the Bronx Veterans Affairs hospital.\n\n>Waiting on the screen was a boilerplate termination email citing performance concerns. Graziani printed out the message and took it to his boss, who was shocked \u2014 and promised to submit a request for exemption.\n\n>\u201cYou\u2019re critical staff,\u201d Graziani recalled his boss saying. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try.\u201d\n\n>Graziani, who is 45 and has four children, had believed until this weekend that his veteran status would protect his job. He served 20 years in the Army, first as a supply specialist and then in public affairs, deploying for two tours in Iraq and another two in Afghanistan before retiring in 2023.",

It's occurred across the country, across agencies, regardless of hiring shortages or resource constraints. Even the FAA was impacted, and we had the recent plane/helicopter crash near the White House. For context checkout these articles;\n\n* [AP News: Trump begins firings of FAA staff just weeks after fatal DC plane crash](https://apnews.com/article/doge-faa-air-traffic-firings-safety-67981aec33b6ee72cbad8dcee31f3437)\n\n* [CNN: Hundreds of FAA probationary workers fired by Trump administration, union says](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/politics/faa-employees-fired-trump-administration/index.html)\n\n  \nAdditionally, it seems they didn't consider exceptions to terminating probationary employees. For example, weighing if someone is a veteran, or if someone moved into a new role after decades of service. It's my personal bias, but I would at least consider retaining those folks because of their years of service to the American public. All of this gives me the impression the firings were indiscriminate.\n\nTo your point - I do wish there was a concerted effort to investigate fraud, waste, corruption within the context of lobbyists, bribes, etc. Those are the kind of folks that don't have everyday Americans' best interest at heart. Yet it seems they have even more access than any of us. I've been to DC before. There are so many banks with offices so close to the White House. What kind of message does it send about what our democracy values? Why do these corporations need offices a few blocks from the White House?\n\nTo your final point about national debt - I am also curious to see how these savings will be leveraged. For example, will it be used to pay down national debt? Or are we destroying so much, so quickly, that we will instead need to backtrack and put out fires that affect Americans' safety? For example, air traffic control, food safety, fire safety, etc. Not that I'm implying it's all bad. But ultimately curious to see how this turns out.",

This means that the act of creating and passing laws happens through Congress, elected legislators who are held accountable by their electorates.\n\nFor too long Congress has delegated its legislative authority away from Congress to federal departments and agencies. In theory, this should work as long as Congress properly provides oversight of the agencies and departments they have delegated legislative authority to. But they have not. Congress has not properly exercised its oversight authority which has allowed misuse of taxpayer dollars to occur and the passage of vague and hard to understand regulations by agencies has allowed agencies and departments to abuse the powers granted to them. Also, it\u2019s pretty clear from oversight hearings that members of Congress are more interested in bashing their political opponents and blaming them for everything instead of using that time to properly oversee and hold to account the folks they have given legislative powers to.\n\nAlso, Independent agencies are supposed to be insulated from presidential control, the reality is that presidents have much influence and control over them, meaning that Congress has delegated much of its legislative authority to the executive branch.\n\nDelegating legislative powers away from Congress to federal agencies and departments is also a convenient way for members of Congress to blame someone else for bad laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nPoint is, if Congress wants to make laws and regulations, they themselves must pass it. That is exactly what the Founders intended for when setting up our current system of government. Members of Congress can scream all they want about Trump having too much power, but for decades they deliberately gave the executive branch too much power because it suited their political interests.",

In that case, it seems the implication is that there are more RIFs to come.\n\nI agree there are definitely new rules at play. Folks who don't survive the RIFs will need to look for a job ASAP.

I even had to quit a job once without one lined up. Definitely a tough reality. But nonetheless, as you mentioned, we all have to just find a new job and make the best of it.\n\nI will say, to your point, sometimes it leads to more efficiency. Fewer meetings, less overhead, fewer processes. Especially for larger employers. It has its advantages.\n\nI'm tipping my hand here, but I admit that my spouse was a federal employee who was recently terminated. They helped investigate outbreaks from food contamination. For example, think of anything related to food recalls. My spouse was the newest hire in the last 8+ years. Everyone else (the 3-4 others, literally, in their equivalent role) had been there for decades. In part because it was hard to hire for that particular role. And my spouse was a top performer (captured via performance reviews, organizational-wide awards, etc). Knowing this, I question if *all* probationary employees were terminated because their roles were unnecessary.\n\nAlthough circling to your earlier point - I've witnessed layoffs where the most talented folks were let go because there just wasn't enough money to go around. But even then, it was clear that the plan was to save money by deprioritizing low-priority initiatives. For example, laying off the marketing team and hiring a consulting firm to save money. \n\nIn this case, my impression was that food safety should be high priority. For example, because of globalization, we don't have full oversight into our supply chain. There are so many steps before food reaches the supermarket, let alone our dinner plates. But I guess food safety isn't high priority? Or maybe there will be a new, more efficient way of doing the same thing? \n\nIn the aftermath, these are the questions I have. But ultimately I agree that losing and finding a job is part of life. Definitely unavoidable. Additionally, I agree that the bureaucracy and inefficiencies in our federal government are a symptom of a dire need for reform.",
