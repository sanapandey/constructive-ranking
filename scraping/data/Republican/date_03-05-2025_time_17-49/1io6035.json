So what did Musk or DOGE actually do? Look at the payments and call out a problem? Recommend a cut? Demand a cut? Would the acting director have been fired if there wasn't a cut? Or put on leave like the security for the Department of Treasury? \n\nThe public doesn't really have any answers about anything Musk is doing. He says they're the most transparent department because... they tweet what they're doing? He also said they post it on their website but that's just 1 line of text and an image as of right now.\n\nWhen they tweeted they cut contracts for the department of education was it them or the department that actually did it? Which contracts were terminated? We have NO idea. \n\nEven in your article here, it seems that New York was saying there's no reason to believe any funding stopped even thought the head of FEMA said so. Everything about this administration seems underplanned and nothing has been thought all the way through or communicated well at all. If I'm wrong about anything let me know too though lol.\n\nYou probably didn't deserve downvotes for your take on r/law, but this article still doesn't make DOGE look good or anything.",

            "body": "I think it\u2019s important to note a few things:\n\n1) Musk claimed $59m was sent to house illegals immigrants. The article also repeats this but also in the same articles uses the correct term of migrants. Migrants are not the same as illegal immigrants (and the article doesn\u2019t appear to make an attempt to discern the two), although both have been demonized to be treated the same. Migrants are what the Right (and Left) both say they always want; \u201cpeople to come into the country the right way\u201d. Migrants are people who are in the process of coming into our country the right way. A migrant is a foreign born person that is LEGALLY admitted into the country. That can be via seeking asylum, as a refugee or as a green card holder with permanent residence status. \n\n2) The money was not for \u201cemergency disaster relief\u201d like Musk claimed. It was for Shelter and Services program, which was passed by Congress in 2023 and had the support of both sides, Republicans and Democrats. Disaster relief is a completely different fund. \n\n3) The migrants aren\u2019t in a \u201cluxury hotel\u201d. They are in a former luxury hotel that closed down in 2020 and reopened specifically to house migrants. The structure of how Musk presented the information was meant to cause people to be pissed that they are struggling to have a nice home but these \u201cillegals\u201d get to stay in this \u201chigh end hotel\u201d. It\u2019s worded this way completely on purpose to cause feelings of dislike and hate. \n\n4) Musk used publically available information. He presents it as his team finding fraud but every bit of the $59m is publically available online. \n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of how the article presents its information as it clearly doesn\u2019t try to educate people on the matter but instead is more of an echo chamber pushing a narrative.",
