It is helping people FEEL where their taxes go. The government has made the tax system something that you don't feel, you just know you're getting this much money taken out of your check each month. You should feel it. It's the same idea as using a debit card vs spending cash, you will spend less when you use only cash because you feel it.\n\n>Doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s going to drive up inflation just like last time.\n\nNo, this would have a neutral effect on inflation. The spending is ending. Government spending IS inflation. However that money that would be coming back to us is not going to the debt to pay it down. This is not a negative, it is a positive, but it is not a positive for its effect on the economy. It is a positive because it makes people FEEL their taxes again as THEIR money not the government's.",

                                    "body": "It's true. Think about your own budget. Let's say you take in say $10,000 in a month. Let's assume you have $100,000 in debt. There are three possibilities for your household.\n\n* 1 - You are paying down your debt\n* 2 - You are adding to your debt\n* 3 - You are adding to your debt as much as you are paying it down\n\nIt's kind of a continuum. You could be really good at paying down your debt, you could be doing it very very slowly. On the other side, you could be adding to your debt just a tiny bit each month, or you could be spending like an idiot and ruining your life.\n\nAnyway, let's assume you are the neutral household. You're paying off enough debt and covering the interest enough that your debt is ballooning out of control, but you also aren't making any headway.\n\nThe entire $10,000 you make in the month goes to your subscriptions, your bills, your coffee in the morning, your food... everything. You put that money aside... you may not have spent it yet, but it is as good as spent because it WILL be spent.\n\nNow, you decide that you don't need your subscriptions to Netflix and Disney+ anymore. Let's say that's $40. You already allocated that money as going out, you are not relying on that money to go elsewhere, so you don't need to borrow money and add to your debt to cover some other cost.\n\nSo it is not adding to your debt because you have done both what you need to pay down your debt that month and keep yourself in that neutral position.\n\nIt will not hurt you to spend that money at this point. So you COULD just put it all towards your debt and become someone who is lowering their debt, or you COULD save it so you have some discretionary money to use, you could invest it and hope it grows and allows you to pay your debt down faster later, or you could spend it.\n\nThose are all decent options. Some would say just pay the debt down with it, that would be the smartest move, but what if you spent that $40 dollars on something that will benefit you long term? Again, it has no negative affect on your debt right now.\n\nThat is what Trump and Musk are deciding. Paying down the debt is the best move, but also letting people spend some of it will help people see just how much of our taxes are being used and it will help us feel what ending that spending will accomplish in the long term.",

They are not adding to the deficit with this money because it has already been added to the deficit. In other words, if I itemize all the money I have set to go out to all the things I buy in month: the Netflix subscription, the utilities I know I'm going to pay, the rent, the frivolous monthly subscriptions and food. I have set all that money aside to pay those things. But then I cut my subscription to Netflix and don't have to pay that anymore. I can pay that money towards my debt, or I can buy something that will help me. If I buy something better for me than Netflix that may actually help me further reduce my spending, then I haven't lost anything but a Netflix subscription. That money going to something else doesn't change my budget for that month, but it does change it for the longer term. \n\nIt had no effect on any payments I'm making towards the debt, I just put that money somewhere useful rather than something wasteful.\n\nThat is what is happening here. Spending beyond our means adds to the debt, spending in away that doesn't add or subtract to debt just kicks the can down the road isn't helpful. This decision would split the difference.\n\nIt would be like taking that netflix subscription money and using a little to buy myself a motivational treat, and taking the rest to pay just a tiny bit more of my debt.",
