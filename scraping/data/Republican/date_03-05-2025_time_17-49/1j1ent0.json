I mean, Russia invaded a country and fights a war in this foreign country without an UN mandate and without being attacked first. Even their official reason for the attack was, that they thought sometimes in the future Ukraine could join NATO, a defense alliance, and that could threaten Russia someday in the future just like Russia wouldn't possess the world's biggest nuclear arsenal. \n\nRussia definitely are the bad guys here and appeasement wont bring peace, it will just give them time to become more dangerous to the West.",

If they businesses or politicians try not to take the money they get murdered. See the WSJ article about how dangerous it is to run for public office in Mexico.\n\nSheinbaum is by no means a cartel member. But she did meet with top cartel members before, during and after the elections probably to keep her family members from being killed. Of course, cartels have their demands that need to be met. One of the most unfortunate is stealing money from public works infrastructure projects.\n\nIf the cartels are at least partially crushed I\u2019m assuming there\u2019d be less money bleeding and more accountable politicians with better infrastructure and schools. I don\u2019t think Mexico would change their political course significantly. Though many Mexicans in my experience don\u2019t trust their government due to corruption so vote somewhat libertarian and don\u2019t trust police etc.",

The US has always had military support from its NATO allies when needed, even if NATO as a whole didn't help, even when we were in ill-advised wars. The Korean war, Vietnam, the intervention in Lebanon in the 80's, the Gulf war, the Iraqi no-fly enforcement operation, the intervention in the Somali civil war, the Bosnian and Croation war intervention, the Haiti intervention, the Kosovo war, Afghanistan, the intervention in Yemen, the second Iraq war, the Lybian war, the intervention in Niger, the 2014-21 interveention in Iraq, the 2015-19 interveention in Lybia, the ongoing Operation Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - these are all wars and military interventions that we have fought with our NATO allies.\n\nSometimes one or other of our close NATO allies doesn't join in for any given conflict because they don't agree with it or they are in a crisis, but we always get support. France, often a bit unreliable, stayed out of the IRAQ war, for example, but are 100% with us on fighting Islamic terrorists in Africa. The UK, Canada,  Australia and Poland and many others are solid and reliable allies.",

Just like WWII, Russia knows China will turn on them but for now Russia is benefitting from China. And just like WWII, Russia knows it is not The US's concern right now. Both The US and Russia are facing the threat of China. But this time, because WWII is so burned into all our memories, we are recognizing the new world threat a little sooner than the West did with Germany.\n\nThe US and Russia will need each other when China moves. And ending this stupid war in Ukraine, even if all the blame is on Russia is wise. It reminds Russia who the real threat is (because the US will never try to end Russia, just contain it) it allows them and us both to rebuild for a few years before China moves.\n\nI don't want to be friends with Russia. Their leadership has been ruthless. But we are both facing an even more hostile enemy once again, and we will need to partner up for it.\n\nSo I back Ukraine in the sense that Russia sucks and shouldn't have invaded. But right now Ukraine isn't helping to really end this. Ukraine perhaps doesn't see what is on the horizon that is worse than Russia, or they don't care and the whole world needs to get themselves ready for what's coming.",

There is a conspiracy theory about Russia and Ukraine and that Russia is a force for good to wipe out the infrastructure of the world's elites which they argue store a lot of their money in Ukraine. This utterly stupid but the kernel of truth is that Ukraine is very very corrupt and harbors a lot of neo-nazis in their military.\n\nAnyway, a small group of people I think believe that. But then there are others who aren't backing Russia, per se. But they recognize a storm that is coming and that the US may need some help when it does. That storm is China. Russia knows that China is interested in world domination, that China's recent friendliness towards them means they are last on China's path towards domination. Just like Germany wanted everything in WWII, China wants everything, Russia included.\n\nAnyway, in not very long, and if China indeed makes a move against the Western world, we will need Russia to help us just like we needed them in WWII. I would like to say that the US can take ok China by ourselves, and maybe we can. But it would be much harder to fight China and Russia. Again, Russia knows that China will want to dominate them, much like Germany was friendly to Mussolino and Russia for a while. But China will turn on Russia if China begins to win in a war. \n\nSo we are in a position where unlikely allies may be needed. We will never be friends with Russia. We will never be allies like we are with the UK and Canada and all the countries who are mad at us right now. But the world is still turning a blind eye to the aggression of China, and Trump is the only one who actually seems to be preparing for it. Reminding Russia of our history during WWII, reminding them that despite our differences we fought off a worse threat to each other in Germany, I think that is a wise move in the face of the new threat of China.\n\nRussia is an interesting country. I don't see them as good. Putin is a ruthless tyrant. But they are not the same kind of evil as China. Russia is the enemy that you can almost count on to fight off your worse enemy. Russia knows we aren't here to destroy them, and that is absolutely true. But Russia knows China would if they don't play along with China, but Russia will never give up its sovereignty, it will never bow to China or any other country. That will be important when China attacks.",

But it\u2019s not like Trump can outright say that, unless he wants to be on bad terms with Russia.\n\nIt does largely have to do with peacekeeping and accommodation-\n\nZelensky has essentially called the Russian invasion unprovoked, that it violates documents signed by NATO and Russia- but you have to look at the other end of the deal. Russia insisted that, as part of the deal, NATO is not to expand eastward. Well, we continued to. Since NATO violated terms of the contract, it gives Russia, in their eyes, justification to invade Ukraine under the ruse of a national security threat. Ukraine has a very strategic position, and the border is pretty damn close to Moscow.\n\nObviously, what Russia is doing is horrible, and it sucks. But it is an unreasonable expectation to think that they will just leave Ukraine alone, give back all the captured territories, and cease the war.  But if the war keeps going, Ukraine will exhaust all its soldiers, and any foreign military support outside of equipment will be taken as a threat of NATO mobilization against Russia, starting WW3. \n\nA more realistic outcome (what trump wishes to do) is to allow Russia to keep parts of its captured territory in exchange for a ceasefire deal. Effectively ending the war. If this happens, Ukraine gets to continue to exist as an independent country.\n\n\nAnd to people who say the way Trump treats Putin is ridiculous- showing respect to nuclear powers and mitigating as much tensions as is possible is extremely important, especially in the case of a country like Russia which being on good terms with a single person (being Putin) gives a certain amount of what is essentially guaranteed peace between the two countries. Same with China and Xi xinping, it is in the worlds best interest that the USA, China, and Russia stay on relatively good terms. Regardless of how disagreeable and horrible their actions may be, it\u2019s not worth the sacrifice that would be the world, and so many innocent civilians of every country",

The alternative WWIII argument that is floated is that in another attempt, Russia will have learned from the last attempt and thus have the momentum in their favor. \n\nThis is why what Ukraine is primarily vying for is security guarantees, and not necessarily money. Money is key to maintaining the conflict as it is going on now but for peace, security guarantees are key. The fastest way towards a security guarantee would of course be to join NATO,  which by the nature of the defensive alliance is a security guarantee, but there are alternatives methods. \n\nThe ideas that have been floated thus far in the international sphere includes rearming Ukraine with nukes or a joint European military defense force along Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nWhat Trump was offering was a mineral deal with Ukraine along with the ceasefire. The mineral deal implies that by applying American interests in Ukraine, Russia would not likely try another attack. However, having American interests does not necessarily mean troops on the ground (nor is that likely in the interest of the American public) and in politics and law, anything that is \u201cimplied\u201d and not explicitly in writing can likely be exploited. If the mineral deal explicitly stated that Americans would protect their interests there militarily with ample force, or forces Russia to concede on something that would prevent it from rebuilding after the ceasefire, that would change this whole conversation, but rather, it does not have any real guarantees that will prevent another attack from Russia.",

If we think about it, Russia would not agree to any action that puts troops near their border nor will it concede the land it has currently taken. \n\nUkraine, on the other hand, still has enough fighting capability and promised funding/equipment (at this point primarily from the EU) to not give into any conditions that do not include security guarantees. \n\nThe proposed mineral deal does not indicate an American occupation in the military sense (which would suggest troops on the ground to keep order), but rather just indicates a joint economic deal to pay back the aid we\u2019ve provided plus some economic benefits that is explicitly stated to be reinvested into Ukrainian electric infrastructure. This doesn\u2019t really leave Ukraine with any extra protections than before this conflict started. Any extra economic benefits would likely to go towards reconstruction rather than defense anyways.\n\nUltimately, it seems like the two conditions from both countries are fundamentally incompatible. Unless one of these positions changes, a peace deal is likely not possible.",

He wants nothing more than to reclaim satellite puppet states and become a hegemony again.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean people want the US involved to the level we are. When Russia seized Crimea in 2014, Europe should have taken it as a wake-up call that Putin is *not and never will be* accepting of the status quo and the rules-based international order. Instead, european leadership continued to allow Russia to ingraine itself more into their energy economy, and  countires like Germany decommissioned their nuclear power for the sake of virtue signaling all while the US clapped in support. \n\nNow, Russia launches an attack, albeit one they thought was going to be a fait accompli that takes Kyiv and ends in days, but they get to hold the majority of the European economy hostage. This is post COVID as well, so the economy is already struggling.\n\nDo I think the US should stand up for a country being unilaterally attacked without real provocaton? Yup. \n\nI agree that the harsh language I sometimes see towards Ukraine and its leadership is baffling to me. That should be directed at European leadership, and the US contributions to Ukraines' defense should come with future European security agreements and a slow drawdown while other countries step up. I get that the US is by far the leader in ready-to-use military equipment and technology, but we've been supporting this war for 3 years. All of Europe, especially NATO countries, should have spun up their own industrial defense base by now and started fully supplying weapons to Ukraine. Or, even better, they would have already had it in place to begin with.",

Please explain why trump was in the wrong taking into account half the money we provided the Ukrainian people in aid is missing and while your at it explain why Obama made biden liason  to Ukraine and why hunter in all his faults was ceo of burisma an energy company that was predominantly a natural gas company but also touted a nack for \"exploration\" and Ukraine just so happens to have a surplus of rare earth minerals lithium being one and which country has the highest manufacturing rate of electric cars china at the time sooo... now the emails from the Ccp and the millions transferred make sense, right? remember paying the big guy? And it was still happening into the biden administration this is why America left Afghanistan like we did and failed the people that literally risked they're necks to help us fight the taliban who took the lives of all of those people on 9/11 now we leave the Afghan people to the sharks and they died American citizens were taken prisoner innocents were beheaded in the streets and gunned down in their own homes because they helped us fight the monsters under they're bed. They were so scared they tried to hang on to military planes as they took off. Watch the video if you wanna see them fall to their deaths , it's not pretty. Not only did we abandon them we left 7 billion in military equipment and assists for the terrorist group to utilize in the murder of thousands of people 70,000 military and police plus nearly 50,000 civilians men women and children. But why? Why did we drop everything and just leave? Because Russia said, \"Ukraine, do not allow nato to put military bases on the Russian border.\" That's like Mexico letting north Korea or iran build bases in Sonora, Chihuahua, and coahuila. America would not stand for that, and neither did Russia. At the June 2021 Brussels summit, NATO leaders reiterated the statement made at the 2008 Bucharest summit that Ukraine would eventually join NATO. In late 2021, there was another massive Russian military buildup around Ukraine. This is when we dropped Afghanistan and began a proxy war backing Ukraine, but why? Boundaries were set agreements were made and then broken. It all comes back to the money now that this step had been made by Russia our politicians now have a reason to funnel taxpayer dollars to Ukraine in \"aid\" ok ok Ukraine was warned not to threatened Russia with nato military force and things where spiraling in that direction so putin acted first and our politicians took the opportunity to aid Ukraine and line their own pockets the kick back baby how much do you think our politicians took for every billion we gave them while simultaneously protecting corn pops rare earth meal ticket hence the evacuation of Afghanistan now zalenski has the gall to demand more aid? Especially since half of what we sent is missing? No, our president and vp were not having any of it.
