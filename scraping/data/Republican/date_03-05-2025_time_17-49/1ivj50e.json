If they are all in DC, they are far more susceptible to the Democrat power structure they've created over the decades. Breaking up these administrations breaks up that power and makes it harder for any party to have control over them, which makes them more likely to just do what they were designed to do.",

Lots of scam victims, but also a few people asking about directed energy weapons, cavity searches, and microchip implants.",

The International Operations Division of the FBI is based in D.C. and they oversee the legal attach\u00e9 program. According to fbi.org, this program\u2019s purpose \u201cis to establish and maintain liaison with principal law enforcement and security services in designated foreign countries. This liaison enables the FBI to effectively and expeditiously conduct its responsibilities in combating international terrorism, organized crime, cyber crime, and general criminal matters. In particular, legat liaison activities are essential to the successful fulfillment overseas of the FBI\u2019s lead federal law enforcement mission to prevent terrorist attacks against citizens and interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nPatel emphasized he would like to revert the FBI\u2019s focus to traditional law enforcement. So I think it\u2019s likely he\u2019s repurposing positions in DC to focus more on domestic issues. I welcome any other speculations or sources stating otherwise!",
