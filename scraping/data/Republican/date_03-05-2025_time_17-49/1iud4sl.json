Do they not realize billionaires would owe billions in capital gains if they pursued any liquidity?\n\nHow are they rationalizing Republicans as being the source of national debt when they approved all these spending bills, and lost billions of dollars during COVID as evidenced by the house oversight committee?\n\nWhy are they so opposed to DOGE then - and not giving any alternatives, or commenting on 200 year olds getting social security?\n\nMy frustration with politicians is really ramping up lately, and its also making me realize just how little most people are able to think for themselves",

While misguided they have a point that commerce is something we should be more aware of, billionaires price out most fair competition. Us not having effective antitrust movements is why we have people like Musk can exist.\n\nDOGE is an unknown in its current form and the democrats are doing the same turtling all these career politicians do. Set up some talking point defense and hide behind them when we don't get what we want. The budget stalling has me up a wall because I don't want a government shutdown as the 'cherry' on top of our 'Trump milkshake.'\n\nI want to see how the lawsuits pan out the next few weeks, because that will help slow the pace I think.

My perspective is to do business in America you essentially are aware and are willing to eat that price on your profits because you can be a self-made (always extremely luck-based) billionaire. With how complicated our tax code is I get pretty frustrated that Billionaires essentially have to shield their money and have the power to get effective tax rates down. Meaning they can deflect back to, \"they're not even spending the money the way I want.\" Even though they're rich enough they don't have to sell or even live in America if they don't like it.\n\nWhich now makes it a class issue and can be a critique of capitalism, and anyone can shoehorn socialist arguments, and that's about where I get a migraine.\n\nI understand why they have to do it, like you said, \"make more take more\" is the motivator behind wanting to shield their capital; causing wage suppression across all sectors. Unless we want to dissolve the union we need federal checks and balances, which hurts to say as a libertarian. I think the best thing we can do is use our voices.\n\nTalk to the people in your life about their beliefs and understand how that interfaces with your positions. Then join a party or community to get everyone involved, because the less willing we become to participate in democracy, the more appealing populism becomes. Then we get all sorts of regimes, and that ain't American to me.\n\nSide-note, have a great weekend!",
