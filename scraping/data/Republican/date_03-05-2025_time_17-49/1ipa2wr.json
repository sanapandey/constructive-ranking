    "selftext": "I can not understand how people aren't screaming to uncover more of this wasteful and sometimes fraudulent spending. Why are we not all, EVERY TAX PAYING CITIZEN, breaking down our local politician's doors (metaphorically), asking what they knew and whether they profited from this? We should be demanding answers on how this type of spending was allowed to go on for years and, in some cases, DECADES. Trump turned the spotlight on these corrupt politicians and they are scurrying around like the cockroaches that they are. Democrats and Republicans. WE DEMAND ANSWERS AND REPERCUSSIONS!!!!! Watergate was a grain of sand compared to this mountain of a scandal. The worst part is that so many are listening to the left's chants and falling for it when the evidence is right there in black and white!!!!!! We need to DEMAND that those responsible and/or complicit in this scandal are punished criminally and civilly. Ask why a politician making $174,000 a year becomes a multimillionaire in 5 years. Do not let them slither away without being held accountable!",

The saddest thing, the politicians that benefitted will not have to get rid of anything they got with the rotten money... And Mr tax payer is still in the hook for it.\n\nPlus, you don't wanna take money away from  _______.   The ones in power don't wanna lose their cash cow, so they spew out blatant lies to get the public riled up (as well as bots all over every social media platform pushing the narrative (especially in this left leaning cesspool called reddit)\n\nAnd in 100 years, who will care anyways",

Instead of, we spent $X billion on thong underwear for men in India to bar dance, we should say 2.6 million (the population of Chicago) people had all their tax money go to it.  I believe it makes it more personal and, I think, makes folks think a bit more about how much money went out the door especially when the point is made that it was YOUR money. I don't feel like enough people realize the government's money is YOUR money and large abstract numbers muddy it even further.",
