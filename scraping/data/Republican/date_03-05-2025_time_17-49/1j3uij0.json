The title and the substance are completely different. \n\nIf Democrats introduced a bill with the same name but it declared Trans people can compete with whatever gender they choose, it wouldn't mean that you don't support women just because you opposed the \"Protecting and Respecting Woman Act\". \n\nImagine this picture being posted in a Democrat sub after the above scenario and someone leaves the same comment as you, what would you even say to that? This picture isn't the slam dunk you think it is lol.\n\nIk conservative subs have been purged of any non MAGA user so I'm sure I'm next but seriously use your brains guys. This is on the same level of logic where someone would argue that the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be democratic or the National Socialists must have been socialist.",

That\u2019s where the issue arises. For those impacted it can hurt their chances at playing professionally and not only that it hurts their own confidence. Which as a society, we\u2019ve always commented, we want to uplift women. Trans athletes playing in women\u2019s sports breaks that for those who are affected.\n\nTo use the language of the left to show how twisted this all gets. How do \u201csafe spaces\u201d for females continue to flourish, if they are being invaded by males who \u201cidentify\u201d as females?\n\nAlso, there is the possibility that a biological male can hurt a female in competitive sports. Which has happened already. If you saw the speech tonight.\n\nPoint is, Democratic leaders want to die on this hill because they think optically it\u2019s more important to maintain their current optics and the LGBTQA++ vote (and their supporters) than actually protect female athletes. Remember, there are other \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d (like abortion rights) that they still have a foothold on.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough issue, because women were treated as a minority for so long. And now, a fringe minority (of ironically biological men) wants to be treated \u201cequally\u201d as another group that, even today, feels they are still a societal minority themselves. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a very conflictual situation.",
