The fact that the DSM, the very foundation of psychiatric diagnosis, underwent a deliberate shift in how it classifies and understands gender-related distress proves that mental health professionals have been actively involved in shaping this issue.\n\nThe most telling change is the replacement of Gender Identity Disorder with Gender Dysphoria. That wasn\u2019t just a new label. It is a fundamental redefinition by the mental health field. Previously, the diagnosis suggested that the very state of being transgender was a disorder. With DSM-5, it affirmed that a misalignment is possible (which is bullshit) and moved the focus to the distress that can accompany a misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and assigned sex at birth. That is absolutely an intentional decision to move away from pathologizing identity itself and instead address the mental health challenges that arise from societal, personal, or medical struggles related to gender. So yes, the mental health industry is very involved and sold out.\n\nThis completely changes and influences how therapists approach gender-questioning patients, how medical professionals provide care, and how institutions consider gender in a broader sense. If the mental health field were neutral or uninvolved, these changes wouldn\u2019t have happened. The industry has taken a biased stance and redefined the framework.",

I am here to learn, not preach, but I will answer question. \n\nI am also very sympathetic to libertarian views. I don't call myself one, mostly because I'm not a fan of the US libertarian party, but my core beliefs are very much founded on individual liberty and freedom from oppression. \n\n> I'm curious how your position differs from mine and if you can talk me into being on your side\n\nLet me describe my position through an example.\n\nI have blue eyes. I was born with blue eyes. I'm guessing it's a genetic trait that I inherited from my blue eyed parents. \n\nBut, if I got surgery to somehow dye my eyes brown, what should my drivers license say? I think the answer is obvious: it should say brown. The purpose of a drivers license is to provide identifiable characteristics of a person, that's it. It is not a genetic record or a prescription of who the government considers me to be. \n\nBut that's kind of a weak point. The stronger point I would make is that the government has no right to dictate what they consider me to be. It might be the governments position that if I am genetically blue eyed, I need to tell them that and \"be honest\" about it, but I would strong disagree. They neither have the right to prescribe what \"blue eyed\" means, beyond what is useful for visually identifying me, nor should they have the right to know my medical history or genetics if I don't want them too. \n\n\nSimilarly, the government neither has the right to prescribe what makes someone a man or woman, nor should they even have the right to look inside their pants. If a person always has brown eyes, tells people they have brown eyes, lives as a brown eyed person, they are a brown eyed person as far as the government knows. If a person tells people they are a women, lives as a women, they are a women as far as the government knows. The government exists to fulfill useful functions, in the case of a DL, it is to provide identifying documents. That's it. The government does not get to say who the individual is, it is only there to provide information to an individual's outward presentation. \n\nEveryone may have their own personal beliefs as to what constitutes a man or women, I don't care, but the private details of a person's life are their owns.",

It doesn't matter what makes a blue-eyed person a blue-eyed person for the purpose of an ID, and I don't care what the government thinks about that. The government should only be doing things that fulfill practical purposes for running a country. \n\nIn the case of eye color on a DL, the purpose is for strangers to be able to ID you. If your eyes appear brown, the DL should say brown. Not because philosphers or scientists think your eyes are brown, but because that is the pertinent information a border agent needs.\n\n>What if you get stopped crossing the border, because your birth certificate says blue eyes and your passport says blue eyes but your eyes are clearly brown? Is that an unreasonable stop? Whose fault is it?\n\nIf my eyes appear brown, and I tell the government they are brown, but the passport office puts blue down cause they checked my medical records and saw I was born with blue eyes, then in my eyes that's government incompetence and overreach. It's not the boarder agent's fault or my fault, it's the  passport office's fault for being run in a non-productive manner. \n\n>Can I digress for a minute? ... FASCINATING question, thank you for the analogy. I'm totally curious to hear your response.\n\nSure, and I'm glad the question is interesting to both of us. I'll respond to your questions with my opinions. I think they are interesting as well. \n\n>Philosophical (NOT legal) question: Is this an eye color problem that will be easily fixed after the surgery? Or do we think there is some other unmet emotional need that is presenting as an eye color problem?\n\nIt's an interesting question but if someone says, and continues to say, the change was good for them, I am not sure how I could disprove that. I suppose that psychologists could study them, but ultimately only one person can see in their mind. \n\n>Legal question: Is it up to the government to make laws around this issue to prevent people from trying to solve their emotional problems by changing their eye color?\n\nI don't think so. I don't believe the governments job is to \"parent\" it's citizens. Even if it is self destructive, people have the right to be self destructive. \n\n>If you are aged 12 and we decide you can't have the surgery until 25, should other people who can clearly see that your eyes are blue be forced to refer to you as \"the brown-eyed Fmeson\" or else be labeled as broweyephobic?\n\nNo one should be forced to say anything they don't want to say per freedom of speech. However, on the flip side, if other people want to call someone else \"broweyephobic\", that is also their right per freedom of speech.",

As you can imagine, this has been very difficult. The parents, for now, are raising this child as a boy, but his hormones are different than the average boy and this could be an issue as he gets older. There is a chance he will need gender affirming care, and who knows how he will feel about it once he is old enough to make decisions? Again, this is a very small percentage of people who have to deal with this, but it doesn't make his child a bad person or a freak. It's how he was born. I know this is technically different from trans, but my point is, I guess, that you never know from looking at someone what they are dealing with. Does his child deserve any less opportunity in life because of how he was born?",
