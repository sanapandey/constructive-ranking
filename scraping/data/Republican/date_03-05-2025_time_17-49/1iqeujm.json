We will happily take the win and Vance can be the next republican president, or some other good Republican choice.\n\nWow.\n\nIt's starting to get creepy, though. Is there something seriously mentally wrong with these people? Like, we all know they're not mentally okay, but this is SEVERE delusion.",

Sit in their home and surround themselves with like minded people and don\u2019t experience anything. They are sad, pathetic, lonely people who seek attention and acceptance on social media to even just feel the slightest emotion.",
