It's essentially a consulting firm (may fall under the \"Reuters\" umbrella, but a different business.\n\n\n2. The AESD program was brought about in 2017 by the DoD to help the US develop strategy to combat social engineering attempts by foreign countries.\n\n\nI do think it's worthwhile to look at the spending because it was a failed program; we spent millions on this and let a Chinese app's algorithm generate a huge social engineering risk right under our nose.\u00a0 So in that regard we should question what the money was actually spent on, but it's not as nefarious as it's made out to be.",
