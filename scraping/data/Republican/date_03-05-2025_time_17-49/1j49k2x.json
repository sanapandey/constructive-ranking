An initial survey was conducted by YouGov between February 28- March 3, 2025 using a nationally representative sample of 11,406 U.S. adults, including 4,131 respondents who planned to watch the address. Respondents who planned to watch the speech were asked if they were willing to be reinterviewed. Only those who watched the speech were included in the analysis.*\n\n*The initial sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey, and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, and 2024 Presidential vote. The final sample of post-speech re-interviews was weighted to be representative of those who said they would watch the President's address according to gender, age, race, education, geographic region, 2024 Presidential vote, and pre-speech partisan identification. The margin of error is \u00b13.4 pts.*\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-joint-address-congress-poll-2025/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-joint-address-congress-poll-2025/)",
