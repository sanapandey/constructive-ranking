It was voicing a concern about my own ability to understand where the line is, so I can be respectful of it.  As someone who doesn\u2019t feel she aligns with the right or the left, learning about both is important to me, but given a) that verbalizing online removes around 70% of how people evolved to understand one another (facial cues, body language, and intonation), and b) that my intentions and written words have been misinterpreted more times than I can count, I\u2019m not confident that perceptions of my words will be taken as intended.  \n\nMore importantly, how can anyone be sure to respect the guidelines here if they aren\u2019t clearly outlined ahead of time? \n\nI\u2019m assuming the mod team cares about people being able to voice their concerns, esp for those within their own party, or those considering the party as a possibility, regardless of the specific elected officials/right leaning individuals involved. Someone can detest a particular person/politician, feel that that person is trying to corrupt the values at the core of their party, and still want to discuss it amongst others who overwhelmingly appreciate those same values that the party holds.  But at the onset of voicing that concern, or sharing a detail they are not okay with, esp in a short comment, would it not just look like voicing dissent in some cases? How would m that comment differ from a similar opinion of someone who is just trying to stir up trouble, without having to preface who they are, and detailing what they believe or don\u2019t, in order to avoid a ban?  I\u2019d like to be respectful of the parameters, and am unsure how to do it without it being more clearly defined.  Just seeking some guidance if you\u2019re able to provide it.  Hope that\u2019s okay.",
