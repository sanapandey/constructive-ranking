Their solution to toxic masculinity is to rebound the complete other direction and become toxic feminists. There is no true neutrality in Women\u2019s Studies at all. The bias is strong. They hate men. I\u2019m a woman myself and thought this!\n\nIronically, red leaning states are some of the worst for not recognizing men\u2019s rights, but these are also the ones with the bad reputation for having more toxic masculinity. If you\u2019re a father wanting custody in TN, MI, GA or OH you better have a good lawyer. They almost always lean towards the mother. Plus if you\u2019re lucky enough to get 50/50 custody, you\u2019re still going to be paying a ton of money in support.",
