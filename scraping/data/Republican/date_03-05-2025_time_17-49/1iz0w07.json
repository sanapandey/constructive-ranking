When a complication forces your body to heal itself over and over a million times (UV radiation, sharp fibers in lungs like abestos or fiberglass, damage from chemicals and viruses, or hormonal/genetic distinctions causing 100x more blood cell production than normal) the body inevitably fucks up and creates a cancer cell instead of the proper repair. The odds of cancer forming increase linearly with how often your body has to repair a damage. Some scientists are starting to do a complete 180 and believe genetics actually has nothing to do with it at this point. It\u2019s impossible to cure cancer because it\u2019s simply a malfunction. Preventing the malfunction isn\u2019t exactly feasible either because how would you introduce something into the body that checks every single cell produced\u2026basically the only outcome from cancer research will ever be more advanced and effective treatments.",

For one of my brothers who has low functioning Autism however, my father most likely has ADD (no official diagnosis), and my other brother DOES have ADHD. Not sure about my brothers' mother (they're half brothers, I share a father with them) or her parents, etc. In any case, with my brothers I can see how their conditions were most likely caused without mutation, just a roll of the plain old Genetics Dice. But for me, we don't know what happened, lol.",
