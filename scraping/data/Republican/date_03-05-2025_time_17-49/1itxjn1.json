Cheung's concern was that the directive to issue a freeze letter was based on speculation rather than clear evidence or applicable law. She consulted with the FBI-WFO personnel who were at the center of the investigation, engaged in legal consultation and expressed doubts about the sufficiency of the evidence, highlighting that the directive appeared to conflate suspicion with legal justification. She was a prosecutor for 24 years serving under Republican and Democratic administrations alike.\n\n\nThe existing documents on their face did not seem to meet the threshold for even a grand jury investigation. Do you get how little evidence has to exist for that? Not receive an indictment by the grand jury but to just open a grand jury investigation. \n\nAnd with that standard not met, they want her to violate the 4th amendment? That's what a Freeze on an account would be, a Seizure, even if later released. Prosecutors swear an oath to the Constitution. She was willing to send a letter to the bank, there \"may be conduct that constitutes potential violations\" of  conspiracy to defraud the United States and wire fraud, that \"merits additional investigation.\"\n\nShe told the interim US Attorney for the district \"at this juncture, based upon the evidence I have reviewed, I still do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to issue the letter you described, including sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize the particular accounts identified. Because I believed that I lacked the legal authority to issue such a letter, I told you that I would not do so. You then asked for my resignation.\"",

For instance the funds could be distributed to an NGO that isn\u2019t performing the outlined functions they defined in getting the funding. They could say \u201cwe are going to save all the baby seals from great white sharks, but it costs 1B a year in perpetuity.\u201d Then they win the grant and never actually do anything. They just get 1B a year with very little to no oversight. The head of the government organization has no idea his inspector is being paid off and that the organization is doing absolutely nothing. They see a report and maybe show up to a fund raising gala once a year so to them it all looks legit. \n\nThere is massive amounts of what equates to fraud all over these investigations. At some point soon these people need to start going to jail. If not, then in 4 years they are just going to start rebuilding their pipeline of fraud and the cycle will just start over.",
