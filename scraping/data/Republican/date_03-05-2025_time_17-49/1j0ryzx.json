He hasn't turned off the aid to Ukraine. He's making sure we get something out of it. In this case, it looks like he's gunning for rare earth metals and right of first refusal for Ukraine's redevelopment after the war is over.\n\nAs much as Europe likes to complain, it hasn't been European weapons systems that have triumphed in Ukraine. It was American Bradleys, M777 howitzers, Humvees, F-16 fighters, M4 rifles, and tourniquets (and others). The only thing they can really boast about is the Leopard tank, and there are a lot of asterisks there (we told them that the Abrams wasn't appropriate for the fighting because of logistics issues).",
