I would argue quite a few of them would be ultra liberal(British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario) while a few would be leaning towards conservative(Manitoba and etc). If we make Canada several states, the US Federal government would absorb the debt that Canada held and we would have to find a way to integrate our legislative bodies to accommodate new House members and Senators. A Census woukd have to be undertaken right away to give the appropriate amount of time to complete a monumental task.\n\nWhile I agree that we should not let men compete in women's sports, we shouldn't legislate the same issue in independent nations. Let them decide how to run their country and we should run ours independent of their actions.",

You use the word annex, but I think you mean invasion. The only way we can take Canada is if the US decides to invade the country and take it by force. We would literally need to send troops to go to war with Canadians just because we want their land. This would literally make us the bad guys. Do you really want to read a headline that says America is carpet bombing Toronto? How would you guys think about this if it were Biden saying that he wanted to invade Canada?",
