The Ukrainians were just in the awkward position of having their former overlord's nukes in their territory. They were in no position to take them or, if they got custody of them, maintain them.\n\n\nThe US gave them money - for something they needed a lot of at the time due to mismanagement of the Ukrainian economy by Moscow. The US was happy to make the deal to get the weapons back to Russia where they would have better oversight.\n\n\n*https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2014-12/features/looking-back-ukraines-nuclear-predicament-and-nonproliferation-regime#note39",

                    "body": "I'm curious, what would happen, though?\n\nLike let's suppose the worst case happened. Ukraine tomorrow was told \"look to your own defenses\", and the western border opened and people made a running retreat from the front line. Ukrainians that didn't want to live under Russian rule flee into Europe. 38 million would be roughly 40 times the amount that came all at once in 2015 (around a million), but many Ukrainians have already left the country, and about quarter would probably stay (the pro-Russian elements of the country). It would be a massive humanitarian crisis and destabilizing, but it's difficult to predict exactly how that shakes out.\n\nBut then what?\n\nRussia has NATO membership as a red line. For all the talk to the contrary, Putin has not invaded any NATO country in his adventurism. \"But he could be emboldened!\", you might say, but...with what army?\n\nBefore the invasion, it was a question as to how powerful Russia's military was. Their little action in Syria had Western analysts wondering if they were an advanced, modern military.\n\n...but then the war started and we saw they had a LITTLE advanced equipment, but only a little, mostly for showing off, and once it was destroyed or scared into hiding, they have little else. Their training is also very rigid and hierarchical (unlike the US), which led to their troops being ineffective when their commanders were killed, and they lost a lot of commanders in the war from long range attacks. When they had to move them back further out of range, the troops were even less effective. Their weapon systems have been little match for Western systems like Patriot missiles, and Ukrainian drones have made short work of their vehicles to the point a lot of their attacks are now 2-4 man teams on foot trying to stay hidden as they advance. There are some reports of them having to use pack animals (like literal mules) to move equipment.\n\nRussia isn't a problem, directly, because their military was already a glass tiger, all facade, and now even that facade has shattered. They have a third rate military that's already gutted their nations young male workforce, which is going to have detrimental impacts on their ability to regrow after the war in both economy/production and in population growth (baby making). And they were already in demographic decline and not reaching replacement birthrates before the war.\n\nThey don't have the innovation or impetus to develop advancements in technology, and live in a stifling social structure that discourages it, and they don't have the capability in that system to challenge the corruption in the government and military, much less reform it into a working system for a strong military. Putin may have his praetorian guard protecting Moscow, but they can't fight a war.\n\nIt could take years or even decades for Russia to recover from this, and that's if the war ended tomorrow. Yeah, they can keep throwing poor peasant boys from Siberia at the front lines for another decade, but that's hardly the kind of troops you need for a disciplined, functional army to conquer the world with.\n\nIf he takes Ukraine, there'd be little gain from it. The infrastructure has been bombed to heck, and he'd get no assistance rebuilding it. Many of the mineral deposits are untapped, and though China might help develop them, that could also take years - and would tax China's resources paying for the rebuilding, thus diminishing its ability to threaten Taiwan or other nations.\n\nWill Russia nuke Florida?\n\nNo, that's absurd. Outside of ACTUAL nuclear war breaking out (in which case nothing matters anyway), Russia isn't going to just launch nukes at the US. They know that would be the end for them and probably 3/4ths of the planet besides. There's no gain in doing so, and it's really just the \"if we're losing a war anyway, may as well take our chances while ensuring our enemies don't, either\", which is more likely to happen if we get into a hot war with Russia than if we stay out of one.",

Our strength is at sea. \"Don't fight Filipinos in the jungle, don't fight Finns in the snow, don't fight Americans at sea - and for the love of God, don't touch their boats!\" And unlike Ukraine, Taiwan is an important national security interest for the US: We get a LOT of high tech components from there and South Korea, and have a vested interest in keeping the supplies of both flowing.\n\n.\n\nFor my part, it's not \"Ukraine bad because I disagree with Biden\", it's \"Ukraine and Russia are both corrupt countries with dictatorial regimes, little personal liberty, and effective abolition of democracy\".\n\nI just don't see how Ukraine is a US national security interest. I feel for Ukrainians, but they can't win without US boots on the ground, and after we just ended a 20 year boondoggle, there's no appetite with Americans for another.\n\nSo since we aren't going to kick Russia's ass for them, and no one else can, the only options are for them to be slowly bled to death or for them to get some kind of peace deal to cut their losses.",

One thing about Trump is that he insults leaders that he believes are not fit to be leaders. He has been this way for like 50 years now. He believes that Zelenskyy did not lead Ukraine well enough to take some steps to strengthen the country and the military and whatever it is that is essentially needed to make people fear causing an issue with you. This is Trump\u2019s stance. He\u2019s all about PREVENTING war from happening, not just ending them, but making sure they never happen in the first place. \n\nHe wants to prevent WWIII. In doing so, NATO is off the table for Ukraine. He\u2019s thinking in terms of how that might negatively impact the world. If there was WWIII, Russia has nuclear bombs, and Putin is fucking nuts who says many times he would nuke people! Trump just wants to save as many people\u2019s lives as possible. He\u2019s is not on Putin\u2019s side. He\u2019s on America\u2019s side. He doesn\u2019t want American tax payers to fund this war, especially given the careless use of the money that Biden gave to Ukraine, which arguably, has majorly impacted inflation here in the United States. He\u2019s not getting a pay day\u2014he got one already with Biden. And also because quite frankly\u2014this is very much so a LOSING battle for Ukraine. Have you seen the government kidnapping men to fight in the war like some kind of meat grinder? Ukraine has to know they are incapable of winning a war against Russia\u2014too powerful. \n\nHe\u2019s also tired of people treating America\u2014like they did under Biden\u2014like they can be taken advantage of. America is like the most powerful country, but we need to be able to take care of ourselves before we help others. Because this is not America\u2019s war, Zelenskyy should not feel entitled to whatever he wants just because Ukraine is the victim here. The fact that he understands that being accepted into NATO would result in WWIII, and still has this hope, is not long term thinking. This will trigger WWIII and the loss of hundreds of millions of innocent lives. \n\nNobody is arguing that Ukraine is the victim. He\u2019s not taking Putin\u2019s side. Trump wants to hopefully keep him at bay until he dies (rumors going around about his health) or the end of his term (potentially) in 2036. But unfortunately, the reality of the situation is that Russia has cards, America has cards, but Ukraine has none. :(",

Russia, the US, and the UK all provided security guarantees to Ukraine in 1991 in exchange for Ukraine relinquishing the nuclear weapons in Ukraine's possession. It is obvious now that those guarantees weren't worth much. What kind of security guarantees can be provided in 2025 that will fare better?",

The Budapest memorandum gave them that cash flow, and America was fine coughing the dough up because it put the nukes in an area with better oversight. If you need some proof about how flimsy everyone knew those security assurances were, here's a quote from Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president that negotiated the nuclear handover, said essentially immediately after it's signature: \"If tomorrow Russia goes into Chrimea, nobody will even raise an eyebrow\".*\n\nThey 'gave up' the Nukes for money, not security guarantees.\u00a0\n\n\n'Gave up' is in quotes because soviets had control of the weapons, not the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians were just in the awkward position of having their former overlord's nukes in their territory. They were in no position to take them or, if they got custody of them, maintain them.\n\n\n*https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2014-12/features/looking-back-ukraines-nuclear-predicament-and-nonproliferation-regime#note39\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nTo answer your question though (oops), Ukraine has 4 options I see.\n\n\n1) get NATO membership\n\u00a0- very unlikely\n2) Build Nukes\n\u00a0- results in geopolitical isolation\n3) Get non-NATO security Guarantees\n\u00a0- Credibility problem, due to Russian Nukes\n4) Keep fighting until the Russian population is so exhausted from war that re-starting the war machine after a ceasefire would be so politically unpopular that even Putin couldn't survive it. (E.g., post-afghanistan USSR)\n\n\nMy money is them aiming on 4, but using 1-3 to keep the Russian losses going until they feel like it's there.",

How in the world do you think he is in the right here?",

Even Gorbachev is on record saying there were no promises made.\n\nWas it discussed? Yeah, there are declassified memos about conversations within NATO/US government about the informal assurances to consider not expanding eastward in the 90s. But none of that translated to a formal agreement or wording in a treaty. There\u2019s been Russian propaganda that we made promises and broke them in these \u201cbackroom\u201d conversations, but they never became ink on any of the actual agreements so ultimately who cares, if it\u2019s truly what they wanted, then they can ask for it on ink and they haven\u2019t in 30 years. And as President Trump has outlined in his deal making during his first term, the number one rule of doing business even in America, if it ain\u2019t in the contract then get fucked. \n\n\nTo the other points tho, did we know that Russia viewed NATO or does view NATO expansion as a threat? Yeah we do. Have they had hostile languages for expansion? 100%  - But they didn\u2019t invade Finland in the months before they joined which by your logic would be one of the many reasons they invaded Ukraine. \n\nAlso since you\u2019re bringing up the past, There was a short time in the late 90s, early 2000s with Clinton and Bush (Especially after 9/11), where Russia made some light overtures to join NATO. Pretty sure those went straight into the trash can when they invaded Georgia a few years later. \n\n\nSo anyway, my point is there aren\u2019t agreements that were \u201cviolated.\u201d President Trump has been very much a strong supporter of putting ink to paper and avoid these sort of \u201coh but you promised this to me in our talks\u201d sort of bs too and if the Russians truly wanted that then could\u2019ve asked for it when he was renegotiating the INF stuff in term 1 before withdrawing because the Russians weren\u2019t complying.",

If France said in year 3 \"George is winning this, what's the end game?\" there would have been a significantly different outcome. \n\n>Are you aware they Ukrainians are dying the more we prolong this war?\n\nAnd? If the Ukrainians want to keep fighting, let them. \n\nFrom what I'm seeing recent polling shows half of Ukrainians want a negotiated end to the war, but of that group only about half is ok with major territory concessions, so maybe a quarter of the population supports the deal on the table.",

It\u2019s crazy to me that such a huge nation can be pushed back so fiercely as one of the strongest naval powers to supply coastal artillery that was even critically damaged by drones and strike aircraft.
