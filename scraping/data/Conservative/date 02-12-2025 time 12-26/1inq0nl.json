Regardless of where a federal case is filed presiding judges should be chosen in a blind draw, for the current system is patently unfair and should be illegal.\n\nAlso, congress should revisit Article lll of the Constitution and rein in these activist judges. They have the power to regulate this crap..and they should use it.",
