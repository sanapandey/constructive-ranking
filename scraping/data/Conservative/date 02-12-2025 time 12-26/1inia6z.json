Considering how often folks here complain that the mods give out flairs to bigrading liberals, it probably isn't wise to blindly trust strangers just because of what subreddit you're on.\n\nI can give you my word that I made a genuine effort to provide a clear and truthful answer to your question, but I can't stress enough how important it is to think for yourself; and this includes seeking and validating information. It's true that Wikipedia isn't 100% trustworthy 100% of the time, but nothing is. I'd rather you trust Wikipedia more than you trusted me because at least Wikipedia cites sources that you can take the time to verify yourself; I didn't cite anything in my answer to you and could have very well made it up or misremembered the details and described a completely different person than Marc Fogel.",
