In no way should a judge of such a tiny part of the country determine the law for the rest of it. I simply cannot believe that the Founders had this sort of judicial activism in mind when they envisioned our court system.",

Otherwise we'd just have a pool of federal judges with jurisdiction over the entire United States. That's what SCOTUS is for. How can they be described as \"lower\" court judges if they have this kind of power?",
