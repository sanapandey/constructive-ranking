    "selftext": "While it\u2019s fascinating to read deranged responses to every little thing Trump does, I think it\u2019s time to ignore them. They provide no substantive ideas other than calling someone a Nazi if they disagree with them. They protest at the drop of a hat like hippie DNA has somehow been injected into them. Maybe it reminds them of the glory days of shoving flowers into gun barrels yet they\u2019ve turned into war-hawks when it comes to Ukraine\u2026hmmm\u2026vaccines? Anyway, they are more concerned with bumper stickers and vandalizing Tesla vehicles than rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse concerning their tax dollars. So maybe it\u2019s better to just ignore them but keep an eye on them just in case they turn less than peaceful. \n\nThen again, it is fun making them nuts with one comment. Ok, never mind.  ",
