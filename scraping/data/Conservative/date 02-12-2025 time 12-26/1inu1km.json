There's massive amounts of corruption that is being exposed in this country in real time, almost daily, and on top of all that, we're reducing government spending to the tune of billions of dollars. \n\n\nDemocrats and your average rot brained redditor keeps harping on the eggs. Day one initiatives take a while. Economic recovery is a process that requires longevity. Further that, if Democrats are going to cling onto this one line item for the entire four years....oof. Not a good or successful look.",

Therefore less chickens to lay eggs. So less eggs. Unless Trump can waive his hands and make a bunch of laying age hens appear, he can't make the price go down",
