Seems to me like his firing is justified for EXTREMELY poor performance and execution of his duties.",

So technically he is the one who should have been tracking and reporting and bringing suite against all the crazy things we are seeing USAID was funding.\n\nThis guy should have been doing DOGE's job since 2021.",
