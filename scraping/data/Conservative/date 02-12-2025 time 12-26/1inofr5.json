They would have to maintain large garrisons, missile defenses, and fighter squadrons in the mainland to protect their defense industries from US attacks. Russia has proven unable to gain or retain air dominance in Ukraine, from that we can infer at best the same from a Russo - Sino alliance. A more likely scenario is they trade evenly in 4/4.5 Gen fighters and the F-22/F-35 squadrons absolutely dominate wherever they are.\n\nBarring a backstab from NATO members, a Russo-Sino alliance is likely losing that conflict if they aren't pushing into Germany by the end of the first month. If they're still bog down in Ukraine, Poland, or the Baltics then it's game over",

Remember Biden was so weak that, even though Russia has repeatedly used nuclear capable ballistic missiles against Ukrainian cities, he refused to give Ukraine any serious long range weapons and only recently gave them short to mid range ones. \n\nLots of the mainstream media seems to be trying to bury the story which it took me a while to verify since it's in few of my normal sources but [North Korea just sent 200 artillery systems to support Russia in Ukraine](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250211-seoul-says-n-korea-has-given-russia-200-long-range-artillery-pieces).\n\nMaybe Trump would show more guts and allow Ukraine to strike back at China's forces in Russia, but there hasn't been much new done about North Korean hordes attacking them yet.",

Really only a few European powers can do any level of SEAD. Only France and the UK have ICBMs Add germany with intermediate rage cruise missiles and then remember *nobody* has long range bombers (like America's B1, B2 and B-52)",

The Russian oligarch's friends in St Petersburg and Moscow and their kids in New York and London have not been touched at all. Disproportionately the people dying aren't real \"Russians\" they are Buryats, Chechens, Tyvans and Kalmyks and other Rural groups from the edges of the Russian Empire. Even the ethnic \"Russians\" that are dying are the ones that live out in the Russian colonies. \n\nThat's long been the Russian way - they send their slave populations to do the dying for them. The likely truth is that it would be Ukranians, Belarussians (once Putin annexes Belarus) and other slave groups that he'd send to die. \n\nRusssia's conquests aren't just about land and minerals. They are much more like the old Mongol empire that also wants to capture and enslave peoples and use them for war. That's one of the reasons that Ukriane wants to have the whole of their territory back. They know that if that doesn't happen then in a few years their own people will be being sent to attack them.",

Once the conflict stops they regroup, start to try to apply the lessons of the conflict and prepare for the next one. They thought they had logistics for war sorted out in Syria, but made a mistake on scale. Next time they hope to have learned. \n\nThe Ukrainians have been developing a bunch of interesting tech, for example jamming resistant AI drones which can sit and wait out in the field be told to take off and then still find their target even after losing signal. The Russians have to use much more limited (heavier) fibre optic drones which can't reach nearly as far. One of the reasons Putin wants to force Ukraine to be neutral is so that he can get access to that technology. \n\n> Do...do they just hate their own people at this point? \n\nThey send them on actual assaults against Ukrainian positions unarmored Chinese \"golf cart\" ATVs and literal electric scooters so the answer is 100% yes. If you haven't seen / heard about these things I'd point you to google or r/CombatFootage but beware that some of what you will see goes beyond NSFW and is frankly horrific. \n\nIn fact some of the latest things were recordings sent by Russians on Telegram of still wounded soldiers *on crutches* being forced to go out and fight, which then matched with Ukrainian vidoes of the same literally crawling towards their positions. It's scary.",
