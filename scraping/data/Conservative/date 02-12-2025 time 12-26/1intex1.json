The girl is going to die without a heart transplant.  \n\nYou get the vaccines, get on the transplant list, hopefully she has a match and successful transplant, and then look at your legal options when your daughter is healthy.\n\nVaccination status is just one of a laundry list of requirements to get on the organ transplant list.",

            "body": "Makes sense; the only window to be vaccinated for people facing transplant is prior to transplant.\n\nPeople can be restricted from obtaining a donor organ if they drink, smoke, or are morbidly obese. Why? Because they are more susceptible to transplant failure for modifiable behavior. When there\u2019s only a few organs and a large pool of recipients, the ethics board is going to decide on the person more likely to be a successful candidate.\u00a0\n\nIf our society had an opt-out organ donation program, then sure give them the organ. The reality is organs are scarce. The argument for which vaccines is something I pay more attention to rather than whether or not to vaccinate at all. I.E Is this child likely to be exposed to Hep A if she has international travel or do they plan on never leaving the US (frequent exposure happens in food in Asian countries)? Then they should be vaccinated for it. HEP B which is transmitted through IV drug use and rarely sex is something I would argue against.\u00a0",
