Looking at the OMB apportionment transparency portal, there is $94 million in transfers out of the Disaster Relief Fund (to really divert funds FEMA would need to execute a non-expenditure transfer since they are essentially separate accounts with Treasury), but it doesn\u2019t appear to be going to FEMA\u2019s Federal Assistance Fund, where the New York City payment originated out of. One thing I DIDN\u2019T see were any transfers in to the Disaster Relief Fund, which seems odd since DHS has broad transfer authority across the entire organization. I\u2019ll caveat this with stating I have no idea how FEMA\u2019s budget practically works.",
