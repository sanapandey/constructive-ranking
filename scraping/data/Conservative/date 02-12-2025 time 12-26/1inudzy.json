I mean we know the feds were heavily manipulating Twitter and Facebook. Obviously they are doing the same on Reddit. I have heard on two different occasions Redditors talk about seeing or taking jobs to program bots to astroturf Reddit with whatever the pupper masters desire. This is slightly overstated, but Reddit isn't much more than an army of bots telling a few people what to say back to them in return for Karma. I hope they can find a way to outlaw bot accounts without impacting freedom of speech but that would probably be difficult.",

Snowden leaked the NSA spying program a year before, the left took the side of the NSA. Aaron Swartz ended his own life in 2013 ( he was a free speech activist on the left) while Steve Huffman was known to only care about money and power.  Around this time this is when Reddit collected enough power and users to start banning people in mass who went against the grain. before that the Site would push back on censorship and the site didn't want to lose users. There was a had a huge libertarian user base, Ron Paul was very popular on here. My guess is it start in 08 under Obama, that's when I First noticed astrofuring and hit critical mass in 2014 before the next election.\n\nI also would not be surprised if the Deep state took the side with the Left because of how popular Ron Paul was on the internet. and they needed the Democrats to win.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul_2008_presidential_campaign",
