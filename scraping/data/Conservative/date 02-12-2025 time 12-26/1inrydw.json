    "selftext": "U.S. border czar Tom Homan responded to the pope, saying that the Vatican is a city-state surrounded by walls and that Francis should leave immigration enforcement to him. Homan, a Catholic, also said Francis should focus on fixing the Catholic Church rather than U.S. immigration policies.\n\nThis Pope has never condemned the violent gangs in America that have killed citizens and taken over apartment complexes.  He should just focus on his congregation.\n\n",
