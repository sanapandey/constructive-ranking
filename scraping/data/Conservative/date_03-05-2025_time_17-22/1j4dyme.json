We love diversity, I love watching movies with diverse casts, but if you force it for no reason and make it the only reason because check box it fails.\n\nLook at Snow White...why did we cast a Latina for a German folktale? or change the 7 dwarves to 7 magical friends only to double back.\n\n\nOn the other hand, it can be done so very well too. Battlestar Galactica remake with Starbuck being recast as a women as was admiral cain \n\nYou had two rock solid cast members who owned those roles so hard they are the definitive version of it.\n\nNick Fury - Marvel\n\nM-Judy Dench The James Bond Franchise. (once again so well acted became the definitive version of the character even surviving through Bond's recasting)",
