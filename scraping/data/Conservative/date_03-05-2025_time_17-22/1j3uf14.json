I wasn't around then, but the speech has been televised since 1947. The partisan nature of the applause didn't start until 1982. According to [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/01/a-political-history-of-the-state-of-the-union/70136/), during a Reagan speech, Republicans and Democrats had been distributed separate notes, with the notes given to Republicans having applause cues and the notes given to Democrats not having them.\n\nDemocrats responded to this by acquiring an early text of the next Reagan speech and going through it and writing their own cues of when to cheer, again serving their own agenda by picking and choosing. Later, this morphed into the other party just not reacting to much of anything that a president would say.\n\nAccording to [this 2013 intelligencer article](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/02/state-of-the-union-applause-fest.html), Democrats at the time tended to make far more applause cues than Republicans, often to the point of absurdity.\n\nSo, at least according to those sources, Reagan started it and then Democrats kinda magnified it, taking it to a much larger level, and it's been a thing ever since.\n\nAnd myself? I hate it. It's been the norm over my whole life and I hate every moment of it. It makes me feel poorly represented, makes me have less faith in our government. It drives in how divided we are as a country. I also hate the practice of doing it along party lines. It drives how the two-party system has such a lock-hold on government. It reinforces the idea that the two parties are incapable of working together. I see all these things as deep problems, things we need to stop accepting as the norm and instead challenge and move beyond. It's important to me that both we as a society, and the reps we elect to congress, are able to work out our (and their) differences and build a consensus on important issues. I don't expect people to agree on everything, but if we are as divided as we are today, I can't see our government as anything other than broken.",
