Let the country see them for who they are. Share the shit out of every bad moment. \n\nIf they wake up and \"cut the shit\", we won't have as much of a steamroll in the midterms. And believe me, nothing would end the Democrat party more than losing so handedly in both 2024 and 2028. They're still in shock and think it was a one-off. 2028 will show them they're truly irrelevant and grossly misaligned with American values. Don't give them any iota of what or why they need to change.",
