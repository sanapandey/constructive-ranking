            "body": ">Egypt's Reconstruction Plan for Gaza is a 112-page document that includes maps of how its land would be re-developed and dozens of colourful AI-generated images of housing developments, gardens and community centres. The plan includes a commercial harbour, a technology hub, beach hotels and an airport. \n\nPretty cool ideas \n\n>The major questions that need to be answered about Gaza's future are who will run the enclave and which countries will provide the billions of dollars needed for reconstruction.  \n\nOh.. there's the catch.  A whole big summit to agree that *someone* needs to do something, and that of course somebody will eventually pay for it.  \n\nBut it's a good step, maybe they'll figure it out and the US won't have to be the ones supplying the billions",
