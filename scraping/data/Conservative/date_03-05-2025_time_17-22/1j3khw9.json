If Taiwan goes under our economy takes a hit and that in itself is a security guarantee for Taiwan. Thats why they invested 100bn and will continue to because the more economically intertwined Taiwan is with the US the more likely the US will come to Taiwans aid. This is why the MINERAL RIGHTS deal is critical for those SECURITY GUARANTEES Zelensky wants. However, he wants that open cash flow from the US that he can launder to his friends instead and thats why he\u2019s stone walling and demanding money.",

They're talking past eachother because Zelensky doesn't quite get the implication, and Trump doesn't want to look like he's putting military in Ukraine.\n\nThat's why I had to laugh at the AI parody video of Zelensky 'we're no playing cards, we're not playing checkers, there is no board\" and so on.  \n\nFor reference(I had to dig up the tik tok because I saw it on reddit):\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@mrreaganusa/video/7478053761311657262?lang=en",

It is an indirect security guarantee that would protect Ukraine while also be reasonable for Russia to sign off on. \n\nZ probably met with some other advisors and now see's this as the case as he says in the tweet, [\"Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it in any time and in any convenient format. We see this agreement as a step toward greater security and solid security guarantees, and I truly hope it will work effectively.\"](https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1896948147085049916). He is saying that he is willing to sign the deal as is and that it is a step towards the greater security of Ukraine.\n\nSure you can make the argument that it's all gonna go up in smoke the way it did Friday but I doubt it and anything more is purely speculative",

Is that all he wants as of now?\n\nHe doesn't want US military that close to him, he's probably worried about getting shafted by the US.\n\nSo maybe this is a win for everyone. No US military on Ukraines borders to threaten putin, and a guarantee that Russia won't attack US civilians without major reprecussions. \n\nThat's what I'm inferring, they may have different reasoning in mind.",
