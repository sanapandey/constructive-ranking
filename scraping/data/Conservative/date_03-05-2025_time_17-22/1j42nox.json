They propped him up in advance of last week's press conference by convincing them of something they knew wasn't true- that all of America would flood their representatives with phone calls demanding the US send money and troops to Ukraine to \"end the war\" ( by starting WWIII) but ONLY if Zelensky embarrassed Trump publicly. And Z believed them. True and deep evil. And it almost cost the Ukrainians everything.",
