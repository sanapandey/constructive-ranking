It does not include services or IP royalties/licenses through foreign subsidiaries. In other words, in this case, we are trading Netflix and Disney+ subs and Microsoft software licenses and Google ad purchases and getting oil and maple syrup and so forth in return. If we sell a million bucks profit worth of Netflix via the Netflix Canada entity (wholly owned by Netflix) and bring in a million bucks of maple syrup, that shows up as a million dollar deficit even though it\u2019s really zero, and tbh Netflix is overpriced and maple syrup is underpriced. \n\nIt would be like your wife saying that your marriage is messed up because you have a 10 hour a week housework imbalance with her (but fail to mention you work full time and do the taxes and do the yard work and fix the cars). All the contributions need to be seen to assess the relationship. In that example maybe you aren\u2019t doing enough or maybe she isn\u2019t but fixating on one lane only isn\u2019t fair. \n\nIn the case of China which doesn\u2019t allow a lot of pie strongest industries to compete, the trade surplus is a lot more descriptive of the problem. In the case of Canada, we probably have a net surplus when it is all added together.",

There is stuff we do need to actually trade with other nations for, we cannot have an absolute advantage in everything. And if you want more production domestically and more companies to do business here, let's look at ways to make it friendlier and easier for them to do.\n\nAnd doing this when conservatives were poised to make gains, and giving liberals a reason to rally around a message of sticking it to Trump, is a massive blunder.\n\nEDIT: To the person who gave me the award, I reject it. I still support Trump largely and he was absolutely the better choice over Biden and Kamala. But nice job spending money on it, you're making a huge difference. /s",

What strategy is there to combat the negative effects that will be caused because of it, and yes, there will be negative effects.\n\nHere are some (I think) some of the many legit disputes.  What America will get from the tariffs is a recovery of some of the butden that Canada is saddling on the US. There should be a fairer method to recover that resource, but Tariffs serve as carrot and stick if done right.  More FDI into America from Canada can only help, not hurt. \n\n>[Wikipedia]The heart of the dispute is the claim that the Canadian\u00a0lumber\u00a0industry is unfairly\u00a0subsidized\u00a0by the federal and provincial governments. Specifically, most timber in Canada is owned by provincial governments. The price charged to harvest the timber (the \"stumpage\u00a0fee\") is set administratively rather than through a competitive auction, as is often the practice in the United States. The United States claims that the provision of government timber at below market prices constitutes an unfair subsidy.\u00a0\n\n>[Wikipedia]Another source of tension has been Canada's protection of their dairy farmers. Canada is the only industrialized country in the world to still use a \"supply management system\" for regulating the supply of dairy products.[12]\u00a0The US sees the system as protectionist\n\n>[ Wikipedia]Canada isn\u2019t a small country, nor is it a poor one. It\u2019s perfectly capable of meeting its treaty obligations. Yet it spends a mere\u00a01.37 percent of its GDP\u00a0on defense, or roughly $30.5 billion a year. Despite having the sixth largest GDP among NATO countries, Canada ranks twenty-seventh in defense spending as a proportion of GDP. For comparison, the United States is the\u00a0third-highest\u00a0NATO member ranked in percentage of GDP (3.38 percent),\u00a0",

You go to Walmart for something, see the price has gone up, so now, you go to Kroger or another grocery store that's selling that same, or a similar, item for cheaper. Kroger may not have changed their price, but the new Walmart price went up so high, that it became the cheaper alternative.\n\nThe Canadian election is entirely relevant, as you would now have a party that may be more supportive of your initiatives and goals.

Instead it's just generic stuff like improve border security, and if Canada takes the (internally difficult) step of rebuking its dairy lobby there's not even any guarantee the tariffs would be lifted, so why would Canada do that? The whole thing seems more designed for protectionism this time around though I hope I'm wrong. If this is a new era of protectionism things are going to get worse for everyone except China. China will gladly replace the products and services the rest of the world gets from the US if people no longer want to do business with us (or more accurately we no longer want to do business with them).

I know he has come out hard against Trump on this, but it seems to me that the perception would (somewhat justifiably) be that Poilievre was too cozy with Trump and his right wing pundits, and it would be hard to undo that in this environment.",

Canada has been so hostile do doing anything at all about the drug and other problems that it is impossible not to conclude that their leadership is personally receiving some benefit from the traffic - just as we have seen how the Mexican politicians benefit greatly from the narcotics gangs. Trump's requests here are beyond reasonable. They are common sense. Canada has shown its true colors. We knew they were not an ally because of how often they vote against us at the UN, but they are a bad neighbor as well. We need to reevaluate the relatively unrestricted visa free travel across the border and we are going to have to use our military to secure the border until a wall can be built.",
