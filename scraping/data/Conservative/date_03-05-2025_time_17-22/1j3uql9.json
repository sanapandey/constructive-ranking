    "selftext": "Trump's speech was powerful. I also love that Trump kept his calm throughout his speech. There were so many people who he acknowledged for their bravery. I especially loved the part when he acknowledged the boy who developed brain cancer and assigned him as an honorary Secret Service member. Overall, the atmosphere was so patriotic. As a (legal) immigrant, I'm so proud to be an American.\n\nThank God for Trump.",

Trump is my personal favorite president of my lifetime, and tonight was just another moment where the surreal feeling of having him back in office hit hard again.\n\nI will never grow tired of how he unapologetically stands against the radical left. He will never back down no matter how hard they come at him. Whether they weaponize the justice system against him, launch the largest smear campaign in history, or even try and take his life... everything he's been through and he's still standing tall fighting for America\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8. I'm very proud to have him as our President.",

There were so many great parts in Trump\u2019s speech but the priority for me to end the war in Ukraine. I\u2019m tired of the loss of life for both countries and I hope they make a deal soon.",
