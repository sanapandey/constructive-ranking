Strong control of the arctic shipping routes, especially as the ice begins to melt.\n\n3. Lots of natural resources.\n\n4. Prevents Chinese influence from getting control over the region.\n\n5. Potential for it to be a big military hub.\n\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be a fan of many of the ideas on how the USA acquired Greenland, however.",
