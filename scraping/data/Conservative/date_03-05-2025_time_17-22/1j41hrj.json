They refused to clap for peace in Ukraine (Trump announced both big z and Putin are willing to negotiate). They refused to clap for a 15 year old with brain cancer. They refused to clap for Laken Riley. Instead, they had their cringy signs and their cringy pink suits (when NONE of them voted to protect women). This played horribly with any moderate. \n\n  \nAnd the whole time, Trump spoke of success, strength, and unity. \n\n  \nIm so glad Trump won. We are so back.",
