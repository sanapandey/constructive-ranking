The \"bank shot\" fraud is more common than fraudulent SS payments going to obviously dead people.\n\nObviously, fraud is fraud and we need to stamp it out.  Arguing about whether the fraud is in SS rather than UE, SSDI, PPP or whatever is a distraction.  Pursuing that distraction calls your motivations into question.  Sorry!",

He is clearly talking about social security payments, and that isn't a thing despite Musk's claims. \n\nAnd all of this comes at a cost. Social Security is bankrupt? \"We don't need to reform the program, there are millions of dead people getting payments! \" That of course is bs, and destroys the actual political will for much needed reform. \n\nHaving said that, in direct response to what you are saying, what was the actual fraud found? Because it seems like DOGE makes a claim, turns out to be BS, and then shifts the goal post. Whether it is a mine elevator shaft being the limiting step in retirements, cutting contracts that ended during the Bush era, confusing millions with billions, useless federal staff wide emails that endanger national security (that can't possibly accomplish what Musk claims), etc,etc.\n\nI'm 100% in on cutting waste and fraud. Currently, DOGE credibility sits at zero.",
