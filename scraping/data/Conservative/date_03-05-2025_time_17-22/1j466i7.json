They'll continue to call themselves the compassionate ones, and claim that we don't care about anyone, but we're the ones who risk our lives in the military and PD and firefighters. We're the ones who say \"RIP\" when even one of theirs dies. We're the ones who are trying to protect children.\n\nMeanwhile they protect pedos, fight for their 'right' to murder babies, and are too cowardly to join the military to protect this country. And they can't even clap for a child that survived cancer because it might make orange man look good for 2.1 seconds.\n\nAnd we're the heartless ones?",
