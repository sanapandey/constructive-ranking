    "selftext": "\nI know there have already been a ton of threads about the Democrats refusing to stand for objectively good things during the speech, but what baffles me the most is how they think their rhetoric is going to win them any votes.\n\nIn my opinion, part of the reason they lost so badly is that they veered too far left. You\u2019d think after such a catastrophic defeat, they\u2019d adjust their strategy and find new ways to appeal to the broader voting base. But instead, they just keep doubling down on the same tired narrative\u2014acting like anything President Trump does is automatically bad, without offering any real alternatives.\n\nTrump was 100% right when he said that if he somehow cured cancer, the Democrats would still find a way to shit on it. If they keep this up, the midterms are going to be an absolute bloodbath for them.",

Not any happiness to be found unless they're discussing the downfall of a conservative. It's weird because I even see my liberal friends morphing into that when they're online and talking politics...luckily they're more normal in person for now, but I worry about them slowly becoming nancy pelosi or joy behar as we age lol.",

Trump has fixed the \"woke\" and if he doesn't fix the \"broke\", it will open a gap for a Dem.  People tend to vote their wallets.  In Trump's first term, his dalliance with tariffs resulted in hurting farmers, they were made whole by the taxpayer, i.e. [farmer bailouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration_farmer_bailouts).  We need to be honest here, Trump needs sources of revenue to keep his promise of corporate tax cuts which very well could diminish the living standards of his supporters and independents.",

The Democrats, on the other hand, are in a difficult position, stuck in a \"death loop\" reminiscent of the Civil War era. They've chosen to focus on unpopular issues, which will likely continue to hurt them. Despite potential challenges, I have faith in Trump's economic policy, and I believe that without unexpected disruptions like COVID, America will experience unprecedented prosperity leading up to the next presidential election.",

Personally I put my money on Trump going to far on deporting groups of people that while illegal are part of a group that independents feel for. Like children brought here by their parents. That's just my guess though, hopefully Trump keeps in mind that while it's important to keep up the pace and following through it's also important to win in 28 because if he loses the House then his admin will be impeached again and have his admin handicapped.",
