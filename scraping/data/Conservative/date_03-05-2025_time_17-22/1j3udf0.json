    "selftext": "So the Democrats booed so hard that it interrupted Trump\u2018s speech and then they had to call in people to escort some of the Democrats out. The Democrats tried so hard to rain on Trump\u2018s parade, interrupting the state of the union with jeers and boos, even needing to be escorted out. I\u2019m SURE that\u2019s never happened before, why are Dems so badly behaved? However their boos only set the Republican crowd on fire. They were so excited, clapping and cheering so loud. It only amped up Trump\u2018s energy more. Also, his speech was phenomenal!\n\nSuch a phenomenal time to be a Conservative!!! ",
