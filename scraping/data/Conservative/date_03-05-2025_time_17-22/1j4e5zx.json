All of which reinforces what we already know: Egypt doesn\u2019t care what happens as long as it happens to someone else.\n\nYup about sums it up.  Everyone wants to point a finger, nobody wants to raise their hand.",

The number of Palestinian refugees is more than enough to destabilize Egypt, which is already struggling economically and barely keeping the religious radicals from taking the reins. Do we need another hostile country in the Middle East/North Africa? A bad friendly state is better than an enemy state. The author clearly doesn\u2019t see it, shows how little they understand the situation in Egypt.",
