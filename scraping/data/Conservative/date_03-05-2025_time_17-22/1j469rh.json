The idea seems to be that the PA\u2019s largest faction, Fatah, does not engage directly in terrorism, and therefore the PA deserves the vast sums the American government has been providing it. But \u201coff-duty\u201d members of the PA\u2019s security forces have engaged in terror attacks on Israelis in Judea and Samaria. The PA continues its \u201cPay-For-Slay\u201d program, by providing large monthly stipends to imprisoned terrorists and to the families of terrorists who died while committing their attacks. The PA has recently tried to disguise those payments by having them sent not directly to their intended recipients, but first through another PA agency \u2014 an attempt to camouflage the \u201cPay-For-Slay\u201d program that has fooled neither the Israelis nor the Americans. \u201cPay-For-Slay\u201d both rewards past, and incentivizes future terrorism. Furthermore, the PA has failed to condemn the Hamas atrocities carried out on October 7, with some PA officials praising the attacks as part of the \u201cPalestinian Resistance.\u201d",
