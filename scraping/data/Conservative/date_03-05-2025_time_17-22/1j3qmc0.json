We'll have 2 channels - one for some comments / discussion and the other for peace. Both channels will have a discussion after the address. One will be very drunk.\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/conservative\n\nShit posts can be found here: https://x.com/rcondiscord\n\nYou may now resume screaming at each other about tariffs.\n\n**Reminder** this is for \"SOTU\" and \"SOTU\" topics. We are still going to keep the thread on topic.\n\n*(Technically this is the presidents joint address to congress, we chose this name because that's what social media is erroneously calling it)*",

I\u2019m sure there are right wing platforms and outlets that do this too, but the left side is what I was steeped in so thats what I can speak to. \n\nOnce I found an unbiased news source and got the full context or the rest of the clip/quote for a few stories, I saw it everywhere and it was never being called out. \n\nMaybe it was a frog in a pot situation, but when I first came on Reddit over 10 years ago, the top comments would be calling out lies or incorrect info. I didn\u2019t realize that had gone away and believed what I was seeing because I thought it would be called out if it was wrong. I\u2019m fairly certain left wing bots dominate or at least lead the conversation on Reddit now. The only way I see anyone calling out incorrect or wildly exaggerated info now is by sorting by controversial. \n\nAnyway, all that to say, the people who think Reddit is an accurate reflection of American sentiment are mistaken and it was really interesting to see, what you correctly called, the mandate of the people who decided they\u2019d had enough of it this election.\n\nBest wishes to you, thanks for the conversation!",
