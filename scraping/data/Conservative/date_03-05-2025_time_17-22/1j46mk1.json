They welcome endless war in Ukraine, until every last one is dead. They were happy that the hurricanes targeted red areas. They think sending kids through medical transition is virtuous. They think letting drug addicts choose to rot themselves away is a good thing.\n\nI might sound harsh, but there's no aspect to their mindset that is healthy. They are deranged, mentally & spiritually ill people, as exemplified by the Democrats' behavior last night. At some point, this is probably gonna come to a head. I'm trying to move to a red area in the meantime.",
