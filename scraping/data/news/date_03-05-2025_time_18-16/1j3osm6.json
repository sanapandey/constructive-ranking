A lot of people think that if Trump is a narcissist, he would never give so much obvious praise and admiration to anyone else, but Vlad Vexler makes the excellent point that narcissists frequently give excessive praise and admiration to other people as a symptom of their narcissism. By associating themselves with other strong, successful people, narcissists share in their strength and success, and leech off it. \n\nOf course this doesn't mean that anyone who shows a lot of praise and admiration for someone else is a narcissist, but just that when you see someone who seems like a narcissist doing so, and doing so in rather awkward, off-putting, or inappropriate ways (like selling out their own country to a murderous tyrant or going on at length about the penis size of a golfer while giving a campaign speech) that doesn't disprove that they're a narcissist.",

All that happened was that the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM), which is kinda like the whole governments HR and who makes policies, rescinded a memo that they wrote implementing the Presidential EOs and Memoranda. This was done because OPM can\u2019t legally tell other departments to fire people and the Courts have pointed that out in some injunctions and court cases that have been brought. \n\nTHIS MEMO BEING RESCINDED DOES NOTHING OTHER THAN TELL AGENCIES THEY NEED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION TO FIRE PROBATIONARY (new) EMPLOYEES \u2018THEMSELVES\u2019. The government is still going to fire all these new employees just it would be at \u2018agency discretion\u2019.  And just removes a very low hanging fruit for these wrongfully terminated employees to be fired over. \n\nand we are already seeing this happen.

So until they actually rehire these people they are not in compliance with the ruling and are 100% breaking the law as ruled on. I'm sure Roberts will step in to put another administrative stay on the ruling if the judge actually threatens them with consequences, just like he did last week in the funding freeze case.

            "body": "Trump is physically and mentally compromised. Musk\u2019s company Neuralink specializes in helping those who are suffering from dementia in retaining their cognitive abilities. Trump has had one since about the time he pulled a blade out of his shoe and cut his ear. He may have got it to stave off the dementia that was beginning to show signs. Fred Trump spent 2 years at least with it. Dementia being relentless to the point where how much of what comes out of his mouth is him and how much is the Neuralink implant manipulated by foriegn and/or treasonous entities is difficult to say. . \n\nHe was the most entertaining president that er will ever have. He will be missed by many. But it is not ending well.  Treasonous elements are implementing actions which are turning our democracy into an authoritarian state. Firing our most experienced military personnel. Stopping the counterintelligence on Russia. Removing the three wire services from the press pool. Intimidating Congresspeople with illegal threats. All tactics of authoritarian states. \nMusk and Putin are currently in the process of robbing us blind. This administation\u2019s actions are aiding our historical rival. Sending loaded cargo planes to Russia, perhaps with scientists to reboot its nuclear arsenal? \nAcollection of Trump\u2019s speeches run through a program that coordinates with a facial recognition AI program can comandeer Trump\u2019s appearances. We have witnessed several moments where the caretakers have dropped the ball. When the child was in the oval office, during the cabinet meeting Trump dozed off. \nWhen both the president and vice president have been compromised and are not working in the interest of the people. Congress has the power to remove them by a roll call vote. We need to make Thune and Johnson to call a roll call vote for a Lloyd Austin  or CQ Brown to stop the traitorous theivery. Obviously Several cabinet members are villanous traitors. Lloyd Austin or a leader who understands that the safety of our nation is deep trouble. Johson and Thune must call for a roll call vote. \n\nGeneral Grant encouraged his troops by telling them to stop focusing and detailing what they do or potentially could do. Obviously the details of wholesale theft and disregard for laws passed by Congress are irrelevant at the moment. Come up with ways to stop them. \n\nA really racist dick,a double bearded asshole and Fuzzy Small Balls rolled into a Radio Shack. \u201cWhat\u2019ll it be boys. Fixing up your new buddy with a girlfriend?\u201d\nFuzzy Small Balls snarls back, \u201cHey, I got a girlfried. I caught one yesterday, she\u2019s tied up at the house. \u201c\n\u201cNo, but we\u2019ll take a set-up, and an extra microphone\u201d replies Dick.  \n\u201cHas she been ignoring you again?\u201d VP asks Dick. \n\nThe clerk came back. \u201cHere you go, but if not for a girlfriend, then who? Who\u2019s it for?\u201d\n\u201cThe boss.\u201d, FSB grins. \n\u201cCrap, Dick says angrily, now that you told him, were gonna have to kill him. You got any Pope dust left, Doublebeard?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot much. I dont know how well this stuff works. \u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019ll work well enough. He wont have millions praying for him.\u201d, says Dick\n\u201cor health care.\u201d, says Doublebeard. \nThey all laugh. \u201cOr right big guy as his boss. \u201c. \n\nCome up with some ideas to hit them. A court ordered medical evaluation un a skiff comple with bloodtests by a physician that is familiar with Neuralink\u2019s capabilities will be able to explain to what rxtent Trump has been compromised. A roll call vote for an officer to oversee new elections. I nominate Austin for president, now. Remove Rasputin, make him personally financially liable for the damage he has caused.",
