These are the kind of issues even his own supporters just kinda ignore and make excuses for if they have to because they otherwise like the guy. There really isn't a whole lot of support for sending troops to invade American allies. And yeah, things can get fucked up in military culture, especially for some of the people who have seen too much horror, but there's a big difference between treating a group of people like the enemy and slowly dehumanising them more and more and the stark reality of a hostile invasion of American allies. And Trump's not nearly smooth enough to convince the average person that it's justified.",

We funded Ukraine because we had vested interest in securing a sovereign democratic state on the border of Russia. That was already the something in return. In order to facilitate this without escalation Ukraine had *already paid it forward* by agreeing to nuclear disarmament. Something the US wanted to keep tension down and had already promised to back up. We also did not even fund half of their efforts for the last 3 years. Zelensky rightfully cannot just accept giving us these mineral resources without a peace guarantee. He literally just can\u2019t, it would be a hollow award. Russia will not just stay gone, they have proven for literally decades that any agreement with them is at best temporary.\n\n2. All these other countries have been funding Ukraine as well. 138 billion dollars worth compared to the US 119 billion. And this has been the case since the start of the war. The only somewhat truthful thing Trump has stated is that the US has given a larger percentage as grants instead of as loans. Every country (US included) has had a mixture of both, but UK has structured the loans to have little to no interest and to be paid via seized Russian assets making them only nominally different than a grant. The statement that the US is not being paid back is also somewhat false because a large portion of the donated war goods from european countries were bought from the US and are also being replenished with new purchases from the US.\n\n3. The only escalation now is boots on the ground, and the reason you are seeing that today is pretty clear. *Not* continuing aid to Ukraine from the US is de facto strengthening Russia and therefore is already an escalation of the war. They need to bolster Ukraine before Russia is able to capitalize on this. They were always there just as much if not more than we were.",
