I'm sure many Germans were just normal people, but that's not how Nazi Germany is remembered. \n\nI'm Chinese-Canadian, but with Japanese heritage, so I had both Chinese and Japanese ancestors in the 1930s and 40s... I know about the shit the Imperial Japanese Army did in China, but that also there were plenty of regular Japanese citizens that just wanted to get on with their lives, or even protested... But that's not how Imperial Japan is remembered. \n\nAmerica is on the cusp now. How will Trump's America be remembered?",

I\u2019ll connect the last hop:\n\nProtests are half of a whole, useless on their own.  People have forgotten that all successful protest movements succeeded because in parallel with them, someone else was providing a sense of fear to those in power; usually through small acts of violence, with a broad impression placed on society that they could escalate into larger violence.  Black Panthers for example, suggested they were the tip of an iceberg that could have exploded into a full-fledged race war.  LBJ was terrified of this prospect.  MLK\u2019s non-violent protests were the white flag of truce to allow both sides to talk about what could settle the grievance.\n\n**Protestors are the diplomats** offering to put an end to having to live in fear.\n\nHave someone create fear.  Then have protests which clearly articulate the societal changes that will stop the fear or violence.\n\nThat\u2019s it; that\u2019s how protests work, and it\u2019s the **only** way they work.  Don\u2019t take my word for it, either; take Frederick Douglass\u2019s word:  https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/1857-frederick-douglass-if-there-no-struggle-there-no-progress/\n\n-\n\nI should note:  strictly speaking, the violence is not necessary.  But the fear is.  The fear is ABSOLUTELY mandatory.\n\nAnd the lack of this is why all protest movements in last several decades have been dickless garbage.  They can be safely ignored, and in fact, you can hurt the protesters any way you want, because you can be certain they\u2018ll never actually hurt you back.  Violence and any will to actually stand up for themselves is against their moral code, apparently.  Hell, you can even cosplay as a cop and shoot them for sport, if you\u2019re into that (c.f. Rittenhouse).  You won\u2019t face any consequences for doing that.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be an asshole about this, but our moral attitudes towards nonviolence are laughably privileged and they\u2019re quickly becoming untenable.  The ultimate end-state, if the government doesn\u2019t care about your life and thinks they have impunity, is to end up like the student protesters at Tiananmen Square.\n\nThey died for nothing, and were wiped clean from their own people\u2019s history, unable to even serve as martyrs.  The important thing is not that they tried, it is that they failed.",

What's the actionable purpose for the protests?\n\nBLM was about outrage over a terrible event and it succeeded completely at that. Unfortunately there's nothing to really immediately solve about it, because the solution is what... get rid of police?  Well, police was actually defunded in many places and so the protests were successful at that. But it's all so multifaceted because you can't actually totally defund police and you can't magically do reform overnight. \n\nEverything that caused BLM is highly complicated and not really solvable by simple or even big actions. They are solvable over decades, through continued awareness and pressures, which I think BLM was effective at because people STILL talk about it.\n\nWhat America needs now is very very different. There is an actionable solution to this problem. Impeach him and all of his sycophants or tear them from the steps of Congress/WH by force. It's really all there is to it. There's an active rot and problem with this country right now that doesn't require decades long systemic solutions to fix. No long term cultural shifts needed.

Only exception of the three you listed is Ttrump. Even Putin had to work his way up to the top. Xi spent years working as low level party official in the fringes of china. This of course means that applicable candidates for top positions are already rather old just because theyve had to put so much time working within the apparatus to reach that position. \n\nWhile the nature of people is difficult to change the system could be changed so that a person older than, for example, 65, cannot hold any political position to prevent the system turned into home of the geriatrics.

Sure, most of it is in assets, but they still have more cash than most people. Also, they don't need to \"cash out\", not entirely at least. Many of their assets also generate income directly, things like rent and such. These will likely suffer in an economic crash, but as long as they've been living withing their means, they can store up a reserve of cash very quickly. You also have to take into account that a lot of this grabbing up of cheap assets won't just be done by individuals, but by giant investment and financial institutions, which have even more cash to play around with. They also don't care if the market crashes and the \"value\" of their assets go down, because they only actually lose money when they sell. They assume the market will recover, which gives them their old wealth back plus whatever they bought up for pennies.",

Four people started hammering on the broken glass button.  Three people started hammering on the chicken sandwich button and begged the remaining three people to join them so they all wouldn't have to eat broken glass.  The three people who hadn't voted yet looked at all of this, told the chicken sandwich people \"Quit being drama Queens, it's not like they'll actually make us eat broken glass.\" And refused to vote.  \n\nThen, as they were all being force-fed broken glass, they looked at the chicken sandwich people and said \"Well don't blame us!  We didn't make this happen!\"\n\nBut, they did.  They voted through inaction, and made a conscious choice to not prevent the bad outcome when they had the opportunity and ability to do so.",

I don't believe any person should be able to dictate policy that they won't live to witness the consequences of. We need term limits on judges, we need to get rid of judges who are acting in bad faith and actually get impartial people in. We need to get money out of politics and a living wage and Healthcare for everyone across the board. We need to invest in education, with the arts AND the sciences, and we need, as a society, to stop being so individualistic and learn to help one other. A society is judged by how it treats its most vulnerable people, and we've let down so, so, so many of them so many times. And so much more.\n\nPeople who spout nationalist jingo like Trump make the world a smaller place. There shouldn't be any reason for countries to continue to war with each other in an age where we all have the chance to be connected thanks to the internet.
