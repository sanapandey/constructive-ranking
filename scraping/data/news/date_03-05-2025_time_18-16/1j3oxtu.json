If you've got evidence that Trump was complicit, by all means share it. Otherwise you're claiming guilt by association. There are plenty of perfectly valid, well documented, and proven things Trump has done without needing to resort to this. Shit, just within the last month you can probably come up with at least a dozen felonies he's committed personally or been a direct party to. \n\n>The guy who raped a 13 year old girl and told her that her family and her would be physically harmed if not killed?\n\nNever once heard this one. Details please, though I'm inclined to think that if there was any evidence to support it, everyone but Fox News would have run with it.

There's a lot of claims made, but no actual supporting evidence, not even dates for when the alleged rapes took place. Just that some former Epstein employee would corroborate the details. The judge kicked it over to some kind of mediation system, and then all the mailings to the Plaintiff came back as undeliverable. \n\nShe's alleging rape, but trying to file it as a civil rights claim for some reason. If she had basically anything, she would have had no trouble finding a lawyer willing to take this on contingency. For a chance at the lion's share of $100m, there's plenty of lawyers who would have jumped at that and could have concealed her address.\n\nAll I can say on this one is that it's highly plausible based on the accounts of all the other women who've come forward, but the lack of any kind of specifics is concerning. The case was dismissed and all official notices came back as undeliverable. So, it could be anything from someone who just moved on May 1st, 2016, and didn't think to set up a forward with the USPS to someone seeking attention, money, and/or to derail Trump's 2016 campaign.

Would you need to consult with a previous VP before you did your clearly stated duty as an officer of the US?  \n\nThe fact that he had any kind of dilemma at all, speaks to the fact that he would have done it if he thought it would succeed.",
