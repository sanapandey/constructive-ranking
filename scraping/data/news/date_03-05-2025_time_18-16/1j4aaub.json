I mean, do employees work better as sick slaves or better if their families needs are more easily accessible and maintained with a future that progresses vice regresses. The beatings will continue until morale improves - isn\u2019t getting the result they think it gets. Nobody in charge is thinking beyond next week.",

It's not like the US government is offering any loyalty whatsoever--in fact the Thug and his political party have been vilifying them. These people owe zero loyalty to the US. People are butthurt because they want to run the country like a business but freak the fuck out when they reciprocate the lack of loyalty businesses show their employees. Also, POTUS is clearly an employee of an adversary--Russia is an enemy of the US. Full stop. The USAF can stop clutching their pearls. This is the part of the 'find out.' that happens when you fuck the workers and veterans. Better to be working for a country that has a bright future, unlike Russia and the US.",
