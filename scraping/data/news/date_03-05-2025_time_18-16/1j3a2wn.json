We went through the flood of '97 together. We as Manitobans would go to Grand Forks and Fargo for a weekend getaway and we loved it. \n\nBut we Manitobans are so hurt. It's hard to put into words because it's a new feeling for me, but it's just this weird mix of pain and confusion and mourning. What happened? What went so wrong? Why us? \n\nI'm not expecting an apology from you specifically because I'm sure you're a good person and didn't vote Donald into office, I'm just lamenting on the fractured relationship and am feeling a certain kind of way. \n\nI'm sorry that North Dakotans were so willing to sacrifice their special Manitoban bond and love.",

It\u2019s been their plan all along. Trump is just a convenient puppet for the real intelligent and malicious people holding the strings, the people we should also be targeting, who have been the social engineers behind all of this for decades at least. \n\nWe\u2019re ready to lead the charge here, if you all want help or advice\u2026. Come to r/Vermont to ask us what we\u2019ve been doing and you\u2019ll get a lot of good and experienced advice. \n\nNumber one on my list of advice is fostering a sense of community. If you aren\u2019t close knit with your neighbors and fellow town members, it certainly feels hopeless because you feel alone. Bringing your community together is always step one. It gives you something to fight for and you will feel emboldened. Organize groups in your area first, familiarize yourself with what\u2019s going on in the community. \n\nYou might not be able to do that on Reddit. Vermont is unique in that everyone knows everyone knows everyone. We\u2019re all about 2 or 3 degrees of separation from eachother so organizing comes easily to us. You don\u2019t have to focus on your entire state. Start small and organize people in your towns/ cities. Create groups through messaging apps and social media. We\u2019re all using encrypted apps for an added layer of safety. Talk about what you can provide for one another, and what resources / skills you\u2019re willing to bring to the table. \n\nIf you all want change, that means YOU are the only ones who will be able to facilitate that change. Don\u2019t wait for someone to do it for you. There\u2019s no one to do it for us right now. No one person or country. As the divide deepens and they continue to alienate us from every potential or past ally, we will be isolated further from eachother. Isolation is one of the main goals of these people. When we\u2019re together, we\u2019re so much stronger. We aren\u2019t going to get a hero to save us. We have to be that for ourselves",

It's a mix of State governments being Red (New Hampshire), Federal reps/senators being Democrat (VT, NH, some of Maine) and some Federal Republicans (Maine has the infamous Susan Collins). Plus Maine has a Democrat governor and Vermont has a Republican governor.\n\nRegardless, the only way Trump supporters will learn their lesson is to feel the pain. We've seen it already. /r/LeopardsAteMyFace has so many examples of people realizing *they* will be impacted by the Trump administration. And they tend to change their tune. I think it was Joe Exotic (of Tiger King fame) who recently had his boyfriend deported and suddenly doesn't like what Trump is doing. More of that is necessary if we're going to see any real change or push back against Trump. Republicans control our Federal government and we need Republicans to push back on their Reps and Senators. It's happening but the pressure will need to be cranked up to see any results. So if Trump is going to be an idiot and throw our allies under the bus, we need them to fight back. Trump's a dumbass bully who caves whenever people push back hard.",

He is uninterested in allies and friendships, because those relationships mean he's not winning and therefore must be losing. Dividing and hating are simply the consequences for everyone who's not letting him \"win\".\n\nMost international cooperation, such as trade, is a positive sum game where both sides can win. Trump only sees that as an opportunity for him to take more until the other side is losing.\n\nTrump's power through force and threats is alienating the US from the rest of the world as other countries find new allies and trade partners. Long term, the US will lose out on the positive sum game of international trade and have reduced relationships, if any, with military allies.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the effects of Trump's decisions will take years to materialize. In the short term, trade partners will capitulate in order to keep their economies strong, then leave once they have better trade partners.

You can vote for anyone who qualifies for the ballot in your state. In my states there were like 6 different names listed for the presidency.  If your not a democrat you dont have to vote for their candidate. But its important to realize we unfortunately live in a 2 party system. \n\nYoure originally were talking about how unpopular Clinton was in the party. Now your saying thats not what you meant. You meant unpopular with the general. So again im confused why you thibk a party should let anyone who wants vote for their candidate selection. \n\nPersonally i would aggressively support changes to the US electoral system to eliminate a 2 party system. However until that day you gotta play in tbe system you have. \n\nTo show you my imagination, here are my reforms from easiest to hardest. \n\nCongress set the law of single member districts. Congress can change that law to mandate state by state PR for congressmen. That would fully eliminate gerrymandering. \n\nThe interstate popular vote compact would if enough states sign on garuntee that who ever wins the most votes becomes president. \n\nCongress also defines SCOTUS. I would like to see them Pass FDRs plan which would allow the president to appoint a new justice whenever a sitting justice reached the age of 70. \n\nMore difficult would require constitutional ammendments. Id like to eliminate the senate, and change from a presidential system to a parliamentary system.  Which i believe with a switch to PR on at least a state by state basis would foster additional political parties entering government. Also imo parliamentary systems seem to be mpre resistant to demogouges than a presidential system.\n\nEdit.  And those reforms are without me even getting into reforms to campaign finance.",

That's a given. But the democrats are never going to win those people back by calling them idiots and screaming that they're responsible for Trump. The democrats have to come up with a plan and exciting policies to bring them back. Even if it's not feasible because of Republicans obstruction, stuff like M4A has to be championed and made to be a key platform policy, just being not Trump is NOT ENOUGH ANYMORE. They need to actually let the younger members into leadership and begin to dictate policy. The party leadership has to get this through their heads, but everything over the last month indicates they can't or won't.\n\nUntil they do I'm not donating to anyone but AOC on the federal level and I encourage others to do the same. If she has too much money she will become an arbiter of the extra funds. It's a way to force her into more powerful positions, because when the dems have to go to her on bended knee for campaign funding she can start to swing it around more and force them to capitulate.",

Even if you assume that Trump won every part of that 2.8 million out of the lost 6.8 million (unlikely) that still leaves 4 million who just didn't show up.\n\nPeople who didn't vote were still more of a decisive factor than white voters without college degrees -- who by the way are the GOP's most hardcore base.  Comparing the racial demographics of the election, white non-college voters for Trump only increased 1% while college educated whites went down 4%.  \n\n[The major losses were 24-45% less Harris voters among Black and Hispanic voters.](https://navigatorresearch.org/2024-post-election-survey-racial-analysis-of-2024-election-results/)  This was largely about inflation and jobs, with immigration being largely unimportant to those demographcis.  The narrative that this was largely about Gaza is very incorrect and is basically a huge dose of copium from Reddit, looking to deflect blame to people they see as unreasonable.  Few voters of any demographic had it as a top issue.\n\nThe major deciding factor is that Americans largely don't understand the economy.  Supply chain issues and the tight labor market due to efforts to keep people employed were the major contributing factors to inflation, which was the top issue.  The pandemic knocked Trump out of office, and the difficulties of dealing with its aftermath is largely what swept him back in.",

Independent voters are the voters that least identify with a party and are most likely to simply sit out an election if they don't have anything to make them feel strongly about one of the candidates.\n\nMost independent voters are not true swing voters, though.  The swing voter is mostly a myth.  Elections are mostly won on turnout of each party's loyalists, not by how much of \"the other side\" or the moderates you can convince, and that is largely driven by how angry they are at the other party (first) and at their own (second).  People vote with their culture, and culture is not really something that swings without major life shifts and demographic changes.  For the most part, independent voters are simply those that reject marking down a party affiliation, not true moderates, or people who are basically completely disconnected from politics and only vote situationally.\n\nThat said, there is an overall trend that higher voter turnout means more people voting Democrat, because the most fickle voting groups -- young people and poorer minority voters -- swing heavily towards the Democrats.  2020 has the higher voter turnout of any election, and 2024 (which was still a year for strong turnout) had signficantly less.\n\nRoughly 4 million less, as it turns out.",

Not because Republicans wouldn't do that, but because it doesn't matter: Republicans are gonna do that anyway. They already are.\n\n> Even if we ignore the fact that most teachers aren't making enough money to strike for months\n\nI'm not suggesting a months-long strike. But at a certain point, people have to accept hardship in order to do something like this. It wouldn't just be teachers hurting, it'd be everybody, which is the whole point - preventing parents from going to work, shutting down businesses all over the country, having a huge impact on the economy. Everybody is going to be hurting anyway as Trump sells off the country to the highest bidder, so what's better: sitting on hands and letting it happen, or trying to do something about it?\n\n> They both forcibly ended strikes with legislation in recent years when it threatened the economy\n\nThis legislation only matters if it's actually enforced. For the most part it is a scare tactic. \n\n> Congress would declare the strike illegal and those who refuse to return to work would be fired and jailed\n\nMany teachers' strikes have been declared illegal and then they took it to court and it turned out otherwise. Additionally, it being illegal doesn't matter if they stand together strong. In Kentucky they had teacher strikes not too long ago, the state declared them illegal and said they would arrest and jail teachers who did not capitulate. The unions said fuck you, stood strong, and they got much of what they wanted in the end.\n\n> And do you really think they wouldn't take the opportunity to imprison the \"woke\" teachers who are \"indoctrinating\" their kids?\n\nAgain, if they are willing to go there, then this is the kind of thing they're gonna do with or without an \"excuse\". They'll manufacture whatever \"excuse\" they need.",

Steam power plants only have a small amount of \"spinning spare\" which is ability to take on sudden load changes. Other sources are faster or slower to bring online. You can bring up a gas turbine set fast, but it costs a lot more to run, so you don't use it for base load. Hydroelectric is fast to bring up, you open the control valves and power starts flowing in a few seconds. There is more than enough gas turbine power to cover what the Canadian hydro power could cover. But it will cost more to run, and it wears out a lot faster. Gas turbines last a long time, but not as long as hydro plants. So DC is unlikely to lose power, unless the system is mismanaged. But it will cost more to run, and natural gas suppliers may take this opportunity to bone the electric customers, like they did in Texas.",

Potash is another HUGE one.\n\nCanada will also probably do what it was planning to do before -- target industries that support the red states. Some of those states have almost nothing going on aside from a few large companies doing business there, and targeting them specifically can really put the hurt on red states and Trump nuts. This strategy is especially important because we in Canada realize it isn't all Americans who want this or support this; most don't. It's a boneheaded move that hurts everybody, and we would rather target the problem as directly as possible.\n\nThe Republicans and Trump's administration are a cancer on the US; when someone has cancer, you give them targeted radiation. Actually part of the problem is that when it comes to red states, their biggest employers are often health insurance/healthcare companies that are already sucking their own residents dry, and we can't really target them effectively.",
