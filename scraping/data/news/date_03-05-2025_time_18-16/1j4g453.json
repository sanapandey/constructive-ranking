Candidate X going from 54% in March to 49% in November doesn't mean the March poll was wrong -- it means opinions shifted. And when you have multiple pollsters, each with their own methodology and turnout model, you're going to get a lot of different results.  \n  \nPoll also have a pretty wide margin of error, considering how tight recent elections have been. The strongest polls have a margin of error around 3%, which means **each** of the reported numbers could be wrong by up to 3% in **either** direction. If you see a poll showing Candidate X at 50% and Candidate Y at 48%, the actual truth is that Candidate X could be anywhere between 47-53% and Candidate Y could be anywhere between 45% and 51%.\n\nThe average margin of victory in a battleground state in 2024 was 2.87%. That's well within the margin of error for even the best of polls -- and all the reporting before the election said as much. The election was functionally a toss-up. In the end, swing state polling ended up underestimating Trump by around 3%. That's at the high end of the margin of error, but still accurate.\n\nIt's true, pollsters are still trying to figure out how to accurately capture and model the new American electorate, but they've actually done remarkably well considering how bad things were in 2016. But much of the anger towards pollsters is coming from people who treat the results as written gospel -- they see Harris 49% Trump 47% and assume that means a Harris win. But that's not what the poll is saying.",
