These things have been decried by legal scholars for decades as glaring and outdated flaws in the modern world. \n\nHaving a vague patchwork of enumerated powers that ends up being based on 250 years of \"interpretations\" setting precedents more than the vague clauses in the original constitution is a super dogshit system of government and it should be a surprise to no one that this much executive abuse is so easy to get away with in America.",

Instead he spent more than any other president before him in just FOUR years WHILE lowering taxes to pay for spending. That isn't even counting COVID spending. Just actually think about it for more than ten seconds. They like to throw around big numbers to scare the uninformed. Like when talking about wasteful spending, he reduced a ocean health monitoring fund to \"treadmills for shrimp\", removing all context. And people just believe him because when you reduce it to that level, yeah it is going to sound dumb. If you TRULY care about America, you would reject reductionism and anti-intellectualism that is plaguing American society and the current government. We ALL lose if society just becomes crabs in a bucket that truly think government is spending millions of dollars on shrimp treadmills.",

The biggest middle finger which went way beyond what most people thought would happen, was when actions that occur as part of explicit powers can't even be used as evidence to determine if the president committed a crime.\n\nI can at least see why someone would argue you can't charge Trump with criminal conspiracy for his conversation with Barr, but not even being able to use that as evidence for other crimes he may have committed is completely insane. That statement is what led to much of Smith's case to switch gears: he could probably have dealt with not charging Trump for the Barr conversation, but not even being able to use anything he did while carrying out a \"conclusive [or] preclusive\" act as evidence was devastating.",

That is, she's a strict constitutionalist / originalist.\n\nWhile sometimes (often times) I disagree with such interpretations of the law, she is at least fairly consistent with it, which means she will on occassion side with the liberal justices. Especially on several LGBTQ issues which has been nice (while she wasn't part of Bostock vs. Clayton, she has often voted to reject hearing many cases related to LGBTQ issues, which left the lower courts' decisions in line with anti-discrimination in place). \n\nUnlike the \"new\" conservatives like Alito and Thomas and the sex predator who likes beer, who don't really have any principles. They will change/bend their interpretation as they please to suit their agenda. It's less that their school of interpretation guides their conclusions so much as that their pre-concieved conclusions dictate which school of interpretation to use to support it.\n\nI still don't like ACB, but she's a fairly loose jenga if you can argue a case that aligns with her philosophy. It gives me some hope that the upcoming US vs. Skrmetti as well as other legal challenges to the Trump admin will be correctly decided. Roberts and Gorsuch also fall into similar descriptions (e.g. they were part of majority in Bostock vs. Clayton, with Gorsuch even writing the majority opinion), so along with three liberal justices, just getting any two of Barett, Gorsuch, or Roberts will win cases.\n\nPost-edit: And further to ACB's credit, she also was the lone conservative justice who didn't rule against the EPA/Clean Water Act in the very recent City of SF vs. the EPA decision and wrote the dissenting opinion. She is a tricky one to nail down how she will sway.",

They are very left leaning but they still shit on the liberal justices when they are being morons too. My friend has been recommending this podcast to me for years and I thought it would be a lot longer episodes and very dry, I also thought I would just get pissed off listening to it. I will say the episodes are a lot shorter than I imagined (~45 mins) the hosts are very knowledgeable and very funny and have amazing chemistry. I will also say that it for sure does piss me off listening to what happened in each case and the reasonings behind the decisions. Especially the Castle Rock vs. Gonzales one\u2026..",
