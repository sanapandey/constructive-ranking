They actually believe that they're steering away from an American collapse similar to the USSR where their empire buckled under the weight of endless foreign wars, unchecked spending, and an unwieldy corrupt bureaucracy that consistently struggled to self-police (particularly spending). In some ways I agree that American exceptionalism can lead to some fairly poor choices regarding spending and debt.\n\nthat said Thiel's basic premise may have merit but his approach of burning the whole system down and marketing it as a \"reformation\" shows these guys don't truly know themselves. They look in the mirror and see themselves \"saving\" America, but deep in their subconscious they feel they should rightfully be in power as opposed to the IC and bureaucratic core of America. They're power hungry, and look at oligarchs in other countries and are  jealous of their power and wealth. They simply lack the self awareness to admit their own desire for more power and less oversight.\n\nFWIW I think the petrodollar is the lynchpin of our current spending policy, and I do worry that will only enhance our dependence on oil supremacy. The left definitely can't have it both ways. You can't spend trillions a year while also playing make believe that we're going to phase out oil. Oil is the only reason we can spend as much as we do.\n\nWhile most Americans oppose grift/fraud and probably don't support the degree of US meddling, as others have pointed out the average person (even in the business community filled with fairly smart people) also lacks the broader contextual understanding of how Pax Americana benefits them directly. They just see their taxes going into a black hole and hearing bureaucrats say \"trust us.\"\n\nThis is exactly what I always feared about the American experiment - that it would default to a populist nutjob in absence of genuine bipartisan solution-finding out of desperation for fixes that never seem to come with mainstream politicians at the helm. Say what you will about the Democrats being the \"lesser of two evils\" but the last two election cycles they've struggled to find someone who is both electable and has the political willpower to upend what is undoubtedly a system that increasingly needed reform. As they say, if you don't do the hard part yourself, someone may come in an do it for you.\n\nThat said if you want to know what Trump's motivations are, just look at how he is treating Russia. IMO the man is compromised. There is no reason to stop assisting Ukraine with intelligence sharing (for example), even in the midst of broader FoPo negotiations.",

The left definitely can't have it both ways. You can't spend trillions a year while also playing make believe that we're going to phase out oil. Oil is the only reason we can spend as much as we do.\n\nIt really didn't have to be that way. China has been consolidating control of the mineral resources needed for renewable energy production.",

Which is kind of absurd to any student of history. \n\nThe kindest way to describe it was \u201cenlightened self interest\u201d on Americas part with the idea being to cement and maintain Americas economic, political and military hegemony. The rest of the free world went along with it after WWII pretty much because they\u2019d been mostly heavily bombed to one degree or another and it beat the alternative (Russia). \n\nFor *seventy years* every single U.S. administration both Democrat and Republican saw the clear benefits of maintaining it until Trump and his cronies came along. Those cheering this on or believing somehow America was hard done by are going to have some painful lessons to learn by-and-by. This is going absolutely going to hurt Americas economy, security and influence - probably a lot quicker than they might imagine. And all the while Russia and China are going to be quietly laughing their asses off. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if all this is going to go so far as to stop the dollar being the world\u2019s reserve currency - or reduce it in status to one of several contenders - but it just might, which would have sounded ridiculous only a few months ago.

I claimed that subsequent offers would have resulted in less loss of land than a current offer.  \n\nOriginally Russia wanted just the Donbas (two oblasts), and yes you could argue they may have started another war for more later, but let's just look at the actual offers rather than fretting about could-have-beens.  \n\nThe next offer was just for a ceasefire, not a peace agreement, and for that they wanted four oblasts, some of which as you pointed out they don't currently control.  Likely they would have asked for more than that for a full peace agreement, but not half the country.  \n\nNow at this point I suspect the ask will be substantially larger, probably including all the oblasts along the Russian border, which is 7 total, with the possibility of asking for everything east of the Dnipro which is 9 total, or possibly wanting Odessa as well since Russians really love that city and want a land-bridge to Moldova.\n\n**2 to 4 to 7-9 is a big degradation in territorial integrity.**",

He has to gain directly from the relationship, take honor from his enemy in the negotiation, and look victorious to the media.\n\nUltimately I think it's either Trump bowing to Putin (unwillingly or humbly), or Trumps incredibly narcissistic and insane view of negotiation that's the only possible scenario here.",

Unfortunately, I don't think it's likely.\n\nFascists don't tend to like breaking up their empire. Musk and the other oligarchs know full well that their billions mostly come from the income of blue states, whereas red states are merely their brainwashed cannon fodder and pawns. The source of their power comes from being able to subvert the will of their revenue-producing states by lying and stoking the fears of the states that bring fuck-all to the table. They will fight the secession of blue states tooth and nail.\n\nThat's why they can afford to constantly insult blue states: Those states are still bound by law to pay into the corrupted power structure of the officially non-democratic US government. The billionaires get most of their power and income from said corrupted government, whether through favorable (lack of) regulations, tax breaks, or outright nepotism (as with Starlink). They can still leach off the still-existing institutions and economies of blue states while keeping the red states obedient and docile by telling them blue states are to blame for all their problems.\n\nFuck the oligarchs. They're evil and stupid. I don't know how or what it'll take, but we have to fuck them up to survive.",

The GOP now belongs to trump.\n\nBut their overall goal is the same.\n\nKleptocracy.\n\nPutin became one of the richest people in the world by stealing from Russians first. The Russian oligarchs used perestroika to privatize all the assets of the USSR by stealing them from the hands of the decent people because that\u2019s what predators do.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a political problem. We have a predator problem. Like murder hornets that invade a beehive and destroy a bee every 14 seconds until the hive collapses the oligarchs want to move into the United States and do the same because none of them want to live in Russia.\n\nWho would? after all, it was destroyed by oligarchs and nobody steps away from the mob, they get retired through violent means.\n\nBut all these oligarchs are old now and know they can\u2019t keep ahead of the slightly more violent and ambitious lion cub beneath them who is growing tired of paying the old man when he does all the dirty work.\n\nThe soviet oligarchs ate Russia to death with their greed. Then Ukraine. Now they are designing a perestroika 2.0 to put 330 million Americans into real estate default so they can come in and buy everything up at 3 cents on the dollar. Trump just enabled them.\n\nIt\u2019s the collapse of the USSR, American edition using the naive and compromised GOP as their assault force, But your slave masters are the same. The 3% that are so devoid of empathy that they put their wealth above everything else\n\nKolomoisky was the putin puppet in Ukraine that bought most of downtown Cleveland.\n\nBefore that he started privatbank which was taking IMF loans which the oligarchs would loan to themselves and never repay.\n\nWhen the IMF figured it out they tried to force Zelensky to have the Ukrainian people pay it back before they would extend any more aid.\n\nKolomoisky wasn\u2019t alone. He was just the crossroads between Rudy Giuliani, trump and Kushner.\n\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/inside-anatevka-the-curious-chabad-hamlet-in-ukraine-where-giuliani-is-mayor/\n\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/giuliani-associates-leveraged-gop-access-to-seek-ukraine-gas-deal/\n\nWhen Ukraine arrested him last year for corruption it cracked the whole network open.\n\nTrump can\u2019t stop lying now or his MAGA base tears him apart when they realize he is literally the man who stole the world.\n\nTrump is a pathological liar. But lying is an expensive habit. If you tell the truth, you can say it once and it\u2019s finished. You have expelled all the energy necessary for it to stand on its own for eternity.\n\nLying requires infinite and exponentially more energy input in the form of more lies, bribes, extortion and murder to keep it covered.\n\nTrump is now testing this theory on a worldwide scale.\n\nPutin is tied to him by the purse strings and so is everyone who pushes Putin\u2019s narrative because puppet strings work both directions. Why would any sane human push a psychopaths lies unless they are heavily invested in it?\n\nThe difference is, this is the first time in known human history that the Information Age happened. You can hide your neighborhood bullshit in 1980. It\u2019s harder in 2000. By 2024 the internet knows more about a narcissistic oligarchs movements than he knows about himself.\n\nIt\u2019s just a matter of organizing that data.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t self regulate their greed.

Not one single thing you said there was a valid way to pressure Russia into negotiations.  \n\nNow as far as \"giving up\" stuff preemptively, yes, Trump is trying to lure them to the negotiating table with a sweet deal that gives them what they want most, without giving them the entire country hopefully.  Why should Putin negotiate?  Because wars are costly in money and lives, so if Putin can get what he wants most tomorrow for free, he'll likely be willing to stop without taking all of Ukraine.  That's how surrender has always worked in wars of conquest, you pay the invader to stop or go away rather than fighting to the death and making their victory a pyrrhic one.  \n\nIs losing part of Ukraine pleasant? No. Is living to fight another day the practical choice? Absolutely. It should have been Zelensky's call two years ago if he was intelligent and cared about his people. Three years ago if he was smart, selfless, and had foresight.",

We did some deep strikes in Russia and after that happened they changed their laws to essentially hold us accountable for Ukraine doing that.  \n\nThey might ignore a little bit more of it, but if we did it enough to threaten their war effort they'd be forced to hit back at us directly.

It would have been a clean way to wash our hands of the conflict, rather than Biden surging support after being voted out to screw with Trump's plan to pressure Ukraine.  \n\nThat said, I think you overestimate Ukraine's value or the longevity of the impact.  You can look at what Europe is doing for example - they're preparing to spend the better part of a trillion dollars revamping their own militaries.  If Ukraine was important they'd be dumping that much money into Ukraine to spite us and fill the gap left by us pulling support, but they aren't.  Because no one has an actual defense alliance with Ukraine, it was just a useful way to bleed Russia for a bit, and now it's an expensive money pit so everyone is washing their hands of it and blaming each other to avoid looking like the bad guy for cutting them loose.",

In November 2019, a jury convicted him on all seven felony counts. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison. On July 10, 2020, days before Stone was scheduled to report to prison, Trump commuted his sentence. On August 17, 2020, he dropped the appeal of his convictions.
