He got enough people to support him when it actually mattered (election) but right now even a good chunk of his voters have began to realize he\u2019s not to be trusted. That\u2019s why I say only about 1/4, a minority, are currently still in that full MAGA support crowd. You\u2019re counting non-voters & just anyone who didn\u2019t vote for Kamala & arguing that those people fit in the same demographic I\u2019m talking about. While I may disagree with those who didn\u2019t vote for Kamala for whatever reason, lumping those people in as part of the MAGA crowd is just way too polarizing. Plus, what I\u2019m saying is even some of what *was* the actual MAGA crowd now has regrets for voting him in.\n\nI\u2019m not talking about who voted or didn\u2019t vote for who, I\u2019m talking about the amount of people in our country *currently* opposing him vs supporting him. Right now it\u2019s a minority that still supports him. Yes, the majority let this happen one way or another, but it\u2019s a *good* thing that now even his previous supporters are turning against him. We can\u2019t go back in time & change things, so it\u2019s best to address the present & find ways to combat things now & in the future, & welcoming his voters who have turned against him help us build a stronger collective resistance to this regime. Remember, it\u2019s not us vs. each other or left vs. right, it\u2019s us vs. them, the top vs. bottom. Let\u2019s not get too distracted pointing fingers to other everyday Americans, most of them at this point realize how terrible this is. Being pitted against each other just takes away from any potential we have to still have any impact.",

Which will further hurt the ability of these communities to compete in education, ecommerce, and other areas.\u00a0\n\nAnother ultimately dumbass populist policy of his: pulling all American liquor from their shelves, as opposed to the far more intelligent strategy in BC of pulling liquor only from states that support trump. Hurting the economies of blue states increases the chance of them flipping red in the midterms, giving Trump even more power to enforce his agenda.\n\n\nI really hate populist politicians like Trump and Ford, they blow with the political wind and keep getting away with it thanks to soundbites, feel good but illogical policy, and voter short term memory.",
