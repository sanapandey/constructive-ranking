Wasn\u2019t there a damning public letter signed by a not insignificant number of 3-4 Star Generals and Admirals?  \n\nThere are VSOs speaking up, sending letters and call scripts to vets to contact their representatives and push back against Trump and the MAGA agenda, fighting disinformation directly to veterans, and more.  You probably don\u2019t see it because it doesn\u2019t sound like you run in those circles or are in those organizations.  Many of us are actively pushing back against the people we fought, bled and lost with to try and de-radicalize them just the same way that we push back against family members and religious organizations, reminding them they were all DEI hired if we ever check the veteran box on an application.  None of this is televised/reported because it\u2019s not good television, and it\u2019s such a small part of the population that it doesn\u2019t matter.  When it does happen, like the former top brass publicly stepping out, it gets squashed by conservative media and spun as unpatriotic, soft, woke, etc.  Getting the PACT act passed to help vets took a very tenacious celebrity working for years and tying it in with 9/11 support, and it only got any kind of coverage once it was close enough and politically relevant to talk about.\n\nThere\u2019s a MUCH bigger conversation about the lip service glorification of military service and veteran status, the grooming and preying on young kids in low-income, often rural conservative areas of the country who are enticed with benefits that give them longer boot starts to pull themselves up by, but further indoctrinate them and radicalize them in echo chambers where they\u2019re legally unable to speak out about their government (as a service member and in uniform) because of their employment status, but also don\u2019t want to advocate against their own employment, and then drop them with, until recently, deplorable transition assistance back to civilian life with a dearth of meaningful social, mental and physical retraining and support.  \n\nIt\u2019d be real easy to just reply GFYS to you.  It\u2019s what I wanted to do.  But many of us put more time and effort into what we\u2019re doing and what we care for and stand for, and that response doesn\u2019t get people care, something I\u2019ve learned from trying to reason with my fellow vets.  Still, I don\u2019t expect you to have read this far or actually care, so I\u2019ll just GFMS anyway.  Semper I, right?",

My comment was a bit harsh and looking back on it, I can definitely see where some might have seen it as cruel. However, I need to say that my sentiment can be applied on all of us as Americans. I\u2019ve heard some people say, \u201cwe deserve better than Trump\u201d and I have said the same thing: do we? We as a society have allowed the ignorance that has led to Trump to fester. We have become cold, selfish, overtly privileged and complacent. Many of us have lost our fight. I come from a place of a lot of frustration. I live in the south, so it am surrounded by Trump sycophants. My father is a veteran and I see every day how this admin is fucking him over and destroying he and my mother. He of course is a Trump voting republican, though. He has no retirement despite working his ass off ever since I was little and much of that is due to the hard financial years we lived through under Bush and the recession that took place as a result of republicans that absolutely tanked my parents savings. It\u2019s so infuriating to see he and other vets I know who live in poverty and with not a dime to their damn name, but they are so bought into the very shit that is continuing to destroy them. It\u2019s just exhausting. \n\nI do want to clarify that my comment was not as a means to demand that all vets be punished for the transgressions of a few, but I also know that we will never do better if all of us don\u2019t wake the fuck up.",

Those are the bedrock of America. Trump may be slinging executive orders at the constitution, trying to undermine it, but he hasn\u2019t succeeded. If he ever succeeds, and the constitution and democracy are broken, there WILL be a revolution.\n\n\u201cPrudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.\u201d",
