            "body": "Governor Greg \"Wheels\" Abbott refused to sign the water restoration declaration put before him that would have allowed millions of gallons of water, from excess rain and snow melt from the North, to flow daily into many parts of Texas including the areas that are currently burning in a virtually apocalyptic way. He wanted to protect an essentially worthless thing like \"wrongful censorship on social media platforms\"(it didn't work!), but didn't care about the people of Texas. Now the ultimate price is being paid. I will demand that this incompetent Governor allow beautiful, clean, fresh water to FLOW INTO TEXAS! He is the blame for this. On top of it all, no water for fire hydrants, not firefighting planes. A true disaster!",
