            "body": ">The lawsuit comes days after the Board of Regents banned on-campus drag shows across the 11 universities in the A&M System, including the flagship campus in College Station. The resolution, passed unanimously by the regents last Friday, said drag shows were \u201cinconsistent with the system\u2019s mission and core values of its universities, including the value of respect for others.\u201d \n\nReally wish they would elaborate more on how drag shows *specifically* violate their \"mission and core values\". Really seems not that different than theater, musicals, etc which is historically filled with dressing up as the opposite gender. It's all in good fun, so what's the problem?",

I mean, it's not the sort of thing I'd go out of my way to see, but I can always just... you know... not attend. When I was in college there would occasionally be some wandering preacher guy who'd show up on campus for a couple days. I wasn't really interested in his message, so I just kept walking. A very simple and elegant solution that didn't involve me trying to impose my personal beliefs on anyone else. I just would have appreciated someone from the campus security doing a bit of crowd control since people listening would often block the entire sidewalk which was a major thoroughfare.\n\nAnd honestly, nothing beats the name of a SF group: The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence",
