Russia NOW is using donkeys instead of vans for resupply and they're using dirt bikes and golf carts to go into battle.\n\n\nFrom the very beginning the estimate was Russia could only keep this up until around late 2025 to 2026. Russia's stocks of tanks is dropping fast. Their ability to produce anything is increasingly limited. They literally can't keep this up.\n\n\nI have a feeling the \"plan\" Europe, Australia, and Canada are putting together basically amounts to scraping together enough to let Ukraine run through this year and then at some point have a coalition just sort of come in and mop up the rest.",
