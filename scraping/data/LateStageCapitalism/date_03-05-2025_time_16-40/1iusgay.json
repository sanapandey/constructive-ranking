Of the handful of others I tried, the only one that actually had the element as the first result was \"Pb\" for lead. Every search for the the elemental abbreviation and \"element\" turned up the element's Wikipedia page as the first result, for reference. But unless you want to try and claim that there is a capitalist conspiracy to hide helium and hydrogen behind the pronoun \"He\" and the letter \"H\", maybe you should just be impressed that the second thing the person you walked up to and shouted \"Fe!\" at was the element.\n\nAnd I don't want to leave this just implied, but Google has absolutely made their product measurably worse in the last few years. But I don't think this qualifies as an example of that.",
