The fact is that millions of working class people have already been disabled by long COVID. This number will continue to grow, and more rapidly as the less precautions are taken. When these people become disabled, the Capital owners do not care if they can no longer work, they are content to let them go homeless on the street. \n\nAnd things are only going to get worse under RFK and the trump admin, who are cutting every public health measure they can.

Properly fitted N95 respirators protect you from contracting illness. If you\u2019re sick, they help prevent you from transmitting illness to others. Consistent public masking (not just at work or transit, but at bars, home get-togethers, basically anywhere spread or exposure could happen) is the key.\n\nPLEASE START MASKING AGAIN! We cannot physically or financially afford to be getting each other sick!!! \n\nNo one should have ever listened to Biden or the CDC when they told us we could unmask + \u201cvax & relax\u201d they were so, so horribly wrong and they did it all for capitalism.

How will they fight the billionaires when they are evicted and living on the street?\n\nAnyone who considers themselves a leftist/socialist/communist, can and should be doing all they can to stop the spread of this disease that is ravaging the working class. And the easiest way to do this, is by wearing an N95 in shared spaces. \n\n\"At the pandemic\u2019s onset, approximately 10% of people who suffered COVID-19 infections went on to develop Long COVID. Now, the risk of getting Long COVID has dropped to about 3.5% among vaccinated people (primary series). While this is a considerable decline, over 1.3 million Americans are still becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 every day. \u201cYou do the math\u20143 to 4% of those people is a huge number of potential Long COVID patients being added to the roster,\u201d says Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of Research and Development Service at Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System and the study\u2019s senior author.\" (https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-vaccines-reduce-long-covid-risk-new-study-shows)\n\n\"For example, a recent Yale-led study found that up to 14% of 3,500 Long COVID patients surveyed in the US had not returned to work three months after getting sick. (To date, 20 million Americans have been diagnosed with Long COVID.) The research team also found that nearly one in 10 Long COVID patients suffered from five or more symptoms. These participants\u2014which included young, previously healthy individuals\u2014were twice as likely to be unable to return to work within three months compared to those without symptoms.\" (https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-keeps-people-out-of-work-and-hurts-the-economy)",
