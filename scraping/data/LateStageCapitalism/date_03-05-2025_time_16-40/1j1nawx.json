    "selftext": "It basically boils down to \"pick from this predetermined list\" over and over again. The people do not decide what issues are relevant to them, the pick the best they can from predetermined options. There is no \"by the people for people\" at all. Pick from this list of candidates for the primaries - here is a debate to manipulate you a bit. Pick from these candidates - red or blue - see who \"best\" represents you, not what you want from your government. Why would the majority of people vote against public Healthcare if the majority of people are in need of Healthcare, and can't afford it? This is unsustainable - we need another solution.",

            "body": " The U.S. isn't just at war\u2014it is waging a global jihad, a never-ending crusade cloaked in the language of democracy, freedom, and security. This war is not about defense; it is a religious-like commitment to dominance, rooted in the neoconservative doctrine shaped by Leo Strauss.  \n\nJust like extremist movements justify violence through divine mandates, the American empire manufactures moral crusades to justify its military-industrial complex. The enemies change\u2014communism, terrorism, authoritarianism\u2014but the mission remains the same: unchallenged hegemony through eternal conflict.  \n\nNeoconservatism: America\u2019s Jihadi Ideology  \n\nNeoconservatives are the clerics of this state jihad, and their ideology is based on the writings of Leo Strauss, the philosopher who inspired them to believe in the necessity of deception, war, and elite rule.  \n\nThe \"Noble Lie\" \u2013 America\u2019s Fatwa for War  \n\nStrauss argued that rulers must sometimes lie to their people for the greater good. Neocons took this idea and ran with it, crafting mythologies to justify war:  \n- Iraq War: \"Weapons of Mass Destruction\" (never found)  \n- War on Terror: \"They hate us for our freedom\"  \n- Cold War: \"Stopping the spread of communism\"  \n- Ukraine: \"Defending democracy\"  \n\nEach war is sold as an existential struggle, much like a holy war, demanding absolute loyalty and unquestioning belief.  \n\n Perpetual Conflict \u2013 The Sacred War Doctrine  \n\nIn traditional jihadist ideology, war against the infidel never truly ends\u2014it must be waged until the entire world submits. The U.S. follows a similar logic, only with capitalism and military dominance as the creed.  \n- 750+ military bases worldwide  \n- Regime change operations in 64 countries  \n- 107 wars and military interventions  \n\nThe military-industrial complex is the caliphate, always seeking expansion, always needing new enemies to justify its existence.  \n\nSuppressing Dissent \u2013 America\u2019s Heresy Trials  \n\nLike any theocratic regime, the U.S. silences heretics who question its war doctrine.  \n- Julian Assange: Persecuted for exposing war crimes  \n- Black Panthers & Anti-War Leaders: Assassinated, imprisoned, or discredited  \n- Socialists & Anti-Imperialists: Targeted by COINTELPRO and Homeland Security  \n\nMeanwhile, white supremacist militias, religious fundamentalists, and corporate elites are free to operate because they do not challenge the state\u2019s jihadist mission\u2014they reinforce it.  \n\nThe War Economy \u2013 Sacrifices for the Cause  \n\nJihadists promise their followers rewards in the afterlife. The U.S. government promises freedom and security\u2014but only delivers economic devastation and mass surveillance.  \n- Trillions spent on war while Americans drown in debt and poverty  \n- For-profit prisons keep \"undesirables\" locked up  \n- Police forces militarized to suppress domestic \"insurgencies\"  \n\nEvery dollar spent on bombs is a dollar not spent on healthcare, education, or infrastructure. This is the sacrifice the people must make for the holy war.  \n\nConclusion: The Jihad Must End  \n\nThe U.S. has become a militant theocracy, where war is sacred and dissent is blasphemy. The neoconservative crusaders who dictate policy\u2014funded by the military-industrial priesthood\u2014will never stop unless they are forced to.  \n\nThe question is: Will Americans continue to be foot soldiers in this endless war, or will they reject the holy lies that have kept them enslaved?",
