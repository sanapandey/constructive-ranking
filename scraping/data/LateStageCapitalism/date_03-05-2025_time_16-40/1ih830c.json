Let's not forget, the west was very buddy buddy with the apartheid government until it became untenable.\n\nThirdly, we like to think of ourselves as a mediator state, one which looks to end conflicts through diplomatic, or legal channels.\n\nFourth, we have great lawyers.\n\nFifth, given our history, human rights is rather important to us.
