Piketty, aware that Kjos is talking about wealth taxes, asks him about his net worth and the amount he pays in taxes. Both questions go unanswered, leaving Piketty speechless.\n\nSource: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdWfEozTOQg&ab\\_channel=Skavlan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdWfEozTOQg&ab_channel=Skavlan)",

But neither ALWAYS mean negative, it definitely is a word that is neutral and we use it more often negative today.  Agreed and I feel like that was always stated, but that isn't all it is!\n\nAnother turn of the thread the argument was I'm wrong since people downvoted me and words are only what people use them as and basically populace might means right....

It\u2019s perfectly legal to do this, but also completely exempt from tax. \n\nSo you could have a token salary with your company, but if that company is successful and you own a lot of valuable shares, you\u2019re able to fund a lavish lifestyle and not pay any tax on that. \n\nYou only pay tax (even then at a modest rate) when selling the shares, and typically then only if the shares went up in value. \n\nThis feels like a loophole that should be closed internationally, but unfortunately those with access to this kind of wealth are also in the best position to push against these reforms.\n\nEdited some typos",
