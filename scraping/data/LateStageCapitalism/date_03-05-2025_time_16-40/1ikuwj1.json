That backlash is, beyond doubt, beneficial to the enemies of this peace movement - those who support and benefit from the ongoing massacre.\n\nSo of course, the troll farms are boosting it. Example: we're watching LAMF being pivoted into constantly spotlighting Arabs as no-gooders, and boosting unsympathetic and downright hateful homogenization of all Palestinian supporters.\n\nAnd worse - it's only the kind of frustrated rage we allow towards the dumbest trumpers. When we justify shadenfreude toward the manipulated, we're marching down history's forbidden roads ourselves.\n\nToo many know the history and still can't see the patterns. Resonance is destiny, the past shapes the present and the future. Yay.",
