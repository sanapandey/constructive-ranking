    "selftext": "I was in a liberal sub for a while and after the election they went full on saying that Bernie was right and tried to rehabilitate Bernie.  It was so weird to me because it felt like they were part of a discord server or something where they could coordinate before putting out a message.\n\nIn 2016 Bernie wanted to save capitalism from itself.  He wanted to be a modern day FDR.  This is a communist sub so people aren't going to agree with the merits of Bernie's actions in 2016.  Anyway, in 2016 Bernie endorsed Hillary Clinton and campaigned for her.  He promoted Russiagate.  He failed to join the Green Party or start his own party.  \n\nBernie very obviously betrayed his own movement in 2016.  Nobody in good faith should have ever supported him after 2016..  Not to mention him being a massive Zionist post acceleration of the genocide.  Nobody well meaning is supporting Bernie Sanders at this point.  His purpose is still to be a sheepdog and rope people back into the Democratic Party.  If liberals are to be peeled off and moved to the left then the liberals need to be taught what Bernie Sanders' purpose is.\n\nMost people here would probably agree with me that the Green Party has socialists within it but is not socialist itself.  As far as I know 2024 Green Party VP candidate Butch Ware intends to run for president as the Green Party nominee in 2028.  He promoted the Uyghur genocide myth.  Even if for argument's sake there were a genocide, the answer to it would not in reality be something sensible like using the ICC.  It would be extreme measures such as sanctions or outright war that would only make things worse for Uyghurs.  So I'm not sure what Butch Ware's deal is.  What even makes the Greens an alternative to the Democrats if they too subscribe to liberal interventionism?\n\nI saw a tweet yesterday from @SxarletRed which is a screenshot of a guy from the YouTube channel Revolutionary Blackout Network and he is saying that he is going to have on people from the ACP (American Communist Party) on his YouTube channel.  Revolutionary Blackout Network did the same thing when the fascists of the ACP created MAGA Communism.  The creator of MAGA Communism wrote a manifesto several years ago and instead of interrogating the manifesto, RBN invited on Jackson Hinkle and gave him a polite interview allowing him to explain what MAGA Communism is and of course he softened it up and didn't call it fascism.  This is not to mention the intertwining of RBN, the mechatankie/maga communist crowd, Jimmy Dore, and also followers of deceased fascist Lyndon LaRouche.\n\nMost people are probably aware of the above and it is low hanging fruit.  So why bring it up?  I don't know the depths to which the YouTube channel Revolutionary Blackout Network were involved in the 2024 Green Party presidential campaign but they were involved.  I would like to say that they were even in either Jill Stein's original announcement or the announcement of Butch Ware as the VP candidate.  They have interviewed Jill Stein a few times from what I can tell via my brief YouTube search.\n\nThe Green Party should be viewed as liberals despite Jill Stein calling her platform ecosocialist.  Also her 2016 campaign was very much a mirroring of Bernie's primary campaign and Bernie wasn't running as a socialist despite what some might say.  Anyway, I don't know to what degree the fascists at RBN infiltrated and integrated themselves into the Green Party but it should be reason enough to stay away from that party, also with the understanding that they are liberals.\n\nI am struggling with how we should approach imperfect allies.  Two days ago Ryan Grim (One of the creators of Dropsite News) was going on about Hamas parading coffins.  Hamas honors the dead.  After 15 months of the acceleration of the genocide, a liberal ally decides to both sides things.  From what I understand, things are getting better in Gaza but Israel still breaks the ceasefire.  Of course Trump told Netanyahu that he can have whatever he likes in the West Bank so there has been a massive escalation there.  So why concern troll about Hamas in this moment?  This comes at a time when Israel has made up how two Israeli children died and are using that as justification to not release more hostages as agreed upon in the ceasefire deal and also possibly to even turn around and begin attacking Gaza full force again.\n\nI don't know how we should be approaching the work of people like Ryan Grim.  At the beginning of the acceleration of the genocide, Israel attacked hospitals saying they had Hamas bases underneath or were storing weapons.  Mehdi Hasan said that there needs to be foreign and impartial journalists there because he can't trust the IOF or Palestinian journalists.  Not to mention Mehdi has supported the biggest CIA operation to date Timber Sycamore which was the war on Syria and the ultimate overthrow of Assad which has seen revenge killings happen after the regime change was complete.  Of course Syria for all its failings gave both Hamas and Hezbollah weapons and weapons from Iran would travel through Syria to Hamas and Hezbollah.  These liberal allies like Ryan and Mehdi sometimes do decent work but ultimately our best course of action is to explain to all who will listen what they represent and why they are bad, just like Bernie Sanders.",

This is all in an attempt to co-opt energy and bring it back into the Democratic Party rather than towards actual progress.  \n\nOne day (right before the election) Bernie was talking about how good a president Biden was outside of Gaza and how Kamala would be a good president and then a few days later after Kamala had lost he was talking about how Democrats had lost their way and weren't meeting people's basic needs.  Bernie is whatever the Democratic Party wants him to be in a given moment and that has to be expressed to people and those who still push for Bernie as a leader need to be outed as the frauds that they are.  If Bernie's tour and social democracy remain popular then that's going to take energy away from building actual socialism.",

It\u2019s too much of a burden for anyone to carry and it\u2019s not realistic. A lot needs to be fixed, locally and federally, from mentality to action. \n2. I understand there is massive paranoia on the left because of government lies, smears, COINTELPRO infiltrations, etc. but there isn\u2019t even a movement at this point. It will take years for a proper movement to be built. Anything would be more than what we have now, which is NOTHING. \n3. There are people that are plain problematic, if not bad faith actors. Many whose only purpose is to destroy the movements, herd people back to the duopoly, etc. To me those people are trump, Rfk jr, mehdi Hasan, Bernie, AOC, Ian Carrol, etc. Then there are some that are just plain drama queen, if not grifters. Like sxarletred, Jackson hinckle, Madeline peddleton (too much dramas), etc. if you want to be serious, start learning from serious people (there are plenty): Chris hedges, Ralph Nader, Michael Hudson, Richard Wolff, Michael parenti, norm finkelstein, etc. Read. \n4.  There\u2019s plenty to do, individually and collectively. Learning basic skills and brushing on up on higher level skills. If leftists can spend so much time on petty dramas\u2026 then clearly their focus isn\u2019t where it should be. There isn\u2019t enough time on the day to do personal things and then dedicate a bit of time to the cause AND  follow petty dramas from a bunch of twitter nobodies. \n\nDisclaimer: I follow RBN on twitter and Sabby something. Im not black and they bring a perspective that is a blindspot to me. It\u2019s also a different perspective than that of Brianna Joy that comes from Harvard and is a bit better off than most. But I consider it as a perspective. They aren\u2019t the experts with a lifetime of knowledge and activism under their belt. Because they are simply a perspective, they aren\u2019t the core of what I will read or listen to. \n\nI hope more people used some kind of guidelines to what information they consume. The left eats its self before it even starts.",

Chris Hedges sure isn't serious though and his involvement in the Green Party and being friends with Cornell West makes me side eye both the Green Party and West.\n\nLike what the fuck is up with [Lynching the Deplorables](https://chrishedges.substack.com/p/lynching-the-deplorables?utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=auto_share&r=1afom)?  That's Hedges defending the people who did January 6th.  He took part in the Rage Against the War Machine rally which was an event full of fascists.  Chris Hedges went on the Jimmy Dore show and they asked if the far left and far right can work together to fight corporatism.  The far right in question was the Charlottesville neonazis.  Here's the part 2 video for that Jimmy deleted part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcH3_ssyX0o.  Note the thumbnail taking very careful care to show that BLM activists should align with neonazis: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chris+hedges+jimmy+dore+left+and+right+fight\n\nChris Hedges is cooked.  I agree with your point at large though.\n\nAs far as the left eating itself, we do need to apply standards.  RBN are either fascists or happy to be in the presence of fascists if it will make them money.  This is why they have promoted Jimmy Dore, Jackson Hinkle, and Jose Vega (follower of deceased fascist Lyndon LaRouche).  \n\nAna Kasparian's politics suck.  That doesn't mean she deserves to be sexually harassed though.  Remember when Ana came out about being sexually harassed by Jimmy Dore and then Sabrina (Sabby) came to the rescue?  She knew where her bread was buttered and defended Jimmy because that is what she had been doing in her career up to that point.  RBN initially grew in popularity by promoting Jimmy Dore and stealing the Fred Hampton family name calling themselves the Fred Hampton Leftists.  The family forced them to change their channel name. \n\nWe do need to teach to people what's happening and that socdems whether that be politicians like Bernie or media like Dropsite or the Intercept will actively lead them astray and that those politicians and media are part of the problem and how we got to where we are in the first place.",
