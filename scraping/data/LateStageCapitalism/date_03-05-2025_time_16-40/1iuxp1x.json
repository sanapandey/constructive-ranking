                    "body": "Unlike communist, which from the beginning was used to form a collective political identity, capitalist initially referred to a specific class of people, those who owned capital and used it to generate wealth through private enterprise. The term became more widespread in the 19th century, especially in the works of Karl Marx, who used it to describe the bourgeoisie, or the ruling class that controlled the means of production. In this context, being a capitalist wasn\u2019t simply about believing in capitalism as an economic system, it was about actually possessing capital and benefiting from it. This differs from communist, which refers to an ideological and political identity that anyone can adopt, regardless of their material wealth.\n\nEven in America during the Cold War, political rhetoric was dominated by anti-communism rather than pro-capitalism. The emphasis was on resisting the perceived threat of communism rather than actively promoting capitalism as a personal identity. The Red Scare, McCarthyism, and general political discourse framed capitalism as the natural order, while communism was cast as an ideological opponent. As a result, many Americans came to define themselves not as *capitalists* but simply as *not communists.* Even today, conservative and liberal political movements in the U.S. tend to frame economic debates around defending against socialism or government overreach rather than championing capitalism as an explicit identity.",
