            "body": "The premise that fascism was \u2018buried forever\u2019 in 1945 and is now being actively resurrected\u2014is historically simplistic at best and dangerously misleading at worst. Fascism was never truly defeated\u2014it was repackaged, rehabilitated, and in many cases, absorbed into the very institutions that claimed to have destroyed it. The U.S. government, for instance, wasted no time integrating Nazi scientists into its Cold War military-industrial complex (see Operation Paperclip) and embraced anti-communist authoritarians across the world whenever it served capital\u2019s interests.\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing now isn\u2019t the \u2018revival\u2019 of fascism\u2014it\u2019s the logical continuation of a system that never really abandoned it. Neoliberal capitalism has always had a deeply anti-democratic undercurrent, and when economic crises hit, it inevitably turns to reactionary strongmen, corporate authoritarianism, and nationalist scapegoating to maintain control. The \u2018tech libertarians\u2019 in this cartoon aren\u2019t some bizarre aberration\u2014they are exactly what you would expect when capital is given unchecked power. Whether it\u2019s billionaires openly praising dictators, reactionary influencers peddling hierarchy as \u2018natural,\u2019 or corporations bankrolling far-right movements, the conditions for fascism have been incubating in the global economy for decades.\n\nThe mistake is in thinking that fascism is something that was \u2018defeated\u2019 in the first place. It was never truly about jackboots and swastikas\u2014it was, and is, about ensuring that economic and political power remains in the hands of a select few, using whatever means necessary. And if digging up the old symbols of the past helps distract people from the fact that the real battle isn\u2019t between \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 but between ordinary people and the ruling class, then of course they\u2019ll do it. That\u2019s how power works.",
