Suddenly a huge mining corporation comes, opens a huge open pit mine, poisons the earth with chemicals. When leftists and environmentalists argue against them, they sya they are creating jobs. They have the papers, they show that they employ everyone there (because any other economic activity is destroyed by them) and the average income in the region increased by $10 a month! Meanwhile the new workers of the mine have to spend $20 per month to food and water now because all their crops are dead and rivers are poisoned. Some of the people protest against it but as they are just brutes who don't understand how \"the eocnomy\" works, they are simply silenced or worse. Jobs created, income increased, no right to complain.\n\nThe company, after getting subsidized for heroically reducing poverty in the area, leaves after the mine is no longer profitable. With no jobs and no workable land, people immigrate to bigger cities or richer countries. The role of the GDP myth is to justify and rationalize these insane processes, this was just one example but there are many more.",
