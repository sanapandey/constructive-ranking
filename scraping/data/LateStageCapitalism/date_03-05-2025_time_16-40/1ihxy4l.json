After the war, instead of being prosecuted for treason, ITT collected $27 million from the  U.S. government for war damages inflicted on its German plants by Allied bombings. General Motors collected over $33 million. Pilots were given instructions not to hit factories in Germany that were  owned by the U.S. firms. Thus, Cologne was\nalmost leveled by Allied bombing but its Ford plant, providing military equipment for the Nazi army, was untouched; indeed, German civilians began using the  plant as an air raid shelter.\n\nMichael Parenti - Blackshirts and Reds",

They have to get some truth shoved in their faces so they know that they are lied to since they are born.\n\nThe US burgeoise lies, the yankees believe it, and everyone else suffers for it. Its time you people start having some responsability for the effects of your own ignorance, and the first step is to acknowledge said ignorance and start working into becoming LESS ignorant.\n\nHopefully now that they are FEELING said consequences, they might have a positive change of mind. So heres an old new for anyone getting here now: THERE IS NO DEMOCRACY IN THE US, THERE IS NO FREEDOM AND THERE IS NO AMERICAN DREAM!!!\n\n In any other place in the world, half of the things that happen in the US are considered insane and absurd! The only reason people even THINK this shithole of a country could possibly be the best country in the world, its because US midia sells its own country as an paradise on earth since, at least, the last 100 YEARS! \n\nThe US is the most hellish shithole ive ever had the displeasure of getting knowledge about IN MY LIFE! Every time i learn more about the most basic shit that happens in that place, it just makes my life worse, because the THOUGHT that such an distopian place can be considered the peak of civilization by most people in my country is just REVOLTING!\n\nAnd im not european, nor japanese, or from any other relativly wealthy or stable country. Im from fucking BRASIL, im Brasillian! Even here in this damn country, we stil arent a TENTH of how bad the US is! We have free healthcare, we have more than 2 PARTYS, we have actual worker movements, we dont waste trillions shoving war down the throat of other countries. We dont tax every single action, product, or job into oblivion to the point people are indebted to life.\n\nBuuuuut many politician assholes are not happy in that, and are trying to make this place become the US 2 electric boogaloo. More and more the far right here look like the Republicans, and the \"progressive\" parties (aka center right) are trying to become more like the Democrats. Its gross and disgusting how submissive and bootlicking they are. \n \nAnd this all go back into the US. Even though its our responsibility to deal with the sellout trash that are trying to butcher every single piece of my country, its still is the US fault for financing, promoting, normalizing and justifying this neoliberal hell of politics that have being formed over last 3 decades.\n\n So lets make a deal: we deal with our own traitors that are trying to sell our country to the US and friends, and YOU yankees deal with your own burgeoise trash that is now trying to sell the US to themselves. Because now the world wide burgeoise may have nationality, but they dont have loyalty other them capital. They rule all places and no places at the same time. And you yankees are not special to them.",

And it is assumed that, having defeated the working class in decisive battles (Italy, Germany), the bourgeoisie felt that it was the victor and could now afford to adopt \u201cdemocracy.\u201d In other words, while the decisive battles were in progress, the bourgeoisie needed a fighting organisation, needed fascism; but now that the proletariat is defeated, the bourgeoisie no longer needs fascism and can afford to use \u201cdemocracy\u201d instead, as a better method of consolidating its victory. Hence, the conclusion is drawn that, the rule of the bourgeoisie has become consolidated, that the \u201cera of pacifism\u201d will be a prolonged one, and that the revolution in Europe has been pigeonholed.\n\n> This assumption is absolutely wrong.\n\n> Firstly, it is not true that fascism is only the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. Fascism is not only a military-technical category. Fascism is the bourgeoisie\u2019s fighting organisation that relies on the active support of Social-Democracy. Social-Democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism. There is no ground for assuming that the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie can achieve decisive successes in battles, or in governing the country, without the active support of Social-Democracy. There is just as little ground for thinking that Social-Democracy can achieve decisive successes in battles, or in governing the country, without the active support of the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. **These organisations do not negate, but supplement each other. They are not antipodes, they are twins.** Fascism is an informal political bloc of these two chief organisations; a bloc, which arose in the circumstances of the post-war crisis of imperialism, and which is intended for combating the proletarian revolution. The bourgeoisie cannot retain power without such a bloc. It would therefore be a mistake to think that \u201cpacifism\u201d signifies the liquidation of fascism. In the present situation, \u201cpacifism\u201d is the strengthening of fascism with its moderate, Social-Democratic wing pushed into the forefront.\n\n...\n\n\n>  As for what the pacifists and democrats want, as for the policy of the imperialists, they have only one aim in resorting to pacifism: to dupe the masses with high-sounding phrases about peace in order to prepare for a new war; to dazzle the masses with the brilliance of \u201cdemocracy\u201d in order to consolidate the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; to stun the masses with clamour about the \u201csovereign\u201d rights of nations and states in order the more successfully to prepare for intervention in China, for slaughter in Afghanistan and in the Sudan, for the dismemberment of Persia; to fool the masses with highfaluting talk about \u201cfriendly\u201d relations with the Soviet Union, about various \u201ctreaties\u201d with the Soviet government, in order to establish still closer relations with the counter-revolutionary conspirators who have been kicked out of Russia, with the aim of bandit operations in Byelorussia, the Ukraine and Georgia. The bourgeoisie needs pacifism as a camouflage. This camouflage constitutes the chief danger of pacifism.",

But when you think of it like this it becomes extremely obvious why businesses & the business classes fight tooth & nail to fight all forms of socialism and almost always come down in favor of fascism. \n\nGovernment is the only entity that can stand up to billionaires & corporations. This is why they want them destroyed now that inequality is so out of control that they are larger than some smaller countries. And unfortunately, they are winning. \n\nThey are desperate because with the internet & smartphones we all have access to knowledge & can very easily form groups & movements rapidly (think Arab Spring). This is why billionaires are putting their resources into bots & AI & social media platforms & right wing media & right wing think-tanks. \n\nThey have to control our thoughts and information dissemination. Why would any country in their right mind allow one person that has extremist political views to control the most watched news channel or most used social media site? What we are going through right now in the USA is a direct result of these poor choices.",
