    "selftext": "Speaking hypothetically (as a thought experiment), if a large enough portion of the country were to refuse to pay their taxes until specific demands were met - such as: certain corrupt politicians must be removed from office - would this not be a very potent form of leverage in ensuring said demands were met?  Obviously there are penalties for such action, but the IRS doesn't have enough resources to go after half the country.  In this hypothetical scenario, I don't believe it would even require half the country to participate in order for it to be effective, or for the people involved to have herd immunity from potential penalties.  Corrupt politicians make their living off our tax dollars.  Billionaires who exploit everyone in this country make their wealth off of avoiding taxes and putting the tax burden on everyone else.  Undoubtedly this form of protest would hit them where it hurts.  What are you thoughts?  ",

            "body": "The short answer, no because the federal government can just print more money. A general strike would be much more effective since it actually cuts off the Capital at the source. However, a general strike without a revolutionary movement will do little to nothing in the long term.\n\nWe need a working class revolution. For a revolution to work, you must first build a revolutionary movement; following these general steps:\n\n1. Raise class consciousness and awareness (through discussion and education)\n\n2. Organize locally with other socialists/communists, helping to build foundations for mutual aid/dual power structures\n\n3. Unionize your workplace\n\n4. General strike\n\nAs for #1, my recommended intro reading list:\n\nThe principles of communism - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)\n\nSocialism utopian and scientific - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/)\n\nThe state and revolution - Lenin (https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\n\nThere's also a ton of good YouTube content if that's more your thing ( but you really should read the foundations of theory as well), highly recommend these channels as a good starting point:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SecondThought/videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@YaBoiHakim/videos",

About 2/3 of americans will get a refund by filing a return. I know this is a thought experiment but there would be about a 1 1/4 year delay (Jan '25 to April '26) during which time everyone would need to change the amount withheld on their paychecks for the year to zero then refuse to pay it the following year by tax day. \n\nAlso- the ultra wealthy do this. They just use legal loopholes (that are not actual crimes per se) instead of a mass boycott for political leverage.",
