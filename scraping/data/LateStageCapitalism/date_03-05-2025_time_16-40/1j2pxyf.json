    "selftext": "After listening to this, can society as a whole give up & slow down the mass consumption lifestyle OR will luxuries like, same-day delivery or 24-hour operating food services have to be ripped away from us by force?\n\nI would imagine this would effect employers in the private sectors running operations near 24/7 hours 365 days and slow down congestion of traffic being caused by semi-trucks. How would any of this come about?",
