That means any support for any liberal capitalist political party (like the Democrats) is strictly prohibited.\n\n LSC is run by communists. This subreddit is not the place to debate socialism. We allow good-faith questions and education but are not a 101 sub; please take 101-style questions elsewhere.\n\n We have a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry.

The spontaneous destruction of property is a demonstration of the discontent of the masses, but it does not advance our struggle in a strategic and organized manner. We need to harbor this revolutionary energy, give it character, purpose, and direction, then mobilize it for more effective tactics.",
