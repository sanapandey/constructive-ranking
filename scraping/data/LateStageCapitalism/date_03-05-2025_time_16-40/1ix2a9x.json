    "selftext": "I see a lot of drivel in comment sections amongst the left throughout reddit and someone will usually come out and tell people they need to read theory. Thing is, they won't give any recommendations on where to start.\n\nReading theory won't only make you a more knowledgeable leftist, but it can also start to save your mind from the distractions of the bourgeoisie internet and give you a better grasp on how to organize and act.\n\nSo please include all of your recommendations for our fellow workers. I'll start here with Blackshirts and Reds by Michael Parenti. It's a great short read about western capitalism's role in the rise of fascism in Europe and how capitalists continued to side with fascists after world war II to overthrow communism. It has very alarming parallels to what is going on today. It could also help you get a better idea on how we got to where we are now.",
