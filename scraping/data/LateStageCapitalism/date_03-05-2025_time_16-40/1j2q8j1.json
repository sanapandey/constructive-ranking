I could see it dropping further; this cycle is much harder to predict than previous ones. \n\nFor reference: In early 2022, when it became evident that there would be a sustained pullback on cryptocurrencies, I suggested that the United States Reserve might want to covertly begin to accumulate a reserve if Bitcoin dropped under 30k, and to accelerate buying if the price went close to 20k or under. It did drop, the US did not accumulate.  Build up a portfolio of 1-4M Bitcoin for well under $100B. (Stimulus checks were far far higher than these numbers)\n\nAt 4M Bitcoins, the US reserve would hold almost 1/4 of the recoverable BTC in the world or more. And it would make the remaining 17M (minus the lost forever coins which is probably 2-6M already) even more scarce for investors and speculators. So if the price of BTC rose to $1M, the US government would have several Trillion to back its ability to honor its debt/deficit.\n\nCurrently, the price to hold those 4M Bitcoin is nearly $500B, which is a lot more than DOGE can ever cut from the federal workforce (and elsewhere) and nearly the equivalent of the Turmp tax cuts).  Also, the United States is not in a stable enough position (big stick) to make those coins valuable to others. Or itself.\n\nAnyway I've been following this for \nA long time and it's really stupid for the US Government or Reserve to blab their mouths before they were ever to pursue such a tactic. And it would be incredibly stupid to do it right now, when Bitcoin is nearly its All Time High, with an economy in turmoil vs 2022.",
