Buying a home here usually only happens when getting married, and it\u2019s expected that both sets of parents (as well as surviving grandparents) will contribute heavily to this cost, often significant amounts of their life savings. So you\u2019re really looking at the savings and incomes of from 4-14 people to buy a house. Unfortunately houses in China are MORE expensive than houses in America (relative to typical local salaries). It\u2019s one of the biggest issues here. Shanghai and Shenzhen require something like 40 years\u2019 worth of the local average salary to purchase. NYC is like 25, for comparison. And there\u2019s some cultural differences as well, as buying property is seen here as basically the sole responsible way to save/grow wealth. \n\nOTOH once you buy/pay off the mortgage, there\u2019s no property taxes. Only need to pay for upkeep.\n\nRenting is absolutely cheaper and more accessible than in America though, no question",

            "body": "Yes it is too much to ask unfortunately. The cost of building a house and the supply of housing aren't why housing is expensive. It's expensive because of House Price Keynesianism. The financialization of consumer debt, especially in the form of mortgages, has caused our economy to become entirely dependent, increasingly so, on the cost of housing going up.\n\nIn the 80s as Reaganism destroyed people's upward mobility, made wages stagnate, and facilitated a massive upward transfer of wealth, average people began to need to take on much more debt in order to be able to afford the\" American Dream\". Consumer debt, especially in the form of mortgages, skyrocketed. At the same time, wealthy investors were running out of places to invest their money to maintain liquidity.\n\nIt wasn't long before financial institutions realized that they could securitize mortgages, and turning them into an asset they could trade and earn interest on. The government helped facilitate this market, which essentially allows investors to bet on mortgage debt.\n\nThe result is that the cost of a house is determined by how valuable the security based on the house is as a store of liquidity to investors, which is in turn partly based on how much power the investor has to force the homeowner or landlord to pay the mortgage.\n\nKeeping the value of these assets going up is a huge priority for our government because it allows them to avoid a recession and policies which would simply require people to be paid more fairly.\n\nAdditionally, In the rental market, algorithms like the ones made by RealPage are used by landlords all over the country to effectively allow them to legally collude to raise housing prices. These algorithms recommend landlords evict people more liberally, reduce occupancy to about 94%,and raise rents on the current tenants. Private equity firms like Apollo, Carlyle, and Blackstone have taken over real estate, own about a third of single family homes in the US.\n\nIn short, debt is a an incredibly useful form of public control, and mortgages are the primary vehicle of debt in the US.\n\nThis video explains it well.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woz4KgUbIMc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woz4KgUbIMc)",

The People's government provides cheap houses for rent according to the decision made by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. In Shenzhen, where I was born, It is approximately 1-1.5\uff04 per square metre per month (for example. one rent a 60m\u00b2 house and pays \uff1c1600RMB per month, that is roughly 230\uff04)and standard practice is you sign a 3-year contract and renew it if you want at the end of the period.\n\nThis, combined with other policies, is absolutely the solution to homelessness. Unfortunately these houses are in short of supply, despite Shenzhen builds 10k of them each year. Resorting to normal houses for rent on the market will cost double or even triple the cost per sq metre, but for Shenzhen residents that is still managable. You should compare it to top-tier American cities like LA and NYC consider Shenzhen's place within China.",
