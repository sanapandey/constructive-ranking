The USSR was more against Israel during most of its existence than it was pro.\n\nSo this is a false equivalent, Western powers where objectivly the biggest and most relevant supporters of zionism. Who gives a shit that post ww2 UK, with their colapsing empire, was salty they where losing their colonies, so they let their messes to be resolved by the locals.

Other countries, such as Italy, also had a nuked economy and cooperated with the crackdown on illegal immigration into Palestine. Poland had a lengthy history of supporting Zionism that goes back into the 1930s and their continued support for it was ideological.\n\n>Even the USSR had little to say about this project.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a lot to say about it and ended up having a critical role in helping Israel win the 1948 Palestine War by greenlighting massive arms shipments to Israel via Czechoslovakia. No other country did this during that war. At the time, Stalin was convinced that Israel would become a socialist state. It was easily the worst mistake of his career. Stalin only cut support for Israel at the time after the pro-Soviet party performed poorly in the 1949 elections. It had nothing to do with morality until Israel further expanded in the 1960s.\n\nI think it\u2019s always worth mentioning this since we should reflect on past mistakes.",
