Trump is pulling America out of the U.N. human rights council ffs. \n\nTake a look at what Elon is doing with DOGE. He's essentially tearing out American soft power abroad. Basically destroying decades of work down by the CIA, NED, and USAID in a matter of weeks. And he doesn't seem aware of what soft power is, it's function, or what it's even theoretically for. This is going to create power vaccums across the globe, which will be filled by America's competitors. \n\nMeanwhile, Trump's moving forward raising everyone's taxes, except the ultra omega wealthy, who get \\*another\\* tax cut. \n\nThe end result of all of this has to be one thing, and one thing only, higher prices, higher rents, less jobs, less economic activity, and ultimately, system's collapse. \n\nYou just can't run a government this way. It's why no one does. Hold on to your dicks.",

You mean by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic? Last I checked, aside from the ongoing pandemic that no one wants to acknowledge anymore (including most liberals and lots of leftists), Palestinians were the ones being genocided. \n\n\u201cGodspeed\u201d as if this isn\u2019t going to affect you in some way wherever you are? Unfortunately the climate crisis is here and no one is exempt from experiencing the catastrophic consequences of it. \n\nLastly, what makes you think the best case scenario is a non violent recession and food insecurity and what makes you think people aren\u2019t already experiencing this / it isn\u2019t already happening? \n\nWe are already in a recession. And this is America - there are always people experiencing food insecurity, starvation, homelessness, etc. \n\n Do you have any idea what America currently is and has always been?",

Yes, worrying doesn't change anything, it's just involuntary empathy on my part.

In short, I think you are being squeezed economically to death right now.\nYes, Palestinians are facing the worst of the worst right now.\nGodspeed is just a figure of speech for good luck.\nI am not denying the climate crisis. I actually actively work against it.\nSorry for being confusing, saying \"non-violent recession\" is just an idiotic way of saying things stay as they are. You got me on that one. Honestly, I don't even remember commenting, I never comment on shit.\nYes, America and Europe are experiencing a ton of recession and inflation. America is a prime example of exploitative capitalism in its late stages.. which is why we are in this sub, no?\n\nBut I am curious, tell me what America is and always has been.",
