Like colonization, it should be relegated to history as something that had a time and place, had its benefits and ugly sides and now is no longer needed.\n\nLike seriously, if we actually did some decent regulation with the amazing wealth capitalism helped accrue for much of the world, pretty much all of us could be living in a near utopia\n\nInstead that wealth and prosperity got gamed and funneled to the capitalists, who for some reason are still celebrated?\nThey should be treated like colonizers or colonial countries are now huh\nAll those nations became independent so long thanks for all the fish",

It then immediately needed warfare and international exploitation to keep the gears running. Vietnam, the Korean War, the war on drugs, warfare and destabilizing the Middle East, Syria, East Africa, all of it has been to uphold access to resources and cheap labor that capitalists could exploit.",
