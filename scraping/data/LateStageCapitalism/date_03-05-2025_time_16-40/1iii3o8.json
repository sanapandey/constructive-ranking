I got drunk off a 12 pack of Twisted Teas and went on a rant about standing strong in our respective unions (90% of us had Union jobs lined up straight out of college) and to always stand together with eachother to our bosses no matter the bullshit they spew. I was standing on the porch and I guess at some point one of my buddies neighbours came out because he heard me shouting about unions and how workers control the power, he recorded my speech and it went kinda viral in our hometown Fb groups. Felt a little bit like Lenin when I saw the clip the next day lmao. \ud83d\ude02",
