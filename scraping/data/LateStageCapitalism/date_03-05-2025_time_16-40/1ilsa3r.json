Malan after telling Smuts to stand aside:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qnl2g69a87ie1.gif\n\n* \"I'm not a soldier.\"\n   * \"The army is a bastion of pro-British sentiment. Locate the [officers who are sympathetic to your cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brink) and they will be able to convince a decent chunk of the military to support the coup. You have the element of surprise. The Afrikaner nationalists will put up an extremely tough fight, but you can beat them.\"\n* \"Are you sure this will work?\"\n   * \"I know the odds seem stacked against you, but history says otherwise. Afrikaner nationalists have twice launched proto-fascist rebellions against the pro-British Afrikaners, [once in 1914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritz_rebellion) and [then again in 1922](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rand_Rebellion). Both times, they were defeated. Of course, this battle will be much harder since the roles are reversed. That said, have faith. The pro-British Afrikaners are many things, but they are not weak. Many of your followers have extensive experience in killing white supremacists, whereas the Afrikaner nationalists are all racist farmers and Nazi collaborators.\"",
