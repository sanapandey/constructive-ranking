Although that aid came with strings attached and other bad things sometimes normal people benefitted from it? But overall it's a blow to us imperialism though which is a good thing right? ",

I wonder if we\u2019ve been on a slow and natural decline as a nation for many of the same reasons other empires have collapsed in the past.\n\nPeople can\u2019t admit we have been making mistakes when it comes to the way we govern and distribute goods and wealth?  They can\u2019t fathom that this is not a result of any one party or president. Our success had been exploited a long time ago and our systems are corrupt and perverted. It\u2019s not that Democracy and Capitalism on their own don\u2019t work. But they are optimal under specific conditions and restraints. Even if we were to study these systems in practice in the past the conditions and restraints are very different. We would have to update our systems and regulations often to keep up with changing landscape. \nRegardless, this system is widely out of harmony with the current conditions and restraints.\n\nThat being said, the US did set a pretty darn good foundation for governance. Funny many of our struggles were discussed even then. We engaged in discourse about what issues could arise within our system and what we should avoid. Fear the mob and fear the dictator. Do not allow debt to be offered upon the people\u2026our systems are corrupted.\n\nCurrent systems need an overhaul and laws may need to be passed or amended in a pretty aggressive manner. Furthermore, financial systems and the economy will need substantial changes to be made to reduce fraud in a massive way. There\u2019s so many facets of this system that can be examined - I don\u2019t disagree with conservatives on that.  However, it shouldn\u2019t be that we make all these changes and perhaps propose a new system without a good understanding of what will replace/enhance current systems in a positively meaningful way. Stuck between pain now or more pain later\u2026\n\nThis goes without talking about the geopolitical affect this will have. Our (prestigious) position in the imperialistic world arena will be vulnerable, if not down-right exposed, which very well may be the plan! \n\nExpose the system for not working properly, find groups to blame, offer a \u201cbetter\u201d solution, weed out those who do not or cannot operate under tyrannical control within the new system, and you\u2019ve got yourself\u2026well there\u2019s a reason Nazism and fascism is being touted all over.

They\u2019re also not blanket cancelling everything USAid is engaged in which is what we should be most weary off.",

Of course they\u2019ll continue the foreign influence operations USAID engaged in under the CIA and State Department, but this is a huge blow to the U.S.\u2019s soft power capabilities in the global south, which was already turning towards China. You can expect to see more developing countries turning away from the American sphere of influence and towards China in the next few years. The Trump administration thinks it can just rely on the threat of military force and economic leverage to dominate other countries, but the U.S. is no longer in the dominant position it was on either front twenty years ago, and there\u2019s no domestic appetite for war.",
