I walked to the nearest ditch, found a yardstick and a thing of wire, and managed to unlock it. Took 30 minutes. Absolutely worth it. I was making $6 an hour at a farm and that was more than a day's pay for a one minute mistake.",

If you\u2019re gonna be getting snow, make sure you\u2019ve got a tow strap and a shovel and know how and where to hook your tow strap. \n\nWe get tons of snow where I am, typically a pickup truck will come by and pull you out within 20 minutes, but maybe that\u2019s a rural New England sort of thing.",

Maybe the state should plan for weather events and offer a free service but this is America where an ambulance ride can bankrupt a lot of people.  The guy who has to get out in the snow and hook you up to his truck needs to get paid and his truck needs gas.",
