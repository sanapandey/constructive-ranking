The image should look like it was taken from above the crowd. Several people in the crowd should be holding signs that read \"marry me\" and \"I love you\".\n\nIt *could* be edited using a \"real\" version of this photo as the base, then using Photoshops generative fill, combined with general Photoshop stuff for all the text but like..it would be hours of effort for literally no reason. It was also posted the same evening the show happened, so I don't think someone would have time to do that.",
