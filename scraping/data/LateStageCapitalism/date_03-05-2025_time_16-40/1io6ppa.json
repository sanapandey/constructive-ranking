Just because there are new specialties it doesn\u2019t change what their purpose was for. Corporate media, every once in a while they might tell the truth but the purpose is very specific. Does that mean that every lawyer and cop are bad? I suppose that anyone can argue that IAB is a check on corrupt and abusive police but it doesn\u2019t change the main structure of what the police are for. Are there well intentioned cops? Maybe, Christopher donner went on a rampage because of police brutality, they punished him instead for bringing it to light and he ended up offing himself for it. The moral fortitude required within that field to do the right thing is unreasonable. I like Ralph Nader, and he was made a pariah for always doing the right thing. He was smeared, his phones were tapped, etc. You bring environmental lawyers and other fields as though they aren\u2019t the equivalent of \u201cInclusivity marketing\u201d for corporations. We have an explosion of environmental firms, organizations with researchers and lawyers that are an absolute scam. I\u2019m giving you two examples.\n\nIf there are well intentioned lawyers I\u2019m sure that they can use what they have learned to help. If you want to act like you don\u2019t understand because you are offended, so be it. Take a sobering look at your own field. You can be a nice soldier for the US empire but you are still a soldier at the disposal of corporate interests. I think we are complicit and all victim s here but it\u2019s worthwhile to look how we all contribute to this system. Some do more than others.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y9hyvc5nkuie1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e564e8d3740b2434509eec5f0a9051ad31e1267\n\n[https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/myanmar-teak-trade-sanctions-military-regime/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/myanmar-teak-trade-sanctions-military-regime/)",

I think it will be a very lopsided fight without lawyers on our side. But I don\u2019t think they can help much if they can\u2019t be bothered to take a sobering look at how their career and probably their field is weaponized against common folk and the extent of the damage they have caused. \n\nBut apparently this forum believes that if you can admit that capitalism is bad, you can forgo any self reflection?? That\u2019s absurd. Just about every CEO, shareholder and capitalist is fully aware of the exploitation they enforce on a daily basis to millions but their rationalization is that if they aren\u2019t aggressors they will become victims. Does blaming the system also erases all THEIR blame? \n\nIf this is a forum to analyze capitalism and our role in it by those that claim to be more enlighten but cannot do the bare minimum of self-reflecting their role (no matter how painful)\u2026 then I guess that explains why we are so cooked. Blind leading the blind. A forum for impotent whiners. That is why ppl feel doomed. I like this forum but I don\u2019t think you guys are being honest at this point with vague toxic positivity.\n\nI am a firm believer that we are all aware of what the problems are, we just chose not to see them. Either because of despair or shame or some other blinding emotion. You are not doing anyone any favors by giving vague and clich\u00e9 responses such as \u201ccapitalism is bad and we are all victims\u201d. I will give you an example, I know a US military contractor they supply weapons for the wars the US is involved in. You ought to see the incredible rationalizations they do for what their job\u2019s purpose and what it does on a daily basis. I don\u2019t think their psyche could handle self reflection which is why they bathe themselves on ridiculous excuses. They have a very obvious moral fragmentation and I don\u2019t think they are ready to face that. But they aren\u2019t in this forum, willing to see a new world. That is why seeing it here than in those people depresses me more.",

There\u2019s about 200 years of legal precedent to establish this, you could start with Marbury v. Madison in 1803 and then just look at other decisions that have upheld this one.\n\nThe administration has indicated that they will ignore court orders - this is the constitutional crisis. If they decide they can just ignore judicial decisions, it sets a dangerous precedent, essentially removing essentially the only check on executive power.\n\nWe both know you\u2019re being disingenuous, though, so I\u2019m gonna disengage. Way to bait me into wasting more time, though.",

Our entire Republic is under threat because Trump's accountant misfiled his taxes and the attorney general wanted to make a point to try and prevent him from getting re-elected.
