My colleagues were horrified that I went to the fancy, expensive public hospital. They said it cost too much. It cost $15 to see a doctor. I pay for insulin at about $30 a month for a volume that would cost $900 in America.\n\nThere are also totally private hospitals run by companies like Raffles. They are less expensive than American hospitals, but not by much. They are also more like spa/hospital hybrids, they give you things like fancy robes and 4* hotel quality private rooms.\n\nMy biggest criticism for Chinese healthcare is that everything is paid up front. The whole system relies on you having someone with you to go stand in that line to pay, because if you're terribly ill and on your own, good luck. And as far as anecdotes from my colleagues go, yes, this applies to emergencies too. They'll stabilize you but if you want real treatment you have to pay first, hope you can work your WeChat account with a shattered spine.",

            "body": "Okay, I think we\u2019re good with the socialism part, but what about the Chinese characteristics part?  While it\u2019s true they are doing \u201cwhat works for China and the Chinese people\u201d, that doesn\u2019t tell you what is particularly Chinese about it, and in the end why it\u2019s not even exclusively Chinese at all (hear me out), and hence dangerous to the western neoliberal elite. \n\nThe first characteristic is an emphasis on pragmatism vs. dogma, perhaps best captured in Deng\u2019s white cat vs. black cat analogy. In China, out-of-the-box problem solvers are given a prominent place in history (Yu the Great, Zhuge Liang, etc. )\n\nIn this light, markets and central planning are just tools - a means to an end, each with their inherent pros and cons and tradeoffs. The problem they are each employed to solve is the optimal allocation of resources in a society. What is meant by \u201coptimal\u201d, is a political decision that will differ between capitalist and socialist societies (notice I didn\u2019t say democratic, because late stage capitalism IS a political system).  \n\nSo, in the dogmatism of the west, we can\u2019t have any other way because markets were created by God and by virtue of that fact capitalism is the natural state. This has now finally brought us to the logical endpoint of extreme and pervasive rent and surplus value extraction in every facet of life, and at the helm of the \u201cfree world\u201d now sits the world\u2019s richest capitalist. \n\nIn China, by contrast, they told Jack Ma to go away when he was being kind of a nuisance, but then recently Xi called him back to have a meeting along with all the other big private tech companies, because now they are deemed useful again. This is pragmatism - when we\u2019re done using the hammer, and the next part needs a screwdriver, we\u2019re not going to keep on using the hammer. \n\nThe second characteristic is best summarized by an ancient saying: \u201cThe water that bears the boat can also overturn it\u201d (\u6c34\u80fd\u8f7d\u821f\uff0c\u4ea6\u80fd\u8986\u821f\uff09attributed to the philosopher Xunzi during the Warring States Period ca. 300 BCE. \n\nIn other words, rulers must value public opinion and care for the people\u2019s livelihood. Otherwise, they risk losing support and destabilizing their rule. This idea has had a profound influence in Chinese history, serving as a reminder to rulers to prioritize the well-being of the people (full disclosure: a little help from DeepSeek here).   As others have commented, their track record is looking better and better on this front as time goes on.\n\nAnd this brings me back to what I said before - pragmatism and the emphasis on the well-being of the people are not exclusively Chinese characteristics!  Yes, they have found instances that root these qualities very, very deeply into their own culture, but all cultures can look to their own history for instances where pragmatism won the day for the benefit of the people. \n\nThus, socialism with [country x] characteristics is wholly replicable, and that\u2019s why the oligarchic ruling class has to now work double time to keep the rest of the world from realizing this (eg, the US $1.6 billion anti-CCP propaganda fund).",

I live in the US but I really do hope that they surpass us as the world\u2019s leading hegemony/superpower. Maybe that will wake up the rest of the world up to consider adopting their own social market systems. I\u2019d even argue technologically, socially, happiness of citizens and leading the climate change effort, they have already surpassed the US significantly. It\u2019s only a matter of time.",

Tonal languages are difficult too because sometimes you feel silly over pronouncing them - English stays pretty neutral so it doesn\u2019t come naturally if you don\u2019t do it. The good news is that if you\u2019re traveling and speaking any language even in a very thick American accent, most people will appreciate that you aren\u2019t yelling at them in English and be quite helpful.",
