In fact any non nazi elements were specifically removed before this integration. So this guy was never anything other than a nazi in service to nazi Germany, yet he's hailed as a hero because nazis fought communists. A museum has every reason to know this, so it really can't be attributed to ignorance in this case.",

Everybody knew nazis were bad when i was a kid. History is a trip. Just remember the depths that racists and paranoid people will sink to to get what they think they want.
