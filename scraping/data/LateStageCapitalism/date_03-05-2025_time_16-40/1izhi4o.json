Actual rich people don't make their money from \"income.\"  They make it as returns on real estate and investments which is taxed differently and allows them, through 1000 different loopholes, to have an effective tax rate lower than those who have a traditional income.  Then eventually they reach a level of wealth where they can just take loans out from banks with part of their stock portfolio as collateral (therefore avoiding the capital gains tax that would be applied if they sold the stock for cash) which have even lower levels of interest because of their low risk (of course they'll be able to pay it back, they're a billionaire!) which isn't taxed at all.",
