Reading a lot of the posts here I realise how uneducated I am on late stage capitalism and socialism, as well as just world socio-economic policy in general. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if anyone has any good recommendations for beginner reading, as I want to expand my mind and explore this ideology more. I\u2019m in my late teens and am open to anything, books or essays, of any complexity. Thank you! ",

He\u2019s one of the rare writers that writes to educate without overcomplicating things, but never sacrificing content. The Sword and The Dollar is a good place to start. He may not be a communist through and through by today\u2019s standards, but I believe he viewed himself as one. Again, very educational and I think his writing sets a solid foundation for other reading, especially if you\u2019ve been born in the US.",

The manifesto is an easy primer and takes no time to read. follow it with Lenin's \"what is to be done\". Reading these before diving into anything published in the last 20 or so years can give you a much better perspective of how the situation devolved and why those who profit from the chaos remain at the helm for as long as they do.",

I really like reading the Motorcycle Diaries by Che and pretty much anything written by Thomas Sankara. Idk if you're following the nationalized land movement in Burkina Faso, but pretty much everything Sankara has said has now been proven right and his theories on agriculture have definitely encouraged a positive outcome for their developing resource management laws. Che is a loved and hated figure who had a complicated life, but Motorcycle Diaries is a very raw journal detailing his journey towards becoming a revolutionary after touring large portions of south and central America. Not exactly in the same vein as your request, but also good foundation material.",

The French Trilogy is incredibly useful for understanding Marx's theory of politics and revolution. German Ideology and Critique of the Gotha Program are also really good. After than, Capital vol.1 (ignore people calling it difficult, it takes time and effort like most things worth doing in the world but requires no prior knowledge of anything).\n\nSome people like to skip Marx and start with Marxists over the man himself, I believe that's a bad way to go. If you read Lenin without understanding Marx first you'll miss the theoretical depth of what he's doing and take him as a pragmatist tactician (as lots of semi-literate leftists tend to dismiss him as). Lenin himself would advise you to read Marx first.\n\nYou don't need to read Hegel, Fourier, Ricardo etc before Marx to understand him btw (not saying not to read them, all can be very useful, just not strictly necessary to understand Marx). Marx creates a new total way of seeing society. Lenin, Gramsci, Luxemburg, Mao, Sankara etc all move in that totality. Grasping the root is crucial.",
