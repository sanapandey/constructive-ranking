            "body": "Agreed! Let's get rid of all political/social violence including hunger in a society that has enough food, homelessness where there are more than enough homes, people dying of treatable conditions due to lack of insurance, imperialism, prison labour, racism, sexism, queerphobia, etc etc. But in our society all this violence is OK. If you try to protest against it, using physical violence against you is also OK. None of this is even considered violence even though it destroys lives and kills millions. But the second a cop's riot shield gets a scratch, we get liberals screaming the \"get violence out of politics, let's do it without violence, protest the right way\".\n\nWe should indeed all be against social/political violence. We should also be consistent with this opposition in all aspects of life. If the broken equipment of a riot cop activates your anti-violent principles more than homeless people in the streets, your problem is not with violence, it is with resistance.",

            "body": "In my experience, the issue we have as leftists is that the same personality traits that give people the human empathy to want to oppose capitalism, also makes them sort of meek and adverse to these ideas. A lot of leftists will upvote your post, but very few of them would ever do anything beyond protesting in the town square. (Hint: the people destroying our society are not in the town square, so protesting there is meaningless)\n\nRight wingers have the other side of the coin. The personality traits that make them right wingers leads to them being more likely to practice survivalist/weapons training/etc. etc.... but it also leads to their politics being dogshit and subservient to capitalist hierarchy.\n\nThere are some exceptions (like soviet soldiers during ww2, or black panthers in the 1960's), but that time seems to have come and gone. That's why I have sort of concluded that this whole society needs to basically collapse on itself before the leftists become more bold and the right wingers become disillusioned with capitalist hierarchy. It's not a great feeling to think that, but it just seems like that's the issue at hand here.",
