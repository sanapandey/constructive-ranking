Most people that had to get out of Cuba did it because the economical situation of the country was hardly sabotaged by decades of USA menace.\n\nYes, there is the Miami gusanos, the priviledged white slave owners that fled to the US after being offered many privileges as reward for shifting on their own country.\n\nBut there is also many people that had to find jobs in other countries because from time to time, the situation gets worsened in Cuba. There are many Cuban communists working aboard to make enough money to feed their families, because they understand the situation that is affecting their country. Some are eve supported by their government, like the Cuban doctors working abroad.",

And even after having a regime change, he would choose to loathe his own country and defend the slaver farmers.\n\nIt does not matter how you look at it, your husband grandpa was a piece of shit, and your husband is even worse if he is making you defend his grandpa on the internet when you arent even Cuban.

Every large business I have ever interacted with has had to have, promote, anti slavery policies, because modern day slavery is still very much a real thing that needs to be actively policed against unless it creeps back into society.\n\nPeople who live in privilidged countries think slavery and imagine plantations in the past or ancient civilisation labour forces, but slavery is capable of evolving and growing with modern times as a concept, just like anything else can, and being aware of how modern slavery can be identified is an extremely important skill that people should be prepared to stop and apply to real life concerns regularly.\n\nSlavery is one of the most prolific aspects of human society and has been for most of recorded history. Being proactive about checking whether challenged behaviours could constitute slavery under modern definitions is extremely relevant, even today. Making assumptions that something isnt slavery based on assumed definitions and not applying actual assessment is a very slippery slope to allowing it to occur.",

In the case of Peter Pan they told parents and preachers over specific radio stations that Castro was planning on sending their kids to the USSR to be put into cans and sent back. 14,000 kids ended up getting sent to the US because of this. \n\nIt's a pretty small number in the grand scheme of things but it just kinda helps show what kind of shit the US was pulling to freak people out. Plus, Castro was not good to the wealthy and landowners (obviously) and I believe a large proportion of those who fled were exactly that.\n\nLastly, I think it's important to mention that although they're doing surprisingly well with what they have(like having one of the worlds best health systems) they also don't have much to work with. US sanctions have been a stranglehold on Cuba so much so that literally every other country in the UN has recognized this and voted to end the embargo multiple times but USA and Israel keep vetoing it (Ukraine abstained last time too). Communist or capitalist, being largely cut off from global trade is bound to cause hardship and a push factor for emigration.\n\nMost of this is just my opinion and i'm kinda a meathead so take it with a grain of salt",
