    "selftext": "As someone in their thirties who has only become aware of Marx over the last few years, I worry that it is the ultimate black pill.\n\nIt feels like we are so down the road of common ruin that there is no turning back.\n\nI work in a remote job as a software developer and while the work can be intellectually stimulating, it's extremely difficult to find roles where I am not just enriching shareholders. I'm not a manager yet I couldn't be further from feeling connected to the working class. Unions don't really seem to exist in my industry, my personal theory is that people have had it good for so long that they never felt the need to unionise. It's going to be a rude awakening when we are treated like other professions.\n\nI'm sad that I was born at a time where it feels like the realisation of communism has failed and there's no clear idea of what comes next aside from ever-increasing wealth disparity and climate crisis. Where is the hope?\n\n",

But, as with any agency and government with power, it has to be run by humans. Humans are corrupt. We will never have a perfect society, and there will always be someone who wants to take advantage of the masses. \n\nThis fact is the only reason we can not come together, and we can not have a normal existence. Ultimately, I believe things are worse under capitalism. Marx himself writes that a capitalist economy is cannibalistic. The only thing that matters is profits. I believe that shouldn't be the most important thing to humanity, to me, or to you. \n\nIn our current times, the US government is trying to run everything like a business. They are trying to be a capitalist government instead of a democracy (or republic if you like that term better.) The problem is, the government isn't a business. Governments, however you look at them, are something metaphysical. Government is a promise. A promise to provide services to the sick, veterans who defended the government, a promise to build roads and bridges on our behalf, and also to make sure that the roads, bridges, food, drugs, and products that we use every day are SAFE TO USE! \n\nI give up a certain amount of my own personal power so that the Government will protect me. This is Locke's social contract. I understand that, and i will give my avaliable resources to make that happen; however, when the system is disrupted, and suddenly there's a government taking away established protections, the social contract is broken, and E.V.E.R.Y.O.N.E. WILL be affected. \n\nOP, you might be black pilled. Idk what your feeling right now, but you're not alone. I was reading Marx when I was in high school. I'm right here with you. There's nothing more human affirming that recognizing that some of the things Marx says are good. As i said in the beginning, no system is perfect. But im glad you saw something in this philosophy you liked. \n\nMuch love",

I know because it's my job, I literally build machines that take the place of people.\u00a0\n\n\nFor now, what I am doing is enriching shareholders. If you want to take down a system you have to start by working inside the system, if no one has noticed no amount of protests and complaining actually produces change. But I will go from company to company displacing labour. For now, this is a net bad.\u00a0\n\n\nBut say there are hundreds of people like me, and every time we displace a job it's not just in the building we work, but in hundreds of buildings like it. Every time I design and create a machine for a task hundreds of jobs get displaced by it, it won't be long before the majority of work is done by machines. In my building alone I have cut the work force down from 70 to 30, and in about a year it'll be 3 to 5. It won't be long before people notice the majority of shit they buy is produced without labour or cost, and eventually the people will seize the means of production.\n\n\nNow, is this going to happen in my lifetime? Probably not. The industrial revolution took 100 years (ish) and many, many people died in the conversion. But I have confidence that automating 90% of work alongside AI, which will very quickly be able to tell in real-time if someone is lying and to what degree, will herald a new age of enlightenment. People will die, and things are obviously on a downward trend right now, but it is inevitable what I am describing. In fact, even if we have another depression it will just accelerate the process, people will buy CNC gardens instead of groceries and solar panels instead of overpriced power.\n\n\nThe future is here, it looks bright, but we have to keep our fucking mouths shut before the capitalist realize they are savings-chasing themselves into an early grave.",

Things will get worse and people are going to die. It doesn't matter if automation or communism comes around, people will die and people will suffer. The reality is at least we have technology to look forward to actually replacing labor, unlike if you were born, say when Marx was writing his books, where the future is 2 or 300 years away, you can't even imagine it, and you will definitely die in squalor.\n\n\nAnd your whole point about my personal morality in the situation is ridiculous.

When did this become about me? When did this conversation become about judging the people that are commenting on the system? I don't understand your need to attack me for doing a thing. Please explain how you feel I should act. When did I imply that individuals should all collectively act as though their personal choices will uproot or disrupt the system?\u00a0\n\n\nWould you be happier if I just cut off my frontal lobe so that I could be a line worker and more line workers could be line workers? Do you think that the life of a line worker in a factory is some kind of idyllic situation? I do not understand what you are implying. The correct thing that I should do is. So please tell me what that is.",

There are countless other things that have to happen before I am ready to sit down and write code. If I attempted to generate that code using an LLM I would probably have to spend longer checking it that I would have spent writing it myself.\n\nIt would be more of an issue if LLMs were in their infancy and had a huge amount of potential. The opposite is the case. They already seem to be at the point of diminishing returns, just look at the reactions to OpenAPI's GPT 4.5 that was announced today.\n\nI personally believe that it's all hype to keep the tech bubble going.
