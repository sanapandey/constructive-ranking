    "selftext": "\"Why are you so afraid of the word 'Fascism'? Just a word\u2026 just a word! And might not be so bad, with all the lazy bums we got panhandling relief nowadays and living on my income tax and yours, not so worse to have a real strong man, like Hitler or Mussolini, like Napoleon or Bismarck in the good old days, and have 'em really run the country and make it efficient and prosperous again. In other words, like a doctor who won't take any back chat, but really boss the patient and make him get well whether he likes it or not!\" \nIT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE\nSinclair Lewis\n#BornThisDay \u2013 February 7, 1885 \n\nIn 1930, Lewis became the first writer from the USA to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. He literally wrote the book on the fascist takeover of the USA.\n\nIT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE (1935) is a satirical novel published during the rise of fascism in Europe. It's about the rise of a politician who is elected POTUS after fomenting fear and promising drastic economic and social reforms while promoting a return to patriotism and \"traditional\" values. After his election, he takes complete control of the government and imposes totalitarian rule with the help of a ruthless paramilitary force. \n\nMGM purchased the rights. By early 1936, screenwriter Sidney Howard completed an adaptation. But studio head Louis B. Mayer indefinitely postponed production after William Hays of the Motion Picture Production Code notified Mayer of potential problems in the German market, saying the script was too \"anti-fascist\". \n\nFrom IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE: \"He was vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his ideas almost idiotic, while his celebrated piety was that of a traveling salesman for church furniture, and his yet more celebrated humor the sly cynicism of a country store. Certainly, there was nothing exhilarating in the actual words of his speeches, nor anything convincing in his philosophy. His political platforms were only wings of a windmill.\"\n\n1936 portrait by Edward Steichen\n\nS. Rutledge\n#BTD",
