    "selftext": "In regards to leftist in-fighting, I am hoping to hear thoughts on this book, ***Elite Capture: How the Powerful Took Over Identity Politics (and everything else)*** by Ol\u00faf\u1eb9\u0301mi O. T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2. I'm currently reading this book and seeing the author name and call out the issues we see in the problems we have uniting the working class and our (in)effectiveness as a collective voice. But I want to hear from other people who have read and or are familiar with this book and the author.   \n  \nExcerpt from the book:   \n  \n*Visible performance of a deferential act of \u201cpassing the mic\u201d or \u201cstepping back\u201d in order to give attention or space to another person does tend to redistribute short-term attention, as promised. But deference politics can still mask essential power relations, especially when we consider the performance in the context of the people who aren\u2019t in the room at all. For instance, one white person giving the mic to the specific person of color in the room can obscure both the overall power dynamics of the room and the whole room\u2019s relationship to the broader category of \u201cpeople of color\u201d that a particular comrade is taken to represent.*\n\nQuote came from Chapter 3, link to a review of the book: [Elite Capture ](https://marxandphilosophy.org.uk/reviews/21143_elite-capture-how-the-powerful-took-over-identity-politics-and-everything-else-by-olufemi-o-taiwo-reviewed-by-kevin-dodson/)",

It's about how \"yes\" this can be a good thing, but let's take it deeper or get a clearer picture -- given class, white supremacist systems, etc. -- and do more to be actively inclusive. Makes me think of john powell's targeted universalism and Heather McGhee's The Sum of Us (multi ethnic and racial coalitions). Also makes me think about Rev. William Barber's moral fusion.",
