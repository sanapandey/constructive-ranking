Majority of Uyghur people are very integrated into Chinese culture. They support the \"one China\" doctrine while two other groups of Uyghur people (both are small factions of their population) want either a more westernized way of life or a more Islamic/Muslim way of life, \"but we are all Chinese\" is what I've heard. The CCP has indeed built infrastructure in Xinjiang, including schools and trade schools, housing, etc. There's even an image of a \"concentration camp\" that was making the rounds a few years ago that turned out to be a primary school. One could easily look at the history of the US and Canada and how we've treated indigenous people and see how terrible sovereign nations/reservations and Canadian Residential programs were (are) managed (I believe in landback, personally). But as far as I can see, the Uyghur people have been in this region for thousands of years, an protect borders in this area. Also, one of the main instigators of the Uyghur genocide theory is of Uyghur descent, born in Turkey (they are also in Turkey), and identifies with more of a western way of life. It is probably no coincidence her family has close ties to the State Department's Radio Free Asia. I'm not saying problematic issues aren't occuring, but I certainly don't think there's a genocide or concentration camps. Many Uyghur women post their recipes, fashion, culture, lifestyle on REDnote just like anyone living in Beijing would. And everyone in the comments thought I was being racist by asking about genocide and forced labor in their community. \n\nTldr: Imo there's nothing even close to genocide, culture school, forced labor, and mass incarceration going on with China's minority communities. As a matter of fact, they pushed back saying \"not every country is like America.\" \ud83d\ude33\n\nSorry for the wall of text. Please engage on the posts in the comment section. I'm currently having a pleasant debate about LGBTQ people in the comments and none of it has been censored at all.",

China's working conditions and human living conditions have continued to improve as they have methodically used the West's vast overconsumption and unwillingness to soil it's own hands in the production of its consumer demand. \nChinese people are at least able to see the tangible rewards of their collective efforts, in their own country and it's development. Finally getting to see things without the filter on my information has been enlightening. Find people that share interests with you outside of politics, and try to see them as people. It will shock you how much more you and your ideal life's peace have in common with people in China, rather than of other folks in late stage capitalist societies. What we were told leads to famine has led to a robust modern nation, poised to enter a new era of progress. What we were told was liberty and justice for all, is in actuality a stringent divide between the haves and have-nots. \n\nWho is being forgotten are the people filling the roles that Chinese peasants in unskilled labor fulfilled, during their nation's earliest decades. Those people are in India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, Uruguay, nations in Africa... Basically anywhere a capitalist can ship things cost effectively, and exploit either a lack of worker protections or pay. Sweat shops will never lose their place in mass manufacture of goods. Heaven forbid we don't have seventy shirts for each season.",

Companies may apply for special permission to adopt a 996 schedule if their business warrants it. Pilots or train conductors, for example, can work longer shifts than the eight hours stipulated under Chinese law. But e-commerce businesses like the one Li was working for do not qualify.\n\n> \u201cSo even if these companies try to apply for such working hours, most of them would not get approval from the labour administration,\u201d Zhang says.

Due to special reasons, and under the premise of \"protecting the health of workers\", \"it shall not exceed three hours per day and thirty-six hours per month\". If calculated in this way, the \"996\" working hour system uses 18 hours more per week, and the monthly overtime limit is used up in half a month.

Since they receive more money by working more, people get incentivized to work more, when the job allows it.\n\nSome jobs just dont allow higher work rates, for many reasons. Health reasons, not being profitable for the employers, the salary being higher then usual, etc.\n\nAlso, in China they dont work all time, non stop, like you americans do. Most jobs in China allow actual lunch stops, of over an hour in most of the times. And they prefer to work more efficiently instead of working harder. So while they may stay on the job longer, that doesnt mean they do more work.\n\nAnd Chinese have to expent an considerably lesser ammount of money then americans do, so having lower salarys actually makes sense there. The food is cheaper, they have high quality public transport, housing is cheaper, the healthcare is very cheap (but its not free), the wifi is cheap, electricity and water is cheap, etc.\n\nWhen you have to expend less money, you get considerably less stressed, and can do more things outside of your job. And you can choose to take some time to relax and expend your well earned money, since you arent being threatened by looming bankruptcy.\n\nAlso, suicide nets arent a thing, in China at least. Their suicide rate is very low compared to the rest of eastern Asia. People have less reasons to commit suicide when things are working well for then.",

These people's content and comments are generally not censored on Chinese social media, unless they advocate for overthrow of the government or spread foreign info-war (like weeger propaganda or Chyna collapse theory).\u00a0So is this Totalitarian? No, but you could say their speech controls are still tighter than those in the Western bloc, which is increasingly restricting speech as well, if not through law, then through corporate \"content policies\" and \"moderation\".\u00a0\n\nAs for the accusation of China being a \"police state\"...absolute horse-shit. Chinese police are generally unarmed, and because the crime-rate is so low (the violent crime-rate is even lower), they end up doing things like helping the elderly carry groceries or cross the road, assisting foreigners with directions. The US has much higher crime rates, many more heavily armed (trigger-happy/willing to punch/choke/body-slam) cops roaming the street, and a much larger prison population (with all the violence and sexual predation common in the US prison system).",

They have lots of ability to mobilize violent and subversive force on a global scale. If you are going to oppose them on a global scale, you need to be organized and centralized as they are to be able to resist and react to acts of violence, sabotage, espionage, etc. It's maybe not pretty or ideal, but the material reality of opposing violent capitalist power structures often requires \"authoritarian\" measures.\n\nThe West is just as if not much, much more authoritarian in support of bourgeois interests. They have no qualms about spying on labor leaders, cracking down with police surveillance and violence, bombing and assassinating the leaders of countries (see Salvador Allende in Chile) that challenge them globally. Often, being labeled authoritarian by the Western powers just means you've refused to bend the knee to their every whim.",

The level of authoritarianism will depend on your lenses and intellectual affiliation, honestly.\n\nMy answer is: NO, China isn\u2019t as authoritarian as the West depicts it.

The fact that you think that just demonstrates you don't really know much about China. I'm saying this from personal experience, a few years ago I thought the same thing you did. Then I actually started learning about China and realized I was incorrect.\n\nInternationally, the US is the boot of capital on the world's neck. It invades, bombs, stages coups, embargos and sanctions, spends billion on backing opposition groups to destabilize countries, arms and funds terrorists and right wing death squads, arms and assists in genocides, and on and on. China doesn't do any of that, the last time they were at war with anyone or bombed anyone was almost 50 years ago.\n\nWhen a country nationalizes resources the US wants they will invade or stage a coup and install a brutal right wing dictator who will sell them off to Western corporations. If a country nationalizes resources China wants they don't care. They will go the country and offer to build ports, railroads, airports, hospitals, and schools. They will over to develop the mines or whatever and let the country maintain ownership and buy the minerals from them.\n\nThe US wants to keep these countries in poverty as a source of cheap labor. China, since they make everything, wants them to develop and have a growing middle class to buy their consumer goods. There is a world of difference in foreign policy. None of it is altruism from China, they do it because it benefits themselves but it's a win win situation. Economic historians have demonstrated that this sort of cooperation is actually an economically superior way of doing things for the powerful party rather than with force and coercion like the West.\n\nDomestically, China is a country where the government actually cares about improving things for their people, I mean 90% of the population thinks so. Things have been getting better and better for pretty much everyone for decades now in China. The opposite of the US in particular and the West in general where things have been getting worse for decades.\n\nXi Jinping is genuinely a highly capable and well liked leader. China has changed dramatically over the last 20 years, standards of living have dramatically risen for pretty much everyone. They have dedicated a massive amount of resources to poverty alleviation and infrastructure programs, on a scale that makes FDR's New Deal look like Reaganite austerity.\n\nXi is popular for the same reason as FDR (I mean look at [the electoral map for FDR](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/5696/2015/08/13211558/800px-ElectoralCollege1932.svg_.png)). People like it when things are, year after year, getting better. If FDR had lived longer he quite likely could have easily won every election for life. Likewise with Xi. Term limits are bullshit, if there is a capable, respected leader they should be able to lead for as long as they can.\n\nI know what you're thinking but this is just speaking factually. It sounds like dick riding to you because you aren't familiar with states that are actually trying to make things better. We're most familiar with our own ghoulish governments and just assume everyone else is like that too. Is China perfect? Of course not, and there is plenty you could criticize them for, but as far as countries go they are pretty good.",

Like I said, I used to agree with you until I learned better.\n\nWhile not usually the case their infrastructure building is actually sometimes free. But, unlike the West, there has never been an instance where China has used a country unable to repay their loans coercively. They will restructure the loan or outright forgive it. They've never tried to enforce privatization and austerity on a country to allow their corporations to buy up resources like that like the West does. What China does is not imperialism.\n\nThe fact that you bring up Taiwan here further demonstrates that you don't know much. Taiwan isn't just some island country minding their own business that China decided they wanted. Taiwan has been a part of China since the middle ages. During the civil war when the communists were fighting the Republic of China (ROC) led by the fascist Kuomintang the communists took control of the mainland, founded the PRC and the fascists fled to Taiwan. The communists were unable to retake Taiwan and there has never officially been any peace agreement. The government of Taiwan is still the ROC, both governments claim to be the rightful government of all of China, which Taiwan is a part of.\n\nTibet is much the same, it was a breakaway province, Taiwan also claims Tibet as one of their provinces. And, even if it were purely an act of imperial aggression, that was 73 years ago.\n\nWith the South China Sea it's complicated. Like China and Vietnam dispute the Paracel Islands. The islands are equidistant between the two countries but have been a part of China for millennia. In the late 1800s when Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos were colonized by the French as French Indochina, France took the islands from China and made them part of French Indochina. When Vietnam gained their independence they kept these islands. Then in the '70s, the last time China was at war, which was with Vietnam, China retook these islands. So who do these islands belong to? Both sides have legitimate claims, though China's seem stronger to me. This is then framed as Chinese aggression.\n\nTerm limits are bullshit and plenty of liberal democracies do not have them. Angela Merkel was chancellor for 16 years, is that authoritarian dictatorship as well?\n\nI hate to break it to you, bud, but you're the one being played like a fiddle.",

Specifically because with these actions of China if it had been a Western country doing it for similar reasons nobody would bat an eye.\n\nAnother analogy I guess but, for example, do you think Moldova is being imperialist by claiming Transnistria? It's the same kind of thing with Taiwan, Tibet, and the Paracel Islands.\n\nThough with China's border claims like this we should also compare India and Pakistan. Because of the borders drawn up in the colonial era there have been conflicts over territory between China and most of their neighbors. There were similar conflicts with Pakistan and India but the border conflicts with Pakistan were ended amicably in Pakistan's favor decades ago. China has also long offered to India to draw the borders where they are, with the part currently held by China as part of China and the part held by India as part of India. India has refused and been intransigent and unwilling to negotiate and insisting that China cede all colonial claims to them. This is then framed as Chinese aggression.\n\nBut, for arguments sake, let's say you're completely right and these actions are blatant imperialism. Compare that to the West. Like I said earlier it's a drop in the ocean. Also like I said earlier, China is not beyond criticism.\n\nI'm not arguing China is a saint, I'm just arguing that they're actually pretty good and far better than the West. I also kind of feel like this is completely self evident if you hold the West and China to the same standards.",

He had partners and allies and enemies (for a bit, anyway).\n\nYou can go further back and look at Caesar Augustus. In the West, people look no further than his titles and assume he had totalitarian control of everything. But no Roman Emperor did. Again, they operated in a complex political environment and did not have the means or authority to control every aspect of what's going on.\n\nIt's the same in China. Xi has considerable power and influence, certainly more than any individual. But to think he has his finger on everything is not realistic. The CCCP relies on the cooperation of local democratic institutions. You can find plenty of videos of Chinese people talking openly about how yeah, the party is in control and they can't change that, so they get more invested in local politics than worrying about who leads the party. And why wouldn't they trust the CCP? They brought China from the brink of complete obliteration and illiteracy, to where they are now.",

Want to ride the metro? Gotta go through airport style bag scanners and metal detectors at every station. Intercity train? Show your passport. Visiting a city where Xi is in town? Go spend an hour at a police station so you can be registered before the hotel will let you stay.\n\n\nIt has a lot of potential, but is spoiled by having a top heavy government that lacks controls and rules.\u00a0\n\u00a0",

From what i can tell/have observed, it seems like the West typically sprinkles in true information with their wild lies to make it harder to figure out. \n\nSo while China is authoritarian and a surveillance state it seems like to a lesser extent than what you would hear from the west. The surveillance is more wide spread than in the west but its all above board, with the citizens knowing they're being watched and understanding it where as the West lies about it and hides their surveillance so its not that China is doing it more or is worse for surveillance necessarily, its just they aren't hiding the fact they do it. \n\nFrom what I've observed and gathered, to me it seems like the west is angry that China is beating them at their own game, and they're even more mad that China isn't playing it the way the west does. So they need to paint China as this big comically evil villain to make it seem like they aren't winning, or if they are winning that its bad. \n\nThe west does it they just hide it.

In totalitarian or highly authoritarian societies, everyone basically falls in line and tries to save their own skin which makes them extremely conformist. To be an advanced economy, creativity and a plurality of thought needs to be rewarded and encouraged so you have innovation and novel ideas pushing society forward, totalitarianism conversely demands high levels of conformity and obedience and this leads to economic and cultural stagnation.\n\nChina and other socialist states aren't as authoritarian as the west claims because they don't hit the hard ceiling a totalitarian society would.\n\nIn some ways, China is less authoritarian than the west because major investments into public goods and services mean that people there often have more **positive freedoms** than people in the west, a concept that many westerners refuse to understand because western societies, the US in particular, only care about guaranteeing **negative freedoms**. In a society that only guarantees negative freedoms, you're free to warm your hands with any burning trash can you can find.",

There aren't police busting into innocent people's homes conducting raids, certainly not to the extent in America, nor are people getting shot by police during a traffic stop.   \n  \nThe West also likes to claim 'genocide' when it comes to the Uyghurs however my hometown is all the way in the northeastern part of China and even we have Uyghur style restaurants owned by Uyghurs, hard to believe a group that's allegedly being 'genocided' to be able to leave their homes freely and own businesses like any other ethnic group.   \n  \nJust for a quick comparison, I live in Australia which has mandatory voting, it's great right? However my electorate literally in 80 years have always elected the same Liberal party over the Labor party, they have not lost in a single election. So does my vote matter at all? It sure feels like my vote is inconsequential in this case.   \n  \nSo by the West's definition that lack of voting = authoritarian, then fine China is authoritarian. However is being able to vote but your vote being literally inconsequential really any better (which is the case for myself in the example above). Or is it just a facade that your vote matters at all in the West\n\nTLDR : literally no difference when it comes to actual ordinary citizen's lives when living in China compared to the West.",
