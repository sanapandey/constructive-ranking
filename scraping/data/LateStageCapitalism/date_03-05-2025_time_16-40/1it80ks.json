    "title": "61% of Israelis don't see forced sex with acquaintance as rape. When asked whether they saw forced sex with a spouse as rape, only 8.5% of women and 7.3% of men said yes. Less than 50% of Israeli men think Israeli women are just as capable of committing genocide as them. Truly a beacon of feminism.",
