The stock market can vacillate wildly due to his bone-headed policy moves, but as long as the venture capital flows, the speculative bro-products remain spicy, and Americans see a relatively larger number on their portfolios than they did 12 months ago, his approval and power will remain where it needs to.\n\nWealth begets power, which begets more wealth. It is a sacrosanct law of capitalist politics. The only thing I changing capital on a mass scale is a general strike.\n\nAnd a final question, because, if we aren't truthful, we're nothing:\n\nHow many of you have absolutely no money in the stock market? (no 401k, 403b, no pension, no bonds, no nothing) As much as I would like to, I can't claim I do.",

I'm supposed to be grateful for Capitalism that I'm fortunate enough to eke out the possibility of comfort while most Americans don't even get a chance? Again, I will gladly exchange my capitalist crumbs for a better social safety net for everyone.\n\nWhen Republicans say my awesome (lol) 401k and private health insurance are under threat from Democrats I'm like \"yes, plz.\" But you're right, I'll get screwed over anyway and Republicans will still blame it on those Communist Democrats, illegals, and the poors.

They don't even know what woke is. I heard a guy say that he was \"surprised about the wokeness of it all\" referring to the fake corruption in the social security system payment system. The fuck does that even mean??\n\nPretending to win is all he and the most extreme of his supporters have left. It doesn't have to make sense. You think they're all gonna let the last thing keeping their shit together (a phrase I use loosely) go in a post truth America? Doubt it.\n\nDoesn't matter. Stonks can be up down left or right. It's \"not his fault\" somehow. Even when he is directly introducing fear into the market. The only way he loses, is if he loses support. I'd be surprised if people turn on him.
