    "selftext": "I'm going to spend more time reading economics (Marx, Ha Joon Chang etc). **In case there are economists here, let me know if the following is of interest**.\n\nI'm not very rich, but rich enough to have the privilege of overseas vacations. (And yes, you will see huge inequalities in the poorer countries, and it's very depressing.) I also look at high-quality travel vlogs. These, plus Reddit, show a trend:\n\n**When a travel destination sees very low demand, there are very few suppliers willing to provide hotels and flights, and the lack of competition drives prices upwards**.\n\n(Since I can't link to a subreddit, I want to visit Timor-Leste - talking to people to gauge how they look back on the genocide, checking out the political economy. But the airfares are super expensive for the region. I found a Reddit post asking why, and apparently this reason was given in the answers.)\n\n**This could be the most blatant refutation of the neoclassical supply and demand graphs taught in high school**. Let me know if you agree.",
