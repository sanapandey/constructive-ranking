Even though those were put there by Obama, used by Trump and Biden approved plans to build [a new facility in Guantanamo](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/16/nx-s1-5252468/guantanamo-biden-legacybuild)  which now once completed, will conveniently be used by Trump to house undocumented immigrants.",

The idea that Putin is puppeteering the GOP behind the scenes, is ultimately an American and European liberal conspiracy theory which has the purpose to write off the GOP and the pro-Russian European far right as something \"not\" American/European. It is essentially a way for liberals to deny the fact that their far right parties are a product of their *own* domestic conditions.\n\nThis does *not* however mean that these parties are not pro-Russian, or that they have no ties to Russia, but this is because their politics and ideology are aligned. The mistake is in believing that Putin and Russia are the source of the pro-Russian sentiments.\n\nFor Trump himself, I think you are spot on. Trump is not an \"ideological\" fascist, but goes along with whatever politics which serve his own purposes best, which happens to be the politics of the far right. Moreover, his narcissistic traits are conductive to fascist expressions of power. Essentially, Trump is someone who *only* respects power, which is why he is actually somewhat respectful towards Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un, especially in the case of the latter, given that he leads a country that *should* on all accounts not be able to resist America\u2019s power.\n\nTrump is also influenced by those around him, and the general pro-Russian tendency on the far right is better explained by ideology. Essentially, the far right believes that communist China is their greatest geopolitical threat, and that Putin and Russia are a potential anti-China ally. The funny thing is that 10 years ago this actually might have been possible, but that the Russo-Ukraine conflict has led to an irreversible Russian pivot towards China. The fact that the far right are wasting their time pursuing this is potentially a very good thing.",

This means that oligarchic alignment can easily shift between the two parties, not just according to changes in their overall economic conditions, but also on a case by case basis. The tech industry shifting away from the Dems and towards the GOP in recent years is a good example of this.\n\nIf the parties served *different* oligarchs like you say, then the Dems would actually be in opposition to the Republicans, but this has simply never been the case. The lack of Dem resistance is especially prevalent right now that the GOP accelerationists are in charge. It is evident that the Dems are being told to fall in line, not necessarily because the oligarchy is in total agreement about the new direction, but that it is seen as preferable over *actual* opposition taking place, something which would be very damaging to the oligarchy as a whole.",

My in laws keep asking me when I'm going to \"Give them grandchildren.\" I keep reminding them I'm part Native American. We wouldn't breed in captivity, which is why they had to bring you all here. I mean, why would they even want to own slaves anymore when they can just rent you and your children for a fraction of the costs..?\n\nThe ruling class can afford a good enough education to know the true history of the United States and certainly to be able to understand the basic principle of cause and effect. They have us playing Russian roulette with our health every day in America for as much profit as they can squeeze out of us. A country with no public health care system obviously could not handle any public healthcare crisis like covid or the never-ending opioid addiction epidemic their private healthcare industry has created and continues to supply.\n\nWith no universal health care, the United States government forces people of lesser means to self medicate or suffer, then punishes them when they do. That is both cruel and wicked. I mean, the whole premise of Breaking Bad only worked for an American audience since Walt would not have needed the money in the first place in a more developed nation because being unable to afford to continue living does not happen there... \n\nThe powers that be are ensuring there are desperate people doing desperate things. Then, we see that the wealthy and their goons, the police, are beyond the reach of our justice system, so their laws are just in place to handicap the rest of us. The social contract has been broken. Que the vigilantes... no justice, no peace. \n\n\"Those who make peaceful change impossible make violent change inevitable. \" JFK\n\nNow I'm not saying don't vote. Please always choose the lesser evil. However, we have always been and always will be the scapegoats left to point our fingers at one another in order to keep us distracted from any meaningful change. I mean, what led to this, people couldn't vote...? How is what got us here going to get us out? When you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is stop digging. After all, repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result is the very definition of insanity. Before we can have an intelligent discussion on how things ought to be, we first would need to agree on how they truly are...\n\nI mean, out of all the hundreds of millions of Americans, who really thinks these were the best two candidates...? Is it a wise tribe that does not send its best warriors to fight? You see, our masters will never give us the tools to dismantle their houses... The Republic of America has a so-called \"representative democracy.\" How can that be true when the \"representatives\" are all wealthy while the majority of the \"represented\" are poor?\n\nAmerican two party politics is like the cartoon Tom and Jerry. Tom doesn't really want to catch Jerry because then he'd be out of a job, and Jerry doesn't want Tom replaced with a cat that will actually eat him. So they act like they hate one another and put on a show for the masses while continuing business as usual in the back room. \n\nFor example, insider trading laws do not apply to any members of Congress, either side. What's it called when those who make the rules don't have to live by them? Furthermore, when the punishment for a crime is only a fine, it does not apply to the wealthy. \n\nSure, they can say they let us \"vote\", and therefore this is what we wanted, but with all the lobbying and money in American politics, America is as much a democracy as would be two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for dinner. \n\nIn America, the wealthy have won every \"election,\" and the only thing to trickle down in the economy has been their generational wealth. This is why, in a true democracy as the ancient Greeks understood it, people got their representatives the same way we would get a jury. America is not a democracy. \n\n\"Only those who do not seek power are qualified to hold it.\" Plato\n\nAnd please remember what we actually celebrate on the 4th. A cabal of stolen land entitled elite, slave owning aristocrats, found a way to get out of paying their taxes. Only thirty percent of the colonists supported the \"revolution\" with the rest saying, \"Why trade one tyrant a thousand miles away for a thousand tyrants one mile away...?\" System isn't broken it's functioning exactly as intended. Why own slaves when you can rent them for a fraction of the cost (read the 13th amendment)...? But the real question they must be asking themselves is how can their grand experiment survive contact with the real time information/communication age, which is where we are now... would you agree?\n\n\"The poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man hasn't; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly, the rich have always objected to being governed at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists...\" G.K. Chesterton",

                                    "body": "\"Technofeudalism\" is entirely compatible with the analytical framework of Marx and Engels. \n\nI must preface this by saying that I think *Technofeudalism* is a great book, and that it contains a lot of incredibly valuable analysis. There are however a number of analytical \"traps\" which exist when approaching the post-2008 Financial Crisis digital sphere and economy from a Marxist perspective, which means that it is a subject which Marxist academics really struggle to get \"right\", Varoufakis included.\n\nVaroufakis' central thesis is that technofeudalism has replaced capitalism, in part due to how tech platforms extract profits through \"cloud rent\" instead of producing and selling material goods like corporations have under \"traditional\" capitalism. Like Varoufakis points out, \"cloud capital\" is not different from capital in its ability to shape behaviour, something which capital has always had. Nor is \"cloud capital\" immaterial or non-physical, as it exists in our digital infrastructure (server farms, etc.). Cloud capital, in Varoufakis' eyes, is essentially the \"algorithmic power\" to command our behaviour, with the critical distinction that cloud capital can reproduce itself *without* waged labour. We are essentially reduced to \"cloud serfs\" that does this reproduction for free.\n\nThis is a somewhat simplified and *very* brief explanation of where Varoufakis goes wrong, but he essentially makes a mistake of focusing solely on Marx's analysis of capitalism being a system which extracts the surplus value of waged labour, which leads him to overly fixate on a distinction between waged and unwaged labour. In somewhat of a typical western Marxist academic fashion, he has adopted a eurocentric analytical lense in where unwaged exploitation somehow becomes \"uncapitalist\". Varoufakis also tends to be naive/idealistic when it comes to the question of political power within capitalism\u2014his avoidance of discussing the role of the state within a socialist revolution being an example of this\u2014which leads to him drawing a false equivalence between historical land enclosures and the \"new\" digital enclosures which withholds our identities, when our identities and citizenships have always been subject of the capitalist class *within* in capitalist societies.\n\nThe result is that Varoufakis draws some false conclusions when attempting to ascribe aspects of the post-2008 economy, aspects which in reality have *always* been present within capitalism. Unwaged forms of human labour has always existed and sustained capitalism. The \"feudal\" cloud rent of Big Tech is simply another expression of the exploitation within monopolised capitalist markets. Cloud capital functions and exists just like any other capital. Big Tech algorithms may appear autonomous, but they are created and sustained by human labour, as well as rely on a digital infrastructure that consists of other forms of capital. Additionally, the ability of cloud capital to command our behaviours, is nothing *fundamentally* different from how traditional marketing works, as well as how traditional media has always curated and filtered what we are exposed to in terms of products, news and ideology. This has also always been a process informed by our consumption patterns. What we are experiencing now is certainly a hyperintensification, however, especially considering that it is much more individualised.\n\nMoreover, Big Tech does not actually profit all that much from rent extraction like Varoufakis' thesis implies, but have value because they allow other corporations to sell their goods and services, in addition to accumulating capital by being overvalued in the eyes of investors who have increasingly been operating on \"vibes\" since the financial markets began recycling debts in the 1970s. Nick Srnicek touches upon this in his book *Platform Capitalism* (not a perfect analysis either but also a good one), but Big Tech are essentially capable of overinflating their own value, due to how they are not \"tied\" to a very specific industry, and do not need to grow through vertical and/or horisontal aquisitions within their own field. This makes it possible for Big Tech to more effectively leverage \"vibes\"-based investments by chasing business acquistions which serve some sort of \"niche\" or \"fad\". This means that the value of Big Tech is in some sense \"immaterial\", but none of these aspects are novel within capitalism. It is pretty much the 21st century version of chasing new forms of snake oil.\n\nIn defence of Varoufakis, I do think that his \"technofeudalism\" describes an accelerationist trend within capitalism after 2008. It is a trend that has always existed, and is not unlike how technology has allowed capitalism to find new ways of extracting surplus profit in the past. I also think that \"technofeudalism\" is a great rhetoric tool, moreso for selling books than making accurate analysis, but I also appreciate its appeal. I've written academic papers on the topic and I am really impressed with the way Varoufakis writes and conveys his ideas. Ultimately I think that Varoufakis analytical missteps are the main issue, not the term \"technofeudalism\" itself. We're talking about really minor and technical mistakes here, but ones that affect his overal thesis, and his book ultimately serves to obfuscate much of capitalism's history of the same and/or similar forms of exploitation. Presenting technofeudalism as something \"new\" lets capitalism off the hook, so to speak, even though I do not believe that this ever was Varoufakis' intention.\n\nIn the end just to summarise: Technofeudalism does not describe anything new in these respects, but I see how Varoufakis' eurocentrism informs such a conclusion. It is also an easy mistake to make, seeing as Marx *did* focus a lot of his work on waged labour due to having somewhat of a eurocentric approach of his own. Though this is not an excuse, seeing as Marx\u2019s analysis of slavery, primitive accumulation, and social reproduction shows that he recognised capitalism\u2019s reliance on multiple forms of labor exploitation, both waged and unwaged. Technofeudalism is ultimately perfectly compatible with the framework of Marx and Engels, and their dialectical method allows us to extend the Marxist framework to modern contexts like \"digital serfdom\".\n\nIf there is one key takeaway from this it is that capitalism is not *solely* defined by wage labor but also by a totalising drive to commodify all aspects life\u2014a process which combines wage exploitation with unwaged coercion.",

However, **the initiative defines what constitutes as a \u201crecord,\u201d to include items such as medical or health records; records of any mental health counseling; and any other student-specific files, documents, or other materials maintained by the school.**\n\nYou might be forgiven for thinking this section was not actually implemented, since a lower court issued a temporary stay specifically around this section. But as the OSPI website points out, the lawsuit was later dismissed by a Democratic judge. Current WA law creates a chilling effect where trans students cannot seek public school mental health resources without their parents having access to those records.\n\nTo steel man your position: your strongest defense of the Democrats here would be to point out that some of them are now trying to amend it. But defending the Parents Bill of Rights as pro-LGBTQIA+ is just spitting on those of us who are actually affected by this shit.",

[multiple supermajorities, startling new powers given to the oval office *during Biden's term*, etc]\n\nSo why haven't they? I offer two reasons:\n\n 1 Because then they'd have no ammunition for the Republican gun they hold to vulnerable voters and progressives alike every two years. \n\n 2 Because they are beholden to all the same big donors/lobbyists that help get the assholes across the aisle elected. And because they serve the same people with the same monied interests, they have the same ultimate goals as the aforementioned assholes. \n\nThey simply play a different role in creating the illusion of choice in order to continue the advancement of both parties' *real* agenda: further enriching the already ultra-wealthy [their owners].\n\nWhile ofc simultaneously co-opting any leftist movements that develop in order to subvert and destroy them from the inside before they can gain real momentum.

They only believe that individuals should have the *opportunity* to change things for themselves.\n\nConservatives believe in systemic change. And when you have two ideologies where one believes in systemic change, and the other does not, you have a political ratchet effect where the overton window shifts to the ideology that believes in systemic change.\n\n\nThere are so many examples of this in effect\n\n- Abortion rights not being codified into law\n\n- Tax cuts never being reversed \n\n- Minimum wages staying stagnant \n\n- Workers being stripped of union rights\n\n- Stripping government programs\n\n\nIn each instance, conservatives enact systemic change, and Neoliberals agree on the conservative framing and only allow for individuals to solve their own problems, with the government only there to maybe support the individual in solving those problems, means tested of course.",

By keeping people engaged with a specific team, the real game of robbing the poor to feed the rich continues unabated. Social issues are used to distract from economics, so Democrats will do a bare minium to \"fix\" a problem because it keeps the problem around to be used in the next election cycle. \n\nObamacare is the ultimate example. It did improve things, but didn't fix the system and left plenty of loopholes that have now been exploited to their maximum, making healthcare too expensive once again. People have been trying to improve healthcare in this country since before FDR, and yet every fix to the system is a patch that gets exploited until people can't take it anymore and a new patch is created. The demand for profits in the system is always in the foreground in any discussion, instead of the needs of the people. This same dynamic plays out on every topic. We can't do that much about global warming because it hurts fossil fuels.

And everything they tried to do was basically blocked by one \"democratic\" senator. And they lost that supermajority very quickly to a special election.\n\n---------\n\nBut the real reason is because they're Democrats, not progressives. And since the Republicans are all basically in lock-step, a Democrat is more just 'anybody who isn't a Republican' - so it's a big tent. And it's hard to get enough votes - they have issues with coalition building.\n\nThe Democrats don't have as good of a propaganda media arm that gets all their followers to believe in immigrants eating dogs & cats. And if they did, they still wouldn't be able to convince their voters to agree on anything.\n\nSo Republicans get insane shit passed in lockstep.\n\nAnd even if Democrats controlled every seat, they would still disagree too much to pass anything progressive.\n\n---------\n\n*EDIT* - the #1 thing the Dems can and should do... Filibuster everything possible. Force the Republicans to abolish it. Otherwise, the Dems will act as though their hands are tied, just so maintain a filibuster that they never use and the Republicans will use at every opportunity anyway. It's both sides playing with two different sets of rules.\n\nObstruct and Filibuster. Be the assholes the right says you are. Their followers believe it anyway, you lose nothing by obstructing. But you might just gain some respect of the left. And you get to force them to do away with the one thing that makes it so you can't get anything done if we ever do get a majority again.",

Kids that showed up alone. Where are they supposed to go? Foster families? How do you find their parents? Their parents obviously thought that if they sent them alone that the US wouldn't be able to deny them entry. With no housing for adults, they were given court dates and allowed to enter the US until their asylum case could be heard. \n\nThem Trump's first administration changed the interpretation of the law. They stopped letting people/families in to await trial, and any that crossed the border, a misdemeanor, were considered to have broken the law and they would be separated from their children and both imprisoned. If you're going to lock people up, you can't lock them up with kids and adults in the same place right? They termed this an end to Catch-and-release. So the previous camps that were used for unaccompanied minors, were now also being used for family separation, which is horrendous. They claimed it was it a deterrent. \n\nBiden switched it back to catch-and-release with asylum seekers awaiting their hearing, and only unaccompanied minors being housed in those buildings at the border. \n\nIt's a complicated problem when people are so desperate they send their kids, alone, to cross the border. Are their parents in some kind of trouble, or have a record? Maybe they have cousins here, who knows?  The solution was not to make it worse, like the R's did. It would seem that the cruelty was the point for them. The D's have tried repeatedly to get more asylum judges down there so this wouldn't be as much of a problem. Get their cases resolved quicker. The budgets always get shut down. I would say that part of it IS both sides dragging their feet because they like having the problem to run on. \n\nImmigration used to be reversed, btw. R's loved immigration in the 90's because they knew our farms, meat packing, and a decent portion of the construction industry relied on undocumented labor that worked for cheap and outside of the US labor laws. The D's said this was slave labor, and these people should be recognized as worked with labor protections afforded to Americans. The R's knew this would hurt alot of businesses, so they just left it alone. Somewhere along the line, the R's changed to hate-that-guy-over-there. If you recall during Trump 1, \"no one wants to work\". They ran off alot of the labor. Then immigrants came back, and started to fill those positions once Biden came in. By next year, you'll hear \"no one wants to work again\" because of lazy this and that... we need immigration, and there should be protections for those people, too.\n\nNow tariffs from the first Trump term... the Biden administration largely left those in tact, which was absurd. I can see that it would be difficult to pull them back when American business had reorganized around their existence, but that didn't help inflation. A gradual draw down of tariffs could have helped the general public.",
