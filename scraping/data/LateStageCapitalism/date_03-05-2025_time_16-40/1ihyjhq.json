    "selftext": "Trump just claimed on the air, next to Netanyahu, that the United States is making a claim for Gaza. He stated that the populace of Gaza should leave, and we\u2019ll help them (I\u2019m sure we will). \n\nI just called the DC line for my senator and expressed great discomfort & concern, and I implored them to take real & decisive action against this. If you live in the United States, call your senator and tell them to stop this resurgence of imperialism/colonialism. We are isolating ourselves and showing aggression to our long term allies.\n\nEdit to add video link:\nhttps://youtu.be/hyi59PGiClg?feature=shared",

What more could they do than what Israel already did?  Just murder everyone there?  You can't use nuclear or chemical weapons because the fallout would leak into Israel.  Practically speaking, they're going to have to go into Gaza and get into those tunnels and fight hand-to-hand, while simultaneously seizing territory from treaty allies, keeping the peace at home, maintaining that massive debt bubble that keeps the country afloat... it's a lot.",

And as economic conditions worsen, and the divide between the rich and poor widens, people start looking for answers for why things are the way they are. There are the leftists who realize capitalism is at fault and look to establish a better system, and then there is fascism. Fascists put the blame on a scapegoat as the answer to everyone's problems and demand the accumulation of more and more power to deal with the perceived threat. But here's the thing, capitalists aren't against fascism, because fascism still protects capital.\n\nI'd be able to forgive you for thinking liberal candidates were a solution to fighting fascism if things weren't as bad as they are now with the occasional concessions they provide (which they can take away at anytime) but considering how bad things have gotten and how close we are to full blown fascism, it should've been a wake up call that liberals are not against fascism when in the face of such evil, they offered a genocidal capitalist to go up against a fascist.\n\nThings will keep getting worse and the capitalists will either ignore fascists or side with them if they fear leftists are getting too strong because only leftists want to replace capitalism with a better system.",

People felt betrayed, progressives did not vote because it betrayed what the standed for. \n\nTrump gains in votes from 4 years to now is very marginal, and more related to population growth them anything else. If the dems had some integrity they would have easily won.\n\nYou now have four years to ditch the dems and build an actual progressive party.

This includes encouraging people to vote for any capitalist political party and any capitalist politician. Harm reduction is not done by supporting either of the two genocidal political parties. The extent to which any elected official of a Capitalist Party in a Capitalist state can enact evil is the extent to which that official is allowed to do so by Capital. As such, neither major candidate is the lesser or greater evil.

If the US didn't have a horrible track record with imperialism and he wasn't alienating allies I think I'd agree with this idea. However, it of course would've been simpler if the US had allowed UN police into DC to sweep up Netanyahu while he was here last year.",

These people deserve democracy in their nations to secure their rights. I'm a little confused by why you asked that question as Iran and Iraq rank in the top 10 of countries with the lowest amount of human freedoms. Theoretically, the US could help facilitate a protectorate in the middle east that ensured a home for Palestinians and stood as a beacon of hope better than the failed state of Israel. But I understand that Trump likely is not planning on doing this.",
