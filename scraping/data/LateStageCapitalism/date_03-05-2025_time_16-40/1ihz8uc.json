What is currently horrifying Americans is that the practices the US has long used abroad, are suddenly used by the US regime against themselves. That this would happen at some point was obvious since the Patriot Act, neither Democrats or Republicans have cared to reverse these developments or mend these institutional weaknesses. Because both parties find it beneficial.\n\nThe genocide has been ongoing for decades, and it became possible to upscale it to the murdering rampage we have witnessed over the last 16 months, because the entirety of your federal institutions are rotten to the core with corruption. There's no party represented in the Capitol that is opposed to this, and few Americans have cared about it as long as they weren't suffering consequences themselves.\n\nAnd Trump's ramblings about building a new riviera in Gaza is no more realistic than the US mission was to replace the Taliban in Afghanistan, despite the vast military capacities of the US it can at best sustain an occupation, and that always breeds resistance. Israel has lost the war already, it has years left, and the US has sacrificed its own international influence and standing in order to enable Israel. Trump isn't the cause or the catalyst of any of this, he is just nailing the coffin shut.",

But instead she tripled down on support for Israel, called protesters terrorists, and then went on to have the most neoconservative policy promises of any Democrat since before Reagan. Increased border security, increased military spending, increased oil drilling, etc etc etc. Her domestic policy only varied on the social issues, otherwise she was no better than Trump. \n\nKamala alienated her voters and then committed to compromise with the conservatives of economics. That's *her* fault, not the voters for having a conscious and a heart. You liberals also don't seem to understand the math doesn't add up. 58% of voters showed up which is on average for EVERY election, Kamala lost by only 2 million which means no amount of third party voters would've helped her win. Trump won because the Democrats didn't try to win, it's that simple.\n\nAnd if you think Palestine is isolated from every other domestic problem we have here in this country, you need to do some critical thinking. What else could the government have spent that $27.8 billion in weapons and aid we sent to Israel for over a year, that's the question you should be asking. Why does the government support war over climate change, infrastructure, public healthcare, food costs, wage stagnation...? The Democrats aren't better than the Republicans on policy, and if Trump was such a threat to democracy then why didn't the Democrats try harder to win instead of capitulating and giving power to the obvious fascist?",

But them alienating voters led to their loss, many centrist Democrats voted for Trump as a result, THEY are the ones to blame (if any, I still don't blame the voters). \n\nBut if the economic and foreign policy is the same, and they both take corporate bribes and push legislation for the billionaires, they might as well be the same because neither party actually cares about the voters. Voting for someone in our government has ZERO affect on policy, once they're in they have their comfy salary and steady employment which is all they care about. Neither party works for the people they claim to represent, thus their similarities. The only difference is social policy, which if you boil down to the core aren't much different either. Democrats ignore LGBTQ+ rights violations at the state level, they are pro-cop which increases black/brown harassment, they are pro-border wall which hurts the immigrant community. Republicans are just more verbose about it which is why liberals point fingers at the Republicans for all the problems instead of looking at the real enemy of the people, the Democrats.",

No, the Democrats probably wouldn't do what Trump is doing socially because then their progressive fa\u00e7ade would fall apart. Democrats are neoliberal capitalists, so they see the tactic for control in economic servitude of the masses. Republicans are conservative capitalists, so they see the tactic for control in overt social change that lines up with their ideology. Both want control, both want profits, neither want social progress.\n\nYou only have conservatives who willingly voted for him to blame, he has a fan base of course. But you cannot blame the leftist voters for the Democrats losing because the Democrats refused to budge on their genocidal geopolitics. There are simply not enough leftist voters to make up the gap in votes, Kamala lost because she didn't win over voters. What other job on the planet do you blame the consumer for a shitty product?",

That's the dialectics you have to pay attention to, apathy has set in in voter turn out because the alleged progressive party (that the majority of the country would vote for) hasn't been progressive since the 1930s. Time and time again the Democratic party has let voters who they claim to represent down once they get elected. But like I said previously, the voter turnout was around 58%, 2016 was a little over 60%. The lack of voter turnout is not a valid argument either, because this was an average election result. If the Democratic party wanted Obama-level turnout, they should've made strides to win over those who normally wouldn't vote. But they didn't, the whole campaign was a shit show, and people are realizing our democracy isn't very democratic (corporate lobbies, electoral college, gerrymandering, etc) and so why vote if it doesn't make a difference? \n\nThe Democrats are pushing the idea that the voters are to blame for their loss to deflect the blame from themselves who have proven for decades they don't actually work for the people. That's why Trump won, he's a symptom of continuously voting for the lesser of the two evils. If we actually had a progressive party, the Republicans would never hold office again because their core base is less than a third of the population. But we don't, and so we swing back and forth and it's all a big game while the oligarchy cements itself in our government and the politicians stay in power for as long as they can. This isn't about voter turn out, it's about lack of progress from the party that claims to be progressive. Stop blaming the voter base and hold the politicians accountable for their actions.",
