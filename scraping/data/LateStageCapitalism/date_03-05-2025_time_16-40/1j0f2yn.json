You got poor people being convinced to give money in a form of donations to Super Pacs who tell them they will give them healthcare, education and tax cuts or deregulation and tell them it would make them money.\n\nThat money than goes to their \"candidate\" who further spreads the lies and gets his cut of the donations. It keeps going up and up and up, all the way to the leaders of that party who pocket the most money. At the top of the throne sits the billionaires who basically get free tax money through tax-cuts and money laundering. Essentially, the more people you recruit, the more money you make from the people below\n\nCrazy how this is considered democracy at this point...",
