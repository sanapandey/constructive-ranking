Once you read more, however, it gets clear that the two men were fully convinced that German nationalists had learned nothing. As it turns out, history proved them right. The First World War was a mistake, but the Entente was arguably in too deep that point.",

The French were \"unbearably smug\" since Germany had done the exact same thing to them after winning the Franco-Prussian War. The terms of the Treaty of Frankfurt and later the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk make the Treaty of Versailles look generous in comparison. The armistice terms for Austria-Hungary and Turkey were far harsher than they were for Germany. Turkey famously had to fight for the right to not get balkanized entirely.\n\nEveryone (except Belgium) shared blame for starting the war, but the Central Powers were the aggressors. Germany allowed Austria-Hungary to impose absurdly harsh terms on Serbia for the assassination of the Archduke that were never going to be fulfilled, invaded and occupied two neutral countries (Belgium and Luxembourg), and went well out of its way to provoke the United States. As soon as it was over, German nationalists were blaming Jews and leftists for losing and insisted that they had been on the verge of victory.",

The failures of the German government to reign in the extreme right are certainly correct, but given how the existing treaty was interpreted by the public and the economic collapse that the treaty caused they're hardly surprising, and created a situation where the quixotic quest to remove the requirement of reparations through the disproving of war guilt ended up laundering the previous government rather than creating a clean break.",
