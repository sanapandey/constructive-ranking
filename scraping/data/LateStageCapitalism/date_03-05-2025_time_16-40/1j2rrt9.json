This post alone demonstrates your understanding of the potential impacts of political exposure on social media. For some people, this is where they're at, this is where they can help make an impact by exposing people to Marxist ideology through quotes, references, etc. Not to mention that the spreading of Marxist literature has always been a fundamental part of a revolution, it would be to our detriment not to utilize the vastly superior communications technology we have today for such a purpose. \n\nWith that said, I entirely agree that every one of us that does fully grasp the situation has a duty to do what is in our power to organize this movement into something useful for the world. It's well past time we speak up, it's past the time to take action. We need people engaged and active in practical work *yesterday*. There is much work to be done, we can't do it all, and we can't do it alone. Let's go forward together, as one, and lance this boil that plagues our society and ravages our planet.",

On the importance of theory from the foundations of leninism:\n\n\"Theory is the experience of the working-class movement in all countries taken in its general aspect. Of course, theory becomes purposeless if it is not connected with revolutionary practice, just as practice gropes in the dark if its path is not illumined by revolutionary theory. But theory can become a tremendous force in the working-class movement if it is built up in indissoluble connection with revolutionary practice; for theory, and theory alone, can give the movement confidence, the power of orientation, and an understanding of the inner relation of surrounding events; for it, and it alone, can help practice to realise not only how and in which direction classes are moving at the present time, but also how and in which direction they will move in the near future. None other than Lenin uttered and repeated scores of times the well-know thesis that:\n\n\"Without a revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement\"(see Vol. IV, p. 380).\n\n(https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/foundations-leninism/ch03.htm)\n\nFor a revolution to work, you must first build a revolutionary movement; following these general steps:\n\n1) Raise class consciousness and awareness (through discussion and education)\n\n2) Organize locally with other socialists/communists, helping to build foundations for mutual aid/dual power structures \n\n3) Unionize your workplace\n\n4) General strike\n\n\nAs for #1, my recommended intro reading list:\n\nThe principles of communism - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)\n\nSocialism utopian and scientific - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/)\n\nThe state and revolution - Lenin (https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\n\nThere's also a ton of good YouTube content if that's more your thing ( but you really should read the foundations of theory as well), highly recommend these channels as a good starting point:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SecondThought/videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@YaBoiHakim/videos",

While reading socialist literature definitely does shine a light on the duration and dispicable nature of our bourgeois system, it also demonstrates that, for nearly all of its existence, people have seen it for just what it is: oppression.\n\n For centuries now people have observed, evaluated, and theorized solutions to the evils and contradictions in our society. Our predecessors have dedicated their lives to providing us with invaluable theory and practical measures to form something better for all of humanity, nay, all life on earth. They did not make their sacrifices out of a sense of futility. Is it not then only logical to build upon their foundation? To carry that torch so that future generations may be free of our oppressors? This is the way! Our ancestors walk beside us through their words and actions, and our children depend on us for their prosperity. We must march towards progress because the *only* way is *forward*.

We have physical needs. \"Just say no\" wont keep you warm in freezing weather. Thoughts and prayers wont feed you when you're hungry. \n\nUnless you can manifest a ham sandwich with nothing but happy thoughts, in which case the world needs your sorcery, you can't impose your \"we just need to stop needing\" zen philosophy on people who can't take care of themselves and call it a plan",

That leads to malpractice and there is no way to reverse it. People rarely point out the many scams capitalism develops. And you\u2019d be surprised to hear that research is used to market these scams. If you have enough money you can control everything, even science.",
