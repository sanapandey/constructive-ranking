    "selftext": "I feel very anxious and sad about the future and current state of this world in all aspects. Specifically as an American.\n\nWe are moving toward (kind of already living in) a renter\u2019s society and nothing is being done. It actually feels like less than 10% of people in my generation will own a home and we\u2019ll all be at the mercy of corporations.\n\nEVERYTHING is for rent. Streaming services. Your phone. Even your clothes you can get on Klarna/Affirm. And they increase prices every 6 months. It feels like not enough people push back against rampant consumerism. We should be paying these companies dust but all we\u2019re doing is happily giving them our hard-earned money so nothing changes.\n\nThere is no end in sight with infinite growth. There is only so much money you can obtain with a declining birth rate. So what do companies do? They increase prices, lay people off, turn things into a subscription service that previously weren\u2019t, make lower quality products, etc.\n\nWe\u2019re becoming an oligarchy. People are being treated as pawns and being laid off as a political statement pushing a bunch of federal workers into an already crappy job market. Workers have no power anywhere. These companies have their pick of the litter because they have thousands of applicants. They can force us to work beyond 8-5, force us in office, spy on us with software, lay us off when they want. I\u2019ve seen people put up with insane treatment at work and happily work forced overtime in the name of \u201cfamily\u201d. Ugh, I despise bootlickers.\n\n2024 was our hottest year on record. We\u2019ve passed the 1.5 degree mark. I don\u2019t feel the need to elaborate further.\n\nI say this because I feel like I\u2019m genuinely starting to be affected to by things outside of my control. I vote, I donate, I try to spread information. I had a coworker say the other day that she\u2019s \u201cnot into politics\u201d when people were talking about the DOGE hearings. It pissed me off.\n\nIt feels like a privilege to say you\u2019re not into politics. As an interracial gay couple in a red city in a red state, we find ourselves feeling increasingly unsafe in these times and isolated from this community. Sometimes we wish we had a friend or two in the area.\n\nOur future feels actually incredibly dark.\n\nEDIT: There are a lot of comments but I just wanted to say thank you for the advice and support in the comments. Sorry I can\u2019t respond to everyone but thank you. I am reading and taking in advice and viewing your links. It\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m not alone.",

It's just disgusting; it makes me hate that I work in the field, it makes me hate the people I used to surround myself with. \n\nIt's like, no guys, I don't want to head over to your house for a BBQ to laugh at people losing their jobs. No, I don't want to catch drinks to make fun of the poor. I *want* you to remind me that you have some humanity left in your hearts, to use your wealth to try and do something for someone, literally **anyone**, besides yourselves...\n\nBut it is like talking to complete strangers.

That's where the support for Trump and Elon is coming from. The more it's looking like America can't hack it in international competition and the oligarchy can't be sustained, the more grandiose their fantasies of greatness and supremacy become. There's nothing more fitting than having two narcissists withdraw the country from the international stage so that everyone can collectively close their eyes, put their fingers in their ears and imagine a thousand-year reich of corporate fiefdoms. But such a reich is objectively impossible, because it has actually functional competition that exerts evolutionary pressure on it.\n\nI'd liken Trump&Elon to Gorbachev. They're taking a hammer to the foundation of the system, hoping that they don't have to disturb the top for something great to emerge. But because their whole strategy is based on avoiding reality, it can only fail, and since they took a hammer to the foundations, when it fails, it must fail hard. And once a system fails that hard, there's an opening for people to actually come to grips with reality and attempt something new.\n\nThe end of America as we know it won't be the end of the world.

The actions you take (\"I vote, I donate, I spread information\") matter, and when they don't get the results you wanted, your body reacting with this kind of disappointment and hopelessness is normal. Part of the challenge of existing in an imperial core is how much we still have to lose coz even the worst off of us still benefit from exploitation outside our borders. Our risk tolerance is out of whack. But I personally believe there's no emotional growth or satisfaction without taking some risks. It's like confessing to a crush, that initial vulnerability is what sparks the potential for emotional intimacy. \n\nWho do you vote for? Who do you donate to? What else can you do with received information aside from passing it on? I've become discontent just voting for the safest options. Im tired of donating to safe charities that promise my goodwill will not be taken advantage of. True community only revealed itself to me when I risked my personal resources and status for them. It's scary to feel like I could lose my job for the information I share, but it's weirdly liberating too. And for every one person who may have taken advantage asking for money on the street, there have been 10 others whose names and stories I've had the honor of hearing and that I feel safer knowing they may be around looking out for me. \n\nI get why youre feeling more and more unsafe, and I hope you find your people whereever youre at. When suppression is high, it really does become more risky to find them, which is inherently unfair to you. But I hope it's a hopeful thought to think about the potential benefits of this risk, and that risk taking doesnt necessarily have to be reckless too. Coz intimidating us into avoiding that risk is exactly our rulers' strategy to hold on to power for as long as they can",
