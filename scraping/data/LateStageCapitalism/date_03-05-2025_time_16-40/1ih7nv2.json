            "body": "There's an observation that anti-war films that depict war are, to an extent, promoting war.  While a film may have explicitly anti-war messages, the act depicting war on the screen tells its audience that war is something to be viewed for passive entertainment.\n\nThe same may be true too for White Lotus.  It may have explicitly anti-wealth messages, the show is visually depicting luxurious lifestyles.  When the show is viewed passively, portions of it function similarly to travel and fashion ads.\n\n(I actually really like White Lotus and I'm looking forward to the third season.  I'm not criticizing the show here, this is more of an observation about how media is consumed.)",
