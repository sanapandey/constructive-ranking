The parallels to Mussolini in the 1920's and to Hitler in the first years of the 1930's aren't just similarities anymore, there are clear one to one comparisons at this point. Going after students in this manner is just one of them. And just like then, a lot of people are reluctant to understand what is going on, because they still see something resembling the political system they are used to.\n\nThere's only one significant check on the president in the US constitutional system, meant to deal with a rogue actor, and that's impeachment. That's already failed twice. The remaining court system is powerless without the executive branch enforcing their decisions, and currently the entire system is likely doing precisely what the Trump regime predicted, including judges striking down some of his EOs. They are swamping the courts with cases they know will be nothing more than temporary setbacks, causing disarray amongst their opposition (where a lot of people are \"choosing a few topics\" they care most about, rather than engaging in broad terms against fascism), while simultaneously mapping which judges/public servants are loyal or not to their agenda.",
