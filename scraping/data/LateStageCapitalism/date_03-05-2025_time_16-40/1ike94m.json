    "selftext": "1. He's tweeted it multiple times over the past year there's over a million educated workers in the federal government.\n2. K-12 + college is a 16 year lag. Won't help whosoever in office now.\n3. Departments cut is fraction of taxes cut. So deficit not directly helped.\n4. H1B is backed by heavy industry support (the problem).\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nThey're gambling that 1 million+ college educated workers will pump profits/productivity more than the tax cut. Elon's play is supported purely off Hopes and dreams. Worked for Tesla *investors*, I severely doubt it it'll work for the common US citizen. College educated workers are also less likely to spend/stimulate economy.",

The recent announcements out of China are deliberately to wrong-foot the US and Western powers into thinking China's in better shape than it is and that Western governments are powerless against it.\n\nThere is nothing to be gained by starting a war with China even if they weren't a manufacturing powerhouse, and most sane US planners understand that. The only party starting hostilities would be China, as evidenced by their aggression at sea. China is highly dependent on imported food and energy and everyone knows it so their recent actions betray weakness to me, not power.\n\nTheir economic system is much more threatened by Western self-sufficiency than ours is by their advancement. Just look at Germany and it's over-reliance on exports to drive their economy. The same will happen to China as nations move to decouple from them.",

Though I will say I\u2019m more suited than most to think like a capitalist than others here.\n\nKnowing the play is half the battle.\n\nThe other half is living (rebelling) around it.\n\nIn this one for example Elon\u2019s hoping that the workforce will seek to work for **established** companies. That would work to his advantage. However, it\u2019s easy to see the gaps in this plan.\n\nPeople have (still) freedom of choice:\n\n1) Move to another country.\n\n2) Start/work for a direct competitor. (What I will be doing). **Co-ops**\n\n3) Be a stereotypical cinematic hippie. Or start movement.\n\n4) Aid a non-stimulant drug epidemic.\n\n5) Start a Bernie grass roots movement within the Democratic Party.\n\n6) Start a community. Start an alternate government network. There\u2019s a lot to be learned from the klans in terms of survivability from a black-hat standpoint. (This would also be grass roots)\n\n7) **Edit:** start a website that tracks direct, underdog competitors. Drag their cheap labor plan through glass and concrete.\n\nElon\u2019s play is actually very linear and requires a lot of things to go right. I see the most likely outcome as Elon failing because there\u2019s many and free counters around it.",
