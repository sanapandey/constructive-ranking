This purged the left of any real peaceniks and social progress movements, and all that remained were \"moderate liberals\", who were straight up imperialist/capitalists that had a soft-spot for social issues (the woke liberals are just a continuation of that).",

Not to say the West was ever good, but there was a time when folks such as the Birchers were seen as extremists whom politicians weren't supposed to associate with. Eventually, the Western ruling classes were overtaken by opportunists who [made peace with their homegrown fascists](https://theintercept.com/2023/01/24/ultra-podcast-hamilton-fish-nazi/) entirely. This didn\u2019t just happen in the United States, either.

I am really starting to think that in some ways, old school liberals, under certain circumstances, were less bloodthirsty than neoliberals in 2025. In 1925, a [squadron of American mercenaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escadrille_Cherifienne) joined the French in the [Rif War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif_War) in Morocco. After learning about this, the State Department warned them that they risked prosecution under the Neutrality Act unless they halted their involvement in the war. Although the public reception to the mercenaries had initially been mixed back home, their involvement in bombing campaigns caused widespread outrage.\n\n>The Literary Digest headlined the news as \"U.S. bombs and Rif babies\". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said it would\u2019ve been one thing if the mercenaries were fighting for the Riffians, but that there was \"nothing gallant or chivalrous in the rain of bombs, dropped on defenseless villages.\" The Christian Century, a leading Protestant magazine, remarked, \"These American soldiers of fortune have no pretexts other than the exaltation of the manhunt. This is a royal sport and the fact that these women and children who have had the misfortune to be born in the Rif villages as victims has no more meaning for them than the death of a rabbit during a hunt.\"\n> \n>After only six weeks of operations, France disbanded the squadron under diplomatic pressure by the United States. According to Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the unit carried out 350 combat missions in six weeks and dropped more than 40 tons of ammunition. According to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Kerwood, the squadron had bombed villages and caused caused considerable civilian casualties. There was even a proven instance of the American squadron bombing a village that had surrendered.\n\nMy issue with this article is that the authors think said changes must've occurred over the last 20-30 years, not an entire century.",

More broadly, it may refer to the cultural appropriation of any subversive symbols or ideas by mainstream culture.",
