In theory, this is a transitional measure until Mozambicans are trained and gain experience. In the meantime, however, foreigners are having a huge impact.\n\n>Investors like it. More than 900 companies, a considerable chunk of the economy, are now in private, often foreign, hands. America's Enron Corporation operates the Pande gas field; Portuguese hotel chains dominate tourism. The government is on the verge of selling the national airline to a foreign bidder. An ambitious plan to rehabilitate Maputo as the port of choice for South Africa's northern provinces has attracted substantial investor interest. Big European and Asian companies are looking at plans for two iron-ore reduction plants, an oil refinery and three new power projects. Alusaf, a South African company, is looking for partners in a huge aluminium smelter. \u201cTrade delegations are coming from all over the world,\u201d says a local business consultant. \u201cEvery day it seems something new is happening.\u201d\n\nIn cases where certain countries nationalized their resources and industries, they were still unfortunately subject to global commodity prices and there was very little they could do about them. For example Burkina Faso and Tanzania. In the end despite the nationalizations, both countries had to go back to the IMF after Sankara/Nyere were out. \n\nThis proposed deal is potentially great for the US and even the Ukrainian comprador bourgeoisie. End the war, go back to business, let the American/European companies and global financiers move into a high growth potential environment and start making money. Yeah you might have to give up a part of the country to Russia but otherwise this is a great deal, for the capitalists.",
