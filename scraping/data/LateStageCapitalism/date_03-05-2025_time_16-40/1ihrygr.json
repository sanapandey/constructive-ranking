    "selftext": "I have been on anti-anxiety and ADHD medication for a while now and had to get off due to my pregnancy. Having experienced a pregnancy loss previously I decided to never push through feelings of discomfort for my job. Having experienced being unhoused due to loss of a job a long time ago I always prioritized work over my needs for security reasons. I knew I had to make a change this pregnancy and started taking many breaks during my day. I go to the library, take a nap, watch an episode of a show, take long lunch breaks, and more short breaks throughout my day. I have the privilege of working from home currently so I know not everyone is as lucky. I count this blessing many times a day. \n\nWhen I tell you that my anxiety is basically nonexistent and my racing ADHD brain is basically silent now (and unmedicated), I am not exaggerating! I\u2019ve come to believe that a 40 hours work week is not meant to be worked all 40 hours. I can still successfully do my work in about 4 hours a day. I know my current workload will change from season to season, but right now I feel like I\u2019ve figured it all out. Take breaks and prioritize sleep even if it is in the middle of your WFH day. \n\nMakes me think that many of the mental health crisis in my late-stage-Capitalist country is just lack of sleep and down time.

I\u2019ve been on the legal meth since childhood and only recently was able to start my own law practice after years of terrible experiences with \u201cfirm culture.\u201d I\u2019m not making nearly as much money as I was yet, but I\u2019m a much better partner to my s/o and don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m drowning for practically the first time in my life.\n\nEveryone got really big on mental health and self-care during the pandemic but in my experience most people\u2019s stressors are primarily economic and political. No amount of mindfulness mondays and company-sponsored yoga classes are going to fix that.\n\nCongrats on your pregnancy and good luck!!",

The reason this sub even exists is because doing those things and prospering is very difficult in America right now for majority of people.",
