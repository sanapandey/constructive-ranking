Nice share/comment.\n\nHonestly the OP, current top, comment is the most succinct and sensical description of some of our national actions and anti-communism I've heard.\n\nIn my head why I would previously think about 'why' it would focus more on the propaganda, like what was taking place post WW2 with the USSR at the close of the war, kind of their 'imperialism' of spreading out to take the spoils of the war..  It's like as an American we start with the supposition that the U.S. is the good guys and the Soviets were the bad guys--so 'why Cold War and Red Scare?!' was framed as \"the GOOD GUYS had to take and save those areas from the BAD GUYS, so they don't do BAD things!\"\n\nMost people (me included) are so ignorant about history without the propaganda of where we live or who 'won'.",
