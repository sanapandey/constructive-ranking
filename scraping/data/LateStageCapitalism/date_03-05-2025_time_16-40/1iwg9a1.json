On the other side was a table stacked with snacks: Milka chocolate eggs, Oreo muffins, Tate\u2019s cookies and family-sized bags of crackers. Then, at exactly 2:50 p.m., a whistle blew.\n\nThe horde swarmed the table, snatching cookies, cakes and chocolate bars. It was every man, woman and child for themselves.\n\nThe hotel melee is a time-honored tradition that unfolds each year in February, at a consumer-goods conference attended by Wall Street analysts, investors and their families. Attendees come to the event, put on by the Consumer Analyst Group of New York, or Cagny, to hear from executives of food, beverage and cosmetic companies about how business is going. Their side hustle: grabbing as much free stuff as possible.\n\n\u201cKeep your kids at bay, they warned,\u201d said Alexander Robarts, who joined the crowds looking for Milka chocolate bars. \u201cThere\u2019s a stampede element here.\u201d\n\nAs a seasoned conferencegoer, the New York-based managing director of consumer goods and advisory services knows the drill. To get the good stuff you must prioritize your top picks, position yourself at the table accordingly, and move quickly. Ten minutes after the first whistle, another trills, indicating the free-for-all is over.\n\nConference attendees decamp with multiple tote bags brimming with processed food, shipping or lugging the loot home in extra suitcases. Robarts, 60, exercises some discretion, only taking what fits in his carry-on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hardcore, because I do like chocolate,\u201d he said, clutching six Milka offerings. \u201cBut I\u2019m not crazy.\u201d\n\nSome attendees cringed at the spectacle of well-heeled adults clamoring for free snacks, many of which are widely available in grocery stores. Others saw diabetes waiting to happen. But for most, the conference is a chance to indulge in some of the nation\u2019s most nostalgic brands, while gleaning insights into the American consumer and mulling stock ratings.\n\nThe conference, which coincides with spring break for many schools, rivals Halloween for the lucky children of equity analysts. This year, they lounged at the hotel pool or visited theme parks at nearby Walt Disney World, carefully timing their returns with the arrival of snacks from Mondelez and Hershey. Still clad in bathing suits, they lunged for Chips Ahoy cookies and Sour Patch Kids, grown men trying to move them out of the way.\n\n\u201cI worry a kid might catch an elbow to the face trying to grab a Twizzler,\u201d said Wesley Trowbridge, a 38-year-old research analyst at a financial services firm, from the sidelines.",

With years to hone her approach, she knows to arrive at the freebies table early to plot her attack.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get a good spot you\u2019re screwed,\u201d Fereday said. She texted her father:\n\n\u201cHere in the middle by the Reese\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are u?\u201d\n\n\u201cNeed to divide and conquer.\u201d\n\nWhen hotel staff dropped the ropes on Wednesday, Fereday rushed the table, snatching up Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups and then scooting over to the Pirate\u2019s Booty, Dot\u2019s Homestyle Pretzels and SkinnyPop. Fereday was unfazed by the competition as she made for a pile of Jolly Rancher candies. \u201cI\u2019m a New Yorker,\u201d she said. \u201cI can push.\u201d\n\nNext to her, a man edged out of the crowd, clutching his swag. \u201cYou can get killed in there,\u201d he muttered.\n\nThe candy table is just the tip of the iceberg. Analysts also stockpile everyday groceries, such as Pepto- Bismol tablets, Crest toothpaste, Speed Stick deodorant and Mr. Clean Magic Erasers. At breakfast, cereals\u2014and their furry mascots\u2014await adults and children alike.\n\nOne mother and son team stuffed bags with Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes. Alanna Daley said it\u2019s an annual ritual that her son Michael calls \u201cgoing shopping,\u201d while her husband spends the week listening to presentations from executives of consumer-product giants.\n\nBy the end of the week, many stashes have grown so large that conference attendees ship them home via an extra on-site FedEx outpost set up by Cagny for exactly this purpose.\n\nInside cavernous conference rooms, executives waxed prolific over metrics like \u201chousehold penetration,\u201d and described \u201cwhite spaces\u201d and \u201cgreen shoots\u201d in their businesses.\n\nDuring Coca-Cola\u2019s presentation, one man munched on a box of Honey Nut Cheerios. He stopped midway through to photograph two bottles of Frank\u2019s RedHot sauce.\n\nAs General Mills executives discussed shareholder value and profits, attendees came and went, cereal boxes in hand. Kenvue\u2019s attendees left that session early to ensure they\u2019d get one of the company\u2019s swag bags filled with Band-Aids, Tylenol and Listerine mouthwash.\n\nBefore Hershey executives dove into the intricacies of cocoa inflation, a conference organizer issued a disclaimer about the chocolatier\u2019s sweets grab planned for the following day.\n\n\u201cFirst, please let the children go first. I don\u2019t want any adults out there throwing elbows to get their hands on some Reese\u2019s, and you all know who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond of all, I don\u2019t care where cocoa is trading, I don\u2019t want to see any of these products on eBay after the conference.\u201d",

A cardboard Jolly Rancher Ropes tower sitting atop the table was pulled down for better access.\n\nThe e.l.f. Beauty counter was calmer. Male conferencegoers with teen and tween daughters still stopped by for makeup primer and lip oil, however, and listened to spiels about the products.\n\nCagny is marketing gold for companies, a chance for investors and consumers to try their new products, such as Conagra Brands\u2019 dill pickle flavored corn puffs and McCormick\u2019s Frank\u2019s RedHot Buttercream Frosted Cookie.\n\nVictoria Hart, a portfolio manager at Pinnacle View Capital Management brought along her 18-year-old nephew Cooper to join the fracas this year\u2014and an empty suitcase for their spoils.\n\nThe younger Hart said he snagged plenty of goodies, which he plans to share with his video club and marketing teacher back home.\n\n\u201cI got a bunch of stuff off the floor,\u201d he said.",
