    "selftext": "After a lot of thinking and writing my first book  (about 80 % complete) that details the fairy tale that is Democracy in the present; society ie The Dictatorship of the Bourgeoise, I have come to the conclusion that no more time can be lost. \n\nAs the US falls into a revamped Bourgeois Dictatorship,  as we see the rise of reactionary and far-right political views in Europe, as we see Nationalism and Religious leaders take control in nations like India and Israel and Narco States take power throughout Central and South America, those that are harmed the most are the Workers. \n\nIn each scenario, the Worker has no rights, nothing to gain from Bourgeois 2.0 Coup in the US, nothing to benefit from the rise of the Far Right in Europe, nothing to gain from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, nothing to gain from the Israeli genocide in Gaza, nothing to gain from the Hindu attacks against Muslims in India, nothing to gain from the corrupt Narco Leadership in Central and South America. \n\nIn each Nation State, the worker finds themselves fighting to keep their head above water while trying to juggle a job, a family, child care, security with little time to participate in local politics and community activities.   \n  \nOur goal needs to be to stay engaged, work together at the local level, globally, share our experiences, document what we are doing to improve our local communities and to raise class consciousness.  We all need to be aware of one simple concept.  This world does not and will not exist without us, The Workers.  \n\nWe hold all of the keys.  We hold all of the knowledge.  We hold all of the power.  We just need to become aware of this.  \n\nAs a first step, I would ask each of us to create a small core of 10 workers that we engage with weekly to discuss topics that will lead to our liberation from the global Bourgeois Dictatorship that is killing our species.  If just 1,000 of us can complete this take, that means 10,000 of us will be actively talking about these ideas on a weekly basis.  From there, we expand.  \n\nI am concerned that if we wait longer, we will fall into decadence.\n\nPlease share ideas, let's discuss and cooperate, together. ",

We need to form mutual aid groups everywhere to support, educate and defend our comrades and even non-comrades and all those oppressed by this capitalist misery in order to bring to them real and meaningful material improvement into their own lives.  \n\nWhen they see that it is Revolutionary Communism that does this they will be far more interested and open it as a way to organize society for our collective good.  The way it has been done for eons isn't working.",
