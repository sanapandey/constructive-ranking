Natives were rewarded with food and provisions for apprehending runaway slaves, white indentured servants and African slaves were rewarded for scalping natives, and of course the different races were segregated. This proved very effective especially in the West Indies where conditions were worst of all.",

I have mixed feelings because if companies don't genuinely believe in DEI, I'd personally just as soon they drop the pretense and stop using it as cover for continuing to perpetuate systemic racism, queerphobia, etc.  It's almost funny when you go to the leadership website of some corporations, and it's an entirely, or almost entirely, white executives with one Black guy as the VP of DEI.  I personally work for a company that has spent hundreds of thousands on DEI initiatives, committees to recommend change etc. ....and then they never acted on any of the recommendations.  And whenever the issues with racism or queerphobia come to a head, nothing gets done. So I would actually be very happy if my company stopped using its performative allyship as a marketing tool.  Companies that actually \"get it\" don't need DEI departments. You can tell they're great places to work because the majority of the leadership is already diverse and their corporate cultures are not all about trying to protect the dominance of white, heterosexual, ablebodied, middle or upper class perspectives.",
