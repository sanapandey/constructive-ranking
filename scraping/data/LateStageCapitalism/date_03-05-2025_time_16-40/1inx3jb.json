    "selftext": "Gorbachev Introduced glasnost and perestroika to reform the Soviet system. These policies inadvertently eroded the ideological and institutional foundations of the USSR, accelerating its collapse. His policies of liberalization unleashed an economic chaos that the Soviet system was not able to contain.\n\nToday, Trump is pursuing a similar, if ideologically inverted, disruption of the US institutions. Attacking the deep state, undermining trust in media and elections, and prioritizing loyalty over expertise. He\u2019s enacting a purge of the permanent bureaucracy under the guise of draining the swamp, feeding off polarization and institutional distrust. These policies erode the very stability of the system paving the way to an unravelling akin to that of the USSR.\n\nGorbachev inherited a stagnant economy that he attempted to fix using market reforms with perestroika. These reforms took form of a shock therapy with sudden price liberalization, fiscal austerity, and privatization. An economic collapse followed as a result of hyperinflation, economic instability, and the rise of an oligarchic class. Similarly, Trump is busy slashing regulations and cutting corporate taxes, fuelling short-term growth that deepens wealth inequality and corporate consolidation. Like Gorbachev, he\u2019s ushering in a polarized economic landscape where faith in the system is rapidly dwindling among the public.\n\nThe economic unravelling of USSR revived nationalist movements, particularly in the Baltics and Ukraine, that undermined the unifying ideology. Similarly, amplified nationalism, in form of MAGA, is deepening cultural and regional divides in the US. Trump\u2019s rhetoric is rooted in divisive politics. Just as Soviet republics turned inward post-glasnost, prioritizing local grievances over collective unity, so are states like Texas, Florida, and California are increasingly talking about breaking with the union.\n\nGorbachev\u2019s reforms set the stage for Yeltsin who presided over the chaotic privatization of state assets, enabling a handful of oligarchs to seize control of Russia\u2019s oil, gas, and media empires. The shock therapy transition to capitalism led to a rapid rise of the kleptocrats. Similarly, Musk\u2019s companies target the remaining public services and industries for privatization. SpaceX aims to replace NASA, Tesla/Boring Co. are going after infrastructure, while X is hijacking public discourse. In this way, his wealth and influence mirror Yeltsin-era oligarchs\u2019 grip on strategic sectors. The main difference here is that Musk operates in a globalized capitalist system as opposed to the post-Soviet fire sale. Musk is actively using his platform and wealth to shape politics in his favor, and much like Russian oligarchs, he consistently prioritizes personal whims over systemic stability.\n\nYeltsin was sold as a democratic reformer but enabled a predatory elite. Many Russians initially saw capitalism as liberation, only to face a decade of despair as the reality of the system set in. Similarly, Musk markets himself as a visionary genius \"saving humanity\" with his vanity projects like Mars colonization, yet his ventures depend on public subsidies and exploitation of labor. The cult of the techno-oligarch distracts from the consolidation of power in private hands in a Yeltsin-esque bait-and-switch.\n\nMusk, in particular, is well positioned to take advantage of reindustrialization having already built an empire subsidized by public money. Companies like SpaceX, Tesla, and Boring Co. are designed to feast on state contracts, hence his desire to funnel money that\u2019s spent propping up allies and waging wars inward. The framing of empire maintenance as wasteful acts as rebranding for corporate welfare under the guise of national renewal. The goal is to ensure that public wealth flows directly into the ventures owned by Musk and his friends.\n\nJust as Halliburton profited by rebuilding bombed infrastructure of Iraq, Musk\u2019s firms stand to gain from rebuilding America\u2019s decaying roads, energy grids, and aerospace dominance. Control of SpaceX which is becoming critical for Pentagon launches, and strategic infrastructure like Starlink grants Musk unprecedented power to dictate terms to the state, privatizing what was once public utility. The retreat from empire is just a pivot to a form of internal colonization, where foreign adventurism is replaced with domestic extraction. The result is as always, wealth flows upward and austerity downward.\n\nThe USSR collapsed abruptly, while the US might face a slower erosion of its institutional norms. Yet both Trump and Gorbachev, despite opposing goals, represent disruptive forces that undermine the system through ideological gambles. Much as Gorbachev and Yeltsin did in their time, Trump\u2019s norm-breaking and Musk\u2019s oligarchic power are entrenching a new era of unaccountable elites.\n\nMarx was right! History repeats, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.",

                    "body": "A few other books I can highly recommend\n\n1. Rosa Luxemburg \u2013 *The Accumulation of Capital* which argues that capitalism requires constant expansion into non-capitalist spheres (colonies, public goods) to sustain profits.\n2. David Harvey \u2013 *The New Imperialism* introduces the concept of *accumulation by dispossession* directly parallels Klein\u2019s shock doctrine. He details how capitalism reinvents itself through crises, privatizing public assets and exploiting disasters.\n3. Mike Davis \u2013 *Late Victorian Holocausts* examines how British colonial rulers weaponized famines in India and droughts in Africa to impose free-market policies, killing millions while consolidating imperial power.\n4. Volker Caysa \u2013 *Capital as Power* critiques how capital uses crises to centralize power. Caysa argues that financial collapses are not accidents but strategic resets, enabling oligarchs to buy distressed assets and rewrite rules in their favor. \n5. Ellen Meiksins Wood \u2013 *The Origin of Capitalism* traces capitalism\u2019s birth to violent enclosures of common land in England, a process Marx called *primitive accumulation*.\n6. Frantz Fanon \u2013 *The Wretched of the Earth* provides an analysis of colonialism\u2019s systemic violence as a tool to fracture societies and extract resources anticipates Klein\u2019s focus on how shocks destabilize nations for capitalist pillaging.  \n7. Giovanni Arrighi \u2013 *The Long Twentieth Century* charts capitalism\u2019s cyclical crises, showing how ruling classes use financial collapses to restructure economies.\n8. Paul Burkett \u2013 *Marxism and Ecological Economics* links ecological crises to capitalist exploitation, arguing that environmental disasters are profit opportunities for corporations.\n9. Ernest Mandel \u2013 *Late Capitalism* analyzes capitalism\u2019s crisis-prone nature includes how states use emergencies to suspend democracy and impose austerity.",
