You can have every single penny in the world but without that skilled workforce your capital means fuck all. Therefore the relationship between the owner providing capital and the skilled workforce is symbiotic at the least, but normally parasitic at its best since the owners extract the vast wealth for only initial capital injection. The reason why \"the poors' say eat the rich, is because the rich have been taking from and eating off our plates for decades all the while getting rich and telling us to work harder. \n\nConservativism leads to belief in human hierarchies, which leads to belief in the owner class supremacy and racism, which leads to thinking the colour of your skin somehow makes you better, but ultimately proves that it rots your brain because you believe your whiteness makes you pure by its existence alone. \n\nI hate conservativism because through non biasis studies, it has shown time and time again to be anti-human, culturally suffocating, environmentally destructive, and a means for gaping assholes to justify they desires to be gaping assholes.",
