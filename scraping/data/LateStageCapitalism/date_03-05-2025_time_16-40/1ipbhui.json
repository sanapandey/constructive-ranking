We allow good-faith questions and education but are not a 101 sub; please take 101-style questions elsewhere.\n\n We have a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry.

This is why capitalism is inherently evil, society is deprived of the very goods we produce anytime it doesn't serve the development of bourgeois property/capital. It's more important they make money than people have homes, food, healthcare, education.",
