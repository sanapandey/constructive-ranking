They exist to capture, control, redirect, control, obstruct and thwart any pressure from the revolutionary left so the right may continue its agenda of serving their capitalist masters.  \n\nThis is reality in America.  If you believe the american government serves your interests, you're a fool.  America is the evil empire.",

His running mate in the 1864 U.S. presidential election was a [Copperhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperhead_(politics)) (fifth columnist) who wanted to make peace with the Confederacy.",

His Maryland Campaign is the first instance where Lee is soundly defeated in the field and it secures the midterms for Lincoln. I\u2019m a bit of a civil war buff and have gone into exhaustive minutiae about these people. McClellan is often made out to be a whipping boy as it pertains to his generalship because of his dogshit politics. \n\n\nBut yes, he was for a restrained war which allowed the confederates to regroup and reorganize. He wasn\u2019t an abolitionist and he didn\u2019t see the importance in freeing slaves. But the overall war aims at the start were much different as well. \n\nI\u2019m in no ways a McClellan fan but he\u2019s often maligned for things that aren\u2019t deserved. My favorite generals are George Thomas and Grant. And I love how Sherman put belt to ass in Georgia and the Carolinas. \n\nI got a laugh out of the comparison though. I didn\u2019t think I could get more embarrassed of the Democratic Party after 2016, yet here I am. \n\nWe need leadership who are willing to wage total war like Sherman, Sheridan, and Grant prosecuted.",
