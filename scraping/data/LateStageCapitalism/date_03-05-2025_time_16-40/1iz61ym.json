Europe is coming from multiple generations of not having independent military capabilities, it would be wildly optimistic to say that they could build a coherent European defense in even 10 years. \n\nAt the same time, Russia has the most experienced military in peer war and can recover from Ukraine in less than 10 years for sure. IMO there is a close to 0% chance that a NATO without USA could prevent Russia from taking the Baltics if they made the move in 2031 or something.\n\nTherefore Europe must play nice with USA for a long time still.",

When most of the world was still colonized and thus kept deliberately poor and underdeveloped, and WW2 had totally fucked over the world's most developed economies in Britain, Germany, France, and Japan. The US at the end of WW2 was almost 50% of the world's GDP, and if WW2 had lasted a little longer it would have been even bigger. The only other country with real industry and development that wasn't bombed out from the war was Canada.",
