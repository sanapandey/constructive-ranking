We allow good-faith questions and education but are not a 101 sub; please take 101-style questions elsewhere.\n\n We have a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry.

            "body": "The main reason(s) billionaires have concentrated so much wealth and power is their acquiring basically every major media medium from TV, radio, newspapers, magazines and social media websites. \n\nThis goes to the 1980s when murdoch lobbied reagan to overturn the Fairness Doctrine and allow him to purchase more than one media entity. Before media ownership was limited to one medium in any major market. Then Clinton passed the telecommunications act and they were free to buy everything they wanted. \n\nNow, people are so misinformed that they believe doge is actually eliminating fraud and corruption despite them being fraudulent and corrupt.",
