Over the years, USAID has been linked to efforts that align with American geopolitical interests, including funding opposition groups, supporting regime change operations, and influencing media narratives in various countries. For example, declassified documents have revealed its involvement in covert programs, such as the failed ZunZuneo project in Cuba, which aimed to incite dissent against the government",

As you said, capitalism is a failed system. However, the Democrats have failed to do anything to stop this. What\u2019s happening now is equally their fault. They consistently uphold this system and support policies that benefit corporations and Wall Street. This is the inevitable outcome. \n\nUS foreign aid is used to enforce dependency, loot resources, and crush those that dare resist its hegemonic rule. Now that the empire is crumbling, it\u2019s withdrawing its tentacles of imperialism from the furthest reaches of the globe. This will allow other countries to finally be able to make decisions that benefit their own people. I said I disagree with that comment bc dismantling this imperialist apparatus is good. I still think giving corporations government handouts is bad, but it\u2019s nothing new.",

The destruction of Libya started not with bombs but with stuff like USAID and public opinion shaping. Same goes for the Russian Ukraine conflict. Ukraine's media was completely infiltrated by USAID who then set the stage for what came next. In Arab nations the same.\n\nPeople on this sub don't seem to be aware of how imperialism works and why more money into conventional military and weapons is not the bigger threat at all. Also, USA is already by far the most funded military. More for the US military is not good but it is not worse or more effective than the \"regime\" change aparatus that Western imperialists use to control, exploit, and destroy the world these days.\n\nYoutube/Reddit \"Communist\" communities are always disappointing.",

Or by toppling democratically elected presidents and exchanging them with whoever gives the resources of the country away for free (or almost free) to the Western nations. \n\nSuppressed nations don't need USAID. They need independence from Western imperialism which is holding back their economies and sucking their resources dry, while calming the population down through aid deliveries which don't even balance out 0.1% of the damage done by Western exploitation and manipulation. \n\nAnd another side effect of the \"Humanitarian\" component is, that the one doing the exploitation can present themselves as morally good in front of the exploited people and people at home. This gives the Western imperialists more power to \"justify\" attacks on protesters in the exploited countries. This makes big parts of the exploited population blind and confused, and more likely to side with the exploiter. \n\nSo no. Hell no, it shouldn't have a humanitarian component!",

As the head of the foreign relations committee he also paraded a bunch of his handpicked \"expert witnesses\" to corraborate those lies. He is as much responsible for that genocide as Bush. Obama back tracked on every campaign promise and committed some truly disgusting warcrimes. Clinton abolished glass steagal and committed some terrible war crimes. All three unapologetically expanded the corporate oligarchy and the war machine.\n\nThe issues they feign to support to garner fundraising never get solved, and are swept under the rug the moment democrats have any power.
