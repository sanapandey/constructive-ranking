            "body": "Medicaid is probably first on the chopping block. Poor Red states that rely substantially on federal funding will have their excuse to kill their state medicaid programs if that funding is pulled. Wealthier states like New York and California may be able to soldier ahead on their own.\n\nTouching Medicare is really the third rail of politics, similar to Social Security. They would need to manufacture quite a substantial crisis or public spectacle to shove through any substantial wind down of those programs without the boomers actually revolting. Americans are selfish to their core, but if they want us to work for slave wages with no prospect of social safety net at the end of it, things could get much more...confrontational.",
