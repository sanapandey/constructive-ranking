It comes up short in the criticism but it does at least try.\n\n\n\n\nFor what it's worth, Canadian eggs remain cheap; about 50c per egg for freerun/freerange/nest laid (with cheaper options very available if you can stomach it).",

And to think that many Big Ag states have criminalized the gathering of any sort of investigatory video or photos or whatever.",

The current prices would be more than fair in my opinion if - and only if - all that money actually went into providing better conditions for the animals and workers; especially meat needs to become a luxury product again (like it was a hundred years ago) if we ever want a chance at treating everyone involved fairly (and also a chance of curbing climate change, but that's a whole different horse).\n\nHowever, the problem is that the increased prices have done nothing to improve conditons. We need to get used to these *prices* if we want a fairer world, but we absolutely do not fucking need to get used to the current amount of money ending up in the companies' pockets. It's the profit margins that need to change, not the prices. And government subsidies need to be redistributed from animal agriculture to the production of plant protein - if animal products become luxury products like they should, people fucking need to be able to afford vegetables in their stead.",

Eggs have long been a cheap staple, usually bc most people kept a few chickens on their property for this very reason. It was the convenience of mass produced cheap eggs that made the practice of keeping chickens unnecessary and impractical for most people and now that it's no longer something we're familiar with the industry is using that power to force consumers to pay out the ass. Don't be so quick to throw you fellow citizens under the bus. Billions of our tax dollars go to subsidize corn and soybeans, 80% of which goes to feed livestock. There's simply no other foodstuff that gets even a fraction of that kind of subsidization and as such meat, cheese, eggs and dairy has always been much cheaper in the states and it's what people are used to eating. We can clearly see the handful of companies who dominate these industries are making billions in profit while millions of people are being squeezed, literally to death in many cases, by high prices that are of a insultingly low quality. There's a lot of problems in the industry and in the American diet but you should never agree with the narrative of any of these companies.\u00a0 They have 90% of the power and therefore they are responsible for 90% of the problem.\u00a0",

She's just really good at writing propaganda in a way that doesn't trigger millennials' well honed corporatespeak bs detector (that's why she still has a well paying job in a dying industry). Instead, she's using our guilt about animal mistreatment to put the onus on us, the consumer, as if chickens must be tortured for you to get cheap eggs (they don't, the industry is just heavily monopogozed by 5 companies that are colluding to raise egg prices and have spent the last 20yrs perfecting the science of mass exploitation of labor in their industry. Eggs could be cheap and chickens treated better but it would cut into corporate profits which is\u00a0sacrosanct in the eyes of the ruling elite and their pets in the judiciary). I know it's feels bad, but you're not being unreasonable for refusing to accept the narrative of the elite. In fact, it's a skill that will protect you in the long run. The needs of the people to a staple protein trump the right of Corporations to extreme profits. That's basic morality. Don't let them deceive you with a lot of fancy talk.\u00a0",

So now the eggs can be expensive enough to drive profits for the now (investor driven capitalism)... \n\nAnd I am not being hyperbolic here, in the davos they were talking about rebranding their investor capitalism built on consumer capitalism, into the new 'stakeholder' capitalism. because then they can justify making stuff like environment as a stakeholder, and putting a monetary value they are happy to pay to not uphold their responcibility to that stakeholder.

            "body": "I mean I sort of agree. I work with small farmers and urban farmers. And anyone outside of the mass production assembly line could never sell their eggs for $2 a dozen. I\u2019ve always been willing to pay more for my local farmers. I know I\u2019m supporting a fair wage, sustainable practices and good land stewardship, and local families. \n\nRight now we are seeing price gouging. And that is the problem. But in a broader sense our food system is so out of whack. How is it that bananas, produced mostly in Central and south America and transported here can be 53 cents a bundle when apples grown up the road can be $6 a lb? \nBecause those bananas were grown and harvested by labor that makes almost nothing, that is blasted with fungicides and plagued with associated health problems. Because corporations that buy and sell those bananas are making profits on the backs of their workers. \n\nHave you ever been to a chicken house? I have plenty of times. Birds filled to the brim, sometimes 10,000 birds in one house. Farm laborers aren\u2019t well paid and are often not well taken care of and majority of them are immigrants who have no one to advocate for them. If we want $2 eggs then that\u2019s the system we have to be comfortable with. \n\nWe could also build some autonomy in our lives and make more conscious decisions regarding our food. Take the control back and empower local producers.",
