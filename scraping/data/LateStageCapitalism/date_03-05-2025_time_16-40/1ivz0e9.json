We allow good-faith questions and education but are not a 101 sub; please take 101-style questions elsewhere.\n\n We have a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry.

            "body": "\"I've got good news and bad news. The reactionaries have launched a coup against the Russian Provisional Government. Chairman Kerensky was able to stop the coup after releasing and rearming the Bolsheviks, but the truth has come out. The Tsarists were always paying lip service to democracy. Worse, the commander of the coup was none other than Lavr Kornilov, the commander of the chief of the army. The entire military has already been compromised. Kornilov and his accomplices are planning their escape from prison as we speak. The Russian Republic was doomed from the very beginning.\"\n\n\"And the good news?\"\n\n>Kerensky, in desperation, turned to the only force that still had real influence over the masses, the Bolsheviks. They suppressed their own grievances against Kerensky and agreed to help defend Petrograd. But they made it clear that they were acting entirely independently of the government, and that they were still intent on overthrowing it.\n\n\"Comrade, that was the good news.\"\n\n>As Lenin explained to the party, \"We must campaign not so much directly against Kerensky, as indirectly against him, namely by demanding a more active, truly revolutionary war against Kornilov. The development of this war alone can lead us to power.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/glthfsavpske1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e39edcfa1a833b03fb463fd1695480b6a8b7019",
