McBride).\n\nTrans people won't really be free until we dismantle capitalism. The kind of representation we need is trans people helping lead the revolution. I think we need to do all we can to make our leftist spaces as welcoming to trans people as possible (and all marginalized groups) so that trans people feel safe to be a part of the revolution that we need.\n\nFred Hampton had the right idea and I think we should be following his example. We can all defeat capitalism together by creating communities that can exist outside of the racist (and trans-phobic) capitalist structure as much as possible.",
