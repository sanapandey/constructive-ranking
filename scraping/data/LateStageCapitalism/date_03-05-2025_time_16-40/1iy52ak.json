    "selftext": "I first posted this elsewhere and it was suggested to me that this might be a good sub to bring this up in. \n\nAnyway, I had a bit of an epiphany and my idea is to try to get this text read in 50 public places around the US within a couple month period. A lot of people right now feel beaten down by those in power, they feel isolated, and they feel alone. I think there\u2019s power in publicly saying out loud that we are against fascism and also power in it being not strictly political party related.\n\nA good starting place would be to have this read at city council meetings. Typically, any resident can sign up to speak at a city council meeting and get somewhere in the 2-5 minute range to speak. This is specifically local and normal citizen focused.\n\nI know people who would read these at 10 city council meetings around Texas, California, and maybe one in the NE. I want to find out if there\u2019s support for my idea. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s powerful enough unless we can get at least a small critical mass. I know a couple regional newspapers who I can get to pick it up and then a national one might notice, but the point is for people in these towns where it is read to stop feeling alone.\n\nI\u2019ve already spoken to one person who said they were afraid to go and read it in public for fear of MAGA violence. I thought that\u2019s where this sub could come in. Maybe having some supportive people show up to PEACEFULLY show support would help lesson the fear.\n\nIf you would be interested in either reading or showing up as a non-reader support, please post or DM me. Please don\u2019t go act yet. If there\u2019s at least some support, I\u2019ll move forward and I\u2019m hoping to gather this up and have it done together to make it more impactful.\n\n  \nFull text in case you don't want to follow the link I also included: \n\nFrom \"They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45\", an interview with a German survivor after WWII, and his regrets in hindsight.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>",
