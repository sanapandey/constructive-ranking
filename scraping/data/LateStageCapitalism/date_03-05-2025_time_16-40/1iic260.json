    "selftext": "Comrades - thanks for your attention as we clarify the purpose of this sub and some of the discourse we expect here. Firstly, this is a place to vociferously condemn the ills of capitalism - and here\u2019s the kicker that liberal interlopers don\u2019t get - from a socialist perspective. Our fundamental purpose is to drive conversation among those impacted by capitalist exploitation. This may take the form of memes, deeper theory, or the ever beloved internet screed.\u00a0\n\nThat said, there\u2019s some things we aren\u2019t here for. I\u2019ll touch on those and some alternatives as well.\u00a0\n\nWe are NOT here to promote calls to violence. This is a violation of the Reddit TOS. If the sub is nuked, we aren\u2019t able to fulfill the mission of providing a space for socialist discourse. This simply isn\u2019t the place, and we will remove any content which can be perceived as a direct call to violence.\u00a0\n\nWe are also not here as a staging ground for organizing. Social media is a poor place to organize. Not only is everything you do online tracked, but infiltration in online spaces is rampant. Opsec 101: if someone on the internet who you do not personally know is trying to get you to show up somewhere for an allegedly leftist/socialism project, they are probably a fed. If someone you do know is using social media for the same, they may or may not be a fed. However, what can be certain is that a fed is aware.\u00a0\n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: but, A-CAB, this is how I radicalized and I have lived most of my life dependent on the internet. How am I supposed to get involved? I\u2019m so glad you asked! The reality is that your involvement may be limited for a bit, and you\u2019re going to have to do some irl work. Your job, if you\u2019re starting out, is to read and learn.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin is universally applicable. We should regard it not as dogma, but as a guide to action.\u201d - Comrade Mao Tse Tung\n\nIn other words, learning Marxism-Leninism leads to mobilization, and provides a framework for organization.\n\nWe (socialists) need a vanguard committed to revolution, not clicktivism. If you want to organize, read first. Find likeminded people you know in real life. Study with them. Hold each other accountable for learning Marxism-Leninism. Let that guide the actions you take specific to your context and for the love of god don\u2019t announce it to the feds when you do.\u00a0\n\nWe also, as a sub, are not \\*the\\* vanguard. This is an Internet forum. We don\u2019t determine courses of action here. We are a sounding board, a place to make you feel less alone, and ideally a part of your education in Marxism-Leninism. But what we cannot be is the vanguard itself. We aren\u2019t an org. The way social media is set up, it would be way too easy to infiltrate, coopt, and undo.\u00a0\n\nWhat we are is a likeminded group of committed comrades. We want you to go out in the world and join orgs (not on the internet). I\u2019ll offer some advice to that end:\n\n1. Avoid organizations with a focus on horizontal power or who have a real issue with hierarchy. (Anarchists, I\u2019m happy to work with you on projects but I am side-eyeing you a bit here.) They don\u2019t get things done and they\u2019re too easy to derail and co-opt. Don\u2019t believe me? Go ahead and join one. The next time they\u2019re working on consensus, throw a stand aside in with mildly coherent criticism. Watch the chaos ensue. Or just wait for them to start organizing for <insert liberal party here>. Neither will take long.\u00a0\n2. Do join organizations which stand against imperialism and imperialist politicking. Look for Marxist-Leninist orgs involved in projects that benefit the community and which outright reject electoral democracy. Focus on feeding people, not getting them to vote for reform. This is the work of the vanguard.\u00a0\n3. Do employ the language of non-violence for political and practical purposes. Kwame Ture is a gifted orator. Look up his speeches on YouTube. He is a wealth of information about this.\u00a0\n\nI appreciate each and every one of you, comrades. Remember to keep each other safe. Be mindful, and enjoy a meme or two while you\u2019re here.\u00a0",

Activism is great, but without a resilient community the movement fizzles out",

It\u2019s saying \u201cI don\u2019t support this and won\u2019t help but don\u2019t care to stop the group.\u201d It is considered a strong criticism and usually results in the reworking of a plan. I\u2019m not saying in itself that it\u2019s a bad concept. However, I am saying that purely horizontal orgs will get too caught up in minutia to make a decision and that party direction is always up for debate. \n\nIn contrast, most ML orgs are pretty solid about supporting the party line once a decision is made. There\u2019s a time and a place to critique the party direction, but it needs to go through proper channels and you better have a solid rationale. In this way, the party is more likely to stick to the path and accomplish something once they\u2019ve committed to a course of action.",
