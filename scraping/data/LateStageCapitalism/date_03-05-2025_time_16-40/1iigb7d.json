    "selftext": "I believe that video games is an important medium that should be used in the struggle against spreading fascism, probably even more important than books or movies nowadays.\n\nSome examples of games that carry anti-fascist message:  \nSpec Ops: The Line;  \nHalf-Life 2;  \nDeus Ex;  \nThis War of Mine;  \nPapers, please;  \nHelldivers 1 & 2;  \nDisco Elysium;  \nFallout series;  \nUnderrail\n\nGiven limited resources (most likely enough for a relatively short 2d pixel game, but not for something more complicated) - how would you approach this, comrades?  \nI have a bunch of ideas, one of them is a stealth roguelike where the player needs to smuggle prohibited books out of city under police lockdown, a la Fahrenheit 451.",

Your job is physically taxing so your exhaustion meter goes down a lot faster, you eat poor quality food because you\u2019re too tired to properly cook, you can become unhealthy and sick. You can buy things like cars but the top of the line ones are just for show and your character can never afford them. Cheep cars that guzzle gas and break down are what you can afford. Maybe your partner is abusive but you have to make the choice of breaking your lease or staying so you have a place to live. Etc etc",
