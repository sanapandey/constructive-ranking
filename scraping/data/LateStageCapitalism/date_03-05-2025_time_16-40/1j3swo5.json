    "selftext": "(taken fromy post on thedeprogram sub)\n\nHi Comrades, \n\nI'm about to graduate with a PhD in mathematics. My whole life I've wanted to be a researcher, doing science and discovering new ideas. However, I look at the road ahead and I don't see much potential for success. Unless I do something absolutely groundbreaking (which I'm pretty sure I won't) it's just a slog of low-paying postdocs and assistant professorships until I MAYBE get tenure somewhere, and even then with defunding of research I might still not be financially secure. I'm about to publish my first research paper and, while I've enjoyed working on it, it hasn't exactly given me the overwhelming sense of joy I dreamt about as a teenager reading science books.\n\nMy dad was a researcher in politics and now he's retired and he can't afford to support himself in his retirement. I want to be able to live a more comfortable life and take care of him financially as well. Luckily I had a scholarship so I don't have student loans to repay.\n\nI was thinking about applying to work as a quantitative researcher at Jane Street, Optiver or one of the other Quantitative Trading firms. The pay is really good and the mathematical problems are interesting. \n\nOf course these firms are at best useless to society and at worst actively harmful. They essentially use algorithms to game the stock market. They thrive on capitalism. Ultimately I do want to do something to help society but I also want to financially secure my future first.\n\nMy question is how bad is it to actually work for these companies? How much of a sellout capitalist shill would I be? Would it be like working for the fossil fuel industry and destroying our planet? \n\nI don't know what I'm asking for. Absolution for my sins against the proletariat? Being spared the guillotine when the revolution comes? I'm not sure.\n\nI'd just like to hear people's opinion on this.",

There's an argument that they're providing some benefit to society as market makers, de-risking as backnarkle48 said, but yeah part of the reason I left was because of the nagging feeling of bullshit. Also it was definitely stressful.\nThat being said, you should still consider it if you decide you don't want to pursue research. The pay is good enough that if you can just deal with it for a few years you can give yourself a good base financially.\n\nPlus it's really not much different, in terms of having no value to society, than any generic corporate job. We all have to get by in the world, and you could use some of your money for the cause...\n\nIt's all part of the spiritual damage of capitalism. Something intrinsically valuable like adding the humanity's knowledge is severely underfunded and full of bullshit. The best paying positions contribute the most harm and exploitation.",

It's the surplus value extracted from hardworking people and invested by the capitalist class. It feels wrong to play around with.\n\nc) It doesn't contribute anything to society. It doesn't develop any new technologies, save lives contribute to education or anything\n\nThese are just my opinions though.",
