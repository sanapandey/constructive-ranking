However I vote Democrat because I care about things like clean water, solar energy, etc. Plus I support LGBT+ rights and disability rights. I voted for Biden in 2020 and then voted for Harris in 2024. What should be said of someone like me who would support a candidate who would be more aligned with Marxism than Biden or Harris but still votes against the far-right party known as the Republican Party. \n\nSure voting for a Democrat like Biden or Harris is not ideal or perfect but it seems not just the lesser or 2 evils. It seems like a step in the right direction in regards to things that make our lives better. \n\nWhen Democrats had total control of Congress and the Oval officer in 2009 through 2011 we at least got healthcare reform, granted not the one we would wanted. We also got repeals of don't ask don't tell... The list is actually long. \n\nI fear if people stay home and let the far-right win elections we will see unregulated capitalism go unchecked and our world will never get better.",

Then I saw another comment that said something like:\n\n> \u201cI hate [Leftists] more than Trump voters. Way more.\u201d\n\nAround 900.

And, if his role was quietly upholding the status quo of what today we would call apartheid while simultaneously publicly presenting himself as an ally of people who _needed_ them, was JFK more or less dangerous than politicians who were overtly against civil rights?\n\nThe reality is that governments as we know them have *never* advanced progressive policy out of benevolence - they are _always_ responding to grassroots movements that force their hand. This is true of civil rights, it's true of gay rights, womens rights, abortion, slavery etc. \"How do you intend\" to get there is _always_ going to depend on grassroots movements, and depending on a party that quietly seeks to undercut those in favor of the status quo is exactly how the far right, which is not particularly popular, has taken power, and it was how Hitler took power.",

(What this country calls progressives is really old school liberals.)\n\nBecause once a true liberal sees that DEI is not civil rights or dismantling institutionalized racism, that it is only getting more diversity in the boardroom, and its apex was getting Obama elected (\"Racism is over\"), or that neoliberals will give more loans to minorities but not free college, they will start demanding differently or even withdrawing support.\n\nThe enemy of my enemy is still not my friend, but all of them can be damn useful right now.\n\nTake Dick Cheney for example- evil personified.  But if anyone is going to take out Trump it would be whatever is left of that faction.  Lawyers and judges are suddenly finding themselves in a situation where they will have to directly fight this administration to keep their authority.  FBI agents are resigning en masse and you can count on them to be vindictive.\n\nTrump is dismantling the whole structure, and in a way that only benefits his people.  So there will be some useful opposition, and there is room to manipulate it, if you look at what their interests are.  Also, people in this country are really underrepresented.  That makes is easy for the politicians to fundraise lots of money and ignore people.\n\nBut if a lot of people starting calling and harassing them, it can overwhelm them quickly.
