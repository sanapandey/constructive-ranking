He is accused of opening fire on two men he thought were Palestinians.\n\n\u2022 The victims were actually two vacationing Israelis, named as Ari Rabey and his father. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for federal hate crime charges against Brafman and his alleged victims in the shooting.\n\n\u2022 The incident is the latest example of anti-Palestinian hate crimes in the U.S., says the group's national executive director, Nihad Awad, in a letter to President Barack Obama. The shooting took place in Miami Beach, Florida, on Saturday night, according to police reports and social media posts by the two men who were injured.\n\n\u2022 The men were shot in the left shoulder and the right forearm, police said. The wounded man posted a message on social media, saying: \"My father and I went through a murder attempt against antisemitic background.\n\n\u2022 I am so proud of my family\" The incident was captured on surveillance video and posted online.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udca1 [TipJar](https://paypal.me/paulfox360?country.x=IN&locale.x=en_GB) \n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.*",

That shooting was absolutely caused by the same settler colonialist mindset that they subscribe to, but at the end of the day they still got shot by an islamophobic scumbag who thought he was shooting Palestinians",
