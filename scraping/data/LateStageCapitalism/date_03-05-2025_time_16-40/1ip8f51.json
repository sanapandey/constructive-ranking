    "selftext": "We need a movement of this. Materialism will destroy us all. A 2021 study by Matthew Killingsworth found that happiness continues to rise with income even beyond $75,000, though the rate of increase slows down. Essentially, money still improves happiness, but at higher income levels, other factors (like purpose, relationships, and work satisfaction) matter more.\n\nFor most people, the sweet spot seems to be between $75,000 and $100,000 per year for basic life satisfaction, but beyond $200,000\u2013$500,000, the increases in happiness become much smaller. At extremely high levels (millions per year), happiness is more tied to personal fulfillment rather than income itself.",

Dialectics is a process by which a theory or variable, and a counterpoint to it, creates a synthesis.\n\nMaterialism basically says that material reality is primary and ideas come from it, not the other way around aka Idealism aka Ideology. Idealism says that our ideas come first, and we construct reality from those ideas. \n\nSo Dialectical Materialism is basically science. Dialectical Materialism is the philosophy of Marxism and it insists nothing it can't prove with science.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyzFwHFN\\_BI&list=PLuzqoNvqVKydyRAMjDAHDikbVY9BDLC7V&index=5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyzFwHFN_BI&list=PLuzqoNvqVKydyRAMjDAHDikbVY9BDLC7V&index=5)\n\nSo as you go about your day, you will come across lots of Ideology.

I'd rather focus on whether someone is a worker or an owner. \n\nMaking 200k from stocks, real estate etc. passively while sitting on your ass is very different from working 5 days a week to make 200k.\n\nThe former will allow you to focus on your health, well-being, your passion, your family and friends.\n\nThe latter will burn you out especially if it's a high-stress work environment. Besides, you can get laid off anytime",
