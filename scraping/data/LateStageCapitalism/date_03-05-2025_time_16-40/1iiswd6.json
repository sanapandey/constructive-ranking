    "selftext": "I am part of a small movie club with some friends locally and I recently began making a small (read single A4 paper small) zine after each film we watch, as a project after breaking my back early last year. \n\nWith everything that's going on and how easily info can be blocked on the internet, I've been thinking about creating media I can surreptitiously distribute IRL. I live in a decently large US city and I think there are a wealth of people who might be sympathetic, but might not be as online as I am. A small pamphlet that they can read without necessarily having to dig through a swamp of social media sites seems like a decent enough place to start. \n \nObviously the format necessitates a certain amount of brevity, but I've been working on some ideas varying from purely informational regarding resources local to my area to more theoretical. I've tapped some of the people in my life for additional ideas, and I wanted to do the same here in case people were interested. \n\nLet me know if you have thoughts or even think this is a good idea in the first place. \n\nThanks for reading, and here's to hoping that the next time Mitch McConnell encounters a set of stairs they have the good grace to finish the job.",
