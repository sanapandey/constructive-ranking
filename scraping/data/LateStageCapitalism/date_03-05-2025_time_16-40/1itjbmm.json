I could get away with this legally until 6/15 when I would have to submit a quarterly estimated tax payment. \n\nIn 4 months, how many employees would it take to cause problems for the Trump administration?\n\nEdit: AwesomeOrca shared what seems to be a good explanation why this idea would not be viable.

For a revolution to work, you must first build a revolutionary movement; following these general steps:\n\n1. Raise class consciousness and awareness (through discussion and education)\n\n2. Organize locally with other socialists/communists, helping to build foundations for mutual aid/dual power structures\n\n3. Unionize your workplace\n\n4.

You would need an absolutely staggering number of people involved to make this idea work. Again, as an example, 7.23M people who each earn $100k and completely stop paying taxes would only lower revenue by $100b. \n\nIn short, I think you would have an easier time getting 20 to 40 million people to take to the street all across the country than getting that same number to go to their HR departments, adjust their withholdings to $0 illegally and risk tax penalties.",

What this means for employees is, you can reduce your withholding to $0 per paycheck, as long as you then pay them a quarterly installments by April 15, June 16, Sept. 15, and Jan 15, 2026. Penalties are [based on your earnings this year and/or last year](https://www.irs.gov/payments/underpayment-of-estimated-tax-by-individuals-penalty):\n\n>You may avoid the Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals Penalty if:\n> - Your filed tax return shows you owe less than $1,000 or\n> - You paid at least 90% of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever amount is less. If your adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2023 was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if your filing status for 2024 is married filing separately), substitute 110% for 100%.\n\nIirc the penalties are not life-altering, maybe a couple hundred bucks.\n\nSo the real questions are\n\n- How realistic is it to get even 10% of employees to do this?\n\n- The financial mechanics of the federal government: How does the Treasury work? How long can the Treasury keep the government afloat while, say, 25% of expected weekly income is missing (deferred)? What other mechanisms could impact that leeway - for example do interest rates affect the answer to that question?\n\nI don't know where to find clues to these answers.",
