They'll figure out how to keep subsidies flowing to Musk, even if it does mean funding an electric car company.\n\nThe Republicans voted unanimously against the Inflation Reduction Act. I would really rather that it had not passed. The Democrats sent 83% of the money, apparently, to Musk and Republican congressional districts, figuring they'd never kill the bill if all the money went there. They may be right, but dumping money on top of Nazis to make the bill safe is not the answer here.\n\nThis also means that the Republicans will figure out how to cut even more from social programs that benefit blue states in order to pass their $2 trillion tax cuts for Musk, Gates, Bezos, and Buffett because they'll have to figure out how to keep the IRA money flowing into red states.",

It's one of the most ridiculous things I've seen in my life, honestly. \"We know we lose every election. We even lost a seat while Trump was elected President, but can you like, please give us half the power to set the budget anyway?\"\n\nThe State Republican Party collapsed and nobody even wants leadership roles because the only thing they do is sit there and get paid to be Karens and remind us of how bad they'd be if anyone put them in charge of something, like we even need that with the Failed State of Indiana next door.\n\nIn Indiana, the taxes go down every couple of years, while the poverty rate surges again. The reason they would prefer block grants for things like Medicaid, even though it means less money for the State, is so they can spend it on football stadiums and more tax cuts for their richest residents.",
