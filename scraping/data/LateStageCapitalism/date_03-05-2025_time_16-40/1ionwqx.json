They did enough civil disobedience such as bombing mailboxes and buildings that belonged to west montreal officials, kidnapped political leaders. Canada declared martial law and deployed in Montr\u00e9al.\nIt wasn't all in vain, Qu\u00e9bec is the most progressive province/state in all North America by having more social programs to aid it's citizens. Also nationalizing electricity production has been a significant contribution to it's health and prosperity.",

But the bourgeois government as soon as they realized this wasn\u2019t a full revolution they just arrested the ring leaders and used violence to disperse the streets. They even demolished the park where the speeches took place to prevent a memorial. A rare chance had someone stepped up and played a role similar to Lenin something new could have been born of Canada.",
