It's as much of a refresh of the series as Doom 2016 was.\n\n**Old Blood**, the second game, is a shorter prequel that adds the occult stuff that the series was known for. I don't want to spoil it because *when it happens, you'll be in for a shock*. I was kind of bored with it until hat *one particular moment when everything changes*, then I loved it.\n\n**New Colossus** is the proper sequel to New Order. It changes quite a few things, but it's still the same kind of game pretty much. They play with the health/armor system due to BJ's... *condition*. The game felt more \"open world\" and they kind of gamified it by making you retread old zones for new pickups and stuff. They kind of tried experimenting with what they can do in the genre/series. Some of it worked, some of it didn't. Still a good game.\n\n**Young Blood** is... *not good*. I won't say it's awful, but it's definitely not good as a followup to New Colossus. It's a coop game and suffers greatly if you want to play alone. It makes you now have scores, XP, levelups, and forces too much replay of too little content. Wolfenstein shouldn't be a game with levels and perks/talents. It takes place much further in the future. It kind of assumes BJ did more stuff after New Colossus but not enough, because it's set decades later and not much has changed. It takes the viewpoint of his two adult daughters, and it is almost mandatory to play with a coop partner.",
