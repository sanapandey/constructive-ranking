I think if you offered me a choice between a democracy run by the wealthy for the wealthy or a dictatorship run for the people, that provides material benefits for the working class, there's a good chance I'd be willing to sacrifice my vote. I do want to be clear, it's iffy!",

What we need is more restrictions & regulations of personal freedom if it means to improve our society as a whole.\n\nIn Vietnam lately, the 168 decree was dropped including heavy fines & regulation, facing backlash from reactionary voices & those so called \"human rights\" ngo funded by US' intelligence to weaken the government's reputation in the people's eyes. But an indisputable fact remains, the amount of traffic incidents has dropped significantly, less people are dead because of this, drivers actually stand in line to wait for the redlight instead of driving recklessly like a Discovery's channel stampede (seriously, for the longest time VN has been known for chaotic traffic). If less personal freedom = improvement as a whole, then it's a fair sacrifice, after all, a country can only stands if it's served its people, as a whole.",
