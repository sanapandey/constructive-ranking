China sells drones to countries. Some of those countries decide to use the drones as flying hand grenades. Same as when China sells basic chemicals and some idiot-countries (USA) don't do anything against their drug lords who use it to produce drugs. Other countries buy stuff from China but don't use it in bad ways. It's not China who strikes poor nations with military drones. It's NATO and its puppies. The headline shifts the focus and blame onto China. \n\nYes, US expansion of drone warfare is a bad thing. But I'd disagree here: If China would provide some military drones to countries who defend themselves against NATO and other terror organizations, then I'd fully agree with China's support. Palestinians, Houthis, Cubans, DPRK, People in Donbass, Burkina Faso and all anti-imperialist nations should have all of the best military drones. I fully support their side in fighting the US, Saudi Arabia, Israel and all the other imperialist puppies.",

People who commit serious violent crimes can be prohibited from owning any firearms.  With just cause.\n\nYeah, ok, I don\u2019t know if a random person will commit a murder, but if someone has a history of murdering, that is a pretty good basis for concluding that they may well do so again and shouldn\u2019t be allowed guns.  And I certainly wouldn\u2019t sell them one even if the law said it was fine.\n\nChina could say at the beginning they thought the US would use them for defence, maybe (and I say maybe because the US has a long history of war crimes), but that excuse ended quickly.  The world knows the US uses the drones to kill.  And they do it without regard for civilians.  Anyone who sells the US government (or defence contractors) drones at this point is complicit because they *know* or they *ought to know* (on the reasonable person standard).\n\nIt\u2019s fucking weird you would defend China in this.  I mean, is it cool when countries supply Israel with weapons for their genocide?  How about Russia for their invasion of Ukraine?  Would that be cool to sell them weapons?  No?  Then why is it okay for the US to outright murder civilians (including some of their own citizens and children, btw) with drones bought from China?",

Where anarchists come in is that I've seen them saying stuff along the lines of Chinese loans being imperialism as if Chinese loans are the same as IMF loans.\n\nThere is of course soft power and hard power and basically I've seen anarchists not use the term soft power but they were saying that loans and the BRI are soft power.\n\nAt the end of the day this is all so fucking stupid because let's assume for the sake of argument that loans and the BRI are soft power.  That's fuel for the US war machine to manufacture consent and justify war with China.\n\nIt was similar with Assad and obvious that he isn't a perfect leader but that Syria was better off with him.  This was clear without even suspecting or knowing about CIA involvement in Syria.  US involvement in Syria, China, wherever is never going to do any good but some anarchists I see will say China and the US are imperialists and therefore they will take no sides in a war between imperial powers.",
