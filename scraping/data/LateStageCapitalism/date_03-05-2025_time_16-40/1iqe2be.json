            "body": "Alright, how about this: first, apply supply and demand to the labor market.\n\nSecond, look at the curve of labor supply, people actually working to make things or provide services. 2a, what does the curve of labor demand look like compared to labor supply. 2b, what material resources do they use to make stuff or do things.\n\nThird, look at who owns the shit workers use to do stuff. What do they do with their ownership? (Hint: skim literally as much as they can while still maintaining the basic functionality of society.)\n\nCommunists and socialists want the resources capitalists own to instead be collectively owned, so that no one can skim off labor and society for their own enrichment.\n\nBonus thoughts: society is changing. If the resources that capitalists own can now do all the menial work through robots and thinking work through AI, and we still exist in a capitalist society in which we either work or die, what the fuck do we do for work?\n\nYou\u2019ll hear a lot about \u201cdiametrically opposed goals\u201d from Marx and Engles, it boils down to labor wanting a larger proportion of the benefits resulting from the work they did, and capitalists also wanting more of it. Communism just sides with labor. Needs of the many and all that.",
