I chose this major because the world is plainly fucked and I want to know how to critically examine the flow of resources and what can be done towards the construction of a more just and equitable society. \n\n  \nUnfortunately, all of my econ professors and peers are corporate/capitalist bootlickers that spend their days wondering how to maximize shareholder value. Even supposed progressive econ groups I've found online outright ban discussions about alternative/noncapitalism economic systems/theories. \n\n  \nI've read Marx and other foundational works and I'm looking for modern data and work that critically examines the structure of the world instead of how corporations can better fatten the pigs at the top.\n\n  \nThanks for any help comrades",

That will give you a few different yet related perspectives on contemporary Marxist political economy. After that, if you want more empirical/direct stuff, try google scholar searches of the concepts/methods they propose. For example if you search \"unequal exchange automotive sector\" you will find a lot of works on it.\n\nIt's great that you are trying to escape the neoclassical brainwashing, a shit theory that lost its last ties with reality back in the 80's. I would advise you to also consider that the two separations between intellectual/political and economic/sociopolitical are also complete bullshit. The best way to get out of the shit mainstream econ mindset is to ignore these separations. Read a lot, not just econ but also radical philosophy and social/political works, and also read nonacademic stuff. Find an intellectual group you can discuss political economy with outside academia, read and write in political magazines.\n\nThe method is as important as the content. Theory and practice go together. Try to do more practical stuff (joining an academic union for example) and then trying to solve your problems using Marxist theory (looking for specific explanations of exploitation in the academic sector) can be a great way to learn by doing.",

Things in conflict have to be parts of the same whole for the dialectical method to be relevant. And it's not all negativity, the logical conclusion is the synthesis. Materialism in the way Marx uses it is a philosophical claim on the direction of determination between the material reality and the world of ideas. As an example, \"a lot of people are liberal, that's why we have a capitalist economic system\" would be an idealist claim, putting the ideology before material reality. As opposed to that, \"we have a capitalist economic system which produces the liberal ideology to justify itself\" is a materialist claim.\n\nI would advise Georger Politzer's \"Elementary Principles of Philosophy\" to understand what dialectical materialism means. It is the lecture notes of students in a philosophy class by Politzer for a workers' school, it is super readable. Bertell Ollman's \"Dance of the Dialectic\" is also a good read on how Marx's method exactly works.",
