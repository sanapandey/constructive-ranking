The fact the germans pushed and held for as long as they did, having completely run out of fuel and running low on ammo is a testiment to the complacency of the western allies.\n\nThe Red Army made no such mistakes though, to be fair, they did absolutely demolish most organized resistance during the liberation of Poland so the nazis mounting counterattacks of this scale in the East was impossible, for that reason and the constant pressure the Red Army applied to their lines.",
