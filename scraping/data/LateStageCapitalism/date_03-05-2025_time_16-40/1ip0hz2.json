We get a lot of posts that are just a title and link, and often those are walls of texts or videos that take precious time to digest.  I have seen many myself that not suitable for this sub, and this rule helps everyone know quickly if it's worth their time or should be posted here.\n\nTo that end, posts that do not follow this new provision will be locked and removed from the sub.
