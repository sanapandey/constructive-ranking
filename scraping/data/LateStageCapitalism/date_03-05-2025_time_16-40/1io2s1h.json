    "selftext": "Inspired by collaborative outdoor activities, protest movements that are more than just marching, and good old fashioned capture the flag. Here are some rules for a game to organize online and play in person over the course of a day-long session.\n\nDuration of play can be from 4 hours up to 12 hours, depending on the scale of the play area and time availability of players.\n\nNumber of players at a session can range from 30 minimum to 1000 maximum. Ideally, over 1000 people would sign up to play on a big activity day, and even if the play area overlaps, multiple games can be run simultaneously.\n\nGameplay area is predetermined before the play session by the event organizers, primarily by the player taking on the role of \"Billy\", \"the billionaire\". It could be a neighborhood, a whole city, or even a wider countryside area where cars, horses, or cycles are needed for groups to get around. It is important for the game to be publicly visible, and an explanation given to non-players so they know what's going on. Whether our game is perceived as an \"ARG\" or a \"reality show\" or a protest action, may differ depending on the context in which it is encountered.\n\nCommunication for game setup and between the sub-groups of players during the play session relies on any simple mobile communication app most convenient for group chat. There's Discord, Mastodon, Telegram, WhatsApp, default SMS, or whatever. A proprietary app could and should be built just for \"Bingo Bango Billionaire\", available for free. Meet-up, match-up, and messaging. Anonymous and encrypted.  \nFive different roles are taken by players during this game, each divided into independent sub-groups roaming the play area.\n\nSpooks. Spotters. Swarmers.\u00a0plus \"Billy\" and their \"Shields\"\n\nSpooks are the operations, analysis, and decision making teams. Fewer in number than Spotters and Swarmers, with only 2 to 4 separate groups of spooks each session. Ideally 3 groups when there are hundreds of players. This is a good role for players who are not so mobile, or would like to participate from a distance.  \nSpooks search social media, websites, and even make social engineering calls to find the clues given by \"Billy & the Shields\" as to where an appearance will be made. They may ask groups of Spotters to help with these tasks.\n\nThere are multiple groups of Spooks because the decision making process is a group process. In some play sessions, Shields may be able to compromise and infiltrate groups, inserting false information. Or... sometimes players might make guesses and just guess wrong. So it is up to the Spooks to decide which sub-groups of Spotters and which sub-groups of Swarmers are beholden to information unanimously verified by all Spooks, or which are given the most autonomy, or a direct chain of command from one Spook group to a few Spotter groups to other Swarmer groups.\n\nEach play session may see different structures of information management and decision making emerge! Learning is part of the fun! \u00a0\n\nSpotters are the information gatherers, the eyes, ears, noses, of the play session. Nearly half the players involved are subdivided into Spotter groups of 3 to 8 people depending on the total number of players. They are provided leads by the Spooks, and may investigate on their own, running around town looking for Billy as he moves between his pre-determined locations and events. They are not permitted to engage with Billy or Shields other than to follow and keep tabs on them, relaying information to Spooks & Swarmers.\n\nSwarmers are the most numerous of the player groups. Half or more of the total players are in groups of Swarmers, with 2 to 10 people per group depending on the total number of players. Swarmers carry ping-pong balls covered in aluminum foil, or alternatively, ping-pong ball sized balls of aluminum foil. They follow the tips and directions given in communications channels, deciding within and between their Swarmer groups which Spook groups and Spotter groups to listen to, or which might be compromised! The WIN condition of the game comes when any Swarmer group is able to give Billy a gentle hug for a few seconds, or hit Billy three times or more with aluminum foil balls. Billy is the sole decider as to whether the win condition is met and the play session is over.\n\n\"Billy\" the Billionaire, has the most difficult role, which must be filled by someone who is part game master, working with a few other organizers to prepare at least a week before to make sure the play session runs smoothly and safely! It is easiest if they use their real name and identity to plan three required public appearances during the play session in guessable locations.\n\nThe week before the play session, Billy should set up some clues online, using social media posts, or small press articles & releases, or even something more subtle, like messages left with friends and colleagues willing to participate and leak answers to anyone who asks the right questions. It isn't as complicated as most ARGs. The least effort would involve telling friends & colleagues about the game then making restaurant & event reservations, perhaps even going so far as to sign up for a fishing, bowling, golf tournament, etc.\n\nJust as important as making plans for three specific public appearances, (*more examples-- a business meeting, a show or sporting event, a dinner or gala*) Billy must provide Spooks & all players with a list of their real life friends, family, contacts, and workplaces that are OFF LIMITS during the game, as well as a list of participating contacts who don't mind being bothered by strangers during the play session. Any person or location or organization not on the approved list of participating contacts & locations provided by Billy should be assumed to be unaware of the game and left unbothered.\n\nThere is a hazy area to be navigated between making this game publicly visible so it attracts attention as a protest activity should, and actually bothering people who are not participating, giving them a negative impression. The latter may be impossible to avoid, but damage can be mitigated by Billy and their Shields carefully planning their travel route and public appearances during the play session, and listing enough clues, contacts, friends, and associated organizations for information to be gathered about their preordained plans and potential backup moves if alerted to danger.\n\nShields are the final role for players to fill. Good for late sign ups, as a small entourage is required to block incoming hugs and aluminum foil projectiles. However, in advanced versions of the game, Shields can also function as infiltrators set against the Spooks, Spotters, and Swarmers, given access to one communications channel and chat group to try to provide false information, or even take over the whole operation through skilled social engineering! Though Spooks may retaliate by asking Spotter and Swarmer groups to swap members and channels, discovering who the infiltrators are by examining who perpetuates false leads. It's an extra layer of strategy for groups who enjoy such challenges!\n\nExamples of role assignment for the suggested minimum and maximum number of players--\n\nMinimum of 30 players.\n\n2 Spook groups of 3 players each. Total- 6\n\n3 Spotter groups of 3 players each. Total- 9\n\n5 Swarmer groups of 2 players each. Total- 10\n\n1 Billy, with 4 Shields. Total- 5\n\nMaximum of 1000 players.\n\n4 Spook groups of 20 players each. Total- 80\n\n50 Spotter groups of 8 players each. Total- 400\n\n50 Swarmer groups of 10 players each. Total- 500\n\n1 Billy, with 19 Shields. Total- 20\n\nBingo Bango Billionaire has yet to be play-tested, so future role assignment weights may vary considerably!\n\nThere should be no limits as to who can participate. Bingo Bango Billionaire is for the people. However I imagine it could be best suited to college campuses, or among work colleagues at mid-sized or large companies during team building activities. Going on strike counts as a team building activity.\n\nIf even a third of us who show up to march in protests take a day to play Bingo Bango Billionaire in separate game groups of manageable sizes, the impact should be significant fodder for sensationalist media.\n\nThe overall goal of our game, reached if a significant number of players start playing regularly, will be to send a message to Peter Thiel and his ilk about their opposition, and how we may be able to find common ground for negotiations. We are not a singular, stratified, hierarchical entity like the billionaires who control the US government and their companies. We cannot be beheaded. All we want is democracy, self-governance, assurance that help will come for those in need, inequities will be addressed, and the standard of living raised for all.\n\nThis will not happen if religious organizations are given the reins of control, as they would if suddenly there were a power vacuum left unfilled by both billionaires and democrats. Those who use the name of Jesus Christ (*or the prophet Muhammad*) to achieve power over others are damned by their own religion.\n\nAre all those who seek such power, that of billionaires and kings, driven by fear? If so, then let them fear us. And be met not with fear in return but civil respect and an offer to trade power for stability. It isn't too late to trade doomsday prophecies for the elimination of extreme poverty and the mitigation of climate change.  \nPerhaps the billionaires think they've already won? That \"Project 2025\" will give them greater control over the USA and the world? How many people can play Bingo Bango Billionaire all together to show them how wrong they are?",
