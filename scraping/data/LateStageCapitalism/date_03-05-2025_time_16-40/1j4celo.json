    "selftext": "\"Today, @CapitaineIb226 has arrived in Bobo Dioulasso, where he will inaugurate Burkina Faso\u2019s tomato plant this coming Saturday. \n\nThis project was conceived by the Agency for the Promotion of Communal Entrepreneurship (APEC) through popular shareholding. \n\nPopular shareholding means that, when there\u2019s a government project, everyone or anyone can participate in it, whether you\u2019re illiterate or educated. \n\nAll you have to do is to bring whatever you can afford and contribute. However, there\u2019s a limit as to how much you can contribute, if not the rich will bring in more cash. \n\nThat\u2019s why even villagers who have cattle can sell their livestocks and bring the money to the State. So, the amount of money you bring in will automatically give you a certain number of shares in the project. That\u2019s what popular shareholding is all about. \n\nIf we do this on a regular basis, we\u2019ll realize that our villagers whom we think that they are poor, are not actually poor, because they have at least poultry, goats, sheep etc. We can easily change their lives. \n\nSo, the factory was fully funded and is owned by Burkinab\u00e8 who put money together to build it. Therefore, with this approach, we can fund any project we want, and we will be the sole owners of our own investments. \n\nIsn\u2019t this economic model far better than evil and perverse capitalism where a handful individuals own and control the means of production? \n\nWe ought as Africans to choose our own pathway. Therefore, I urge Africans to subscribe to the ideal of popular shareholding, and to reject the predatory tendencies of capitalism.\" \n\nSource: https://x.com/marcus_herve/status/1862139840189346176?s=46",
