It\u2019s an economic ideology that evolves from capitalism and requires the scapegoating of an underclass to cover for its failings and rally support for its successes.  This time different ethnic minorities and majorities are taking the roles but the underlying ideology is the same.  The nazi salute is being used as a symbol of fascism as an ideology but not antisemitism which was part of Hitler\u2019s version of it.",

Fascism occurs when any given country is closing in on a catastrophic economic and political crisis and their current \"elites\" go the reactionary route in order not to lose their position of power. They do everything at their disposal to influence politicians and the government to enact policies to stifle all civilian dissent, they begin supporting hyper nationalists narratives and any and every politician or person of influence that's willing to play along those lines. As they're fighting grassroots movements that are aware of the evils that have been brought upon by the greed of the economical and political elites, which are often intertwined, they also begin looking for scapegoats to place upon all of the guilt for anything that's going bad inside their countries. Everyone can be a scapegoat. The Jews are a classic one, which is why the Nazis chose them as their scapegoats, but they can also be \"the illegal immigrants\", \"The Muslim terrorists\", \"The latino drug dealers\", \"the barbarous Africans\", etc. And while all of this is happening, they're also gaining more and more power through political efforts in order to have complete control over the economy, the industry and the government. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if so-and-so is in power, what matters is that they are in power and they will do whatever it takes to remain there. The Zionist political elite is that, and \"elite\" that's willing to play hand in hand with the US political and economical elite, and they literally don't care if they end up supporting people that are now upholding an ideology that once swore to kill all Jews, all they care about is how that will help them stay in power. To them, who they hold accountable to sustain their reactionary movements is irrelevant, all they need is to have an scapegoat. Their current scapegoat are the Palestinians, the Arabs and Muslims in general and the latino immigrants. And so, they're set to go.",
