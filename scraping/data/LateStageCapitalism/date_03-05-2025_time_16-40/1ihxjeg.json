I\u2019d even wager most of that donated campaign money came straight from his handlers in the front or back office of government slush funds. \n\nThat said, this can\u2019t be Musk vs. the CIA, its just the CIA - rebranding and restructuring. The company is retiring their vestigial and irrelevant carrot-and-stick foreign policy agencies from the pre-digital age, like the military towing old derelict ships and warplanes off to scrapyards, and using Musk to bloviate a blatantly revisionist propaganda narrative about their dastardly \u201cradical Marxist\u201d roots and evil deeds and thus the need for their DOGE dissolution. Just fucking intelligence service theater with a slice of asinine. Somewhere in the distance Victoria Nuland can be heard howling at the moon\u2026",

But this is all just [monopoly consolidation](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cia-offers-buyouts-entire-workforce-align-with-trump-priorities-wsj-reports-2025-02-05/). They\u2019re \u201celiminating redundancies\u201d and \u201crealigning their workforce\u201d to \u201caccomplish goals and strategic gains\u201d (or some other corpo BS). There is no way Allen Dulles\u2019 agency got one upped by Musk and Trump. Those two ding dongs are working for the CIA before the CIA works for them. The hegemonic class interest behind the security state isn\u2019t allowing anything to happen that it hasn\u2019t preordained. The 2025 Plan goes back to the Bircher Movement in the 50s who were trying to reestablish the Gilded Age order of things upset by the New Deal before WWII -liberal concessions made to deflate and delegitimize  the power of labor, socialism, against the backdrop of the rise of the USSR and capitalism\u2019s Great Depression- and the burgeoning power of labor organized across racial, gender, and geographic lines post WWII. This writing has been on their wall for a long time.",
