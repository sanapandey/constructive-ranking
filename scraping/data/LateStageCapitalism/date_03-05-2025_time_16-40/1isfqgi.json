Karl Marx listed Spartacus as one of his heroes and described him as \"the most splendid fellow in the whole of ancient history\" and a \"great general, noble character, real representative of the ancient proletariat\".[58] Spartacus has been a great inspiration to left-wing revolutionaries, most notably the German Spartacus League (1915\u201318), a forerunner of the Communist Party of Germany.[59] A January 1919 uprising by communists in Germany was called the Spartacist uprising.[56] Spartacus Books, one of the longest running collectively-run leftist book stores in North America, is also named in his honour.\n\nRosa Luxemburg, remember? Not to mention all the sports-related things named after Spartacus in the Eastern Bloc.",

The amerikan project is distinct compared to say Spanish colonial projects in that it represents the genesis of whiteness and a race-based colonial project. \n\nConventional European colonialism was in no small part rooted in religious hegemony. The central question of hierarchy came down to Catholic Christianity. There were black conquistadors for example. \n\nThe amerikan (really British) project lacked religious homogeneity so we see the emergence of a white identity. This white identity then became the basis of the state and cultural hierarchy in these colonies (eventually making its way back to empire). It\u2019s this white European identity that the fascist myths relies on. \n\nAgain, while nothing is identical, the philosophical evolution here is distinct and they should be understood as interdependent philosophies.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s all sort of beside the point. My comment is more to challenge this notion that a random white guy before the formal emergence of fascism should be understood to be an example of an anti-fascist when there are far better examples contemporaneous to the same time that we should focus attention on.",

They feared that immigrants and Indians threatened the new nation\u2019s identity. (For example, the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 gave the president broad new powers to arrest and deport immigrants, and made it more difficult to become a citizen.) Paranoia about internal enemies bred fierce and ugly feelings of group belonging. With growing fervor against foreigners in the mid-nineteenth century, these white nationalists sparked deadly and fiery urban riots, raving about immigrants who were stealing jobs and committing crimes. (It didn\u2019t help that many white people had been uprooted by a growing market society, which was pushing them into cities and jeopardizing their livelihoods.) Their xenophobia culminated in the [Know Nothing Party](https://imgur.com/O5ZsgJz), a bunch of nativists who were early adopters of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d",

It needed to see itself. When a government puts forth its strength on the side of injustice, as ours to maintain slavery and kill the liberators of the slave, it reveals itself a merely brute force, or worse, a demoniacal force. It is the head of the Plug-Uglies. It is more manifest than ever that tyranny rules. I see this government to be effectually allied with France and Austria in oppressing mankind. There sits a tyrant holding fettered four millions of slaves; here comes their heroic liberator. This most hypocritical and diabolical government looks up from its seat on the gasping four millions, and inquires with an assumption of innocence: \"What do you assault me for? Am I not an honest man? Cease agitation on this subject, or I will make a slave of you, too, or else hang you.\"\n\n- Henry David Thoreau; 30 October, 1859",
