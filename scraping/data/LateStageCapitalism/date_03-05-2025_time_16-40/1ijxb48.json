    "selftext": "I know this an anticapitalist sub so everyone here knows that, but it kills me how most Americans would disagree with this. When has making a public good private ever made that thing better? NASA was better than space X, USPS is better than FedEx (despite being grossly under funded), private Healthcare is just inhumane, we are currently seeing how disastrous defunding public education was, and the privatization of NOAA will have insane consequences. Shit, even private security is somehow worse than police. I'm just so sick of how effective \"starving the beast\" has been. ",

Even as an Elon hater, SpaceX pushed space exploration further in modern times because they had more money and weren't at the whims of Congress for funding. It's a case where less bureaucracy helped and he attracted the best engineers due to what they were going for\n\nId rather NASA just be funded better though than spaceX do their BS and get fed gov bailouts",

Healthcare is very obvious one because it is not like other service. The customers health and well-being are at risk. They have no bargaining power and very little ability to seek alternative options. The seller has them over a barrel. And that's bullshit. It's a warped dynamic that incentivizes price gouging and results in terrible outcomes.\n\nBut there are plenty of areas where capitalist markets produce far superior goods and services then state planning ever could. There is no world in which state planning would have produced smartphones and advanced them as quickly as they did in a competitive marketplace. You say NASA was Superior to SpaceX but I disagree. SpaceX has brought down the cost of space transportation insanely fast because it's the only way to make it a viable business. A state-run agency has no need to push that hard for that kind of progress because it's funding is secure.\n\nThe ideal economy in my opinion would be one where the products and services that actually benefit from competition ( mostly not essential things) produced in competitive markets while other  that we have learned painfully over time do not deliver good outcomes in private markets are managed by the state or other organizations who's incentives are not perversed by profit.\n\nThere's a lot of gray area in there to figure out which works best in which way. State-run economies have historically been very bad at managing agriculture, but markets also incentivize bad behavior in that area.\n\nI don't have all the answers. But I think even a cursory examination of History shows that this has been the case.\n\nTLDR: Competitive markets previous amazing outcomes in some areas and terrible ones than others, and the same goes for publicly run entities. Separating out the details of what needs to be where is not easy, but finding the balance is key to a productive, efficient, and humane society.",

Tightly knit organizations of trauma bonded individiuals. People who volunteered to serve the american idea with their very lives. You think if we found a few more of these organizations within our country, we could string together a real government?",
