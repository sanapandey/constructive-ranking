It\u2019s such a perfect example of how twisted that German society became during the Nazi era, and it is a perfect comparison to Israeli society. Even after all this time, barely any IOF soldiers have gotten second thoughts.",

However, World War I ended before he saw combat. The German Empire collapsed in the face of a communist revolution. Around this time, many German youths who were not old enough to have served in the war enlisted in the Freikorps, hoping to prove themselves as patriots and as men by crushing the revolution. Schulz participated in the suppression of the Spartacist uprising as a member of the 3rd Guards Regiment, and was discharged later that year.\n\nActual satire that the politician who armed those youths and told them that they were saving Germany from communist traitors has a foundation named after him in 2025. Were it not for him and his colleagues, Schulz and those other nationalistic German youths would've all been killed in the revolution or forced to flee Germany afterwards. Given how young they were, they might've stopped questioning the revolution and simply went along with what was happening.",

He allowed 2,000 detainees to escape during the Lviv pogrom, but still participated in mass executions there and did not leave outright until he was told to escalate his already genocidal actions. At his trial, Schulz repeatedly tried to downplay his pre-war antisemitism and overall ideological belief in Nazism, despite supporting them before Hitler took power. He became an informant for the SS in 1931 and helped the Nazi Party gradually take over the police force in Bremen. He joined the proto-Nazi Freikorps in the early 1920s.\n\nHe\u2019d been set on this path from the start:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ly7901hz5he1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd78362f71ed2fbf3c49d2976934a3521f19339\n\nThe men in this notorious photo were from his specific unit. The photo was taken about a year after he\u2019d left. Not a single other person in his unit had any problems with the orders whatsoever. Given that Schulz was the commander and seemed uneasy about his actions from the start,\u00a0the notion that he pressured his men to stay is horseshit. All the SS did was replace Schulz with\u00a0[someone else](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Meier_(SS-Mitglied)), and that person had no objections to the orders.",
