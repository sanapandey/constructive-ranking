I'm a Reddit lurker with peanuts for comment karma, but this is something I'm intimately familiar with so I felt compelled to comment.\n\nPsychopathy isn't diagnosed, it's a personality trait. ASPD is the actual diagnosis, which I have. I agree with you that it's something we can't help and all the misconceptions around it need to change.\n\nAntisocial people are portrayed as predators and serial killers who seek to go out and harm people and lack insight, as caricatures you should be afraid of with ominous music in the background. Yet the 98% of the population that isn't \"antisocial\" can be just as hurtful and unpredictable - cheating, lying, bullying, physical fighting, gaslighting, engaging in hit & runs, neglecting their children/pets, passive aggressive behavior, etc., and they mentally rationalize scary ways to justify them that psychopaths do not even need to.\n\nThe society that makes these projections and sensationalisms is the same society that diagnosed me and put me in a box. Yet I write and record my own music, I've cried at sad movies, I've donated thousands to children's cancer research, and I love my cats. I would consider myself as dynamic and empathetic as at least half the people I know, most of whom are self-absorbed in one way or another.\n\nMy darker side is that I have an deep need for excitement and novelty, and I get extremely restless. I have issues with dopamine. In the same psychological assessment that gave me the ASPD diagnosis, I scored in the 97th percentile for intelligence, so I have a tendency to overwhelm and alienate people. Those two things, coupled with the fact that I feel zero connection to other people, including family, means I get urges to commit crime, do things behind people's back, that kind of thing. It satisfies the need for excitement and lets me hold onto a self-efficacy that gets lost in trying to interact with other people. I'll concede this is a mental disorder, because most people do not think like me, but I'm capable of feeling all the same emotions and making all the same rationalizations as any other human being.",

You are from a different country than I so what you can do is different from what I can do.\n\n>I personally have no power to stop that\n\nYou certainly do have the power to contribute to revolutionary organization in your country. \n\nExample: climate/comments/17oqmp1/trump_20_the_climate_cannot_survive_another_trump/k833mzh/)\n\n>so I ask- who are the gatekeepers and how do we find the key to unlock those gates?\n\nEstablishment politicians and media.\n\nIf you are from the US: The old money and techbro billionaire class as well as the dynastic political families maintaining the US empire alongside all the fascists leading clandestine organizations. \n\nThe best bet if you are an American is to get a good education, a good job, earning money, and infiltrating the system, then teach the leftists in your country about everything so they can also infiltrate and sabotage.\n\nYou don't need to become a major decisionmaker and rich and famous, either. Imagine how much damage a single unsuspecting programmer serving within the US military, the US military industry, or the energy sector can cause to the war machine over the time of their career.\n\nImagine how much a single strategic analyst who earns top secret clearance and has access to US state and military secrets can contribute to the international effort against the US empire.\n\nEven something as simple as curating a list of names, their jobs, their places of work, their income, and their places of residents is extremely valuable information and that's something some random low-rank HR worker can pull from the system.\n\nIf you are already too publicly high profile that you will never get security clearance: At least train your children well so the next generation can move forward.\n\nIf you are from another country: Organize with other socialists. Organize anti-American efforts and sabotage NATO. Support independent news and fight against US-connected news media and NGOs. Just talking to your friends and family about how the US sucks and how China is actually really cool is already planting seeds.\n\n>I think it\u2019s the concept of realizing that no one can hold the treasures here on earth. Being able to reach people on their deathbeds or through mystical experiences is an option worth exploring.\n\nThere is no afterlife. Religion is nonsense. This is the only life you will ever get, so don't waste your chance to fight against those who try and make (and keep) it worse than it could be and at the very least try and improve the lives of future generations.\n\n>Violence simply will not work and will only jeopardize our lives, so I present another avenue.\n\nViolence, in fact, is the only thing that ever worked. Turns out capitalists never gave up without a fight and society always rapidly improved and countless of lives were saved after capitalists have been defeated.\n\nOn the other hand: By tolerating capitalism and only offering peaceful resistance, you are perpetuating capitalism, which is an inherently violent system killing millions every year and jeopardizing literally all of our lives.\n\nWhat exactly have you presented?\n\n>Ask more if you\u2019re curious, but know that replying \u201chuh?\u201d, and then sort of begging the question that breaks down into absurdity might stop this movement in its tracks before it moves anywhere.\n\nI asked \"Huh?\" because this is a socialist sub so I would expect people to already be aware of at least basic socialist theory.\n\nWhere did I beg the question or say anything absurd?",

What facts about Jeff Bezos do you include? \n\nDo you include a full history of every story the newspaper has ever printed on journalistic integrity? What about how they've spoken about Bezos in the past? Which of those is relevant? \n\nIs it relevant to include Jeff Bezos' educational history? What if he majored in journalism? What if he minored? What if he took a single 100 level course on journalism? What if he never took a course on journalism? Is a full list of every company he has a stake in relevant? \n\nWhat about how many stories the newspaper has published on companies he owns, and the viewpoints expressed in those pieces?\n\nEvery piece of the world is entangled in some tiny way with every other piece, every event affects everything in existence in some small way, and there's a necessary bias implicit in deciding which of those events you consider relevant and which you don't. \n\nAnother case, John Lithgow announced he's going to be the new Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series. A lot of people are particularly excited just to see a new version of something they like, and they just want to know who's playing a character, so they will want a listing of what other roles he's played. Other people are big fans of Lithgow, and may not know much about Harry Potter, so including his filmography isn't meaningful. And then some people are greatly disappointed and want everyone to know about JKR's comments on trans people and want to know anything she and he have ever said or implied about trans people, and a discussion of his filmography or more details about the production are a distraction. \n\nWhich of these facts do you include? Do you even write an article about it at all? Maybe you don't think it's important to even write an article. That's bias. \n\nAdding context, leaving it out, how you describe the context, it's all bias.",

Not that you asked for my opinion, it just kinda reads like a parody of the way many people feel leftists communicate with non-leftists. If you really think they're a Nazi, they won't give a shit if you say so. But other people reading the comments see the immediate dismissal of what could possibly be an honest question (maybe a question they themselves have) and feel that the left, and people who care about trans rights, are totally unwilling to explain their perspectives to those who aren't already on board. That we view anyone who doesn't already agree with us as Nazis.\n\nYou don't have to engage with people you feel are communicating in bad faith. You won't change the minds of bad faith actors so maybe just move on and let someone else deal with them? If we **really** care about supporting trans and all other oppressed people, we have to be willing to change the minds of the folks who today indirectly support their oppression.\n\nIn my opinion, this doesn't apply to actively hateful posts/speech. If it's hate speech then yes, insult them, make fun of them, do whatever. But we need more people on our side if we're serious about supporting marginalized people instead of just signaling our goodness and feeling satisfied with ourselves. Apologies if I'm missing context here (I didn't check their post history, maybe they posted some real Nazi shit?) - I just want to see real change and I don't want us to get in the way of it.

But there's plenty of competition so it doesn't matter as much - it still has some excellent programs and the World Service is wonderful. The Sounds app is a festering turd, however.\n\nBut back in the day it was obsequious.

            "body": "My brain is tired so I ran it through AI to analyze it. Here is the result. \n\n1. Lack of Editorial Neutrality\n\nNewspapers traditionally strive for a diversity of viewpoints. By explicitly stating that your opinion pages will only support personal liberties and free markets\u2014and leave opposing views for others\u2014you signal a shift away from editorial balance toward ideological advocacy.\n\nThis could undermine credibility, making it seem like your publication is no longer a forum for debate but a partisan mouthpiece.\n\n2. Dismissal of the Traditional Role of Newspapers\n\nYou argue that newspapers no longer need to provide a broad range of views because \"the internet does that job.\" This undercuts the very role of an opinion page: curating a thoughtful, well-argued discussion rather than leaving people to sift through the chaos of the internet.\n\nReaders might see this as an abdication of responsibility rather than an evolution.\n\n3. Unclear Justification for the Shift\n\nYou assert that free markets and personal liberties are \"underserved\" in the market of ideas. Many would argue that these ideas are already well-represented in major newspapers, think tanks, and political discourse.\n\nWithout evidence or examples, this claim might seem unconvincing or even disingenuous.\n\n4. The \u201cHell Yes\u201d Hiring Standard\n\nYour phrasing about David\u2014essentially that he had to be all in or not at all\u2014suggests an ideological purity test rather than an interest in robust editorial leadership.\n\nThis could make it harder to attract top talent, as it implies an expectation of unwavering alignment rather than intellectual curiosity or editorial independence.\n\n5. Tone Issues\n\nThe phrase \"I am of America and for America, and proud to be so.\" comes across as unnecessary chest-thumping, which may alienate readers who don\u2019t share your exact perspective.\n\nThe closing line (\"I\u2019m excited for us together to fill that void.\") assumes agreement from your audience, but many may not share your belief that there is a \"void\" to fill.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nThis message risks damaging your publication\u2019s credibility by positioning the opinion section as ideologically rigid rather than intellectually diverse. If the goal is to make a major editorial shift, a more thoughtful and nuanced approach\u2014perhaps emphasizing why this direction benefits readers and how it will encourage meaningful debate\u2014would likely be more persuasive.",
