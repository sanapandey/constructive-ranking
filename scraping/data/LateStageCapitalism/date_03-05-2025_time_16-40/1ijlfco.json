    "title": "During the Bonus March, Douglas MacArthur disobeyed orders to not pursue the marchers. However, colleagues blamed his assistant chief of staff, George Moseley, for not delivering the orders. Moseley saw the march as a communist conspiracy, later resigned over the New Deal, and openly praised Nazism.",

            "body": "Now that I think about it, Douglas MacArthur might've refused to do the Business Plot had Wall Street chosen him instead. He might've been smart enough to realize, \"These idiots have no idea what they're doing.\" As seen by what happened in Spain, [simply marching in the capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjurjada) wouldn't have been enough. [George Moseley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Van_Horn_Moseley) would've done it, however. He was not merely a fascist. He was a full-blown Nazi who thought the Holocaust was good and needed to be implemented worldwide, Jim Crow needed to be implemented nationwide, and black people needed to be ghettoized and used for slave labor. He was the American mirror image to Hitler, the kind of fascist strongman whom conservatives would grant power, thinking he can be controlled. In fact, [someone else](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Deatherage) later chose Moseley as a potential military leader for a far better-planned conspiracy against Roosevelt similar to the 1936 coup in Spain.",
