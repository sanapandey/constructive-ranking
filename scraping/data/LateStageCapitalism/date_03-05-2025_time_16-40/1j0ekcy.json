    "selftext": "People love to talk about class solidarity as the answer to capitalism, but let\u2019s be real when has the white working class ever chosen unity over racial hierarchy?\n\nOver and over again, they\u2019ve sided with white elites against Black workers and other marginalized groups, ensuring that economic exploitation continues.\n\n**Labor unions were built on racial exclusion.** White-dominated unions often fought harder to keep Black workers out than to challenge capitalists. Even \"progressive\" labor movements in the late 19th and 20th centuries violently resisted integration. The New Deal, one of the biggest pro-worker reforms in U.S. history **deliberately excluded Black American workers** to appease white Southerners.\n\n**The white working class propped up Jim Crow.** The civil rights movement wasn\u2019t won through worker solidarity it was won *despite* white workers. They overwhelmingly supported segregation, voted for Jim Crow politicians, and violently resisted desegregation. MLK tried to push class consciousness, but white workers rejected it in favor of racial loyalty.\n\nEven today, economic populism is racialized. Instead of blaming billionaires, many white workers blame immigrants, DEI, or \u201cwoke capitalism.\u201d When presented with multiracial labor movements, they often retreat into reactionary politics. The same elites exploiting them use race as a weapon, and time and time again, they fall for it.\n\nSo where\u2019s the solidarity? History is clear.\n\nMost of the white working class has failed to choose solidarity when given the option. Their racial biases have been weaponized against them, keeping them in line with the very elites they *should* be fighting.\n\nCan anyone provide counterexamples? When has the white working class ever led to true multiracial solidarity? Placing the burden on others for this problem isn't working",

White workers were not simply manipulated into siding with elites. They were materially rewarded for doing so.\n\nThe U.S. was built on settler colonialism, where land, jobs, and political power were distributed along racial lines. White workers gained access to stolen Indigenous land, legal protections, and better wages, while Black, Indigenous, and other racialized workers were excluded or hyper-exploited.\n\nDespite this, class solidarity has existed. The Populist movement in the 1890s, Communist-led labor organizing in the 1930s, and multiracial unions in the CIO all built unity across racial lines. The League of Revolutionary Black Workers in the 1960s also worked with radical white autoworkers. These efforts were destroyed because the ruling class saw them as a real threat.\n\nWhite workers have not simply failed to choose solidarity. They have been given incentives to uphold the system, even as it exploits them. Breaking this cycle requires organizing that challenges both capitalism and the settler-colonial foundations that sustain racial divisions.",

Everyone's making choices here and reaping the fruits.\u00a0\n\n\nThat takes autonomy away and disempowers that group when it's choices can be justified as merely being lured to act irrationally and without integrity.\n\n\nIf that's the case, why would they ever pick the side of the working class and stay if they can just excuse their behavior in the end?\n\n\nAnd it doesn't work. If we say the elite can offer the majority \"A\" and we, as a unified working class, dismantle the appeal of \"A\" as a source of division, even if the majority is on board, all the elite has to do is offer up \"B\" and the majority just might find that appealing enough to abandon the class fight.\n\n\n\n\nThe class and culture war are inseparable because they are both rewarded both materially and through the veneer of \"status\". That fight is fought within each individual. And you can't fight a person's demons for them.\n\n\n\n\nThat's a fight that white people would have to have within their own group.\n\n\n\n\nOP is right.

Due to the framework they have, if minorities are coming to them offering partnership they assume that the deal we want to broker with them benefits us more than them. And it doesn't matter how much logic we present to them because partnership was not how they were raised. Currently partnership is not in their lexicon.\n\n\n\nThe lack of control in not being able to get another side to show up consistently is scary, but that's the reality.

The system itself has shaped their choices by offering them rewards for upholding it.\n\nYou are right that unity can not be forced and that white workers have to choose it for themselves. But saying they need to \u201cfind some glue\u201d before interracial organizing can happen puts the burden on them to have an internal moral reckoning instead of recognizing that class struggle is what shifts consciousness. White workers will not just wake up one day and reject hierarchy. But when material conditions make racial privilege less beneficial or when struggle forces them to see their shared interests, shifts happen. White workers will not become revolutionary because they \u201cdiscover partnership.\u201d They will become revolutionary when capitalism no longer offers them an escape route from solidarity.\n\nWhat I'm saying doesn\u2019t absolve them of responsibility for their actions, but we do need to shift the conversation away from moral failure to the structural forces that shape those choices. \n\nImo any revolutionary movement in the US will be led by Indigenous and Black nations, just as Palestinian liberation will be led by Palestinians. If settlers want to be part of that struggle, they have to prove it not through words but through action that materially undermines settler colonialism and racial capitalism. Anything less is just another attempt to preserve a more \"equitable\" version of a fundamentally oppressive settler colonial system.",

Learning from it teaches you to be wary of being susceptible to messaging. Who is telling you what and why.\n\n\nWithout acknowledging each individuals responsibility to the working class, even if we manage some sort of unity to combat this administration, we run the risk of being in this same position in 5 to 10 years.\n\n\n\n\nAnother Trumpian figure will come along and tell them that XYZ is responsible for all their problems.\nAnd the system will have made them do it.\n\n\nWhite people are going to have to make a system that eliminates that threat.\n\n\nImo I just don't see Indigenous and Black people leading that fight.\u00a0\n\n\nCapitalism failing the American citizens alone won't force solidarity. It's been failing rural America for a while and it's not led to cohesion between the working poor.\n\n\nI mentioned in another comment that Timothy Snyder, the author of On Tyranny, wrote that the class and culture war can't be separated out because for people class is a part of their culture. And only the person can decide what class they are in and what interests matter most to them in that class.\n\nSo instead of being able to pay their bills they care about trans people in sports, etc. Psychologically speaking it's transference. Billionaires aren't the issue, the scapegoat of the week is. Punching horizontally and down is easier than punching up.\n\nThat's why Trump supporters seemingly vote against their best interests. They've decided other factors besides their personal economy is in their best interests in an effort to be, in spirit, a part of the powerful billionaire class. That's why they can tell them who their enemy is. If you think like that you are one of them. And there is safety in that. And if you aren't safe it's anyone else but the wealthy class. Essentially cosplaying the powerful elite but with zero in the bank. With magical thinking they really believe it is true. Or at least wish really really hard it is so they will do terrible things to make it so.\n\n\nAfter watching people dying of Covid and with their last breath denying that it's real, I'm just worried what rock bottom will look like to force solidarity.\n\nhttps://snyder.substack.com/p/class-war-or-culture-war",

            "body": "There are absolutely periods of class solidarity across racial lines in US history. The problem is that the dominant cultural zeitgeist is generally controlled by the ruling class. The bourgeoisie uses corporate media and bourgeois government policy to set different racial groups against each other. Whites find it easier to accept deteriorating working conditions and wages if they can at least see themselves as separate from and superior to other racial groups. This is one of the reasons that the definition of who \"counts\" as \"white\" has shifted over the last 200 years. Whiteness is a construct designed at its very core to cause racial division, expanding and contracting to include or exclude groups that can be mobilized to defend the interests of the bourgeoisie by being admitted to the labor aristocracy/professional-managerial subclass of the proletariat.\n\nFascism pursues these goals overtly, but Liberalism is also a racist ideology in that it holds \"western values\" of individual property rights and bourgeois \"democracy\" above all other values as a euphamism for white supremacy, and views societies that do not adopt these values as \"uncivilized\" or \"authoritarian\", which justifies imperialism and violence disguised as \"democracy promotion\" or \"international development\". Case in point, see how the Democrats' narrative of racial equity falls apart when certain majorities of racial groups don't fall in line to vote for them. Fuck those Palestinians and Latinos who refused to vote for a sham candidate, right?\n\nThe value of organized labor and socialist political ideology is that they demonstrate the power of cutting across these lines. The only way to counter the dominant racist narrative is a class-first approach that can directly improve the material conditions of the working class. That's not to say we should ignore race in our political analysis, but liberals have succeeded in pushing identity politics to the forefront of the supposed struggle for liberation as a direct means to suppress a class-first approach, to the extent that people who talk about class solidarity are labeled as racists because they don't engage in racial/gender conflict as their primary political motivation.\n\nUnions are some of the best examples of demonstrated class solidarity across racial lines. There are sordid counterexamples, but many positive examples exist as well, particularly in the 1930s - 1960s and, to a lesser extend, onward. That makes labor organization a central task of Socialists today.",

            "body": "The Rainbow Coalition was made up of various left leaning groups fighting for underserved communities. One of these groups were The Young Patriots\n\nThe Young Patriots were a group mostly centered on serving and protecting young white appalaccian migrants who were having difficulty assembilating because of-- *class.*\n\nThese appalachian people were heaving discriminated against from jobs and forced into extreme poverty. Hell, if you come down south and ask any white family in any trailer park, you will usually find a story about how some ancestor moved out there for better only for nothing to give. It does genuinely happen. And even though the group was founded with people of Appalachia in mind, natives, latinos, and other undeserved groups were permitted to join. And they did.\n\nI understand things genuinely seem hopeless right now. I know it seems like there are just people who will never understand. But what you have to understand it that these people are *still human.* They have brain parts and red blood and can experience things like you and I. They did not wake up and decide to hate people. Hatred is taught. And hatred can be untaught. C.P Ellis was a cyclops for the NC chapter of the KKK. He derobed and spent the remainder of his life fighting for civil rights activism. Daryl Davis single handedly got 200 klan members to disrobe *just by sitting down and having a conversation with them.* He even mentioned in some of the conversations, the men would admit they had *never spoken to a black person before.*\n\nWhen people are in a community where hate is normalized, and they grow up like that, and they go out into the world and find people are challenging them, because this is how they fundamentally see the world, they WILL react aggressively. It's a very human response to get defensive about pre-conceived ideas. If someone grows up thinking the sky is green, do you punish them until they admit it's blue? Or do you try to work with them on what colors are and *why* the sky isn't green? Do you abandon them? Kill them because they don't agree with reality? No.\n\nTo be clear, I don't think we can deradicalize every single last Trump supporter. But there's a really clear, definitive line: the people who are fully aware of the full scope of the agenda and are excited about the consequences, and people who grew up being told the sky is green. There are so many post election reactions that reveal how much misinformation has damaged society, with plenty of people admitting to not even knowing the different platforms, or even *who* was running. *That was a real peaked search result after the election. Americans were kept in the dark because they were distracted with their shiny objects and comforts.*\n\nAnyways, I say all this to say, if you are serious about revolution, about change, you need to accept the fact that there are a lot of white people who have been denied acknowledgement for their oppression. And that denial is what allowed Republicans to weaponize a large amount of them. I mean-- he got the unions on his side last second. That tells you there's a significant portion of the working class that was duped. There are white people who have been disenfranchised and just painting them all with a broad brush of \"oppressor\" while not acknowledging the fact or even trying to teach them that it's systemic and that's its effecting ALL of us, I don't know how else they would react aside from aggressive denial. This isn't to say we need to baby them, but this is to say it's past time for the left to start appealing to those disenfranchised families more. And when talking about class and class solidarity, *that is the perfect time.*",
