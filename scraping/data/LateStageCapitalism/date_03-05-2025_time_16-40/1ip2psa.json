There are many cases of survival instinct being to sacrifice your own safety for the common good/survival of others. So while self preservation is a high driver in *moments* of duress our social wiring can and often has overridden that to preserve the greater social community has a whole. The problem I have is the narrative that we as a species at our core are selfish, and will always choose ourselves first is a horrific misunderstanding/intentional misinterpretation of what survival of the fittest actually entails. It\u2019s a narrative that was specifically built to justify and even extol the worst behaviors in capitalism, colonialism, exploitation, and slavery.",

Adolf Eichmann published a pamphlet where he argued that a strong Jewish state in the Middle East would become a threat to Nazi Germany in the future. That said, even he would express begrudging admiration for Israel while hiding in Argentina.\n\n>\u201cI did see enough to be very impressed by the way the Jewish colonists were building up their land. I admired their desperate will to live, the more so since I was myself an idealist.

But after a few days and your comment I have to explain a bit more what I mean\n\nI really and wholeheartedly can say that everyone in my family (except one great-grandparent who died before I was born in the 90s) was an anti-fascist after the war ended. \n\nI was born and raised in a rural part of West-Germany in a predominantly conservative town in the middle of nowhere\n\nEven my grandparents in their shitty little town in Nowhere, Germany were harmed by WW2 \n\nMy grandma lost 8(!) brothers and her father during the war. Her soon to be husband had to duck for cover after he had to refuel Airplanes while he was just 16 years old. My other grandmother had to care for the sick and wounded soldiers, while my grandfather got shot in the leg with only 18.\n\nAlmost all of those people I just told the internet about are now dead and I was the last generation to  hear them tell their storys.\n\nI can swear on their graves that not a single one of them had anything else than hate for Hitler and his party after the war and especially the years of Hunger while rebuilding Germany. Rebuilding this time not while thinking about their superiority to other \"races\" like Americans still call them today.\n\n\nEvery. Single. One. Of the Germans that were alive during the darkest part of German history has lost something or someone to the war that this fucking artschool-failure started.\n\nAll the people I know/knew that lived during that awful time said that when they saw what the nazis did... they were more than shocked and scarred for life because of the things that they could have (maybe) prevented if they weren't so blinded by the propaganda of the NSDAP\n\nMy grandma (she turned 96 in January... tough fucking girl) is one of the few German people who know how it started and while her body slowly stops working... her mind is more than alive. \n\n\nI'm tearing up while I think about my grandma watching the news saying \"Genau so war es damals auch!\"\n\nI'm definitely not the only one that has stories like that! \n\nI just think it's an insult to my country saying that the fascism is deeply rooted here. The War-Generation learned from their mistakes and distanced themselves from the atrocities that the regime. They know (or knew) they can't make excuses for it so they worked on being better people. You don't trust me? Ask almost any other German. They have similar stories to tell.\n\n\nI can almost hear the victims of the war rolling in their graves from my bedroom right now. Wish, hope and maybe even pray for Germany while we vote for our new chancellor this Sunday...\n\n\nSo in conclusion... the allies did their best to denazify our country but definitely failed, but most of the people realized what the Nazis had not only done to other peoples in the world, but also to their own and would rather fucking die  than vote more right than the center of our political center",

Examples include the [Christian Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Front_(United_States)), [Black Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Legion_(political_movement)), and [Silver Legion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Legion_of_America)). Many of these homegrown fascists hated Roosevelt. The Business Plot aside, there was even [one person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._Deatherage) who plotted a Spanish-style nationwide fascist insurrection against the president over the New Deal.",
