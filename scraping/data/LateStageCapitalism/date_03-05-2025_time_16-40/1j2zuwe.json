This means that all that extra worker productivity has not been paid to labor but has being extracted to capital (good ole\u2019 surplus value extraction). With real wages flat, people only have the illusion of an increasing quality of life because overall things have become cheaper in real terms (because Chyna). But because inputs are cheaper as well, that\u2019s just means an opportunity for more value extraction. Dismal science indeed.",

Today, it's at least 300 times  as much, and that's not getting into $100 million \"bonuses\", etc., on top of it.",
