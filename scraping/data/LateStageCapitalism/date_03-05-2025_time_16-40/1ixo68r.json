Instead of coming to the conclusion that if capitalism is exploitative (as he himself claims), why are we not fighting against the root cause, rather than only addressing the symptoms. \n\nMaybe I'm missing something here but are most American liberals like this? They are so close to getting it, it's kind of amusing. ",

                                    "body": "Celebrities are more like gladiators in the Roman Colosseum. They're just tools used to distract the public. While we're distracted by celebrities and entertainment, real issues like inequality, corruption, and political power grabs go unnoticed. The same is true for professional sports teams. People get absorbed in games and team rivalries while the elites keep running the show behind the scenes. The Roman Empire used the Colosseum to keep its citizens distracted from the empire\u2019s flaws and injustices, and today, the media and celebrity culture serve the  same purpose. The focus on entertainment keeps the masses passive, ensuring that the systems of power remain unchallenged.\n\nFreudian psychology, and mass psychology, shaped by both elite interests and emerging social sciences became more prominent in the early 20th century. Walter Lippmann, a World War I-era propaganda expert, argued that the public is too dumb and irrational to govern itself, so elites must control information to shape public opinion. Bernays took this to heart and expanded on it. People don\u2019t think independently; they rely on simplified narratives and images. If you control what stories are told, what is emphasized, and what is ignored, you control what people believe. The best way to influence people is through subtle, indirect messaging. Modern corporate PR buries negative news while flooding the media with positive distractions, so the public only sees what they want them to see. People trust experts, even if they\u2019re fake. If people feel threatened, they\u2019ll look for a savior. Simple, emotionally charged symbols stick in people\u2019s minds. Outrage is one of the most powerful engagement tools because it triggers fight-or-flight responses. Rage and tribalism are used to divide people and keep them distracted from systemic issues.\n\nSocial media platforms prioritize engagement over truth, feeding people content that keeps them hooked and emotionally reactive. TikTok\u2019s algorithm gives early engagement boosts to new users, creating a dopamine rush that encourages constant posting and scrolling. People\u2019s psychological profiles, fears, and biases are mapped using social media behavior, purchase history, and personality tests. Political and corporate actors craft highly specific, manipulative messages tailored to individual psychological vulnerabilities. This allows mass persuasion to feel deeply personal and organic. False narratives are seeded alongside real ones, making it harder to distinguish truth. The goal is to flood the information space with conflicting narratives to create confusion and distrust. News outlets and social media trends intentionally inflame culture wars, keeping people angry at each other instead of questioning the system itself.",

Socialism is probably the best system in modern history because capitalism is allowed to create wealth while the government controls the profits and redistributes it to all the people in the form of free healthcare, education and government housing, cheap food and job security. It's way better for the environment because they aren't over extracting for profit like the United States. Almost every president in American history has removed regulations to benefit corporations. The United States learned about global warming in 1896! See for yourself.

Living in a capitalist system is very bad for mental health and some of my friends are no longer here and that makes me sad. Opening our minds to understanding how connected we are in our suffering helps me to not feel so alone. Anger and hatred is very bad for the health but understanding why something happens or that something is a feature of the system is enlightening and can possibly provide a path to move forward. Reddit is cool because I can connect with like-minded people and learn new perspectives and even though we are not connecting in person, we are learning together.",

                                    "body": "We are nowhere near post capitalism. Post capitalism is a fallacy. What you are talking about is PRE-CAPITALISM. We are in the neoliberal phase of capitalism. Historically, neoliberal capitalism is followed by fascism. Neoliberal capitalism is a modern form of capitalism that emphasizes \"free markets\", privatization, deregulation, and reducing government intervention in the economy. \"Free market\" is in quotes because corporations consolidate or consume other corporations until they have monopoly control of the entire market. That can be seen very clearly in the entertainment industry. 6 companies own 90% of the media we consume.\n\nNeoliberal capitalism rigs the system for the rich while gutting protections for workers and the public. It hands power to corporations, turning everything into a commodity. Jobs become unstable, wages stagnate, and unions are weakened or crushed. Privatization makes essential services more expensive and less accessible. Rising inequality concentrates wealth at the top, making economic mobility harder. With wages down and social safety nets cut, people rely on loans and credit cards to survive. Corporations fund politicians to keep the system rigged in their favor. The formula for capitalism is profit over all people and the entire planet. When capitalist systems face deep economic or social turmoil, fascism can emerge as a way to preserve elite control, often with violent force, and maintain social order. That's why I'm concerned about the president shutting down the national database that tracked misconduct by federal police. If you study union history like I have, you'll learn about numerous violent clashes that have occurred between the working class and the military and law enforcement. The great railroad Strike of 1877 resulted in the national guard and federal troops killing up to 100 people, most of whom were railroad employees.\n\nThere are numerous protections in the Constitution that protect corporations and if you read George Washington's farewell speech you learn the following about corporations. \u201cThe alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.\u201d Thomas Jefferson said, \"I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and bid defiance to the laws of our country.\" He had this to say about banks, \"Banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.\" Read the Federalist Papers for a better understanding American democracy. I believe democracy is one of the oldest pieces of misinformation in American history. Words are defined a certain way to the citizens but they have entirely different meanings to capitalists.\n\n In 1984, George Orwell provided the most accurate analysis of history. \u201cWho controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\u201d Orwell emphasized that the most effective way to control people is to erase, distort, or rewrite their understanding of history. Also in 1984, he writes, \u201cThe most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.\u201d George Orwell gave a clear warning that controlling history is a form of mind control. I've studied all the tactics and found numerous articles online about it. Our own government publishes articles about mind control. Our media has been using these tactics since the 1920s.",

What exactly is considered failure ? In meaningful ways, even Eastern Bloc communism modernized a lot a countries before it 'failed', and it didn't even failed independently of global geopolitical events. Not to say that those regimes are any kind of desirable models to be followed today, but I would say that transforming a backward society with medieval/feudal/premodern dysfunctional and very corrupt institutions into a reasonable modern one in a very few decades is something that needs to be investigated more careful before dismissing everything as failure. The problem is that they don't want any kind of alternative to capitalism, that's why they are not interested of learning anything and only rejecting any kind of detailed investigation. Those communist regimes made a lot of mistakes and they weren't exactly democratic themselves either, but they really can't serve as any kind of evidence that 'communism can't work'. They just don't want it to work. And we should not even speak about how capitalism 'works', at what costs and for how long. Capitalism 'works' because they have very low, hypocritical standards for 'success' and even these won't be sustainable for long. If communism would benefit from the same level of efforts and energies that capitalism gets just to only 'exist', this planet would be an utopia.",

That's what condemns us to collective suicide in slow motion. This kind of slow boiling of the frog gets society used to evil, frustration, normalizes attitudes that makes solidarity even harder (think popular support for fascist regimes). That's why I believe that accelerationism is the only way to actually get people to feel that the current system isn't worth fighting for. I know I am in minority here, as accelerationism is getting bad rap in communist circles. This slow decay is what makes everything so much harder for people to actually see the problems - that are not immigrants, high taxes for the rich, 'woke' liberal propagandists and so on, but the economic system itself. As long as there is the illusion that you can STILL make it for now, no social change will come. It will actually get even worse because of the increased competition and fading away that little class solidarity remains.",

I don't think he does but he understands that we do live under capitalism and there is a role to minimize it's harmful effects.
