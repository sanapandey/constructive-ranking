Worker owned factories, hospitals, mines, etc... A lot of other things are called socialist when they are just social programs: universal healthcare, UBI, or just \"when the government does things\". That is your definition for socialism.\n\nAs far as checks and balances go, in an ideal situation, workers who own the means of their production would not charge exploitative costs for the fruits of their production, (as is done under capitalism so that a owner or CEO can expropriate value that they did not generate) because they don't need to. Necessities are affordable, luxuries are inexpensive and abundant and exploitation doesn't exist. This would be considered a post scarcity society. Everything I need and want is readily available to me, why would I exploit to get it?\n\nIn reality, people as a whole will not wake up tomorrow and decide that they no longer need to hoard or exploit. Some may continue to take advantage of others. A post scarcity society requires a cultural shift that will take time to be realized. The checks and balances here will be a worker run government (dictatorship of the proletariat) whose interests will be the interests of the people and whose job it will be to prevent exploitation, distribute resources equitably and plan the economy based on the needs of the people. Once post scarcity is achieved, the government will no longer need to prevent exploitation because everyone will be preventing exploitation and the government's sole job will be day to day management of the economy and resource distribution (the state will whither away).",

There is no middle course (for mankind has not created a \u201cthird\u201d ideology, and, moreover, in a society torn by class antagonisms there can never be a non-class or an above-class ideology). Hence, to belittle the socialist ideology in any way, to turn aside from it in the slightest degree means to strengthen bourgeois ideology.\" - Lenin \"What is to be done?\" (https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1901/witbd/)\n\nOr rephrased by a more modern Marxist (with emphasis on pan African movements of the 20th century):\n\n\"What I will attempt to deal with as best I can, are certain questions arising from individuals who might say yes to most of what I've said and then will ask the question, \"Is there no other alternative? Is there no other ideological system which is neither capitalist nor socialist, but is anticapitalist, but addresses itself more humanely, if you like, to the interest of African people wherever they are?\"\n\nThey failed because their conception of what was a variant different from bourgeois thought and different from socialist thought inevitably turned out to be merely another branch of bourgeois thought.\n\nAnd this was the problem, that bourgeois thought, and indeed socialist thought, when we get down to it, can have a variety of developments or roads and aspects or paths. With bourgeois thought, because of its whimsical nature, and because of the way in which it prompts eccentrics, you can have any road, because, after all, when you are not going any place you can choose any road!\n\nSo it was possible for these individuals to make what. I consider to be a genuine attempt to break with the dominance of bourgeois thought and yet find, in the final analysis, that they had merely embraced another manifestation of that which they themselves had suggested that they were confronting at the outset.\" - Marxism and African Liberation - Walter Rodney (https://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/rodney-walter/works/marxismandafrica.htm)",
