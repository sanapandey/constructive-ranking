    "selftext": "Hey all. We\u2019ve received a few messages from the admins warning us that there have been quite a few posts/comments over time of people calling out other subs by specifically naming them, which is sometimes considered a call to brigading by Reddit\u2019s mod team. \n\nWe know your hearts are in the right place, but we want to remind you all that inciting a brigade is against Reddit\u2019s TOS and will get you banned as per our rules. \n\nSo chill a bit, okay? We don\u2019t want to get the sub nuked. \n\nEDIT: since some people are asking what brigading is: Brigading is the act of users of one sub purposefully going into another one with the objetive of trolling and annoying their users. We\u2019ve had some cases of users calling for that action on other subs here before, so the admins asked us to do something about it.\n\nEDIT 2: Also, please remember that this action comes as a request from the reddit admins, we\u2019re simply complying and this statement does not necessarily reflect the mod team\u2019s opinions on this topic.\n\nEDIT 3: Also, do not make calls to violence as well. You know why I\u2019m saying this at this specific moment given some recent events, but again, Reddit TOS. Please respect them or you will be banned.",
