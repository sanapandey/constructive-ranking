I got\u00a0fed up with billionaire\u00a0sycophants claiming trickle-down economics works, so I built\u00a0[trickledown.fail](https://trickledown.fail)\u00a0to visualize just how badly\u00a0we're getting screwed.\n\nThe\u00a0site shows:\n\n* Real-time wealth growth of billionaires\u00a0(watch the numbers tick up while\u00a0you scroll!)\n* How your salary compares\u00a0(spoiler: it's depressing)\n* Why\u00a0the \"job creators\" narrative\u00a0is absurd, backed by\u00a040 years of Federal\u00a0Reserve data\n* How billionaires somehow pay lower\u00a0tax rates than you\u00a0do\n\nAll data comes straight\u00a0from government sources (while they're still accessible lol) and Forbes' billionaire tracking. Check it\u00a0out and let me know what you think. Would love feedback on what else to add or how to make it more impactful.",

I, for one, have been looking exactly for something like this, simple but dynamic graphs/illustrations that help communicate the total and complete failure of trickle down economics. \n\nPaired with a journalist\u2019s insights, this could go far. Thank you for the initiative.\n\nEdit: esp as they continue to dismantle our systems of education, we need to keep fighting back with this kind of data-backed messaging.",

If they work so well then why do we need to keep doing them?\n\nI just looked up the Chinese Electric car company BYD. They have multiple stock offerings. I looked up one to see who the major stockholders were. Besides the founders there were many Americans like Warren Buffet, American banks like PNC, American Funds like Fidelity & Vanguard and of course private equity like BlackRock and many others. \n\nBiden increased Trump's tariffs against this car manufacturer to 100% because they would kill the US EV industry. Now they have a pickup truck that will start destroying our overseas trade very soon. This is one of the few issues that many different political factions in both parties and independents agree on. \n\nBut isn't it strange that no media outlets discuss who is financing our enemies? I wonder where they got all that extra money from? Oh, yeah, tax cut after tax cut after tax cut. BlackRock & Vanguard (who used to own 33% of BlackRock) are responsible for our out of control rents & housing. They have been snapping up single family housing for more than a decade. They purchased over 1,400 houses in Atlanta in one day. \n\nWe need to start discussing who the real enemy is. Much of this Trump craziness comes from an extremist right wing infrastructure of NGOs, think tanks and other organizations financed by the Koch Brothers. Where did their money come from? Daddy. Where did he get it from? Hitler & Stalin - the USAs most bitter enemies.\n\nBoth Elon & Trump publicly fellate Putin presubably for business reasons, although he may have a pedo tape on one of them. They both seem to admire the way he rules and seem to be moving the USA towards a Russian Oligarch model. The wealthy undermine us and work with our enemies every single day and we need to start talking about it more.",
