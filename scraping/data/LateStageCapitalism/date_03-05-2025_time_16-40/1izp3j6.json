My African friend (who is trained as a physician in his homeland) put it this way: the west is not a real civilization, it is a parasite. All the beauty of the great European capitals came out of the soil of Africa. \n\nWhoa, this is something I had to process. It made me redefine what I thought what was meant by civilization and being civilized. It is not how exquisite your art and literature is, how splendid and grandiose your buildings and architecture are, or how advanced your science and technology have become. It is about how you treat and are treated by people (I know, duh thats what civil means). In this regard, heretofore undiscovered Pygmy tribes in the rainforests will be more civilized than the west. \n\nThe \u201cdecay\u201d we are witnessing is the result of the host (the global south) finally being able to recognize, resist, and gain immunity from the parasite.",
