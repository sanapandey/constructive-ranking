General strike\n\nAs for #1, my recommended intro reading list:\n\nThe principles of communism - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm)\n\nSocialism utopian and scientific - Engels (https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/)\n\nThe state and revolution - Lenin (https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/)\n\nThere's also a ton of good YouTube content if that's more your thing ( but you really should read the foundations of theory as well), highly recommend these channels as a good starting point:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@SecondThought/videos\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@YaBoiHakim/videos",

I'm pretty set on getting healthier to spite the people who got us in this mess. \n\nThey also asked me something similar in a later conversation, we're both the kinds of folks who would defend our people at the drop of a hat and sometimes that needs to stay checked. It's a similar bit of advice but from a totally different perspective, be ready to fight with / support/ or assist your people when the time comes but make sure you allow them to fight as much of that battle and utilize their own voice before stepping in.",
