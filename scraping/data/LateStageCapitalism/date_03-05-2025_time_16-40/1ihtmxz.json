    "selftext": "Ever since I was a preteen I have always gotten the same meal from Carl's Jr. When I started working in my mid twenties, I heard it said that a reasonable way to gauge how much money you should be making Is that your daily eat out lunch should be a half hour's worth of work. For give or take 20 years this has held up within reason. For the last 10 years I have felt that gap stretching further and further out of reach to where today I am paying $18 for the same meal while making $27 an hour. I don't know how anybody says the American dollar is strong if it's spending power has been so massively diminished.",

Five to six decades ago in the US (can\u2019t find Canadian numbers), it was only three times more.
