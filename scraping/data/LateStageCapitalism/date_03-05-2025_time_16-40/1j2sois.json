While the shift definitely predates Traor\u00e9\u2019s rise to political stardom, there is no denying his astuteness in hanging on to its coattails, subtly positioning himself as the bridge between the mass of frustrated ordinary Africans, and the halls of the African academy where, incidentally, he is viewed by some as the long-awaited arrowhead of an imagined continent-wide socialist revival. Indeed, much of the admiration for Traor\u00e9 on the left side of the political spectrum\u2014his standing among the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in South Africa is a perfect illustration\u2014seems motivated by this hunger for an ideological idol.\u201d\n\nYes, real Pan-Africanism is rising that will threaten the West\u2019s standing.\n\nI hope the EFF will rise in South Africa too.\n\nSource of the article: https://www.cfr.org/blog/prince-sahel",

Outside of Gaddafi\u2019s official role as Higher Commander of the Armed Forces, his role in politics was that of an informal advisor to the General People\u2019s Congress and at times the Secretariat of the General People\u2019s Committee.[6] Even among Western academics, historian Lillian Harris, who authored Libya: Qhadafi\u2019s revolution and the modern state, noted that Gaddafi didn\u2019t hold any political authority in the Jamahiriya process. Despite attempting to make the argument that Gaddafi was still a dictator pulling the strings by claiming that Gaddafi could override the General People\u2019s Congress, she admitted that after Gaddafi\u2019s proposals to the congress were all rejected his response was holding protests across the country to express criticism. Immediately following these demonstrations, the congress held a special session and voted to approve only one of Gaddafi\u2019s three proposals.[7]\" \n\nSource: https://en.prolewiki.org/wiki/Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya_(1977\u20132011)",
