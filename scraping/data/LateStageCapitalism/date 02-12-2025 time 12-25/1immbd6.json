The cycle of freaking out of every four years and *everything is fine and totally not fascist unless THEY win but we\u2019ll go back to not caring and being genocide apologists when they\u2019re out*. It makes my blood boil \ud83d\ude43 take your personal urgency out of here and go do something to help someone in your community. Why wasn\u2019t this important before trump? (Rhetorical question. It was important pre-trump. And also we\u2019ve been through trump once, do people have no memory of the shit he put us through?) \n\nHere\u2019s what you can do:\n\n- Learn the un-whitewashed history of the United States. Context is so fucking important here and none of y\u2019all should be surprised that this is where we\u2019re at. Especially considering the events that have unfolded over the past year (genocides) - were you paying attention? \n\n- This sub has an abundance of excellent resources and reading recommendations. Take advantage of them. \n\n- Get involved with mutual aid in your community. You don\u2019t need to have money to help people. \n\n- Consider masking in well-fitted high quality masks in public spaces again, consistently. Covid-19 was a war on the working people, a war on disabled folx, etc, some of whom are here in this sub. It is still rampant and if we want to protect each other and fight the fascism that Covid-19 helped accelerate, mask up and don\u2019t spread your exhalations. Bonus is that this could also prevent you from getting sick. Biden and the CDC\u2019s call for vax and relax in 2021 FUCKED US ALL OVER. Notice how Biden didn\u2019t save us? No member of the two party system ever will. \n\n- Keep educating yourself. This is a communist sub. *Not a fair-weather only freak out when trump is president neoliberal election stress dumping ground.* I\u2019m not gate keeping - adding important context because it seems like a lot of people come to this sub without realizing what it\u2019s about. That is all. \n\nAnd if anyone has additional suggestions please feel free leave them here. \n\nPodcast recs off the top of my head:\n\nPodcast recs:\n\n- https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/still-here-a-podcast-from-the-sick-times/id1772137966\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/death-panel/id1444679141",

No member of the two party system ever will.\n\nI want to add something to this. [There is a very very clear reason as to why both parties do not and will not address reason why we have high egg prices.](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/bidens-usda-never-tried-to-control)\n\nAnd it is because of Donald Trump's horrific policies towards all infectious diseases, and which were adopted and continued by Joseph Biden, and will be continued by Trump (again). The very ugly possibility of Bird Flu killing millions of people keeps increasing and increasing and why is that?\n\n>Every time a farm worker is infected with H5N1, it\u2019s like a game of Russian Roulette for the rest of us. The virus is making trillions of copies of itself, and many of them carry random mutations. If any of those copies carry mutations that allow it to achieve human-to-human transmission, it will likely be passed on to a contact- or contacts- of that worker. You\u2019ve just witnessed the potential birth of a new pandemic.\n\n>So basically, you really, really don\u2019t want this thing- this Spillover Event- to happen *even a single time*. Every time you do, you\u2019re potentially gambling with 8 billion people\u2019s futures.  \n The Biden Administration has allowed it to happen 61 times in less than a year. And instead of treating it like an emergency, which they almost certainly would\u2019ve before COVID, the USDA, FDA, CDC and White House keep treating their Russian Roulette \u201cwins\u201d like permission to play another round.  \nIt wasn\u2019t easy to get the entire country to abandon masks, begin mocking them, turn spiteful toward those who wear them, and accept a \u201cnew normal\u201d of constant illness. It wasn\u2019t overnight that parents accepted [endless illness for their children](https://www.thegauntlet.news/p/nytimes-invents-increasingly-bizarre), and stopped questioning the carousel of RSV, flu, pneumonia and COVID infections. It took years of wall-to-wall media messaging, arguing that there were *no* tools available to prevent this, that a better world was *not* possible, that vulnerable people *must* die for the rest of us to live, that *lockdowns* were the reason for the suffering wrought by a world-historical pandemic, that sickness is healthy and that illness avoidance is, well, crazy.  \nWith this context, it\u2019s easy to see why, when H5N1 was identified in dairy cows, there was no urgency to eliminate it. How can a virus in cows be an emergency, if nearly a million dead doesn\u2019t trouble this administration? How can the threat of a pandemic be a concern, when an ongoing pandemic isn\u2019t something they think about anymore?\n\n>How could disrupting business as usual ever be good policy?\n\n>Biden\u2019s administration has loaded the gun, spun the cylinder one more time, and now hands it back to Donald Trump. \n\nRestating this again: PROTECT YOURSELF AND YOUR COMMUNITY because the war criminals in the capital are most definitely not going to.",

I\u2019m currently substitute teaching as my survival job in NYC and you would not believe the amount of ill people I\u2019m coming into contact with on a daily basis, especially on the subway and in classrooms. As someone who wishes I would\u2019ve never relaxed after vax, masking feels like a very important thing to do and I feel better protecting myself and also those around me. Just want a parody button of \u201ceverybody\u2019s talkin\u2019\u201d by bill withers that says \u201ceverybody\u2019s coughin\u2019 at me, I don\u2019t hear a word they\u2019re sayin.\u201d Bc it\u2019s TRUE.\n\nI\u2019m masked in my N95 - almost everyone around me is unmasked, sniffling, hack coughing\u2026 except for me.\n\nMy immune system was damaged from being infected with covid-19. I noticed because I was immunocompromised years ago when I was suffering from an eating disorder and got sick all the time. Then I got healthy, stopped getting sick as often, then the pandemic happened and my immune system is back to square one (incredibly frustrating because I worked so hard to recover but I also acknowledge that many people have it worse than me as a result of covid-19 infections.) People\u2019s immune systems are damaged from C19 infections so everyone is getting sick more often + worse and from what I hear, seasonal vaccinations are happening less (C19 boosters, flu shots.) We might be at a point of no return unless most people start masking again and a C19 vaccine that stops the spread is created. But so much permanent damage has already been done\u2026",

News flash libs, it's the Dems' fault for being pro genocide and alienating all those people in the first place. Sure Trump and the right is worse, but you should be blaming the party that were so useless that they alienated chunks of their voter base and lost to fascists TWICE. The Dems are the most incompetent party I've ever seen and I say that as as a Scottish man who's dealing with the almost equally milquetoast neolibs called Labour.\n\n\nThe truth is that Labour and the Dems could adopt actual leftist stances and push for them hard if they wanted, to the benefit of the worker, but the utterly selfish neolibs, hypocritical centrist cowards and right wing scum that have infected those parties have sabotaged any hope the left had. Sanders and Corbyn are both prime examples of what happens when the neolibs target leftists.\n\n\nWhy have these parties and those involved moved away from actual leftist stances? Greed, money and corruption. The neolibs would genuinely prefer to lose the elections and wait until the public is so sick of the right that they get their inevitable and fleeting \"they can't be as bad as the right\" free win every now and then before the public's short memory combined with a lack of meaningful change put the right back in power. If they make actual leftist changes then that hurts the rich, including their wealthy benefactors and themselves. The right makes policies that benefit the politicians and the rich, including the neolibs, so they benefit even when they're not in power.\n\n\nIt all comes back to the class wars. The system is being run by the rich for the rich either way.",

When they claim to care about child cages and deportations, but only when the reps are in charge, and they seem totally unaware that obama built the cages, and that biden holds the record on deportations? When they freak out about roe vs wade being struck down, then vote for someone who himself tried to strike down roe vs wade, and they dont even notice four years later that he hasnt actually restored abortion rights? When they attend rallies chanting \"ACAB\"... Then turn around and vote for a cop to be president, and for everything their local police dept asks for?\n\nThats all so extremely hypocritical and counterproductive to their stated goals that its hard to believe they are honestly just being that stupid. Im leaning towards it being a willfull BS act, like the reps constituncy pretending elons sieg hiel wasnt a sieg hiel. They know better, they just dont have any true convictions beyond \"my team must win\", and so theyll be dishonest to get that goal.\n\nI cant find any evidence or signs that the dems arent the same in their thinking. Indeed all I find is evidence confirming it.\n\nAnd its made me very upset, bc I thought that 1/3 the country at least were decent people who genuinely wanted things to be better, even if 1/3 were not, and now I have to confront the possibility that 2/3 total are not good people, and that means the majority of the country is evil people working to make things worse. \n\nThe propaganada is constant and strong, so strong the DNC voters brains shut down when confronted with reality... Ex: if you mention that illegal EOs are bad, both when trump abuses them *and* back when Obama abused them to authorize murdering civilians and citizens, the dems will stop reading as soon as you mention anything bad about \"their\" side then berate you for being a trumper. Theyve been triggered into attacking \"the enemy\" and cant process any info at that point, or think about whats been said, and they never check any links you share about the dem politicians and their actions, bc theyre suddenly as unreliable as fox news in their mind, nevermind if its actually npr youve linked to.\n\nWhether brainwashed and propagandized with trigger points to prevent them from ever waking up, or just plain ole evil, its a daunting reality, and it leads to the grim realization that these people will just keep doing the same shit theyve been doing for decades, over and over again without progress, while attacking anyone who points out this insanity or tries to help in any way. \n\nThe dems are as much an obstacle to progress and the reps. It remains to be seen whether they can learn better, wake up, and stop sleepwalking through this... But at this point Im not hopeful.",

We have a major problem in that people begin with Majority Report, TYT, or Secular Talk and then take a long time to move off of them if they ever do.\n\nForeign policy in the heart of empire is more important than domestic policy so I find foreigners who speak English provide some of if not the best insight there is to get.",
