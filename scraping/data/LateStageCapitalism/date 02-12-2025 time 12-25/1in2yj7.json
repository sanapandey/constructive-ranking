They provided the apartheid government with political and military support. Only after it became politically impossible for them to continue after domestic protests and opposition did they distance themselves and allow UN resolutions sanctioning SA to go into effect.",

Vorster had been a Nazi sympathizer and member of the fascist Afrikaner group Ossewabrandwag during World War II; in 1942, he proudly expressed his admiration for Nazi Germany.
