MAGA believes that they are winning, even as Trump and Musk dismantle institutions that are intended to protect them from being preyed on by the people who have actual power: billionaires, big tech and Wall Street. As long as Trump and Musk put on a show of targeting the people that MAGA hates (minorities, immigrants, etc.) they don\u2019t actually care that they are being fleeced.",
