Oh, [because he nationalised oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalization_of_the_Iranian_oil_industry)...\n\nWhy did the US [support the Ba'ath party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan_Revolution#U.S._involvement) in Iraq and it's overthrow of the government of Iraq? Oh, because Abdul Karim Qasim [nationalised the oil industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_National_Oil_Company)...\n\nWhy did the US support the [overthrow of the Syrian government in 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1949_Syrian_coup_d'\u00e9tat)? Oh, because [the US wanted an oil pipeline built](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Arabian_Pipeline)...\n\nWhy did the US organise [a coup in Guatemala in 1954](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Guatemalan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)? Oh, because they were about to nationalise agricultural production and members of the US administration had private interests in the US company exploiting the land in Guatemala and paying no tax...\n\nOr the [coup against Allende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) in Chile in 1972, the capture and [murder of Patrice Lamumba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba#United_States_involvement) and installation of a brutal dictator in the Congo in 1961, or funding [right-wing militias in Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) through illegal arms sales to Iran in the 80s.\n\nIf you understand the US dialectically and not just on the surface-level, it's pretty self-evident that the US has really been the greatest force for evil in the world since the second world war.",
