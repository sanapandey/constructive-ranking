As an ex-muslim I wanna say that if the tables were turned and the strong side was Palastine you would be seeing a real genocide against Jewish people. It is in Quran. It is a prophecy that one day even trees will talk and say that 'Here there is a jewish here. Come and kill.'\n\nYou don't have to take sides. Both sides are religious fanatics who can't live in peace together. If you want to help and take sides, takes sides to end Abrahamic delusions in the middle east.",

Even arbitrary things like drivers vs cyclists have psychos and normal people. Unless the grouping factor itself is evil (like nazism) projecting the worst of a group onto the whole is the same mentality that's used to justify individualism and screwing people over. \n\nThe whole point of leftism is that you unify and stand for the people, which means all the people, even the ones you don't like.
