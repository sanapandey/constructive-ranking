    "selftext": "TBH, I find the discussion around the subversiveness of Kendrick Lamar's performance and its critique of the US so irritating and distracting. People with a minimum of media literacy are celebrating this as the ultimate act of defiance. As if KL is leading a march on Washington when in reality all our asses are getting bread-and-circus'ed 24/7...\n\nI wrote this somewhere else but feel it is relevant for the point I am trying to make:\n\nYou get an idea how broken and rigged the outlets for legitimate opposition are, when you have people cheering a millionaire artist hiding subversive messages in the biggest \"panem et circenses\" spectacles of late capitalism. \n\nThe venues of protest, the \"potentiality space\" for true alternatives to the current system is already so severely limited that even this form of protest is seen as \"biting attack on the status quo\". It is not. It is an impressive cultural Trojan horse inside the fortress of hegemonic culture. But it reeks of couch activism that gives people the impression that \"finally someone said something\" without anyone having to do actual serious thinking about how and when to organise actual resistance against ... yes, what exactly?!? \n\nAgainst Trump and Tech-bro fascist blitzing over a country where over half of the population lost the ability of critical thinking to even understand what is happening? Or against the continuous stifling of discourse over true alternatives of a system whose inherently violent commodification of fucking everything and the destruction of our planet on the name of financial gains, growth and comfort is leaving people cheering for even minor, ultimately meaningless feats of protest?\n\nActual organising of communities on a regional level, re-building connections and exchange that is not virtual (and thus not controlled by exactly the kind of people who are destroying the country), unionizing, intersectional solidarity, these are some of the true goals that should be on our agenda. \n\nSo question: Is this actually the pinnacle of actual protest that can currently be mustered in the US? People on social media congratulating themselves  for finding (not so) hidden messages in a Superbowl halftime show? Will this lwad to tangible results? Or is it just the meme of the day that will be forgotten in a week or two: entertainment/art, slightly sprinkled with legitimate concerns about the deeper underlying problems of the status quo?",

It's kind of like with Obama, people would go on and on about the symbolism of his victory rather than the actual facts of his administration.",

                    "body": "Agreed. It seems to be very American, although it's still a problem in Europe where I live. As an activist, in my experience it's really difficult to work with people coming from a symbolic, performative kind of activism, aka roaming on social medias arguing how some Netflix series actually saved feminism and insulting people disagreeing with them. When you work with them in real life, they are used to placate their own point of view on everything, because on social networks and in medias, you actually can cherrypick the contents going your way and you don't really have to make things work since you're only working with ideas anyway. As a result, they often split away, they spend significant chunks of time arguing even on irrelevant points, they underestimate the importance of organizing and they're satisfied with symbolic actions. I know many people start organizing partly because they've been moved by some symbolic event or fiction, and that's okay, but this whole obsession about performative activism is counterproductive, and as such I try to avoid speaking about it, even more to new activists, even though I'm knowledgeable about it.\n\nStill, I think it's important to be open about it, because if they're moved by symbolic actions, it means they've already started realizing something must be done. It can be the starting point for some activists, and our power is in number and organization, not in gatekeeping potential allies (not saying you are).",

He's literally doing what great artists do. He's getting people talking and thinking. That's the role of art in revolution, propaganda is a different beast so I'm not counting it. He could not have said more without repurcussions and right now he's more useful as a messenger than a political prisoner. He also laid out a whole blueprint of actions, specifically for the Black community that I won't be discussing in mixed company. AAVE is historically about doublespeak. It's how we managed over the centuries of living in an America that literally hates us so much they let this happen.",

Nothing else was ever going to be shown on that kind of platform.\n\nThere's a reason he kept saying *turn the TV off.* Was he saying it to Drake, who he thought might tune in, because he lost the diss war? Or was he telling the biggest American TV audience of the year that they need to stop hoping someone else will sacrifice themselves first, while they sit around on their couches wondering why nobody is doing anything, with no real intention of sacrificing their comfortable life to stand behind them?\n\nI guess we'll never know.",

The number of people who complained the protests last week were on a Wednesday when they had work was eye-opening. \n\nIt reminds me of the climate change discourse. Nobody wants their own life to change. They think someone else should do it. The government should pass legislation to impact 'the corporations', not understanding that a) any impact on 'the corporations' will be passed straight on to them as consumers anyway, and b) that they *have the power* to skip the middleman by just not consuming things they don't support, or consuming the things they do, until 'the corporation' is forced to change. As a very basic example the government didn't force companies to make or offer vegan milks, that came about entirely through consumer behavior; equally, no government is going to stop companies making plastic tat when everyone *keeps buying plastic tat.* \n\nIn exactly the same way, everyone seems to want 'the government' to step in, seemingly not realising that all the branches are being disintegrated and that the actual government does not agree with them. \n\nActual change requires understanding that some of your comfort might need to be sacrificed, but too few are willing to band together to make that sacrifice powerful enough. But even the tiniest sacrifices, like cancelling Amazon Prime and deleting Meta accounts, and not giving them your money and data, seems too far for most people.",

It's not like Kendrick Lamar can pass any laws, he's a cultural figure, and he used his platform to speak to the culture. I personally wished he'd been a bit more overt with his messaging, because I think what he did went over too many heads, but he presented a piece of distinctly black performance art laden with symbolism of rebellion in the middle of the largest televised spectacle in America every year, with Trump himself in attendance. At a time when a lot of people feel demoralized and overwhelmed, even performative protest can be uplifting. \n\nI think we need to get over this hatred for performative protests. They're not hurting the movement, they're a piece of it, and they can have a strong psychological impact on the people within the movement who need to see them. Obviously they shouldn't be the centerpiece of political resistence, but we'll never win without art to inspire us. Besides, I guarantee Kendrick's listens will spike this week, and much of his music is deeply politically conscious. New listeners being exposed to messaging which speaks to our causes is a net win for the movement. \n\nThere's a vein of leftist activism that dismisses art as being a lesser form of activism, discouraging those who use creative expression to voice their dissent. It's a foolish, self-defeating mindset. And yes, art is commodified in our society, so naturally profit is a part of most creative endeavors, especially at a scale and platform as large as this one. But labor is also commodified, and we wouldn't discourage people to leverage their labor to advance the movement through strikes or unionization, so that argument is specious.\n\nIf you didn't care for it, fine. But stop trying to tamp down any excitement within the movement this might generate, because we need that excitement to win.",

Now, again, while the performance can only ever be a performance, art still has a valuable role to play within the struggle for liberation from oppressive systems, even if art alone is not sufficient in terms of the organization required to provide meaningful alternatives to living under an oppressive system. \n\nWith that being said, everyone is free to interpret art as they choose, but I think that people who say stuff like \"he's just a rich guy pandering to rich people\" simply don't understand how personal the layers of social commentary and symbolism woven into the performance are to Kendrick. He has not forgotten his roots, and he used the half time show performance as an opportunity to say what he had to say in the way that I think was the most subversive that he was allowed to on that platform. \n\nThink about it this way. Has any other super bowl halftime show sparked so much debate? Symbolically representing the divisions that polarize American culture, society and politics under late stage capitalism doesn't magically solve those problems, but at the very least it gets people talking about them. I think that if you can't acknowledge the artistic feat involved in pulling that off, it's your loss.",

Black joy and excellence is absolutely a viable form of resistance. Further more, we need to not act like music and art isn't a huge part of revolution as well. It can't all be destruction. There must be creation but art is always devalued when it comes from black American hands. We have single handedly built every significant cultural aspect of America to have it stolen from us since time immemorial and the second we reclaim any of it, it's a problem.
