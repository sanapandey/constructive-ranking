They didnt do this out of a sense of morals, they did it to keep us compliant and ensure the value continued to be extracted from us.

Slavery was basically immoral laisee-faire capitalism to the extreme in regards to outright owning other humans to profitize off of what they produce and hoarde the profit for themselves. Capitalism in it's basic meaning is that private owners own the means of production, if humans are apart of that means of production, than the private owner (slave master) owns the slave outright because he produces the goods and services needed to generate a profit. The Surplus Value of that labor, which would be in a slave capitalistic system, all of the value extracted from that labor would go directly back into the pockets of the wealthy whom own you.\n\nModern US Capitalism is just a slightly deformed variant of that system to where instead of the private owner making all the proceeds, they just take 99% of the proceeds and leaves the poor with little or nothing at all while hoarding it for themselves. The imperial aspect to US capitalism and US corporations indulging in aquiring slave labor in Sub-Saharan Africa for  their resource mines and cheaper chinese labor to cut operational expenses and manufacturing costs prove this.\n\nIn addition, as a free labor reserve that prison systems serve to corporations, the United States needs a way to convince the public to accept lower minimum wages, via using immigrants for cheaper labor in addition to the slave labor inside the prison system as both a bargining chip to force the domestic citizen's labor to drive down it's asking price and as a way to cut costs.",
