    "selftext": "This is where I sleep tonight. Or rather, try to sleep. It's not working so well. \n\n\n\nYou see, I have a brain injury that makes it nearly impossible for me to work, and definitely impossible for me to find work that will get me off the streets. Also, because of the winter, all the shelters are filled. Even homeless people have the sense to come out of the cold. \n\n\n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to gather sympathy or soft beg. Not at all. Well, not unless someone can offer to change society to help me out. I usually get all I need out here with my writing. \n\n\n\nNo one does \"white flag shelter\" around here because, so they say, insurance companies don't like that shit. So, churches are being regulated out of, well, being churches. \n\n\n\nOur president just spent $15,000,000 to go to a football game and then left during halftime. Meanwhile, Meals on Wheels gets defunded. That's some real leadership right there. \n\n\n\nUp until Friday I had a spot deep in the woods with a nice cozy tent. I was out of sight and out of mind. Never once had any problems until the leaves fell from the trees and nature betrayed me. Then, the business nearby decided that people shouldn't have to see some bum living in the woods. So the local cops came by, and, well, you can guess what happened. \n\n\n\nThey were nice enough to give me a 15 minute window to gather my life together and get the hell out of there. As they stood by watching me frantically try to gather all I could carry a couple of them found it amusing to watch a sixty-one year old man with brain damage try and gather what was important to him and some laughs were had. \n\n\n\nThey did offer to take me to jail, which is privatized around here. Incarceration for profit. The absolute pinnacle of capitalism gone mad. \n\n\n\nWhat they don't seem to get is that they need people like me. They need us to be seen so that the factory workers have an incentive to show up. On time and ready to keep the machine fed. But it can't be fed enough. Glad to be of service to you, Master Musk. \n\n\n\nI'll round this up because my fingers are getting useless. Guess that's what I get for being a human fucking being. \n\n\n\nIt could be worse, though. The guy that had been next to me for two years had all his stuff just set on fire because they couldn't find him to let him know he was unsightly. \n\n\n\nI wonder if Tolsoy ever had that problem. Maybe they don't like me because I'm no longer a cog, my ball bearings seem to have slipped out. \n",

That's why you, or anyone else, should never get all pissed off or judgemental if someone out here doesn't take your food, or takes it then throws it away. Would you take food from a perfect stranger when even the cops are known to put shit on bread and give them to the homeless? Not to mention all the allergies today. I remember once that this guy in Wilmington would get like 50 Little Caesars pizzas and hand them out at the library every Friday. I stuffed myself like a damn python one day and a guy came up and asked me if I wanted a bag lunch he was handing out and I said \"no\" and I really thought we were going to come to blows. There are many reasons why someone would turn it down",
