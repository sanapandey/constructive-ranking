We have record low unionization in this country right now. Neoliberalism has destroyed the working class and the working class needs to stand up, together, again.\n\nBut my initial point is that workers forcing an economic blackout is going to be much more effective than individuals choosing to refuse to consume. A couple of workers at Visa or Mastercard causing an outage is much more effective than a couple thousand people choosing to not spend. A shipping container staying docked for a whole day is much more effective than a few thousand people refusing to shop at Best Buy that day and just buying what they were going to buy anyway the next day. Much fewer people involved for a much wider and more impactful message.\n\nShoppers don't run this country. The working class run this country. And they should use the most valuable asset they have as their weapon.\n\nLabor.",

I also support the UAW's call for a general strike (pending the release of their demands). They already support the expansion of demands from auto workers to the working class in general with demands like universal healthcare being on the table. Strike is scheduled for 2028.\n\nWhy 2028? Well, that gives workers everywhere time to save money, stock up on masks, blankets, canned food, etc - to prepare for an extended general strike. The strike is not one day. That doesn't create the economic hurt companies need to feel. It is a strike until demands are met. \n\nFamilies need time to prepare for that. Poor people don't make enough money. The UAW is growing their support fund to help families in need during the strike but that will only go so far. Spreading awareness of this to people is also very important - people need to know to prepare for a fight for our rights (again, pending the demands we see the UAW come out with). \n\nBut again - let me know what the goals of this economic blackout are. Very curious who is leading this effort. Is it a union or labor organization of some sort?",

An unorganized strike does not work.\n\nThe general strike called for by the UAW is scheduled for 2028.\n\n[https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/general-strike-2028-unions-labor-movement/](https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/general-strike-2028-unions-labor-movement/)\n\nI predict there will be a bunch of astroturf calls for a \"general strike\" with no real direction or demands in order to create frustration ahead of the real general strike in 2028 - but thats just my speculation and I'm not saying any of these current strikes are that. They're just directionless. \n\n>Operation Flex, BMTArts - organization. #MAFFA\n\nInformation I find on Operation Flex shows it to be an old FBI op.\n\n>[The present case involves a group of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d), dubbed \u201cOperation Flex,\u201d in which the FBI engaged a covert informant to help gather information on certain, unidentified individuals from 2006 to 2007.\u00a0](https://casetext.com/case/fazaga-v-fed-bureau-of-investigation-2)\n\nI'm sure you aren't referring to that - do you have a link to the organizations work?\n\nBMTArts? As in... the TikTok account? With 1400 followers? Not that, right? Gotta be something else. Help me find these organizations.",

Creating an easy way to gin up the will for action is to encourage smaller action and graduate up.\n\nSure, but if for 2 years you set up these low stakes no risk fights - and people win nothing time and time again - what are you really accomplishing? You're going to end up with a frustrated movement that loses steam. Which - as I said - is exactly the point.\n\nWe can disagree on how to get involved but we should at least agree on the intent for the protest.

Nor were they EVER single days. They were sustained movements until demands were met or dissent was destroyed, whichever came first. This is the same type of \"boycott\" that keeps going around the internet since before Facebook even and it always has the same tone-deaf ahistorical misunderstanding of revolutionary politics and basic organization structure that gets dismissed immediately by anyone with more money than Broke As Fuck. The poor, and ever marginally not poor, do this garbage boycott every day. It's called being fucking poor for 6 out of 7 days a week until a paycheck comes through.\n\nEnough with this internet boycott spam garbage already. Try again with a solidified plan of SUSTAINED action.",
