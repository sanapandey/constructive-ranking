In Canada the average would be 25,000 chickens.  This alone reduces the impact of bird flu on the system because if a farm becomes infected and the chickens have to be culled (standard practice is to cull all chickens on an infected farm), less chickens are lost, so the hit to the supply is less.  This is aside from our better bio security practices.",
