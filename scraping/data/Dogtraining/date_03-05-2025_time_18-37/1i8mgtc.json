    "selftext": "So all of a sudden my dog has started acting really anxious and restless whenever I\u2019m home. When I\u2019m not home I see him on the cameras and he\u2019s sleeping perfectly fine. \n\nWhen I\u2019m home he won\u2019t go to his bed or jump on the couch with me (which he loved to do), just stays on the floor. and he seems very jumpy and startles easily. At the same time he\u2019s being a velcro dog and follows me around everywhere - he doesn\u2019t get upset when I go to the bathroom or shower or close the door, he\u2019ll just lay down on the floor right outside the room, but if i get up from the couch to go to the kitchen he\u2019ll follow me. And he won\u2019t bother me at all when I\u2019m on the couch, he will lay on the floor and sleep but startles awake easily. He will jump on the couch or my bed and immediately jump off, then he\u2019ll pace around like he doesn\u2019t know what to do. He has also on two occasions had like a panic attack moment where he is pacing relentlessly and panting and won\u2019t settle down and doesn\u2019t relax no matter what we do. He won\u2019t even take treats (which is especially strange considering he\u2019s a very food motivated dog)\n\nI leave the house and check the cameras and he\u2019s sleeping in his bed and on the couch like normal, this strange behavior only seems to happen when I\u2019m home. My mom says it doesn\u2019t happen around her either. \n \nHe\u2019s 6 years old and I was his primary caregiver for his first two years, then I left for college for the last four years and would see him every other month or so, I moved back home six months ago and have been with him every day. He has been acting perfectly fine until maybe two weeks ago when he started acting strange all of a sudden. I have a very appointment later this week but figured I\u2019d ask here as well. The only recent stressors I can think of have been 1. he had a tail injury back in october until november, 2. i went away for vacation at the end of december and then again the second week of january, 3. on the first week of january my mom took him on a walk and he got into a fight with the neighbors dog.
