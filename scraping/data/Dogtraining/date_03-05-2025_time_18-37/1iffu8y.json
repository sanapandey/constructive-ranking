    "selftext": "I currently have 2 dogs (1 female who's 7 and spayed and an intact male who's 3). My father passed away suddenly last week and we took in his dog. His dog is an intact male that's about 1.5 to 2 years old. \n\nMy dad only had the dog for a couple weeks. With people the dog is great. He's sweet and pretty obedient. But the minute he sees my other dogs, particularly my other male (who is very timid, shy and not at all aggressive), dad's dog wants to really really go after him. And I mean aggressively. \n\nI'm in a wheelchair. So these slow walks in a neutral space are difficult as any of them could pull me out of the chair. We've been trying to slowly introduce them outside through a fence while on leashes, inside with multiple barriers between them, you name it. I even called the vet to ask about neutering and they said it likely wouldn't help. \n\nI don't know the history of dad's dog. He's a great dog outside of this interaction. I tried calling a couple professionals and was quoted $2400 to get help. As I'm having to pay for dads final expenses, I can't swing that right now. I want to keep this dog if I can. Right now there's no peace since we have to be at separate parts of the house with the dogs split up. I know his dog is grieving with me and I really don't want to have to send him off. \n\nAny advise would be greatly appreciated! ",
