    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nMy wife and I have a newborn baby and came home with him today. We have 2 dogs a Pom mix and a ACD. They were very excited to see us but our ACD was scared of the new baby and was showing signs of aggression (barking, ears up, nipping) and when we tried to introduce them he tried to bite the baby. He is currently out of the house and we are very nervous about the safety of our baby. My ACD is 3 years old and has always had issues with other dogs (reactive) but never bitten people or dogs, though there have a few times where he tried to. He is fairly well trained besides the reactivity, very good at the basics and is very sweet to us and other people. He is good about showing his discomfort before biting but today he just bit at the baby unprompted, like he was a rabbit or cat. We are worried about re-homing him before trying other methods to help him. \nWould a muzzle be appropriate to attempt to have them in the same room while either he\u2019s on a leash or kenneled? I have never muzzled him before and spent quite a bit of time trying to have him be more comfortable with other dogs to no success (I just didn\u2019t have the money for a trainer). My wife and I are pretty distraught about the idea of re-homing him, he is my first dog of my own and am very bonded with him. He has never tried to harm us or our other dog or friends and family. What are some reasonable steps to take? What can I expect? Thanks ",

                    "body": "Hello, I have read through the wiki regarding muzzles, how to use them appropriately and what types there are as well as aggression in general and the recommendations to help soothe that. When reading though the different articles I still want to know if a muzzle is a safe and appropriate option for a potentially aggressive dog towards my baby and wanted to hear the opinions of others who may have experience with it. I really would like to work with a trainer but I have been really tight on money and work full time with a newborn and a wife who is chronically ill. I also will be meeting with my vet tomorrow to discuss options with how to train and possibly re-homing as well as a check into how reactive he is. So far my vets have all really liked him and his temperament while at the vet and compliment him every time he\u2019s there about how well behaved he is. I just want opinions from others in this emotionally hard time for me. I hope you understand",

Please review the resources in the approval guide specific to kids and dogs, particularly the resources should discuss how you need baby gates and playpens up all over the house so that you *can* have that physical barrier separation between dog and baby at all times without having to confine the dog to a small crate.",

I guess I didn\u2019t clarify that in the post or the reply, I thought it was implied. All I\u2019m asking is if it is an option to use a muzzle to allow them to be in the same area or would it be near permanent separation. Also one of the links is dead",

                    "body": "You'd *hope* it was implied, but some of the questions we get here means it's always useful to clarify, just in case. \n\nIf it's the dogs and babies learning/babysafe dog training link that's broken, we just got told about that one the other day, no idea what happened to her site! In the meantime here's her older URL that has the pre-2011 blog posts still up. https://dogsandbabies.wordpress.com/  and here's the archive link for the latest version in December https://web.archive.org/web/20240721231733/https://babysafedogtraining.com/blog/ \n\nI would say the muzzle is definitely *valuable* but I would warn against its use in most situations purely due to complacency. A child can still be injured by a muzzled dog through a muzzle punch (getting hit with the head despite mouth closed and teeth not exposed), being scratched or stepped on, and the baby can still scare or hurt the dog by approaching or making contact, which would increase the bad feelings around baby that you're trying to diminish. So think of it as, yes, if I'm in a situation with no other barriers then a muzzle is definitely the barrier I want to use, but ideally I shouldn't be putting myself in that situation in the first place. Make sense?",

This would likely be with a basket muzzle on and with high value treats for being calm. But how you introduce the muzzle is really important (we were told it will be a 3 week process if done correctly) and how and when you introduce rewards will be important.\n\nThis is not a small problem and under no circumstances should you allow the dog to be near the baby without safeguards in place (a muzzle and direct supervision).",
