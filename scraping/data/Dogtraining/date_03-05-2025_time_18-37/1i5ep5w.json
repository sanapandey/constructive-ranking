Sit/down/left/right/touch are nice to throw in, but I get the best bang for my buck out of \"go to bed\" and \"come\" because he's crossing the whole room and back without me moving much.\n\nOutdoors though, there's no bed to go to. Best I have there is \"wait\" and cross the area myself then \"come\" but then I'm spending as much energy as he is. Suggestions? Ideally a command that is also actually useful in some way, and doesn't involve me taking a second bed out for every walk. Anyone have \"do laps\"? \ud83d\ude02 . I could go back to training fetch since he doesn't do it naturally, but it's been really start and stop with him. I can't imagine what else I'd send him to though, so maybe I should...",

Platform (4 paws up) might take extra confidence/spacial awareness, but same sorta process. \n\nI hold my pointer and middle finger in an \"A\" shape over/infront of what object I want her to Paws Up on, once she had it down pat on things closer to the ground I was able to move it to verticale objects. Having the hand signal is good because she can see what I want her to go on to.\n\nFor paws up, I tuck my thumb in and hold all four fingers facing down over/infront of the object. \n\nWith \"go\" in okay it'll look like: \n\n*Points to tree \"go\" \n*Changes hand positioning to A \"paws up!\" \n\nand she'll run over and put her paws up, and typically comes back. When I was first training for it I was trying to get her to only release on cue like her sit and down cues, but i dropped that. I will ask her to wait if I want a picture or something, but since I'm not working on duration right now sometimes that's tricky \ud83d\ude05",

I\u2019ve never had a issue with food motivation though. Some also use meal time as training time. I just use regular treats, sometimes apples or other dog-safe fruit/veggies, liver sausage for special rewards. One of them liked duck the most, the other doesn\u2019t care. I also don\u2019t like drowning them in treats. So treats are only for new or currently difficult/exhausting commands. I\u2019d rather build a relationship with them and work together, give them praise, play time or cuddles as a reward (depending on what they prefer and what fits the situation).",

It gives her a place that she knows is her own. \n\nAfter fetch, you can work on \"find _____.\"    Name some toys , ball, duck, knot, etc..  You can get scent sticks to help with this.  Then you can hide them in the house or the yard and tell her, \"find the duck,\" and watch her search the whole house to find it.  Scent work is very rewarding for some breeds.\n\nIf you have small kids, this is a great game.
