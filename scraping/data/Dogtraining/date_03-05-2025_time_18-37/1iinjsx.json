    "selftext": "Hi there.\nFirst off, I definitely haven\u2019t done a lot right with my dog, but I\u2019m trying now for the both of us to turn it around. \n\nI have a 1.5 year old rescue that via DNA testing is a chow/pit/gsd/lab (quite the mix right) but I love him truly.\n\nHe\u2019s the only dog in my house and we rescued him younger than he should have been away from his mom but that was the only option.\n\nHe has an absolutely incredible amount of energy- and I\u2019ve had a border collie. He walks atleast 3, 30-45 minute walks spread out every.single.day. I try to do scent work stuff at home he enjoys, I have enrichment toys, and I work from home. \n\nWell, the issue lies when he A. Gets the zoomies, B. Is playing fetch or someone in the house is excited, he gets so ramped up after a few minutes, he displays these signs I am struggling to decipher if it is overstimulation or aggression, and where to go from here:\n\n- stops waiting for his sit command for ball to be thrown\n- jumping and snapping at face \n- play bowing however also biting HARD.\n- seemingly play growling and high pitched barks, however only gets more energized when I say no, or try to disengage. I struggle to walk away without him jumping and biting my hands, back of my hair, calves, anything he can and HOLDING DOWN.\n- this flip happens suddenly and I can\u2019t understand why. Even when I don\u2019t freak out and remain calm he just gets more and more nuts when he enters this mode and it\u2019s scaring me. \n\nLastly building upon this- after events like a long walk, fetch, trip to a store, play date, 100% of the time he either comes home and naps like an angel OR is insanely destructive and acts more bored than ever. I\u2019m just lost on his mind right now and what I can do to keep him happy, and me safe.",
