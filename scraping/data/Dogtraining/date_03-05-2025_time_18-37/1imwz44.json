Feel free to post your fortnightly progress report, as well as any questions or tips you might have! We seek to provide a safe space to vent your frustrations as well, so feel free to express yourself.\n\nWe welcome both owners of dogs with separation anxiety and owners whose dogs have gotten better!\n\n**NEW TO SEPARATION ANXIETY?**\n\nNew to the subject of separation anxiety? A dog with separation anxiety is one who displays stress when the one or more family members leave. Separation anxiety can vary from light stress to separation panic but at the heart of the matter is distress.\n\n**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!\n\n***Resources***\n\n**Books**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Don't Leave Me!

            "body": "I really need a dose of hope that it\u2019s gonna get better with my dogs separation anxiety. I adopted what is most likely a 1 year old Aussiedoodle from a shelter just under two weeks ago, she was/is very even tempered and showed no signs of separation anxiety in the shelter. After bringing her home I realized she had some separation anxiety so I started reading and trying to train her, I took a week to work from home while working on her but now I need to get back to office and leave her alone but the longest I\u2019ve been able to leave her without her crashing out has been a hour. After that she gets destructive and today she destroyed my blinds and it looks like she may have left some of her own blood behind. I feel like I\u2019m doing everything I can, I take her on long walks and give her plenty of mental stimulation for when I\u2019m gone, she doesn\u2019t have much interest in toys in general, just lick mats and kongs. I\u2019m taking her to the vet tomorrow to get her checked and hopefully get some prescription for the anxiety but I\u2019m seriously losing my mind, I\u2019m so stressed about trying to train her correctly and I don\u2019t have the money to put her doggy daycare or have a sitter. Is there any hope for me and this dog?",

I love to hear that your situation was similar but has gotten better with time and that a few weeks really is nothing. I took her to the vet and we got some anxiety medication as well! It\u2019s only been 2 days but they\u2019ve been really helpful, she\u2019s not getting as riled up when we leave and I wish the crate was a good option bc I really would love for it to be a happy spot for her while we\u2019re gone but she does not find comfort in the crate no matter what we try. We\u2019ve still got the crate and she gets all her best treats in there so she doesn\u2019t hate it, she just hates being left alone/being unable to access the humans when they are around I think? It\u2019s still very scary and I\u2019ve got all sorts of little things to worry about but your dogs routine and mine sound very similar down to the frozen Kong treat so that gives me hope that time will set us right! I hope you and your dog continue to be happy together, thank you for all the advice",

She gets meds 2 hours before departing, and always gets a frozen food toy as I leave. Anything I will need to do to get ready to leave, I do as I get ready for the walk, so those potential anxiety cues are hidden in something she's excited about and anticipating in a good way.",

Now most days she sleeps and at worst she's a bit restless but she's not panicking. I can't say if your dog's SA is more or less severe than mine, but I think especially in the case of newly adopted dogs there can be noticeable improvement relatively quickly if you do the right things.",

            "body": "We adopted a young dog that was running thru the streets of Elizabeth NJ. He is, overall, a very friendly dog, considering he has been in 4 or 5 homes in 2 weeks. Shelters wouldn't not take him (capacity) and ASPCA wanted 500.00. \n\nHe is very good with women, but me (male) not so much. He is OBSESSED with my wife. Follows her everywhere thru the house. If I feed him and she walks away, he stops eating to follow her. Bathroom, showers, everything. \n\nYesterday she went to work and he began a 5-6 hour howl-a-thon. I can comfort him and get him to lay down on the couch after he tuckers himself out. When he wakes up, he continues to get his howl on. \n\nI've had dogs my whole life & trained since puppies, but this is a little bit of a different situation as it seems like the male figure in his life was not so kind. So, any advice would be helpful. These articles seem to be a lot of great info and will read them this afternoon. I should note that I'm currently working from home and have ample time to dedicate to the little guy. Here's a video of the lil guy.\n\nEDIT: While i have crate trained before with other dogs, this one was adopted quick and have not gotten into a crate. Frankly I'm worried about him potentially hurting himself. Again this was not a puppy that came from a warm foster home. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4x1lvmf",

            "body": "Hi there, 6 weeks into life with my snuggly Frenchie pup, 4.5 months old. We\u2019ve experienced some isolation distress behaviors, right from the start - he\u2019s totally fine as long as he has company, and shows no distress if I leave and he has a buddy. \n\nBut I\u2019m a single gal with a job, and I work from the office 2-3 days a week. I was home with him for the first 10 days, got him seeing his pen as his happy safe place, practiced leaving, and got a doggy door installed so he always has access to toilet when I\u2019m not home. He is doing great with toilet training! We do get some howls when I leave, but he settles fairly quickly (a few minutes or so) and stays settled til I return. He tends to howl when I shower/take the bin out, too. \n\nHowever, nighttime is a nightmare. I have to sneak out of the room, he howls when he realises I\u2019ve left (I\u2019m only 10 feet away in the bedroom, with the door open and he can hear me). Playpen in bedroom is not an option - it\u2019s carpeted. He howls every 2-3 hours for me. Settles upon my return to the living room, even if I don\u2019t let him out of the pen. He is rarely howling for toilet - when I let him out for toilet (and give him no attention), he often won\u2019t go. And I can\u2019t just let him howl in the night - apartment living, I wouldn\u2019t do that to my neighbors!\n\nI\u2019d love to hear happy stories about anyone who was in a similar position and had wins - no matter how small!",

            "body": "We have two German Pinschers, but originally planned just one. We got the first at 8 weeks old, and he would never calm down or relax in a crate. My daughter kept him while we were working, and continued to try to crate train him. He would bark, cry, howl and attack the sides the entire time he was in there, completely ignoring any special treats or toys put in with him. As he got to be a year old, we decided to try adding another dog, and with his breeder's advice found a 6 month old female that is distantly related to him. It was rough for a few days, but one day he suddenly stared at me for a few moments as if he had suddenly realized she wasn't going anywhere, then spent the rest of the day under the bed. When he came out, he was fine, and now they are inseparable, 2 and 3 years old. She has a much calmer temperament, and they play a lot. We can leave them all day to work, but when I can I pop in for a few minutes at lunchtime. We have cameras and a Furbo to alert of anything unusual, and can speak to them or throw a treat if needed.",
