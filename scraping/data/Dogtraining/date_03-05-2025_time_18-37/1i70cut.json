    "selftext": "My partner and I just adopted a young mixed breed dog (1 year old) last week. I'm working from my office 4 days a week and my partner works remotely, which means that most of the time, my partner's with our dog. He's learning to walk on leash and is doing great with potty training so far. At night, he sleeps behind a baby gate in his bed, which he hasn't had any issues with.\n\nThe thing is, whenever he's with my partner, he's calm and easily settles himself and sleeps. But the times when I've been at home on my own to care for him, he goes almost ballistic with energy and constantly cries and whines when I put him in his bed and close the baby gate to do some work. \n\nHe's been playing too rough with me the last few days, particularly when my partner isn't around. The first time, my partner took out the trash in our apartment, and I sat on the sofa to use my phone. He immediately sat next to me on the sofa, and began aggressively sniffing me. I pushed him back slightly to get some space, and then he immediately started pushing back and trying to nip my arms. I loudly said \"No\", and then got up from the sofa to disengage myself, to which he then got off the sofa and started jumping on me. I tried my best not to engage and ignore him, but if I'm being honest I was panicking quite a bit with the amount of energy and teeth coming at me. \n\nThis morning I was leaving for work with my partner and he went to use the toilet. I was on my knees petting him, and then he placed a paw on me. I took that to mean that he wanted some attention, and then continued petting him. Suddenly he started trying to nip at me, and even grabbed my jacket sleeve with his teeth and yanking. When I freed my sleeve, he began nipping at my ankles and arms. It was hard for me to not panic and stay calm, and it was even harder for me to leave/disengage when every move I made seemed like an invitation for him to continue playing. \n\nHe has never done this when my partner is around me, only when I'm alone with him. My partner also remarked that he hasn't heard our dog whine when they're together and out dog is behind the baby gate. Is there any reason why he only does it with me? What can I do about it? I love my dog but I'm starting to become quite scared of being alone with him and his rough play getting out of hand. ",
