    "selftext": "We have a one year old golden retriever that has been great up to this point, however in the past few weeks she has had these temper tantrums on walks (3/4 times each walk) when she would growl and lunge at my girlfriend and I, bite the leash and tug it, etc. She also does this sometimes in our apartment when it seems like she wants to play or she gets overly excited. When she does this we have been trying to disengage until she calms down or we put the leash around a tree/post until she calms, however it doesn't seem to be helping.\n\nWe take her for a walk in the morning (20-30 minutes), a short walk at lunch (10 minutes) and a walk in the late afternoon/evening (20-30 minutes). Throughout the day she has a mixture of bully sticks, kongs, and games (such as kibble in a tied up towel).\n\nWe live downtown in a relatively large city so we think that it may be overstimulation of sorts but we're not really sure. \n\nHas anyone else been in this situation before and what has helped with your dog?
