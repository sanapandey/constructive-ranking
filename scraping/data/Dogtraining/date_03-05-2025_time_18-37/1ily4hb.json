    "selftext": "Hi Reddit team,\n\nMy family of six adopted a two year old black lab rescue dog a month ago. He's been generally great. This is the problem: he's developed increasing aggression to only one family member: my nine year old daughter.\n\nIt started on Friday with just a short growl. But today it escalated into several incidents where he growled, barked and definitely got into an aggressive posture. \n\nHe doesn't do this to any other family member ever and didn't do this to the nine year old when he first arrived at my house.\n\nWe have had the nine year old give him treats to build a rapport and positive feeling, but it's clear something is now very wrong. He's 80 pounds, so it's very scary to everyone involved.\n\nWhat do we do?\n\nMy wife is beside herself and ready to send him back. We meet with a trainer in 11 days, but that could be too late.",
