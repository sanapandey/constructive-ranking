    "selftext": "Hi\n\nmy dog is 6ish and adopted 4months ago. At first he was eager to go for a walk anytime we wanted, but right now he is really hesitant to go in the afternoon and in the evening. Outside he\u2019s unresponsive and often stops Mid walk.  In the morning he\u2019s completely fine and goes without any hesitation. Problem started after fireworks on New Years Eve. We\u2019ve tried to reward leaving the house and random reward when he walks well but with no effect. There aren\u2019t any apparent triggers that would stress him during walks. Medically he's checked out and started antianxiety drugs 2 weeks ago with slight improvement. I\u2019m hoping for some advice",
