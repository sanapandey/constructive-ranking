    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nWe have a 7.5 month old intact male Goldendoodle puppy. He's 47 lbs and getting bigger. He's always been a hyper puppy but it's getting a problem as he grows bigger. One of our friends who we frequently hang out with has a 5 year old female Goldendoodle. She used to be able to play with him and even shut down his hyperactivity when he was younger. Now he's taller than her and whenever they are together she tries to run from him because he keeps trying to play rough with her, put his paws on her and even hump her. Obviously her parents are not happy with his behavior and we pull him aside for down time whenever that happens. But as soon as we take our eyes off him or let him out of the room again, he runs straight to her and starts the same shit all over again. He's intact because we are waiting for him to be a year old before we neuter him based on our vet's recommendation - he's going to be a big boy and looks like research is saying that it's good to wait at least that long for healthy joint development. \n\nIs there anything we can do other than what we are already doing? The other dog's parents were going to dog sit for us for a few weeks when we had to take a trip to see our family next month but now I'm concerned about leaving him with them - because of how he will misbehave and how he might be mistreated if he did. \n\nEdit: wanted to add that he's tried humping some other dogs while playing as well - both male and female, but he's more hyper for the females.",

We have tried rewarding him for sitting/down with us instead of trying to chase the other dog - he stays with us for a while, then realizes the treats are over or gets bored and tries going after her again",
