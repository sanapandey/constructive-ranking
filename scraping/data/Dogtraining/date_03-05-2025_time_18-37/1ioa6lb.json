    "selftext": "Okay so this situation is really unusual I think and I don\u2019t know how we \u201caccidentally trained her this\u201d but we have a 5 mo old border collie (female) who, whenever we ask her to come up onto the bed to sleep with us or just lay down she will absolutely freak out at our cat (and if the cat isn\u2019t there she will bark at his cat tree) she will bark, growl, run around, jump frantically at the cat tree whether he is in it or not, all just because we asked her to hop onto the bed. Now I\u2019ve tried using a different word several times like \u201ccome here\u201d \u201cup\u201d or even just when I pat the bed to signal her to come up it gets the same reaction. If I even say something in an uppity voice no matter what the word is, same reaction. I find it bizarre and I don\u2019t know how she learned this. I just want her to come up on the bed and sleep with us and I want a way to invite her to do so. She will usually eventually jump up and settle down but always this strange fit comes first. Any advice would be fantastic. ",

            "body": "Border collies are highly instinct driven dogs. They feel like they have a job to do, and if they aren't given one then they will make one up in their heads lol. Sounds like some confusion in your pup's mind as the BC instincts are kicking in. \n\nThey are hyper intune with their \"flock\" which in this case sounds like your cat, unless she is given anything else. She might think there is a certain routine at bedtime and when you tell her to get to bed her brain switches to \"work mode\" and is maybe trying to herd your cat to where she feels that it should be. But you aren't giving her any direction so it's just confusing for all.\n\nI highly, highly, recommend working on daily herding work with her (you don't need to do this with animals) so she can do her job and then learn to switch off too. BCs tend to be either in the job or not in the job. You should try to stick to giving commands only during training or games, as if you give her a command at bedtime she will switch into work mode",

BCs with proper breed temperament/drive are not ideal pets\u2014they have a relentless drive to work and need structured tasks to stay fulfilled. \n\nHer instinct to control or chase is likely natural, but she may display aggression if the cat either defends itself or triggers her prey drive by running. If you want to stop this behavior, she needs to learn impulse control and \u201cleave it\u201d before she self-rewards with the behavior. \n\nThis behavior is specific to the breed: Border Collies remain in \u201cwork mode\u201d at all times. To stay mentally satisfied, they need a dedicated outlet for their instincts. When not engaged in work, they must be contained\u2014free roaming is not an option until earned.  \n\nWithout structure and an appropriate outlet (such as a herding ball or flirt pole, which stimulates herding instincts\u2014fetch alone is not enough), they will create their own jobs, often in ways that become problematic.",
