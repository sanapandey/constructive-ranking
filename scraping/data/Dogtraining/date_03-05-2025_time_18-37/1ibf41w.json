We had many dogs growing up but my dad always trained them. \n\nI'm looking for advice in stopping the whining! IT IS ALLLLLLLLL THE TIME! Everytime she goes outside, everytime she's left alone for 5 seconds, everytime she's in her crate - I can't do anything! I haven't left the house in the month we've had her because she just whines and whines and howls and cries. \n\nPlease, help - I just want to shower in peace! Lol maybe do some groceries??? I can't handle the whining. It's excessive to say the least! ",

Go to a class, let her play with other puppies.",

You have a 3 month old dog and you expect to be able to do things? 3 months. That\u2019s a baby who needs pretty constant supervision. A few weeks ago (hopefully) that dog was with her mom and siblings. It is developmentally normal for puppies to use their voice to ask for comfort, help and seek out information. She is learning so much right now, make sure it\u2019s the right things! Like you are a safe person and what to expect from the world around her. \nWhile slowly teaching alone time in a positive way. Letting puppies \u201ccry it out\u201d or even waiting for quiet isn\u2019t necessary - but trying to ensure alone time is all safe and positive will lead to more lasting results. Good luck!!",

If you always return when she whines, then she learns that whining gets you back.\n\nIf she takes to training well, train sitting calmly in the same way that you would train anything else.",

            "body": "Your dog may have developed separation anxiety as well. Watch her on camera in your absence; if she looks on edge or outright panicked, you may need to desensitize her to being alone - a weeks-to-months-long process in which you gradually expose her to more and more alone time, often starting with just a second or two, or even just taking a few steps away toward a door or around a corner. \n\nSuch dogs are often also afraid of confinement (crates, pens, baby gates, closed doors, or anything else that prevents them from \"getting out\" to follow you). The most reliable way to improve this is to engage a veterinary behaviorist (not to be confused with an obedience trainer), but if cost is an issue, you can search the web for high-level tips on how to go about this. Desensitization meetings with the behaviorist are almost always done remotely (so don't worry about finding a local behaviorist) because physical presence from the behaviorist risks desensitizing your dog to the behaviorist's absence instead of yours; the desensitization has to be done by you and only you. A behaviorist may also supplement your dog with meds, at least for the duration of the training, if her anxiety threshold baseline is too low to practically work with, e.g. has zero tolerance for being left alone - like not even a second - or shows signs of being on edge any time you get up to walk out of the room, even without any pre-departure cues.\n\nIn any case, you must temporarily suspend absences so the dog is never left alone outside of the desensitization exercises you do. For this, most people will need to develop a robust social and/or professional network of local dog sitters, walkers, boarders, etc., to keep your dog company while you have to go out (grocery shopping, dinner with friends, work, etc.).",

They need roughly an hour of physical exercise and on top of that an hour of mental stimulus each day.  They are working dogs that need a job to do to be satisfied.   My German shepherds get like this if I have a bad work week and don't get to do enough mental stuff with them.",

He doesn't always accept that playtime is over and instead of sitting down and relaxing, he will pace around the house and whine. It's just going to take time for him to learn there's a time to play and there's a time to chill. We try to reinforce the chill with the word \"calm\" and keep to a consistent schedule so that our dog isn't left wondering what's next. \n\nBe patient and be consistent.",

Have treat or kibble ready at all time in your pocket or a holder around your waist, every quiet laying down moment gets them fed! You can measure out there meal and hand feed it so you aren't overfeeding them. But puppy socialization classes and constant training on what gets praises and attention. Don't talk to them when they are whining or they will think that's how you all communicate. That worked for my 1st doggy anyway, i always get compliments on how good he is except for the licking! People hate how much he licks them I'm still working on that! He is 3 now lol I had him since 10 weeks",
