He loooooves puzzle toys, but our little guy is literally a wreck it ralph with how quickly he shreds them to pieces lol. Does anyone have advice on hard to destruct toys for a smartie pants shepherd?\n\nNote: We have a million kongs and the wobbly kong that we fill with treats and kibble all the time already! ",

My 60lb bully/beagle mutt destroys literally every other toy we have ever tried. He gnawed a chunk of the large black pupsicle off in 20 minutes. He rips the skin off of all tennis balls (and eats them!). He\u2019s chewed literal holes in the XL Chuckit balls. He ate the handle off of a jolly ball. Edible chews get finished off like they are milk bones. He eats firewood. \n\nI (and my wallet) wish I would have accepted this fact sooner.",

I'm afraid some of my dogs have not been smart enough to figure out how to work it to get food out.  I have a couple of simpler balls for the dogs that are a little dense.  Once that gets too easy then I try the buster cube again.",

It comes with an ice tray that you can freeze different fillings in\u2014my go-to is pumpkin or coconut oil mixed with salmon oil and bone broth, some kibble filler and then either broccoli or blueberries for added texture. Mine has little holes on the side that you can stuff mini treats or kibble into, as they whittle down the freeze-pop they can roll it around to get the extra goodies that squeeze through the cracks. They weren\u2019t super interested in the frozen stuff at first but i would slather a little bit of dog peanut butter on top to get them going, now they know the deal.",
