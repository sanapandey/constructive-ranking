    "selftext": "Hi all,\nI\u2019m in desperate need of some help. \nMy boyfriend and I have an English bulldog who was 1 in September 2024. He\u2019s absolutely amazing with me, has the occasional play bite but mostly an extremely gentle boy. He has not been castrated. \nWith my partner however our dog will spend hours (literally the whole evening) when my boyfriend gets home from work basically jumping on him, barking at him, booping him and pretend biting at him. This makes my boyfriend very angry. He has hit our dog on several occasions, sometimes hard enough in the face that he shakes his head afterwards. I have told him not to do this several times and honestly I\u2019m contemplating rehoming our dog because I\u2019d rather he have a safe home than be in this situation. I love the dog more than my own life (I know probably not healthy) so I don\u2019t know how my already deteriorating mental health will cope but at least I know my boy will be ok.\nHow can I get our dog to stop this behaviour that annoys my partner so much? I haven\u2019t spoken to my partner since he hit our dog this evening. I want to scream and cry. I went straight into the other room with our dog to make sure he was ok and gave him fuss, attention and cuddles. I was so upset. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve told him not to hit him, to ignore him, put him in timeout, play with him etc. nothing seems to stop this behaviour and my partner doesn\u2019t seem as though he can change his ways either. Sometimes I just want to pack up mine and our dogs things and leave but I have nowhere to go, and apart from this he is a great guy, it\u2019s just this behaviour from our dog that\u2019s almost as if it flicks a switch in my boyfriends brain and he sees red. I don\u2019t know what to do\n",

            "body": "> dog is jumping, barking, booping, and pretend biting\n\nIs he crate trained?\n\nhave you worked through the [Relaxation Protocol](https://journeydogtraining.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ProtocolforRelaxation.pdf),\u00a0a 15-day training program in which a dog learns to stay in circumstances that gradually progress in difficulty.\u00a0\n\n> \u201cHe has hit our dog on several occasions.\u201d\n\nThis is a red flag.

You can use [this link](https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709) (you might have to use 500 miles as your search criteria), then request an online consult if they are not near.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes one session is sufficient. They are amazing (life changing) but they are expensive and there are few.",
