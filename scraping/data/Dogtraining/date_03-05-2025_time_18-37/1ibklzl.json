What is her reward for putting up with this? \n\nDifficult things are the basics done well with the 3Ds - distance, duration and distraction. Can you recall her instantly outside at distance with distractions? Do you have a stay for 10 mins out of sight with distractions?\n\nIf you want training ideas for pushing impulse control around food then you need to make it more dynamic. Throw out food which she is allowed to eat and then recall her from food on cue. \n\nSo, not that you should, but making this more difficult for the dog would involve leaving the room/house for 5 mins and coming back to see the dog still waiting as you left her.",

Working up to using meat/cheese/whatever, increasing distance, turning your back, leaving the room, clapping, etc. are good stepping stones. \n\nFor a more advanced trick you could try training her to switch focus. That involves training a cue to have the dog intensely fixate on the reward while it\u2019s on the ground or in your hand, and another cue to switch focus to watching you. Quite a bite of self control involved in staring at the reward while still having to listen for other cues. Sadly I don\u2019t have any tips for training this as I haven\u2019t tried it myself, but it\u2019s a common requirement for competition bitework sport dogs. Shouldn\u2019t be too hard to find videos.",
