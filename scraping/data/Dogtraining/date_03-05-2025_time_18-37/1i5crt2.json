    "selftext": "First time dog owner, got a stray puppy who grew into a large 30 kg dog (male). He is currently 10 months old. \n\nWe've done some basic training based on the online resources \u2013 he's very smart, extremely energetic (goes toe to toe with Jack Russels), and has a strong personality (stubborn). No domination-based trainings have worked for us, he simply resists and it triggers his aggression. What I found works best is positive reinforcement, repetition, and authoritative but empathetic approach.\n\nHe loves other dogs, but he is afraid of people. We don't have any specialized dog parks nearby, so we go for walks in a regular local park. Not so long ago, when I let him off leash to play with other dogs, he started to run off to passerbys, bark, and jump on them with his paws (no biting, just launching&barking). Of course, people are afraid of him \u2013 I completely understand them and take full responsibility for the created situations.\n\nOn leash, he used to bark on people as well \u2013 but we've made some progress in recent weeks, and he practically stopped doing that, so I felt hopeful (treats for calm behavior & very strong \"no\"-s have worked). But today the situation repeated \u2013 in a middle of our game (in the most desolate part of the park) he first launched to meet new dogs, and then, when recalled, launched &barked on a stranger, before finally returning \u2013 from my perspective it seemed like he was venting out his irritation. \n\nGenerally, I think, he is driven by a mix of curiosity and fear. He is not physically agressive (had some aggressive dogs launch at us \u2013 and he was always the one leaving with bites, the other dogs went scratch-free. He simply doesn't want to bite)\n\nHe struggles to contain impulses, and I basically don't know what to do once he is triggered by something, his emotions are very strong, he becomes frustrated easily. On leash, I can physically restrain him (even though I've got arthritis because of the strength of his pulls). He shows progress as he gets older, but I'm afraid that disruptive behavioral patterns might linger. Could you please recommend courses or trainings that might work, or share personal experience with similar dogs? Basically I don't know how to help him handle big emotions in a peaceful way.",

Keeping him on leash.\n\n> \u201cOn leash, I can physically restrain him (even though I've got arthritis because of the strength of his pulls).\u201d\n\nIf this dog\u2019s strength is causing you physical pain, if it were me, I would try a\u00a0therapist for my dog. Unfortunately, being a dog trainer or behaviorist requires no specific education, skills, nor certification so many people work as trainers but are completely unqualified.\u00a0\u00a0The gold standard in trainers are Veterinary Behaviorists who are board certified by the ACVB or CAAB. You can use [this link](https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709) (you might have to use 500 miles as your search criteria), then request an online consult if they are not near.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes one session is sufficient. They are amazing (life changing) but they are expensive and there are few.\u00a0\n\nYou could try desensitization and counter conditioning to triggers:\u00a0\u00a0https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/introduction-to-desensitization-and-counterconditioning. Here\u2019s a demonstration video (Diesel, barking & lunging at scooters):\u00a0\u00a0https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tdFK5rGbjJ0",
