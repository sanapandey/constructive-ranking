    "selftext": "Been 3 months of training at the park at home. Not much progress. I know he knows the cue because when he was younger he would readily drop anything for treats. Now he values toys much higher. At the park I bring two different throws led and alternate only throwing the second when he drops the first. Usually takes 45 seconds to 2 minutes for him to drop it. At home\u2026he kinda just stares at me.\n\nI feel like his goal in life is to hold as many tennis balls at once as he can ",

                            "body": "You might want to consider re-training the release with a brand new cue! Cues can get \"poisoned\" or stale if they are used repeatedly without being followed by the desired behaviour and reinforcement, or if they sometimes result in an undesirable consequence for the dog (dog drops ball, ball doesn't get thrown). Switch up your cue word and start practicing from scratch with lower value items and high value reinforcement. \n\nMy border collie mix Sally struggles with this too. She will not let go of her ball if I'm touching it. She'll drop it on the ground, and will grab it as soon as you reach for it. Honestly this seems to be a fun game for her, so I'm happy to engage with her in this way. When she's ready for me to throw it again, she'll let me pick it up. That said, I still want a solid release cue, even with a high value item. I found working with a flirt pole super helpful for this (along with using a new cue). It eliminates having to reach for the object. I reinforce with a scatter feed (tossing a small handful of treats on the ground), which gives me time to set up for another rep. \n\nSo at first, it looks like:\nDog chases & grabs object, stops moving -> release cue -> toss treats -> dog releases object -> human retrieves object while dog eats treats\n\nThen it becomes:\nChase & grab -> release cue -> dog releases object --> toss treats -> resume chase \n\nAnd eventually you can fade the treats and use the chase as reinforcement (although it is still great to include food reinforcers into your regular practice). \n\nThen once you have a reliable response to the new release cue, you start working with lower value objects and practicing a release to hand (or at your feet). \n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk lol hope this helps",

            "body": "So like everyone is saying, you need to amp up the contrast, in your dog's perception, between what he's holding and what you're offering him. The latter thing needs to be wayyyyyy more valuable to him, at first at least, or he has little motivation to engage in the trade. This could be food, toys, attention, or mixing and matching any of those, depending on what your dog likes. Of course, with attention, the absence of it means don't look at him, don't talk to him, don't even move in any kind of way that might intrigue him the slightest bit.\n\nDoes he like to play fetch? If so, he might give up the ball he's holding in the park more easily in hopes that you'll throw it again for him to fetch. Who plays fetch with a ball in the house? (Your dog knows the answer to that question, too.)\n\nI taught my dog \"leave it\" using kibble and chicken. I passed some chicken by his nose and then put some kibble out on the floor in the open, telling him to leave it. At the same time, I would bring the chicken into his smelling range, closed fist. If he ditched the kibble and touched my fist with the chicken, I'd click and give him the chicken. Now, on walks, leave it generally works by itself, but if the thing on the ground is pretty tempting, I may have to offer a few pieces of kibble to move on from whatever is on the ground before he tries to eat it.\n\nDrop it is more difficult to train with just food, I mean, what dog is willing to spit out something yummy already in his mouth? This I had to do with a toy and kibble. Same as leave it, but this time, he would get the kibble in my closed fist if he dropped the toy and touched my closed fist with the kibble in it.",

            "body": "So I can only judge off the clip, but the presentation is very awkward. He's possessing the toy and you're offering it with your hand, but he turns his head. Either he values his current toy more or he's thinking your hand = taking away something fun. I have a possessive GSD and here's some things I've done:\n\n1. Don't take the toy away. Play! You don't even have to trade. This requires you to have some level of dog play skills. I would use a tug toy rather than a ball to do this. Put the dog on a leash so he can't run off with the toy. While you have it, play with it. Swish it, drag it on the ground, make it look like \"prey\". Think of how a squirrel or a rabbit moves. When the dog shows interest and wants the toy, let him \"take\" it from you. Once the dog has the toy, try playing with him. Do light tugging - ALWAYS LET THE DOG WIN. You want the dog to feel empowered playing with you. Games aren't fun if you never win. Do a light tug and turn the other way to entice the dog to chase you. You can tug on the leash a little, call their name. Some dogs do better without the direct confrontation. When the dog is going to pass you, stick your hand at your side and grab the toy's handle and tug very slightly, then turn again and continue the \"chase.\" What you're building here is play and cooperation - the dog learns that you being involved with a toy is fun and exciting. He learns that your involvement doesn't have to equal him losing something, rather you are fun and a joy to play with! This helps with trading later on.\n\n2. When doing \"trades\" between two toys, make yours look fun rather than holding it in their face. In the instance of the ball, don't simply offer it. Play with it first. Bounce it on the ground, chase it, make a little noise (I usually go \"wowwwww look how cool this is, don't you want it?\"). It will feel a little silly at first but most dogs will become interested when they see you having a good time and want to investigate. Then when they're interested, you let them have it! Throw it and let them chase. While they're busy, grab the second and repeat.\n\n3. Practice \"drop\" with non valued items. Low value treats, low value toys. Give high value treats for dropping and trading. I would practice this extensively before incorporating it in your play. On the same token, do the same for trading and putting things in your hand. Train a pick up and a \"give\" command separately. I like to do this with a dog's leash or something that is easy for the dog to hold. Once they have the \"give\" command mastered with non-value objects, move to low value toys then up to high value. If they won't do it, either your criteria is too high or the dog is not understanding what you're asking.\n\nThere are a few tips. I hope they help. There are resources on playing with your dog online. I think youtube probably has some good videos.",

Like your ball is SOOO cool, so much cooler than his.\n\nBounce it around, throw it in the air and catch it. Chase it around. Focus on your game. This may spark his interest, like hey... What's Dad doing that's so fun?  You may need to play a little keep away to build drive to get the ball.\n\nIf he drops his ball to try and join in your game, mark and toss him the ball you were playing with.
