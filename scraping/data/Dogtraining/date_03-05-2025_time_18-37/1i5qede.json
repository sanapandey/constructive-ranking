    "selftext": "\\*Mods, delete is not allowed\\*\n\nThis post is for my fellow home business owners. I am in desperate need of some help. I was curious is there are any other dog trainers in this sub who are willing to share with me your business/insurance situation if you operate out of your home. Here is my situation:\n\nI am a CPDT-KA (Certified Professional Dog Trainer, Knowledge Assessed). I run a very small training business out of my home. I offer day training (4 dogs on sight during 9-5 business hours), private training (mostly in people's homes and/or public places like parks etc) and boarding (small time boarding, not a kennel operation). I have business insurance through Insurers of the Carolina's (they cater to dog training businesses) and my home insurance is with USAA. However, my home insurance recently found out about about the dog business and is dropping me.\n\nI know I am not the first person to operate this sort of business out of my home. But I am having a helluva time trying to find home insurance solutions because of the \"inherent risks\" and nature of the business. If anyone else is doing this sort of thing, my questions are:\n\n1.) What insurance company do you use? (home, business, are they separated?)\n\n2.) How is your business structured? (LLC, etc?)\n\n3.) Do you have commercial insurance?\n\n4.) Do you enforce breed restrictions?\n\n5.) Does your home insurance know about the business?\n\nAny information or advice would be incredibly appreciated. Thanks so much!",
