    "selftext": "I will he moving my parents dogs to live with me soon and I am confused on how to approach training both dogs at the same time for pretty much anything.\n\nTo be honest neither one of the dogs is impeccably trained on anything house manners other than walking on a leash. To live with me they will definitely need to be house trained.\n\nYou might suggest to have one in a crate while I work with the other one \u2026but they are not crate trained either so I just need ideas on where to start.\n\nMoving them will require flying them across the ocean so moving them one at a time is also not really an option",
