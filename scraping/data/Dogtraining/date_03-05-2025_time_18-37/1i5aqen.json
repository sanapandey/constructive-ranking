    "selftext": "We recently got a 3 month old Rottweiler and my 8 year old dog has snapped at him a few times when they were able to interact together. Occasionally they will be able to co exist however whenever the puppy tries to sniff the older one he starts growling. It has only been a 2 days. the older dog is very energetic and hates to be left out but he was fine when we had a dog older then him before.\nAny advice for how to get them better acclimated with each other",
