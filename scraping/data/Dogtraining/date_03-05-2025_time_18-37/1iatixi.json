    "selftext": "We have a 3 year old chihuahua pit (I didn't think it was possible) mix who absolutely loves to go to the park and play fetch. He's generally well trained in everything except when he's in the car and we're on the way to the park. At that point, he starts whining VERY loudly (like piercing our ears loud) out of excitement and starts popping his head out back and forth between the two rear windows. Some things we've tried to do to get him to be calm: \n\n- Getting him into the down position and giving the \"quiet\" command. He gets a treat after being quiet for about 3-5 seconds. Problem is he continues to whine right after as the car is moving.\n\n\n- Stopping the car (windows rolled up) and wait for him to settle down while on our way to the park. Sometimes we wait for as long as 5-10 minutes for him to quiet down. But once we move the car again (windows still up) he immediately starts whining out of excitement.\n\n\n- Same thing as the second point above but we emphasize this by driving around a parking lot until he can calm down (barely works).\n\n\nWe take him out occasionally to run errands with us (ie. Hardware store, friend's house, etc.), and he'll whine thinking that he's going to the park until he realizes he isn't.\n\nAny advice appreciated. We'd like to keep all training positive and won't be using any aversive methods.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Unfortunately, it doesn't work when we're in the way to the park in the sense that he'll take a deep breath but will continue to whine. We've also tried giving him a long walk before going to the park to get some exercise and sniffing in as the Reddit guide suggests, but we still get the same result.",
