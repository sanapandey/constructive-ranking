    "selftext": "\nMy girlfriend and I recently adopted a 6-month-old lab mix. I have been reading a lot and using Kikopup for the basis of training, to the best of my ability, but there are some things I'm still struggling with.\n\n1. Regarding \"Leave it,\" it does work in the sense that he stops what he's doing and pays attention to me. I will often give him a treat for complying and try to redirect him to a more desirable behavior. But what usually happens is, he gets his treat and then he goes right back to the undesirable behavior.\n\nFor example, if he is about to start chewing on a pillow, I will tell him \"Leave it,\" give him a treat, and direct him to a chew toy, and he'll just ignore the toy and go back to the pillow. This can happen several times in a row and at that point it just feels like I'm rewarding the undesired behavior. What am I missing? Do I just need to find better toys so he chooses them over pillows? He has plenty and he seems like he enjoys them most of the time.\n\n2. We have a small side yard and we take him out to use the bathroom regularly. He even signals us at the door when he needs to go, which is great. But he also will signal when he just wants to go outside and dig for stray cat poop. It gets to the point where he will signal to go out 5-10 times in an hour and only use the bathroom one time.\n\nSeems pretty simple to just not take him every time, but it seems like as soon as we ignore him one time, he relieves himself inside (on the pee pad, luckily). I've tried making bathroom breaks as boring as possible for him, by taking him straight to his bathroom spot and keeping him there for a few minutes. That seems to help somewhat but I am open to any other suggestions to avoid taking him out in this cold weather every 10 minutes.\n\n3. Recently he has started chewing his bed in his crate. He doesn't always do it but sometimes he will start chewing within 10 minutes of being crated. I don't want to remove his bed, but I can't correct the behavior if I'm not around when he does it. What can I do about this?",

I know it probably sounds overwhelming, but as someone who has raised many puppies, it is ultimately the easiest and most beneficial long-term. You don't need to hide your stuff forever, but just during the chewy puppy phase. Pick up pillows. Don't leave a bed in the crate - or find an alternate bedding g that he won't chew. My dogs have all gone through a 'no bedding' phase as youngsters and now have full access - it's temporary!\n\nFor the potty behavior, I'd suggest going out on a short leash, waiting 1- 2 minutes without any interaction (boring, like you said), then back inside to an activity or crate rest for a few minutes. I bet if he had something to keep him busy, outside will be less alluring.  If you can't devote the time to training or a play session or maybe a food puzzle, put him up for a nap or tether him to you. You'll need to be aware of potty signals still, but it may cut down on those false alarms.",

I would remove either him from the area or the thing causing the undesirable behavior when this happens, so he doesn't have the option to go back to it after the redirection and can focus on the thing you've redirected him to.\n\n\n2. Train him to go on a cue word (my dog's is \"go potty). You do this by waiting until he lifts his leg, say \"go potty,\" then praise/treat him for going once he's done. Do this every single time he goes. Once he has learned it and understands, you can start telling him to \"go potty\" once you're outside, and if he doesn't go within a minute, you take him back inside. When he does go, I would let him wander around/play for a bit, so he knows that going potty when you go out gets him playtime but going out when he doesn't have to potty is boring. Also, if possible, I would clean up any cat poop in the area you're taking him, if it's your yard, so he stops having that option.\n\n\n\n\n3. Puppies chew a lot. Does he have enough chew toys and is getting enough time to play with them? I've never had a puppy personally, but I stopped my adult dog's chewing on my stuff by redirecting and getting her more toys to chew on and giving her more crunchy and frozen treats. She gets a dental chew every night after dinner, which also helped a lot because she knows she gets to chew on something fun every single day and doesn't need to hunt for other items to chew on herself.",

Whenever pup got to be too much, I would crate him and give him a kong. Two birds, one stone. Would create a positive association with the crate, help numb his teeth/gums with the cold treat, and get him out of my hair for a while. Also taught him that he didn\u2019t have to be on top of me allll the time. I didn\u2019t introduce a bed in the crate until fully potty trained and at first only gave a folded towel.

Sorry!\n\n#1 Leave It should be immediately stopping the behavior and ignoring the item. \n\nYou seem to have started on high desirability items like the pillow. Start small with stuff he doesn't really care about (a leaf, etc.) Reward for immediate compliance then for longer times remaining focused on you. \n\nNext mid level stuff. Do not redirect to something new. Just focus on Leave It. \n\nFinally high level. \n\nIdeally, he should be ignoring it and waiting for your next command. Now you can redirect play by using the toy to reward instead of a treat if you'd like. Rewards need to be high level in desirability. For example, mine had a toy that drives me up the wall (squeaky to the max); he gets 10 minutes with that when I'm training to redirect behavior. \n\nWhen I first was directing towards appropriate chew toys, I built off my kennel training by hiding chew toys in the kennel. I said Leave it, then, after he was ignoring it, I said kennel. Now he had a great surprise he enjoyed chewing on way more than the pillow (or whatever I wanted him to leave alone).\n\nHe keeps his chew toys in the kennel and goes in there whenever he feels like chewing now.\n\n#2 This one is a challenge.\n\nI taught mine to pee on command. He waits by the door, we give him a moment to see if he loses interest or seems to really need to go, and then we go out. We do not say the \"walk\" word. Instead, he gets to go on the leash right to the potty spot and hears his potty command. We do not play. Instead we go all the way back in and remove the leash, settle down, and then he gets a walk or playtime. \n\nMaybe keeping playtime separate would be helpful for you.\n\n#3 Chewing the bed. \n\nMine only did that with boredom/anxiety. You can get a travel pad type crate mat. Mine doesn't chew that one while he likes to gnaw on the fluffy one (same stuffing at toys). I know the chew toys helped with that as well for mine. He loves chewing so very much.\n\nChew toys I like (people may disagree): \n\nPetstages Dog Chew Toy \n\nSPOT Dog Chew \n\nNylabone Chew Toy \n\nHe also loves antlers - you can decide your comfort level on those! I get him tiny ones, sometimes cut in half. \n\nHis highest value treat is cod treats or especially cod skin treats. The cost (and smell) make me withhold these bad boys for excellent behavior or an emergency distraction (like when paramedics needed to work on my hubby). \n\nGood luck!\n\nI got flagged for attaching links, so message me if you can't find something you'd like to look at.",

And also, I\u2019m aware it\u2019s quite possible that none of this will work for your pup \ud83d\ude05\n\n1) make sure you\u2019re actually getting his full attention. When you get it, keep it for a solid minute or even two.  Since he\u2019s young I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s got a lot of energy so if you can get him to calm down a little and maybe try to \u201cshow\u201d him the command by having him go through the action (if that makes sense). I think maybe right now he just thinks it means \u201cleave it for the one second it takes to get my treat\u201d. Also he might like the pillows because of an interesting smell? Even if it doesn\u2019t smell interesting to you, remember that he\u2019s still pretty new to the world and everything is INTERESTING \ud83d\ude02 \n\n2) does he go out off-leash? Do you stay with him or just kinda let him do his own thing? \n\n3) you could try putting some peanut butter (with peanuts being literally the only ingredient or dog-specific peanut butter) in a Kong then freezing it (so it lasts longer). Or swapping out the bed for something else when you\u2019re not around to keep an eye out.  It could also be a display of some separation anxiety. I had a dog who did this and ended up getting a soft mesh muzzle for him. After some time he learned that I was coming back and the chewing stopped. \n\nAgain, definitely not a pro here but just some rando with thoughts",

He chews his toys, gets no attention. But the pillow: that\u2019s a treat party for him! For puppies, having a slip lead on hand can be helpful(or leash); he chews pillow, you say leave it and take HIM away from pillow creating space and offering something else, if he thinks about going on pillow or back to it- be proactive; get ahead of him and tell him to not do it(not mean or yelling) but like hey plz don\u2019t do that lol. He should lose access when he is unsuccessful; so we can help set him up from success, we say leave it, toss a treat or do some training- commit to engagement so he doesn\u2019t run back to pillow. Throw the treat down the hall; pick it up and put it away!\n2) get rid of pee pad- he will think it\u2019s okay to potty inside; he knows to go outside now. Take him out, on lead, allow him 5 minutes to go; if he doesn\u2019t- put him in crate and go back outside in 15 minutes- when he goes then he can have access to the house. \n3) he sounds bored and smart, he\u2019s figuring out how to train you for engagement and fun! Which isn\u2019t a bad thing; but can be if we\u2019re always there to keep him busy and entertaining everything. Have fun with him everywhere; see where he has a harder time performing tricks and work in those areas- the yard , your room , the kitchen. \n4) take out the bed or give him a moose antler or yak chew in the crate- he\u2019s young and he\u2019s self soothing- totally fine, but the bed can be dangerous if swallowed. Sounds like he likes to chew on fabric ; and keep like 3 toys out at a time, he doesn\u2019t need to have access to everything all the time if he doesn\u2019t find them valuable: so rotate the toys weekly so they\u2019re fun for him and new.",

It takes about 2 minutes for dogs to \u201cforget\u201d the demanding from the time they stop demanding so keep that in mind.\n\nHe may be bored if he\u2019s constantly asking to go out..try a daily (or multiple times a day) enrichment  activity like a snuffle mat, Kong wobbler, or roll up some kibble in a sheet to travel, or use your old milk cartons/water bottles to mimic a wobbler.\n\nIs he crate trained?

Depending on what the puppy has learned so far, leave it maybe the wrong cue.  You may not have built the foundation for it to understand.  \n\nWhat skills has puppy accomplished so far?  \nAre you teaching before labeling?\nAre you using the marker, \"YES\" or clicker?\nHave you built a foundation?\n\nYou will notice I've only tackled one. And it's a long one. I will do the others.  Patience, patience! \nI appreciate that you're working on this with an older puppy. You are awesome for adopting!\n\n\n1.  \"Leave it\"  is One of the harder things to learn which is why it's something you should practice for the life of your dog.   The reason it's hard, is most the time not leaving it is self-rewarding.  (Just like counter surfing)\nThe fact that the two of you are struggling with it is not a surprise.  With a 6-month-old puppy who has never had to deal with self-control before, and is approaching adolescence, an age where they are happy to kind of give you the doggy finger and blow you off, this is a very difficult thing to learn. It will not generalize quickly. That means it won't easily transfer from the treat that's in your hand to something you drop on the floor, to something on the walk which you don't want it to touch, or a chair leg you don't want him to chew on. Just because you've taught the words does not mean it makes sense. Bear with me cuz this is a long one because once you teach the basics then you have to teach how to generalize.  I was always taught to use both a verbal and a hand sign. Which came in handy because I got laryngitis with my very first dog 40 years ago. I didn't know that hand signs were going to be so useful.  I don't know if we're allowed to post links or pictures so I'll do my best to describe hand signals for cues as I have learned them.  Some of them have been adopted or adapted from American sign language.  \n\n**As with any undesirable behavior the first thing you do is manage the behavior until you have taught something acceptable**  This means crates, gates, leashes, and supervision so that puppy is not able to do things that are not desirable.  This one is on you, not the puppy \n\n\nHave you done the groundwork before teaching leave it?  Because it's a more advanced skill and cue, you should be teaching focus and attention first.",

                            "body": "Focus ...\n\nThe very first thing you do is teach your dog its name. This is often done best on the leash or in a small space so that you are assured that the dog is going to respond to you right away. You simply say the dog's name and treat.  Repeat often.  This helps the dog develop a positive association with the name you have given it (I never kept the names my rescues came with just in case there was a negative association. They all learn their new names very quickly) \n\nNext is a game that for lack of a better name I called \" hold out\".  Again unleash, or in a small space so that your dog is paying attention. You put a treat in your hand, hold it down so that the dog can smell that you have a treat, then you hold your hand out straight to your side and wait. The normal behavior is for your dog to jump, bark, wine, maybe even paw at you to try to get you to give them the treat that you are \" holding out\".  What you wait for is the dog to stop the barking the jumping and the complaining and to look at you. It may just be for a brief second The dog makes eye connection.  Your timing is important here!!  As soon as the dog makes eye contact and wow that eye contact exists you must immediately say the word \"YES\" loud and clear, and reward.  Repeat often. \n\nOnce your dog is responding to its own name, and gets the idea that I contact and focus without barking and clawing and jumping gets good things then you can move on to leave it. \n\nLeave it:  for this you will need a bait item which is **not to be given**   imagine that that bait item is a pill that could harm your dog because it's a dose for a 200 lb human and it could kill him. Or it's sugarless gum with that xylitol stuff which is toxic! \n\nAnd you need a container with reward items which you will give for success.  I recommend that your bait item be something the dog wants, but not the same as the reward item.  For example a piece of cheese in your hand, but the container can be full of small bits of chicken.\n\nLike most cues you will teach the cue without labeling it first.  So do not use the words \"leave it\"  until your dog has learned to leave it. Only then can you add the cue. This works best if you're at the dog's nose level.  You're going to put a high value treat in your hand, close your hand, and hold it at the dog's nose level.  **Don't say anything**\nIf the puppy gets too rough you can say ouch and withdraw your hand, you can even stand up if you need to. If the puppy is way too rough, then this is not the right time to teach this. Try another time. \n\nBut a certain amount of pawing, or even nibbling or licking at your hand is normal. The puppy wants what's in your hand and doesn't know how to get it -yet.    \n\nIf you have taught \"hold out\" and your puppy was responding well to that particular game, this one should be easy.   Your puppy is likely to *eventually give you eye contact and sit back and wait for \"what the heck hooman!?\"   As soon as the puppy gives you eye contact and pulls back to a sit or down, you say \"YES\"!\"    REMEMBER    When you are teaching leave it, you are *never* going to reward with the forbidden / bait that is in your hand. You are going to keep whatever's in your hand and you're going to reward from your treat pouch, or your container. \n  Practice a lot!   \n\nEven on the first lesson, if you have built the foundation you should find your puppy within under a dozen tries will very quickly sit back and give you eye contact.  Once your dog is consistently sitting back and giving you eye contact without trying to get the bait item, now you can add the cue \" leave it \".  \n\nStep 2...  \nYou're going to start practicing with an open hand, present your hand with the bait item and you're going to say \"leave it\" loud and clearly!!  as soon as you put your hand out. It looks like you're offering a treat but you're giving the counter command to leave it. Your puppy should immediately sit back and give you focus and attention rather than trying to take the item out of your hand. (Of course if they do you can close your hand.).  Reward from your stash of goodies.   \n \nIf your puppy is frustrated with step two, please go back to step one and repeat it until you think they're ready to go forward again. \n\nStep 3\n\nIn steps one and two you had control over the \"pill\"  because it was in your hand.  In the next step you have to give up some control, and simulate a real world situation. Wear sturdy shoes or boots.  I also recommend doing this with a partner and put the dog on a leash so you have a little extra control in case the dog gets really anxious and tries to get whatever it is that you drop. You can use the same sort of treats you did before, different treats for reward than for the poison pill. You're going to drop the poison pill on the floor and you're going to use your foot to control whether the dog takes it or not.  As soon as you drop that item you're going to loud and clear say the words, \"LEAVE IT!\"  If the dog doesn't respond you have your foot, and or your partner with the leash to help reinforce not getting that poison pill item.  And of course if your dog pulls back immediately looks at you and sits or lies down, doesn't try to claw your foot , the \"YES\" and reward from your stash of goodies. \nThe hand sign i use for leave It looks like is closed fist then spread your fingers toward the floor like you're dropping something.  Initially you use The verbal at the same time you do the hand signal which should be *exaggerated to make it very clear. \nStep 4 . . . \nThis is harder because now you're going to start transferring the cue to non food.  I had a puppy with a thing for shoes. So the first thing I did was manage the shoes by taking them all up off the floor where he couldn't get to them. I pulled an old pair of shoes out as my bait shoe.   Some dogs have a thing for tissues or paper towels, or something else that's inappropriate. So you can use those as your bait item. Just as you did in step three you're going to set it up so it's controlled to teach first.",

Sorry but the first step is always management.  \n\nIt sounds like you're doing the right things what's missing is management.  If he has recently gone outside the toilet, and hasn't drunk a ton of water, you're pretty sure he does not have to pee but he is signaling that he does, it may be a time for him to spend a little down time in his crate instead with a safe chew.  If you notice that he cannot settle down and his crate that he choose for a couple of seconds and then he gets up and he starts whining, then maybe he's not fibbing and he really needs to go outside. So go to the crate, leash him up take him outside and give him the opportunity to pee or poo. If he does, party & praise. If he doesn't he goes right back in the crate.",
