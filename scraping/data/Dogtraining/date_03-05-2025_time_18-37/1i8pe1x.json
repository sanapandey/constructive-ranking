    "selftext": "My dog's name is Kira. She learned her name as a puppy and has always responded to it just fine, but today I noticed that if I call my other dog's name (Blaz) she also responds to that. He's older than her and has been around since we adopted her and she's never done this before. I'm extremely confused. Their names don't sound similar. Is she jealous or does she think she has two names? Does she think it's like a command?? Am I doing something wrong? How do I fix this?",
