    "selftext": "Is this impossible? We recently adopted a four year old female husky from a family member who had been used to having a doggy door to use the bathroom whenever she pleases, but our layout doesn\u2019t allow for that. We do let her out a lot but even so she will still pee like right in front of us. Is there anything we can do or is this too late ? ",

Do you actively reward her when she does pee outside? Considering the fact she used to be able to go whenever she wanted, she probably doesn\u2019t understand it just yet that she has to tell you whenever she needs to go outside. You could start by giving her a small treat when she puts her paw on you, immediately take her out, let her pee, and then reward her again.\n\nShe\u2019ll hopefully learn that: paw = reward = go outside = reward.\n\nEventually lay off the treats when she puts her paw on you (because you don\u2019t want her to think she\u2019ll get a treat whenever she does that, you\u2019ll end up with a paw on you all the time \ud83d\ude02).\n\nIt\u2019ll end up as: paw = go outside = reward.\n\nOnce she\u2019s properly used to that, you can stop with the treats altogether. Something I did personally, is connect a treat with a verbal reward. That way you can still give her some type of positive reinforcement by saying something without giving her treats all the time. My dog was potty trained after only a few weeks and is five years old now, and I still occasionally verbally reward her when she pees outside, more now than ever because we recently moved house.",

We also do kennel while we are out in an attempt to build bladder strength in case that was the issue? She has not messed in her kennel.\n\nBy recently I do mean three weeks ago and there are daily accidents happening in front of us. She does cue to us, \u2018come up and puts paw on lap\u2019 and then we let her out. But other times she will just pee in front of us.",
