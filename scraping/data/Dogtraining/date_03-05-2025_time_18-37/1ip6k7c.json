    "selftext": "I'm toilet training my 5 month old pup and a few days in its ok. Struggled to get him to potty outside but I've been crating him and he's started going outside the last few times.\n\nThe crating is working but only if he's always crated and I'm weary of keeping him in the crate all day so I let him out occasionally and this ALWAYS leads to accidents inside.\n\nTo remedy this I bought him a play pen about 3 times the size of his crate and put his food in it and bed thinking it should be ok but he just peed in the corner and even poo\u2019d on his bed so I'm out of ideas.\n\nHow can I keep going without locking him in the crate 24/7. The poor thing needs some freedom but I feel like it has a really negative affect on his potty training. \n\n",
