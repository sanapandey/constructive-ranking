    "selftext": "Please bear with me because this is long. I have two Chihuahua\u2019s one female (8) she\u2019s been spayed, one male (3) he\u2019s still in tact (neutering this month as he will not stop humping our female). Let me start by saying these two dogs are my absolute world, they\u2019re family. We got Missy when she was 5 so she already had learned behaviours from her previous home, they did not treat her nicely, she was stuck in a small crate with another chihuahua for most of the day. We got Obi as a puppy to give her some company. We also have house cats. \nSo firstly they don\u2019t get walks as often as they should and this is the purely my fault, I do have two slipped discs and anxiety but I really want to get them out every day as I know they need to burn off energy and have that enrichment, I do feel extremely guilty about this. Before my back went Missy would go out 3 times a day. \nWhen they\u2019re on walks it\u2019s not enjoyable, Obi (3) is very reactive to other dogs, he will bark excessively 95% of the time when passing them. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s scared or jealous that they\u2019re playing and wants to join. He\u2019s had interactions with dogs and the only time he\u2019s stopped barking at one was my partners mothers dog, we went on a \u201cpack walk\u201d and he even laid down next to the dog at the pub. He met the dog again a few months later and did the same, barked for a while then we did another walk and he was okay afterwards. We\u2019ve tried treat training, avoidance and distractions but no luck so now my partner has resorted to picking him up (he\u2019s very small so with him being reactive she\u2019s worried another dog may not like that). He is extremely intelligent and his recall is fantastic so I imagine it\u2019s something I\u2019m doing wrong. Missy is generally good on walks, she will try and sniff dogs whilst passing but most of the time we don\u2019t let her because as soon as they sniff her rear end she gets uncomfortable and hides between my legs. \nIn the house both dogs will bark excessively at any noise outside, they\u2019re guarding the house but this has become very frustrating and I don\u2019t have a clue how to handle this. Obi will stop when we tell him enough but Missy does not.\nSadly we used puppy pads for Obi from when he was young and up until a few months back he would use them. Missy has noticed this but instead of using the pad she wee\u2019s on the floor. He\u2019s now started marking on everything in the house so I\u2019m at a loss there too. \nLastly, Obi will not leave the cats alone, at first I thought it was cute and he liked them but I quickly noticed it was because he doesn\u2019t want them near us so he will lick them away. Two of them run away from him so he chases them, he\u2019s improving slightly and he will come straight to us when we say \u201cleave it\u201d but 5 minutes later he\u2019s back at it. Thankfully Missy just ignores them.\nAll of these behaviours are very likely our own doing but I would really like some help in trying to tackle them. I can\u2019t afford a dog trainer right now but I do hope to get them in training after April. Is there anything I can do until then to try and improve these behaviours? ",

It\u2019s not frequent and he can hold it, he does request to go outside when we\u2019re downstairs he will sit by the back door. The wee\u2019s are marking- we do not punish them if they poo/pee indoors \nAggression/fear (barking at dogs) Vet has confirmed there are no medical conditions and he shows no signs of pain\nSocialising- we\u2019ve tried since he was a pup, he barked then too, we\u2019ve tried treats, avoiding the dogs, we don\u2019t force him to meet them, we\u2019ve tried sitting at a distance and giving him treats when he looks at the dog and doesn\u2019t bark.\nChasing cats indoors- we use a baby gate to prevent him chasing, we use his recall, we also use \u201cleave it\u201d he listens but carries on again minutes later.",

They are also veterinarians so they would be attuned to any physical/medical issues/solutions, and they have a degree in dog psychology.\u00a0\u00a0Worth every penny.\u00a0\u00a0(These trainers are sometimes referred to as \u201cDiplomates.\u201d).\u00a0\n\nIf you go this route, I hope you will add an update.\u00a0\n\nBest of luck. \u00a0Please don\u2019t be hard on yourself. It idn\u2019t easy.\u00a0",
