    "selftext": "Hello. I hope that this fits the community guidelines, but I am not sure where else to ask. \n\nI am considering adopting a 9 month old retriever from a registered breeder who intended to use it as a show dog, but it didn't fit the mold well enough. My concern is that it hasn't been around kids, and that it currently lives with her littermate and a couple of other dogs. We have three young kids and no other dogs. \n\nIf I adopt this dog will I be welcoming a training disaster for life as the dog is socialized well with her brother, but not a human family? Or are these obstacles easily overcome with consistent training. The breeder seems to feel that there would be no serious issues beyond a bit of a training regression, but I feel like I could use some third party advice here. \n\nWould I be better off getting a puppy to start with a blank slate?\n\n",
