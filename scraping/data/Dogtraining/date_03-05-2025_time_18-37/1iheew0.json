    "selftext": "Before reading, I just wanna mention that the dog behavioralist said that it isn\u2019t separation anxiety cuz we\u2019re in the house (but sounds bs to me cuz she peed from distress, barks which she never does either, and cries and scratches the door to let her in)\n\nMe and my partner adopted a 5 year old dog from the shelter. She had been there since November and she was abandoned by her last owners who were alcoholics ( so probably not a good household). We\u2019ve had her since Saturday (so it\u2019s been 3 days) and we went out with a dog behaviorist who told us she\u2019s already really attached to us and we need to fix it before it becomes a big problem. So for context, the first night she slept outside in the living room and we slept in our bedroom with the door closed, everything was fine. Then the second night she slept with us on our bed  (we still were thinking if we should let her or not on bed so that night we let her) then after the walk with the behavioralist she recommended that our bedroom is off limits so she learns to be alone and not depend so much on us so we closed the door and she slept outside again. However, she would come every hour and a half crying and barking to let her in, which we didn\u2019t. And in the morning when we got out, we saw that she peed twice inside the apartment, something she hadn\u2019t done before so she was definitely stressed about sleeping alone. Now we\u2019re trying to make sure to keep her off the bedroom and try to avoid behaviors that will reinforce her being dependent on us. But I would like some tips on how to achieve this, especially with the fact that she wants to be around us all the time even when were home and if we\u2019re not, she barks and cries.",

It was NIGHT AND DAY. \n\nAt night he would trot over to our bedroom, stick his nose in to see where we were, but we would just tell him gently to go back to bed and he would turn around, reassured that we were still in the house, and go back to his room. He did this a few times throughout the night the first few days. Then that went down to once a night. Then after a while of routine he has become comfortable knowing that when we go to bed then we are in the bedroom, and he happily goes to his bed to sleep through the night. We can close our door fully now.\n\nOften the best way to help ease a dog's worries and anxiety is simply giving it freedom so it is within control to check on something if it is worried about it",

Instead of a crate I got baby gates for the bedroom and hallway so my pup could walk around independently in the living room and kitchen but the bedroom, hallway and bathroom were separated. My cat also could walk around the whole apartment because she could fit through the rods on the side. It was a great solution for us. But at night I still let my pup and cat sleep with me. My pup is now almost 2 and sometimes I still reward her for doing things independently and not following around. If I feel like she is starting to \"check\" me and always walks behind me I give her the command to go away to signal her that I don't like it when she is following me around all the time. But this happens really rarely.",

It\u2019s a dog you have had for three days! \n\nIf you actually look into attachment theory it says, a well attached dog becomes independent. Where an insecure attachment creates issues. So you should be working on your attachment, creating an attachment and security and trust and building a relationship. This will eventually lead to an independent dog. But first you have to build the relationship. \n\nThe dog is not to attached to you\u2026 it\u2019s going through a transition and is insecure. Tether training is often recommended. The dog is on a leash attached to you in the house. Where you go it goes. \n\nI foster, a lot of shelter dogs have separation anxiety. In my experience most do at first. They need stability, security and routine. They are often super Velcro dogs for a while until they realize they are safe. Forced independence doesn\u2019t help. Security and knowing you are there does. Soon they know you\u2019ll always be there and become more independent. \n\nDogs get very dis regulated at the shelter, constant barking, noise, people walking by, lights, little sleep, the inability to relax and rest. Little to no exercise. Weird eating schedule. It takes weeks for their nervous system to relax. \n\nMine always sleep kenneled in my room. Dogs are pack animals they enjoy sleeping in proximity to their pack, and being close enough for them to alert you if they need to go potty is also a plus.",

Unfortunately, in this unregulated industry anyone can call themselves one without necessarily having the credentials. Professionals can have different opinions of course, but separation anxiety isn\u2019t defined by specifically being out of the house - out of sight and in another room can also count. I don\u2019t mean to insinuate your behaviourist is a bad one, but it does seem like a strange call to make with classic symptoms being presented. \n\nProfessionally, I want to encourage you to take it slow. The Rule of 3 is a good one to go by; it typically takes three days for dogs to decompress, three weeks to settle into new routines, and three months before the dog realises this is their new home. Additionally, it can take up to a year to see a rescue dog\u2019s full personality. It does sound like your new dog is in the beginning stages of decompressing, and inconsistency of sleeping arrangements could be a factor here. \n\nTogether, you and your partner should decide on what sleeping arrangement works best for you and then stick to it! This will look different for everyone. My personal preference is that my dog sleeps in her crate, but crate training does take some time to stick. Introducing it properly goes a very long way, and it does have some natural benefits as dogs are a denning animal.",
