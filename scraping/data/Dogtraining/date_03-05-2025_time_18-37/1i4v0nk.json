    "selftext": "We adopted a 10 month old mixed puppy yesterday. She\u2019s drinking she ate human food only thing I could get her to eat( 2 small chunks of cheese and 2 chicken nugs) she has not peed or pooped (since she\u2019s been in my care since 11am) she shows no interest in even going out but will do when I put her leash out. She slept between me and hubby all night and is currently laying in bed with my husband who just walked her around the block by her self. We thought maybe she wasn\u2019t interested in going out with her two new brothers! I\u2019m at a loss when is it a concern when do I take her to the vet? Will she go when she needs to?? Should I be concerned? I talk to her so sweet tell her she\u2019s the prettiest girl mostly because she is! I\u2019ve tried treats I even have rewarded her for just going out with the boys and smelling even though she did nothing. I\u2019m just concerned I\u2019ve never adopted before and this is my first.
