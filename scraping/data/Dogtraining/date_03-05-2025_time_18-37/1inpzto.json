    "selftext": "Ever since my 8 month old has transitioned into his own room/crib at night my dog has been extremely anxious when he cries. If my son makes even a peep my dog is whining for my attention (which wakes us up all night). Once I go to open the door to his room, my dog will scratch at the door and run in ahead of me to sniff the baby through the crib. My dog is very normal around the baby at all other times even when baby cries outside of the room during the day. It seems to only happen at night when his door is closed. We tried to keep his door open but my dog still whines excessively when the baby cries causing him to fully wake and I also don\u2019t feel comfortable allowing him to be at face level with baby without supervision. What can we do to train him to stop? ",
