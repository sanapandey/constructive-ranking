    "selftext": "My wife and I adopted a havenese female last year. She was a breeding mama and had two litters before we adopted her. Since then she has taking a liking to my wife but was hesitant with me, a male. In order to help her to like me I have been the one feeding her and giving her high value treats. Despite this, she began to bark at me when I entered the room. We spoke with a trainer who said that I should start giving really high value treats every time I enter a room, placing the treat away from me as I enter the room. At first I did that but had her eat out of my hand but then switched to throwing the treat a few months later. Since then the behavior has gotten worse and now anytime I move in the house she will start barking and rush towards me and continue to bark to a point of getting hoarse. \n\nNow the thing is this ONLY happens when my wife is home. If she is gone my dog doesn\u2019t bark or do anything with me. If I try and take her for a walk she will run away even if I\u2019m slow and gentle and have treats. I\u2019m at wits end at what I should do. At the very least I want to be able to move around in my house and enter my house without her barking herself hoarse. ",

If she wants your company or anyone\u2019s company or attention that only happens when she remains calm.\u00a0\n\nMaybe switch - as hard as it can be - from focusing on barking to only focusing on when she is calm, that is when she gets treats teaching her this\u2026 this is what we want more of. This is what gets rewarded. Calmness.\u00a0",

She was already barking at this point and would continue barking after eating the treat (sometimes barking WHILE eating the treat). I thought this was rewarding her for barking and that\u2019s why the barking got worse. But she is still skittish around me. For the treat giving during calm moments, should the treat be given to her after she is done barking? Or whenever she is calm for a while?",
