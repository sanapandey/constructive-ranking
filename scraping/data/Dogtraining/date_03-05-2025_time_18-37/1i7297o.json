    "selftext": "My 10 month old pup has been sleeping in the crate for bed since he came home with us at 2 months old. He does great overnight, no whining or anything, until he knows we are awake and whines for us to take him out. Throughout the day he is out of the crate, but when we leave he goes in the crate and whines/barks the whole time. I know it\u2019s due to his separation anxiety, so would having him sleep with us in bed assist with that? I\u2019m not really sure if it would help or make things worse. Any advice is greatly appreciated! ",

Maybe crating and then being out of view will help? \n\nMake sure that the crate feels like a safe and relaxing place to be. Treats, some peanut butter (if that\u2019s okay) and some toys to help keep him preoccupied. You can even put a blanket on the crate (make sure to leave a side open for airflow) to make it feel like a little cave. \n\nOut of my experience, my pup usually does well in the crate while I\u2019m not there as she\u2019ll usually just fall asleep after she finishes her peanut butter and will play with her toys/treat ball if she wakes up. The trick is to give the peanut butter or treats and exit calmly and quietly while they\u2019re distracted.",

            "body": "If he's quiet and content in your presence but uncontrollably on edge, like showing continuous panic behavior, in your absence, it is either separation anxiety (if hyper-attached to a single individual) or isolation distress (cannot handle being alone). He might be ok at night because you are in the same room. Does he show panic behavior if someone other than you is in the room with him, but you are not? If so, it may be the former. Otherwise, it is the latter. Isolation distress is easier to work with because the dog is ok with anyone's presence; with true separation anxiety, you first have to work on desensitizing the dog to being with someone else other than you before you can start to work on being alone.\n\nIs he willing to go into his crate on his own, or do you have to push him into it? The reason I ask is that many dogs with either separation anxiety or isolation distress also develop confinement anxiety (an intolerance for anything that has physically impeded them from seeking their owner or any company) and won't go into a crate, or often hesitate at doorways, baby gates, or other thresholds where a physical barrier has separated him from his owner or any kind of company before.\n\nDogs (and their wolf ancestors) are naturally pack animals, and in the wild pretty much never exist alone. Like, not even to go the bathroom (hence why he might be so comfortable doing his business on a leash right in front of you). Being calm while alone in a strange house - in which you have to provide him access to water, food, and appropriate potty spots (outside) - 3 of his top 4 life needs - is a learned behavior. \n\nMost dogs figure this out on their own, even if not immediately. But about 15% of dogs struggle with it for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with how you interact with your dog when present. These dogs show complete panic when left alone - pacing, excessively drooling, whimpering, non-stop barking, especially of an elevated pitch (panic bark), involuntary peeing or pooping even if potty trained and they have just gone outside moments ago, desperate attempts to escape in a direction they last saw you leave - leading to crate/property damage and/or self-injury. These dogs need to be slowly - seconds at a time - shown that being alone is ok and you or someone else will always come back. For this, you will need the help of a veterinary behaviorist (not to be confused with an obedience trainer) and as many local dog sitters as you can load up into your contacts. This situation can be extremely stressful for both the dog and the owner, as the dog cannot be humanely left home alone beyond his panic threshold, which is often in the order of seconds to start. That is why engaging a behaviorist for an individualized plan and support is important. The dog sitters are necessary to have a backup to the backup to the backup, etc., to maximize the chances of someone being available anytime you need to go somewhere without the dog, as he risks regressing any time you leave him for longer than his panic threshold, even though you have to do things like grocery shopping, dinner with friends, or even work.\n\nGood luck!",

So we decided to gate off the kitchen and that has been working out but it was a process. We hope to soon leave her alone in the house to free roam, close the doors to different rooms, but she just needs to mature a little bit more about chewing things. Separation anxiety is a real thing so you have to do it slowly and leave them alone slowly , in longer increments each time. I think once they gain more self-confidence, they tend to be okay.

My experience has been dogs under two managed to find something they shouldn't and a crate is a good idea.  \n\nPutting the dog in bed with you is just going to increase the idea that unless they're with you, they cannot survive without you. If anything it will make separation anxiety worse.  Short periods of time in the crate while you are home would be a good idea. While you go to the bathroom, shower,  making dinner, watching television, while you're in the next room. And when I say short, I mean just a couple of minutes at first. ** And never ever make a big deal about reunions. \n\nAnd work on a place cue.  You can use a mat, or his bed, or towel. But just teach him that good things happen when he stays on his \"place\".  The place can be moved from room to room, or even taken to other environments.  Hopefully at some point you'll be able to walk away from him when he is on his place, and come back and he's still there. Don't rush it.

            "body": "I recently adopted a puppy (now 6 1/2 month old from a rescue/shelter). My little guy was found by law enforcement officers in deplorable conditions & needed to be sedated for his 1st grooming because he was so severely matted.  \n\nI have had dogs all my life.  This is the first time I have ever decided to crate a dog.  I am crating because the puppy is familiar with crates and for his safety.  He  weighs only 9.3 lbs.  I don\u2019t want him to injure himself in new surroundings.  I do allow him free range of the house during the day as long as he is supervised by a human.  When it\u2019s nighttime - he runs into his crate & happily puts himself to bed.  I simply just close the door on the crate.  I leave my pup in his crate in the morning until I am ready to put him in the yard or take him out for his walk to avoid any accidents inside the house.  We are still working on potty training issues.  \n\nSince adopting my poor little guy one month ago- he came to me with a double ear infection and a urinary tract infection which makes potty training a bit more challenging in addition to the brutally cold weather we have been experiencing.  \n\nI\u2019m happy to advise that my little pup is slowly adjusting & really coming into himself.  He is starting to display his personality & is a fierce & feisty puppy.  \n\nBest thing I ever did was continue with the crate & gave my pup his own little sleep buddy stuffed animal & blanket.  The sleep buddy and blanket are not toys- my pup only uses these for sleeping & is NEVER allowed to play with them outside of the crate.  Highly recommend implementing the use of these same. \nGood Luck \u2618\ufe0f",

            "body": "Yes, the pup should stay in the crate overnight. Having them sleep in your bed will only make the separation anxiety during the day worse. Eventually they'll grow out of it if you persevere. You don't want an adult dog with separation anxiety. Now that they're still a pup it's an easy fix.",
