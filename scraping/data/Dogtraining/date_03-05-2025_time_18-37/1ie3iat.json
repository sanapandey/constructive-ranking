    "selftext": "Okay, so I have a 5 month border collie pup, she loves playing fetch more than anything in the world, but it is very hard to get her to bring the ball all the way back, she usually brings it back about halfway and lays down with it at her feet, if I encourage her to come closer she will, but never all the way and when she gets as close as she\u2019s going to get and I encourage her more, she starts to bring it farther away instead of closer. Now, here is what I have tried based on some other people who have posted this, the waiting game. If I just wait without going to get it and throwing it, she will wait too for quite some time but eventually she will just lose interest and go do something else, so it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s that interested in figuring it out. The only method I have had some inkling of success with has been (it\u2019s weird but) if I lay down on my back, she will bring it much closer and sometimes even all the way but very rarely and inconsistently, like I can\u2019t tell what motivates her to bring it all the way. Even if I cheer her on and \u201cthrow a party\u201d with exciting movements and an excited voice she still only brings it halfway. It almost seems like she gets closer when I just sit there silently and don\u2019t look at her. Any advice is much appreciated! ",

            "body": "Here are a few ideas: \n\n1. Practice \\*very\\* short retrieves to start: Throw the ball just a few feet and then encourage her to come back to you. If she's successful, slowly build the distance. Practice this with a high value food treat like hotdog or boiled chicken and reinforce her with it for coming back to you\n\n2. Use two balls: You throw the first ball, she'll go get it. You still have the second ball, as she comes halfway back get her attention on the second ball by bouncing it or throwing it up in the air. Call her to you as you do this. She will likely either drop the first ball and come to you, or bring the first ball back to you. Then you can throw the second ball and pick up the first ball. \n\n3. Teach \"touch\" and \"Drop it/out\": Once you teach these two behaviors you can apply them to your game of fetch. Throw the ball, she'll go get it, ask her to touch, she'll come touch your hand with the ball, ask her to drop it, she'll drop the ball at your feet! \n\nLet me know if you try these ideas or have any questions about them!!",

            "body": "I have to say I think all the replies miss the mark here. \n1. Training fetch is best taught without a ball. You want something easy for the hold to hold in their mouth but that is intrinsically boring (doesn\u2019t move/squeek) so gundog dummies or doggie dumbbells. \n2. The behaviour you have is \u201ckeep away\u201d which you may have inadvertently taught by taking things from the dogs mouth (like a sock etc. that they liked holding but you didn\u2019t want them to have) and so they learn \u201cdon\u2019t let mum take the thing I like!\n3. You want to start by back chaining the release with a clicker. \n4. There are many many small incremental steps to complete before you start throwing the dummy. You build from the dummy on the ground and getting the dog to go out to pick it up and bring it back to you. For gundog training and formal obedience you then need to train the dog to hold the dummy until you cue a release. Even if you\u2019re just training a pet to fetch I think there\u2019s real value in terms of bonding with your dog in going the extra mile here and not just having the dog drop the dummy/ball/whatever at your feet. You have a collie and they want to work! \n5. All of the above is effectively taken from the course below which I can\u2019t recommend this highly enough. https://www.forcefreegundog.com/clicker-retrieve\n6. Skipping all of the above I\u2019d be surprised if you have a collie that doesn\u2019t like a game of tug. Can you play tug, ask for a release of the article to your hand and then throw the tug very slightly away (eg half a meter) and see if the dog naturally brings the tug toy back to you so the game can continue? If you do then maybe you can build on this and then start generalising it to other objects? It might be a shortcut to getting to where you want with the ball. To echo what another poster said tho do please limit the fetch with a collie. It can become obsessional esp if they don\u2019t have a varied set of stimuli and it\u2019s not great for their joints to repeat this exercise daily for many repetitions.",

It's best to use it as a training method to control impulse. First puppy needs to learn that sit means sit until you say something else. Then you can sit puppy down  throw the toy and only then send the to go get it. \n\nTo get the to bring it back to you is to teach them that it's worth it to give you the toy. So you start by playing with her and the toy, when she has it in her mouth you exchange  it for a treat. If that's works well you can start giving it a command like give or drop. \nThen you can start throwing but just a very short distance.  Remember the sitting first! \nIt's best to keep puppy on a leash for this. 1. to make sure she stays put and 2 if she doesn't come back you can give a little tuck on the leash, no pulling her back all the way,  that should be enough to make her come back and exchange for a treat. Now you can start adding a bit more distance. Once this works well you can start giving it a command like fetch.\n\nYou might want to look into dummy training, it's great for herding dogs.",

            "body": "Have you tried playing ball in the corner or a hallway with a door at the end? Only start with throwing the ball like a foot from you, and have her on a leash. Use the leash to guide her back to you, and then trade for a high value treat. The short distance is because this game is about lot of small reps of her getting the ball and then it goes to you. Ideally, you phase out treats and she learns to give you the ball so you can throw it again. \n\nWhen the basic steps are mastered, you increase the distance of the throw, and then you move out of the hallway/corner and start again at short distances in a new environment. You can look hip hallway fetch on YouTube to see examples in real time. It\u2019s a time honored tradition for retriever puppies. \n\nThe things that make it work are the enclosed area that doesn\u2019t allow them to run off in another direction while they\u2019re learning, and the leash to real them in for the finish until they pick up the habit and learn what you want. \n\nIt might also help to teach a separate game of just picking things up off the floor and handing them to you. That way, you put a word on giving you things that is a separate concept from fetch. This will help make it more clear to her that when are asking specifically to have an item placed in your hand. Say you\u2019re further along in fetch training, but she does get distracted and is now carrying the ball. You don\u2019t ask her to fetch again, you ask her to give you that. It\u2019s also just really useful to have your dog pick things up from the floor and give them to you. \n\nFinally, the laying down with it at her feet sounds like she wants to play a keep away game. You might try learning some tug games where sometimes when she \u201cwins\u201d you \u201ctry\u201d to get it from her and chase her around a little. Dogs love keep away. With a structured version, you can then teach her that she can play keep away until you actually ask her to give you the toy back. This way she can learn when it\u2019s okay to play keep away (during tug) and when it\u2019s not (with a sock).\n\nMy 13 month lab also loves this game where he lays with the ball like that and then rolls it towards me, and I kick it back to him. Or, he will take it to the top of the stairs and drop it down while I stand at the bottom, and I throw it back up to him. These are games he invented himself. I would not have thought to try and teach him those things. Oh, and he loves to hold on to this old soccer ball, or other large toys, while you try to kick it out of his mouth and push him around with your feet. He loves to feel like you want the thing he has and you can\u2019t get it. Having appropriate outlets for that has been useful.",

To the point where sometimes we would go to the park and I\u2019d only end up throwing the frisbee once in 30 minutes. But she learned pretty quickly to bring the frisbee back and sit down. Now I don\u2019t even have to tell her, she just comes back, sits in front of me, and spits the frisbee at me.",
