    "selftext": "1 female corgi 3yr. 1 female dutch shepard 5yr. Both spayed.  I can ussually feel the tension around me a second before they start fighting. Thankfully im a big guy and can overpower and seperate them but they have started getting territorial about the smallest things. Break them up and they are best friends after a cool down. Tried water sprayer, seperate eating areas and walking them together more. Corgi obviously wont win the fight but puffs up at the big dog when im between them. Both dogs submissive as soon as i seperate. Any suggestions welcome. ",
