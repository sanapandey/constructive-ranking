    "selftext": "I\u2019ve had my 2.5y/o dog (rescue) for about 9 months. Things have been going really well until about 2 weeks ago. He\u2019s started getting really shut down at home. He\u2019s doing great on walks, eating and drinking normally, playing with his known dog friends at the park, etc. But when we get home he shuts down. He\u2019s just lays in corners and closets, doesn\u2019t want to play, and barely wants treats.\n\nHe has been to a vet and they agree that what is going on is behavioral.\n\nI\u2019d love some advice on how re-engage with him or make him comfortable.\n\nI honestly don\u2019t even know what to do, I\u2019ve never had this happen with a dog before.",

Another time due to evening reflections in my eyewear.\u00a0\n\nOur dog recently was gifted a\u00a0Cycle Dog Ecolast 3-Play Dino which is meant to be stuffed with bones not peanut better and seems to hold her interest for longer than a kong.\u00a0",

            "body": "I\u2019m in a very similar position except I\u2019ve only had my terrier for four months. He\u2019s about 2+ years. I was told that at about three months his behavior would change so I suspect it\u2019s some of that. \n\nI\u2019ll say he\u2019s still affectionate when we\u2019re settling in for the night but he doesn\u2019t engage in play except for maybe a minute or so before losing interest. He also doesn\u2019t get interested in meals. Or walks \u2014 but with the freezing weather, I expect that. \n\nDoesn\u2019t help we\u2019re having problems with heat in the house so lying around under a blanket in a cooler room or in the sun through a window in a warmish room makes sense. And when the contractor came today he was jumping like the day I adopted him. So maybe I\u2019m just boring to him!\n\nBut I do wish I could help his mood \u2014 besides treats. Those never get old. If this is his normal speed after adjustment, that\u2019s okay. I just worry it\u2019s malaise. I\u2019d hate to wait until spring to test how much it may be cabin fever, by which time it may have long term effects on his mood.",
