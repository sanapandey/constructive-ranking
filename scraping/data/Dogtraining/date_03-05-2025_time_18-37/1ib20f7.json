    "selftext": "I got my dog about 3 months ago, and she\u2019s always had a weird thing where she stops and stares at strangers as they approach us on walks. She\u2019s certainly not unfriendly towards strangers, but she\u2019s always seemed apprehensive. In the past few days, though, she\u2019s developed a habit of barking and jumping away from well-meaning strangers who have asked to pet her, and it\u2019s embarrassing! It seems pretty clear to me that she\u2019s anxious around strangers, but the barking has to stop and I don\u2019t know what to do about it. The weird thing is, though, that she\u2019s always loved people with dogs. If we come across someone walking their dog, she\u2019ll go up to them, tail wagging, happy as can be. The barking has only happened with people who don\u2019t have dogs with them. Why??? The only thing I can think of is that she\u2019s in heat (I haven\u2019t been able to get her spayed, it\u2019s a long story so please no lectures about that because I know it\u2019s important and I\u2019ll do it when I\u2019m able to) and maybe hormonal changes are causing this sudden behavior change?? Please help!",
