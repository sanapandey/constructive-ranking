    "selftext": "Just a bit of background on her barking behavious: my dog barks at strangers when they come into the house but I think we are managing this well by educating new guests on what to do when they enter, redirecting etc. She does not bark, or often even acknowledge, other people when we are walking on busier trails. However, if we are on a quiet trail and we see someone she will bark at them, honestly this doesn't bother me too much (I'm a female and often hike alone) as long as I can assure her there is no threat and she stops barking imminently.\n\nThe problem I have and am really unsure how to manage is when she purposely approaches groups and barks at them. We live in BC and go camping a lot, mostly on crown land far up forest service roads. When we are out there we let her off-leash and she loves roaming around and never goes too far. Mostly we are alone but sometimes there are other groups near by. We continue to have her off-leash and she'll be fine wondering around close by but after a while she'll take herself over to the other group, stand around 5 meters away from them and bark at them (she never gets closer). Maybe she's bored? She normally knows they are there before approaching so it's not like she's startled by new people coming in. When this happens I go over to get her (she will not recall) and put her in our truck for time out. Am I doing the right thing? What more can I do? Why is she doing this? Boredem? Scared? Trying to establish a new territory?\n\nI would like to take her to my partners cottage as I know she would love to roam around on the large lot of land but I also know she will take herself off to the neighbours property and start barking at them. \n\nI appreciate any and all help! Thank you!!\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "If I had a dog that would\u00a0take herself off to the neighbor's property and start barking at them and\u00a0not recall,\u00a0I would keep her on a long lead.\u00a0\n\nI would also work on recall daily.\u00a0\n\nIt would be inconsiderate to have my dog on someone else\u2019s property, disturbing them.\u00a0\n\nOur trainer says:\n\nGet the best treats (meat, cheese, dried liver)\n\nDon\u2019t starve your dog but do practice when your pup is hungry, just before meals. Triple check to make sure (kibble + treats) that the pup isn\u2019t over fed.\u00a0\n\nStart easy (indoors, fewest distractions).\u00a0\n\nCombine calling (only once)\u00a0\u00a0with a body language signal (clap hands, slap your leg, etc). Dogs find signals/sounds/gestures easier than words.\n\nTurn and move away from your dog (as you call and do the gesture). Running away, for a dog, is like an invitation to come play. It makes it fun.\u00a0\n\nReact super excited when doggo comes:\u00a0\u00a0praise, rubs, play, dance, high pitched voice (it doesn\u2019t matter if the neighbors think you are crazy). It\u2019s like pooch just won the lottery. Over the top. Some owners make the mistake of patting/rubbing\u00a0\u00a0the dog\u2019s head as a way of saying \u201cGood boy\u201d but some dogs dislike that so they are less likely to come when called next time.\u00a0\n\nWhen you shift from indoors to outdoors use a long leash (attached to a halter not their collar) until they come 100% of the time.\u00a0\n\nNever call if they won\u2019t come. It\u2019s important not to practice/repeat them ignoring your calls. Hard to be consistent about this one. If she won\u2019t come on one call, she should be on a long leash.\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t call more than once.\u00a0\n\nIf your dog ignores you, don\u2019t up the reward to get them to come because this trains them not to come. If your dog ignores you, use the long line. End the training session and next time try it in an easier scenario (possibly indoors).\u00a0\n\nAvoid accidentally punishing your dog when it comes when called. For instance, if you call your dog to you but then do something to it that it doesn\u2019t like (give medicine, put a harness on, or a bath), then it\u2019s going to be very hesitant to come to you.\u00a0\u00a0During play sessions with other dogs, call your dog, after they come, then release to play (so they don\u2019t associate recall = leaving).\u00a0\n\nWhen it\u2019s urgent, don\u2019t get stern. Instead be cheerful and excited and turn to run away as you call. As if to say \u201ccome now and we\u2019ll have so much fun!!!\u201d (which works well) - rather than \u201cCome or else you are in **BIG TROUBLE** (which works less often).\u00a0\n\nPractice every single day, multiple times a day.\u00a0\nNever stop.\u00a0",

                    "body": "Thank you for this very in-depth comment, sooo many helpful tips! Looks like recall is the thing to work on rather than the barking itself. I always use the long-line when out walking and been doing a lot of what you\u2019ve already mentioned and will continue to do so. Definitely got lots more work to do on recalling with distractions. I think I\u2019ll start spending time each camping trip to do some recall training so she gets better at recalling in that environment too.\n\nJust to clarify we haven\u2019t been to the cottage yet and would keep her on-leash if we do. And when we are camping we confirm with the other group that they are okay with her being off-leash (they always are, everyone has there dogs off-leash), she spends a couple hours roaming around contentedly before she starts the barking of which she then remains in the truck/ on-leash for the rest of the night.",
