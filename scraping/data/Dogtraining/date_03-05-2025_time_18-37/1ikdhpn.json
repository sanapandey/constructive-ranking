    "selftext": "we recently rescued a pyrenees mixed with lab. she's a great dog - very sweet and very smart. she was totally fine to be alone the first week we got her, then we noticed the regression of her hating it. i've read a lot of subreddits with tips and tricks and obviously months of training. however i'm asking what makes the car and other room different than her being alone. at this point, we take her for errands with us and leave her in the car. she will cry for a minute then lay down and to be completely calm. as well, she lays in the other room without us totally calm. but once we're not around at home, she goes crazy. is there a science behind this?\nalso, it should be mentioned we have another dog in the home. we've tried separating them and leaving them together but she still gets uneasy. he is a very calm dog we can leave for hours and never experienced separation anxiety with him. he's basically the model dog compared to her. \nis there some way to utilize the car to train her out of this? is she just meant to be crazy forever? is it the other dog setting her off?

I think it may have to do with a previous learning history of someone always coming back in a short time /able to see their person. It\u2019s a bonus for you, that gives you some freedom! Training would involve you not leaving your dog alone longer than what they can handle. Sadly, most sep anx dogs *do not do well with confinement, especially in a crate* so tread lightly if you try that.",
