    "selftext": "Hello, we have a 1.5 year old male dachshund who knows the \"drop it\" command for food or items, in our language \"drop it\" is slang for \"disengage\" and friend's with dogs tell us they use \"drop it\" for both situations.\n\nI'm wondering if dogs have some kind of connection between the two commands and knowing how to \"drop\" would help him \"disengage\" or should we teach him \"disengage\" separately? \n\nThanks.",
