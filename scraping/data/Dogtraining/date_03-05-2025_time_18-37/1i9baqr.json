    "selftext": "for the last couple months my sister and i have been working to train my dog to ring the bells to go outside. however it seems we have stalled. \n\nThanos is 4 turning 5 and Mocha is 5 turning 6\n\nMy dog Thanos and i moved in with my sister and her dog Mocha. Mocha has been trained from a puppy to ring bells to go out. since moving in we have been working on getting thanos trained but we have only worked on it properly the last couple months.\n\nThanos already knows that when mocha rings the bells that means they get to go out. he knows how to ring the bells, and will do so when asked. however, that is about as far as we have progressed. when he wants to go out he continues to pace and whine, mostly at my sister, even when i am right next to the door. when he stands at the door we make him ring the bells, at first we gave lots of prompting. he does seem to be starting to make the connection that he must ring the bells before he gets to go out but whines and paces to have us watch him at the door and stand there for 20s waiting for him to decide to ring the bells.\n\n  \nas a side, he does respond to me, takes training, and commands from me but does seem to prefer my sister when he wants something, i believe this is is due to me being partially deaf making it hard for me to notice his whining, the bells i can hear well though\n\n  \nAny tips on progressing past this stage in training? \n\n  \n",
