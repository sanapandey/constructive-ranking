    "selftext": "My golden retriever puppy(5 months old) is growling and barking at me, my family and my second dog (shiba inu 6 years). My golden only just started to react ever since she's been living outside her pen where she used to eat her meals. My shiba is not reactive at all and doesn't finish his food usually, so once my golden finishes her food she sprints across the house to his food and licks up the rest, when my shiba goes anywhere near her,her reactions are more intense. \nThis is all really confusing because she's fine with eating treats next to my shiba, sharing toys and they play perfectly the only issue is her food aggression\n\nPlease give me advise!!!!",
