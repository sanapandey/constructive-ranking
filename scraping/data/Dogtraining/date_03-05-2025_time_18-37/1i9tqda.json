    "selftext": "I have a 11 year old Maltese dog. He is very loved and cared for. He's part of the family since day one. There are however a couple of problems. He has a pee pad in the apartment, which he knows to use, we also go for long walks every day, but he pees randomly on like 15 different places in order to just be naughty, and let me know he's upset fo some reason. I now have a crawling baby, and need help how to stop him from doing that,  and go just on the pad. Also another problem is that in recent years he's became aggressive.  Like if I want to pull something from his snout, or paw he would growl at me and he even bite my hand a few times. How do I make him allow me to help him when needed. He has cataract,  and barely sees, he has not been neutered. Grateful for any advice or guidelines.",

Let us know how it goes.

I think also it would be great if you read the book \u201cOther End of the Leash\u201d by McConnell.\u00a0\n\n>\u00a0if I want to pull something from his snout, or paw\u00a0\n\nKikopup has a good video on desentizing your dog to being handled.\u00a0",
