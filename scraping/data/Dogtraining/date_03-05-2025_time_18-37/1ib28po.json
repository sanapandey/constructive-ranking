    "selftext": "Our 4 year old shepherd/hound mix is a very smart guy. We basically never let him off leash around other dogs, not because of the dogs, but because of their humans. He has learned that most dog owners carry treats, and he goes straight for the fanny pack/pocket/treat bag, jumping on the person to get to the treats. Even if he\u2019s only ever stolen 1 treat, he remembers this, and tries to jump on dog owners whenever possible. \n\nHe\u2019s also extremely excitable when he sees a human he knows (other than my partner and I), and if off leash will run full speed and pin-ball off of them, nearly knocking them over.\n\n\nThe tricky thing is he never does this to me or my partner, and he never attempts it when on leash, even a long line. We carry treats all the time but he doesn\u2019t even consider trying to steal our treats or jumping on us. He\u2019s quite obedient on leash and has responded well to training and definitely knows what he\u2019s \u2019supposed\u2019 to do. But as soon as he\u2019s free of a leash he knows he can get away with it and takes the opportunity. His recall is ok, until there\u2019s a distraction (like a stranger who might have treats), then he completely ignores us\u2026\n\nWe have some really nice off leash areas around where we live and he\u2019s great with other dogs so it would be so nice to be able to let him play without worrying that he\u2019s gonna knock someone over\u2026 any advice? \n\n\n",

It\u2019s translating this behaviour to off leash that we have had no success with, as our dog seems to be very aware when he\u2019s on leash vs off and behaves very differently",

It will be easier to work up to it vs just having a 6 foot leash either off or on.\n\nThese kinds of things are *so* hard to train, because it's being rewarded by a stranger's reactions, which you have no control over.  My dog is the exact same, where he knows he can get away with more with strangers.  You really need willing participants outside your immediate family to work with you. \n\nI would also work on having your dog look to you to be released before being allowed to greet anyone.  It might remind him that you control greetings, not him, and allow that control to carry over once he's not physically leashed.",

It's very difficult to discourage unless everyone your dog meets is willing to assist in rebuffing the jumping and demanding a sit.  If you have a bunch of trusted friends or family who are willing to help out, teach them what to do.  And recommend they wear heavy coat he can't scratch up. \n\n  The person/people he's jumping on should not give any attention.   Don't talk, absolutely no hands, turn and step toward him at the same time to rebuff the jumping.    If he is as persistent as you say his target/targets will have to rebuff him physically several times without using their hands, no eye contact, no vocal and wait him out.  \n\n Eventually he will stop jumping because it's not productive, and it's tiring. \n\n Once he stops jumping on people, they can call him over and *before he gets all the way to them they ask for a \"SIT!\".  There's a good chance the first time he'll fail and he'll jump again.   \n\nIf he manages to approach someone, not jump on them, and sit in front of them, that person should immediately say, \"YES\" loud and clear, and reward him with a treat.   \n\nDo this as a round robin.  Each person calling him over, asking for a sit. If he's successful they say, \"YES\" and treat.  \n\nSince this behavior has been reinforced many times in the past, this will be a challenge for him. \n\nAnother part of this is building up his patience and self-control.  You can do this by teaching a PLACE cue, and do prolonged down stay on his \"place\"",

Everyone the dog attempts to jump on must ignore him - don't look at, talk to, or otherwise interact with the dog other than a firm \"sit.\"\n\nI make my dog sit during walks whenever passing a person/people who get his attention, even for a moment, or when a person with a dog is approaching, even across the street. On walks, he responds well to pieces of kibble, so I keep them coming to keep him sitting when needed. I also do this at corners with street crossings while waiting for a gap in traffic to cross the street. Even once the dog seems to have gotten it, it's still great reactivity practice.",

By then, the uncontrolled enthusiasm has worn off enough for her to regain her manners.\n\nAs for the treat pickpocketing, have them sit and stay when encountering new people, using positive reinforcement like treats and praise when they remain calm.  You may have to enlist people you know  with decoy fanny packs  to do this.  That's a tough one.  Someone else might have a better idea.\n\nPersonally,  I dislike common dog areas because there are too many downsides.",

That turned into her getting extra treats for being \"so polite\" when we went to any dog-centric places with treat booths and whatnot. \n\nI agree with others to use people pre-prepped for training for this. No attention, turn their back to kind of get dog off, etc. once dog settles down gets lots of praise and attention. I usually use friends for training but I've even heard of people hiring dog walkers and such to help train and I think I'll be doing that with my dog soon for her reactivity issues. Basically you meet up with the walker in advance to go through the plan (and make sure they're ok with it before booking!), give them whatever treats to use. And then they're a \"random stranger\" you come across while walking",

It sounds like he\u2019s figured out that off-leash means he can get away with stuff, especially when treats are involved.\n\nI\u2019d focus on recall training in low-distraction spots first, using really high-value rewards like chicken or his favorite toy, and maybe keep him on a long line until it\u2019s solid. Teaching \u201cleave it\u201d and rewarding calm behavior around people with treats could also help. Maybe practice with friends acting as \u201cstrangers\u201d so he learns to generalize the behavior.\n\nIt\u2019s great that he listens to you on leash ... it shows he knows what\u2019s expected. With consistency and practice in controlled situations, I bet he\u2019ll figure it out! Good luck!",
