    "selftext": "I have a 2-year-old cavalier who has become reactive to unfamiliar dogs after having multiple bad experiences. At first he only reacted to dogs that he has negative experiences with, but over time this escalated to reacting to dogs of same or similar breeds and now he reacts to all unfamiliar dogs.\nHe is still amazing with dogs he knows well and has a large circle of dog friends. In those settings he behaves like typical cavalier-friendly, cuddly and a bit timid. He actually won\u2019t even correct other dogs for rough play, mounting or other inappropriate behavior. He just cowers and waits for me to step in. \nHowever, as soon as he spots unfamiliar dog his demeanor changes completely-he is lunging, growling/snarling and barking really aggressively. He tends to react more strongly to dogs that focus on him or try to engage. It\u2019s been really hard to find good trainer in my area but we are finally starting in-person sessions with force-free trainer soon. \nFor now, I\u2019ve been focusing on keeping him under treshold and feeding high value treats when he looks at the dog but doesn\u2019t react or when he disengages. He is making some progress, but it really feels like it\u2019s one step forward and  two steps back. \nIf anyone has dealt with a similar issue I\u2019d love some advice. Is there anything more I can do to help him? I know I messed up and I feel awful for it.",
