    "selftext": "**\\*\\*\\*THIS FIRST BIT IS BACK STORY, I WILL HAVE BULLET POINTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MAIN THINGS I NEED HELP WITH\\*\\*\\***  \nSo pretty much I'm still in high school, and my parent wants to get rid of my dog we have had since he was a baby because recently he has been having accidents and today specifically he pooped and peed inside the kitchen. He is a 6 years old  toy poodle who is honestly not very well trained. He knows to go to the bathroom outside (clearly not fully) and thats about it. My parent told me that their friend would be willing to take him in about a month, and said the only way I can stop it is if I train him to be better. This dog has gotten me through many tough times and I love him, so I'm going to try my best to make sure he's at least more well behaved by the end of the month.\n\nHere is the list of things I want to teach  \n\\- He already knows potty training, but to **engrain in him more not to go to the bathroom inside** (about an even split on traits from a bored dog and an anxious dog so I'm not sure what to go off of).  \n\\- **Have him listen,** He doesn't stay off furniture or out of the kitchen no matter how many times we tell him  \n\\- **Useful resources to research more on these subjects**\n\nAfter going through the guide a good chunk of my questions have been answered but I still have a couple\n\nI'm willing to go above and beyond to remedy the lack of training we have done. Thank you to anyone who can help, it means a lot!",
