    "selftext": "We have a 7 month old golden retriever who\u2019s very energetic and are undecided if we should hire a dog trainer. The reason we would want a dog trainer is for basic obedience training as he tends to run through the house, jump on our son or other people when walking. Before we go that route I wanted to ask this group if hiring a trainer is the route to go or if we should just ride it out as he\u2019s still  a puppy and will get better with time. ",

I\u2019d suggest searching https://iaabc.org for a certified trainer in your area. Establishing a relationship with someone you\u2019d have access to later if issues come up is important, and it\u2019ll prevent you from making a lot of mistakes as he grows up.\n\nGood luck to you!",
