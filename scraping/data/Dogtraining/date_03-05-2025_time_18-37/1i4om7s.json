    "selftext": "Our almost 2 year old Chihuahua dachshund mix was trained to pee on pads inside...well, she continually pees and poops off the pads, yo the point the urine has ruined my hardwood laminate floors and all the rugs in our house. I feel like is why we are always sick.\n\nAlong with this, she also barks at anyone that's not our family. This is true if someone stays a few days with us even, she will bark and don't let anyone touch her. Never shown aggression but just annoying barking. \n\nWe are planning a week long vacation in October and have no clue what we will do with the dog during that time. \n\nAt this point I feel it's too late to properly train her. I don't know what to do. Rehoming isn't an option she would not be taken by anyone. \n\nAnh tips would be appreciated.",

We give house guests treats to encourage her to come to them and stop barking, but she just takes it and runs. \n\nAs far as peeing and pooping in house, we crate her when not home for a few hrs at a time. We change pads frequently. \n\nFor dog boarding I've reached out to a few by email but no one's interested in keeping her breed.",
