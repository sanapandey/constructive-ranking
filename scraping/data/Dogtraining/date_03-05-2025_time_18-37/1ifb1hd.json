    "selftext": "In September, we adopted a \u201clab\u201d mix rescue (10 month old   old at the time) and we\u2019ve gone through 16 weeks of training:sit, stay, bed, leave it, come (though she\u2019s hit or miss at recall).  During training sessions, she\u2019s really responsive and has good impulse control, doesn\u2019t pull on the leash, responsive to turning when she gets to far ahead etc. in the house too, she follows commands pretty well. We\u2019re struggling with getting outside and being outside; specifically not bolting when we leave the house and not pulling on the leash . \n\nShe used to bolt outside of the house whenever we came home or left and have to go chasing her but we\u2019ve finally been able to curb that by telling her to sit and only open the door as long as she\u2019s sitting and we will walk out first and we\u2019ll give her the \u201ccome\u201d command and she\u2019ll be fine (this is all on a leash btw). But when we do the same thing for her to go in our backyard I can barely open the door before she tries to bolt outside.  loose leash training has been an challenge, in that she constantly pulls despite stopping, using the call command, and/or turning. Tried the gentle leader, she still pulled so hard that she was getting marks on her face. Vests haven\u2019t helped in the past either.  I think one main problem is she is reactive to squirrels/birds and there\u2019s a lot of them, front yard, backyard, and neighborhood. \n\nBasically just looking for some advice on loose leash walking and trying to instill some impulse control so she doesn\u2019t bolt outside the door and listens to commands outside? We\u2019re expecting this year and would love to be able to walk the dog and the baby at the same time.  Or maybe this is just venting. Thanks everyone. ",
