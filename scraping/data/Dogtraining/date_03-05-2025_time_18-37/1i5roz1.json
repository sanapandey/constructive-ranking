    "selftext": "Hey all,\n\n# TLDR: \n\nI want to incorporate some treat searching into our nose work play/training, but don't know how to do it without messing up his anti-bait training. I want him to stay away from food on the ground, unless he requests and is granted permission. This includes anything he finds outside, as well as our garden and inside the home, so location-unspecific. \n\n**Is it possible to \"grant-permission\", in advance, to a specific treat, such that it doesn't mess up anti-bait training, and such that he doesn't pick up anything else he finds around (like kitchen droppings, or stuff that lays around the garden).** \n\nGot a 10 months old, hyper BC pup. Also, other dummy training and/or general nose work tips are welcome! Thanks!\n\n# Long Version:\n\n**Background information:**\n\nI have recently discovered the wonders of nose work. Like, a 1.5h sniffy walk is enough to put out my hyperactive, 10 months old border collie pup for the entire day, with only a little bit of playing tug! Used to do 2h+ normal paced walking, which wasn't nearly enough for my guy.\n\nThe good thing is that my boy loves searching for his training dummy. But he ends up playing with it every time he finds it. So, I have to babysit him till he learns to properly retrieve it, especially if it is in another room than me. Meaning, I have to follow him around with a tug toy, and lure him with excitement to the starting spot to drop the dummy. It generally works pretty well, but I want to incorporate some other nose work that doesn't require babysitting him as much. I was thinking of letting him search for high value treats in the house and in the garden, so that I can ideally just leave him to search for a few minutes.\n\nThe big but is that I don't want this to mess up his anti-bait training. I got conflicting information from the trainer at puppy school. Sometimes she said that I shouldn't let him eat of the ground, period , because it messes up anti-bait training. And other times she told me to place treats onto the relaxation towel while my pup was on it, or throw them in front of him during walks to provide a little distraction while overstimulated or reactive - while those were the things I was doing when she explicitly told me not to do them weeks prior. So now I am a bit confused as to what is counterproductive to anti-bait training.\n\nMy guy doesn't pick up nearly as much off the ground anymore, especially compared to his puppy days. And he follows No and Drop It commands fairly well. During walks, he usually ignores things like bread on the ground, as he never gets any. But sometimes he picks up food that look like or even are treats. He dropped each one on command so far. But ideally he shouldn't even want to pick it up, or at least ask me for permission when he finds one (not that I'd grant it). \n\nMy fear is that while 99% of treats on the ground are probably genuinely lost treats from other owners (or me), the 1% that might be poison-bait scares the shit out of me, so I watch over him like an eagle whenever he sniffs on walks - which tired me out just as much as him. Also, sometimes there are actual dog treats in my garden that I suspect were dropped by ravens. But as I don't know their origin or composition I would prefer him to stay away from them as well (they aren't of the same kind as the ones I use). Even while he is searching for the treat I hid for him (though I understand that this might be very advanced for now).\n\n**Actual Question:**\n\nSo, is it possible to \"grant-permission\" to treats in advance, without messing up anti-bait training? Would my pup understand that he is allowed to pick up a treat off the ground after I give him the Search command, but not any other time on his own?  Also, would he understand that it has to be the specific one I let him sniff, and can't be any other food item he finds on his way? And if so, how do I best go about teaching it to him? What would the steps to training look like? \n\ni.e. I imagine something like placing two different treats on the ground in front and only allow the one I gave him to sniff from my hand? How would I even go about teaching him that?\n\nI understand that this is quite the advanced skill for a dog to learn, but I don't even know where to start or what to avoid, so I appreciate any feedback and tips coming my way. Thanks!",

                    "body": "Hi!\nSo, my question would be in the \"none of the above\" category in the approval guide. \n\nI found quite a few different guides or tips by people, including this sub, talking about scattering treats on the ground or letting your dog search for a hidden one etc. As it is so widespread advice on the internet and in real life, I don't know which specific guide to post tbh.\n\nAlthough, my question is in regard to how it relates to anti-bait training specifically, rather than looking for general advice, as I have concerns that certain things might be counterproductive to it. I have not found anything about that specifically yet, so I was hoping to have my question answered here. i.e. googling \"nose work anti bait training\" etc. does not result in anything regarding my question, rather showing basic anti-bait guides. \nAlso, perhaps I forgot to mention in the post, that I would want to do this kind of treat search game while my pup is still not bait-proof. In other words, I want to play this game without giving him the wrong idea that he can just eat any treat he finds, nor that he has to ask for permission when he actually finds the right treat as I have already given it to him with the Search command. All while we still train on anti-bait skills separately. And perhaps I should have clarified that by anti-bait training I don't mean (only) training to stay off specific scents but to not pick up anything at all unless permitted (with the exception of our game treat). \n\nSo, I would welcome answers about how it would or wouldn't interfere with anti-bait training, and/or answers about how to go about it such that it wouldn't interfere. \nI hope this is sufficient for the review process, and if not I would kindly ask what would else would be required from me, as I am fairly new to this sub. \n\nThanks!",
