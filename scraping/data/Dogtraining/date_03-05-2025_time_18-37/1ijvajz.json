    "selftext": "First time posting here but I honestly don\u2019t know where else to ask this. I have a 5.5 year old Great Dane he\u2019s on the bigger side of the breed and weighs 190 lbs. Over the past year he\u2019s struggled more and more getting up off of a non carpeted floor so our wood floors or tile in the kitchen. He\u2019s totally fine getting up off of his bed or a carpeted floor or off the ground outside. Sometimes he still lays on the wood floor for whatever reason and we really struggled to help him up off the floor, just because of his size and weight. So about 2 weeks ago I bought a dog lift harness. That we put underneath his torso when he\u2019s lying down and then we can more comfortably help him stand up from the floor. Since we got this dog lift harness he\u2019s been lying on floors where he can\u2019t get up way more often, it\u2019s almost like he knows now that he can just lie there and we can comfortably help him stand up. This isn\u2019t really an issue during the day but at night while we are all sleeping he now will lie down on the wood floors and then whine till we wake up to come and help him up. He never used to do this before I bought the lifting harness. We have tried putting those non slip paw pads in his feet but they either fall off or don\u2019t really help. We have also tried putting booties on his feet but he finds a way to get them off. I am not really sure what to do he wakes my family and I up multiple times during the night sometimes because he\u2019ll lie down in various spots on the wood floors throughout the night. Should we stop using the lift harness during the day? It feels mean to let him lie there because we know he gets uncomfortable in the same position and we know he won\u2019t be able to get up. Does anyone have any suggestions to train him not to lie on the wood floors? Any suggestions will help thank you! ",

Lying on the wood floor more frequently and this change in behavior and I think this is because of the lift harness which I am not sure if I should continue using. There is nothing mentioning training your dog not to sit on the wood floors. We have brought him to the vet and he struggles to get up due to arthritis which he is getting medication for. Having him not lie on the wood floor isn\u2019t just so we can get more sleep. It has also happened numerous times that my family and I will come back from being out of the house without the dog and he\u2019ll be lying on the floor unable to get up and we have no idea how long he\u2019s been there. We don\u2019t want him to be stuck in uncomfortable positions for lengths of time so we would like to know how to get him to stop lying on floors he can\u2019t get up from.",
