    "selftext": "My 3 year old aussie and I are working through the Karen Pryor foundations course and one exercise we have to do is shape a behavior. \n\nI've tried capturing licking her lip (suggested in the program) and lifting a paw. We've been working on them for many sessions and I can tell there is still zero connection in her mind of what I am asking for or what she is supposed to do. She will get frustrated and start offering all these other behaviors instead. \n\nOtherwise she is quite smart and we've been successful at learning lots of other behaviors but mostly through luring or somehow related to an object (go to place, sit in a box, etc).\n\n Capturing a body movement...impossible and im now so frustrated i am lost on how to move forward. Help!",
