We seek to provide a safe space to vent your frustrations as well, so feel free to express yourself.\n\nWe welcome both owners of dogs with separation anxiety and owners whose dogs have gotten better!\n\n**NEW TO SEPARATION ANXIETY?**\n\nNew to the subject of separation anxiety? A dog with separation anxiety is one who displays stress when the one or more family members leave. Separation anxiety can vary from light stress to separation panic but at the heart of the matter is distress.\n\n**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!\n\n***Resources***\n\n**Books**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Don't Leave Me!
