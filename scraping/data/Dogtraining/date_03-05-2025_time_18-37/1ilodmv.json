However, over the past few months, we\u2019ve noticed that she reacts strangely when new people come to our home.\n\nIf someone bends down to pet her, she yelps as if she\u2019s in pain\u2014yet she won\u2019t leave them alone. She jumps around excitedly but seems hesitant about being touched. She also appears fearful, and to be honest, I\u2019m starting to worry about the possibility of her nipping or biting.\n\nThis has happened multiple times with different people, sometimes even more intensely. I\u2019m attaching two clips of her yelping when our nanny tried to pet her. She\u2019s reacted this way with others as well, often wailing even louder.\n\nOne time, I was holding her to keep her from jumping on a visitor, and when they reached out to pet her, she snapped at their hand. At the time, I assumed it was because I was holding her and she felt protective, but now that this behavior is repeating, I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nDoes anyone have insight into why this might be happening, especially at four years old?\n",
