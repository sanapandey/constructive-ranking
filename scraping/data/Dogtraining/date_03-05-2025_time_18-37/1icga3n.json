    "selftext": "i have 2 rescue dogs, one chihuahua mix (4) and a lab mix (1). they have gotten in a few minor fights over bones or toys but nothing bad until today. my lab mix finished his bone quickly, tried to get the chinuahuas bone, and they ended up fighting. my chihuahua has a gash in his ear and a scratch on his head, as when i grabbed my lab mix he wouldnt let go of my chihuahuas head. i cried and felt so bad. my lab mix also tries to constantly intimidate my moms dog and bites his ears and i dont know how to fix this. he also loses it when seeing other dogs, he doesnt bark but tries to pull towards them and stands on his two legs. i dont know what to do, or where to start. looking for any advice and if im doing something wrong.
