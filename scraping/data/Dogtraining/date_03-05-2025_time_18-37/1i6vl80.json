    "selftext": "My girlfriend and I moved in together at the end of November. She has a 4 year old female pit/vizsla and I have a 4 year old male lab/pyrenees/etc. They moved in because my girlfriend\u2019s landlord was selling the house. My apartment is pretty small, so we\u2019re just riding out my lease and planning to get a bigger place together. \n\nHowever, our dogs ain\u2019t having it. My dog, who previously was very calm and sweet, goes after his new sister periodically. There\u2019s not necessarily anything that leads up to it. Certain times, my girlfriends or I might play with her a little \u201cactively\u201d and he perceives it as cause for concern. I believe his behavior to be mostly resource guarding, as my girlfriend\u2019s dog is pretty high energy. \n\nMy question is, where do I go from here? Medicating for anxiety? Maybe, but I\u2019m not crazy about turning my dog into a vegetable. Behaviorist? Probably smart, but a large investment from what I\u2019ve read. I don\u2019t need them to be best friends in the world, but I do need them to stop fighting. ",

            "body": "Medicating wont turn your dog into a vegetable. The idea is to bring their stress/anxiety down while they learn new behaviours. So it goes hand in hand with training. I just had my 4year old rescue on meds as she does not like the puppy we got in spring. She was getting better adjusted but we put her on meds for a few months to help her learn and adapt to the new situation with less stress. But it wasn\u2019t just meds- i also had to teach her and manage the dog\u2019s routines. That being said meds might not be what is needed. More seperation of the dogs and calm controlled interactions (starting small and slowly increasing time as). Resource guarding has nothing to do with a dogs energy levels- here is a great write up if you want to learn more about it;https://dogmantics.com/resource-guarding-protocol/",

Although it is an investment, getting a trainer who understands both breeds behaviors will help a lot. Yes, a behavioral trainer will be more expensive, but you won't need more than a few sessions once you understand the protocols you'll need and if you both do your \"homework.\" The sooner you address the issues the better, so they don't create negative habits with one another in the new environment. Walking them together outside is a great place to start and allowing them their own space where possible in the apartment until you can get someone there to help.",

            "body": "I'd keep them separate except for sessions where one or both are on leash and you can work on just existing together and what the rules are. Examples - I teach my dogs they can't steal the others' food. If I'm petting or interacting with one, another can't come shove her way in PET ME. I work on taking treats from me one at a time by name. Some dogs don't understand other's body language and you have to explain that if your friend is turning her head away and rolling her eye at you, stop what you are doing. If there's a growl or lip lift, leave the personal space of the other dog immediately. Some dogs need to be taught what's an appropriate correction. \nAlso, if you watch closely, your dog's body language may give you clues that he's about to go after the other dog. Intense stare, dropped shoulders, tense body, for example. \nCalling in a trainer is a great idea as well. This stuff can escalate very quickly. Don't let them practice behaviors you don't wish to have long term.",

Take the dogs out separately to walk or play outside so they have their own space and individual needs are met.\n\nMake their food and water separate. Keep the home calm since play seems to be a trigger. Just until you get a new space, which will be new to both the dogs. And hopefully larger so there is more space to share.",
