    "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019ve been visiting Baja Mexico my partner and encountered a stray near my place. She has clearly been malnourished and been very appreciative of food and water daily. We\u2019ve been considering taking the dog back to the states after my stay but I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll be ready for the long car ride. She\u2019s been following my partner and I around and seemingly happy to sleep in our rental. She walks well is friendly with people and great at house training. The few issues are as follows:\n\nAfraid to get into car. She\u2019s come in for food but leaves right after eating. The problem is that it would be a 30 hr car ride back home in 25 days.\n\nSecondly, she seems to have some resource guarding of my partner and I. Mostly my partner. She walks well nearby many dogs with me but while sitting with my partner and I she will react negatively to approaching dogs. \n\nLastly, I\u2019m a little concerned that she may not be happy. She mainly sits about on her bed we got for her and suns occasionally. It\u2019s just that when we first fed her the first few times she seemed so happy and would get the zoomies before she ever stayed with us. \n\nI have reached out to local shelters to see if\nThey could offer her assistance but strays are a huge problem here and haven\u2019t heard back yet. Can you offer any advice that may get her comfortable going home with us? \n",
