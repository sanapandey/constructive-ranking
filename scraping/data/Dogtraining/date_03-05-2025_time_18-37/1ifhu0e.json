    "selftext": "Hi Everyone, we recently adopted a rescue dog and she\u2019s absolutely great except she will not potty on leash. She walks well on leash and responds to new commands with positive reinforcement, but we have not gotten her to go potty on leash yet, only solo in our fence in yard. She\u2019s about to undergo heartworm treatment (she contracted from her previous home) and during that recovery period wr cannot let her heart rate spike so unsupervised yard potty is not an option. We have been crate training and letting her out every 2 hours to go on leash and she has refused potty for 24 hours. I\u2019m a mess at this point because she needs to learn but I\u2019m so broken up about her holding it for so long! Please tell me I\u2019m not a horrible dog parent for making her only go on leash and therefore she\u2019s holding it! We do not punish her if she has an accident in the house or crate and we plan to reward her once she potties on the leash but she hasn\u2019t yet.",
