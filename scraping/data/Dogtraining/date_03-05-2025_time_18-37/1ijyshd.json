    "selftext": "So I got a dog about a month ago named Obi. He\u2019s a husky/border collie mix from what I can tell, definitely some other stuff mixed in there. He\u2019s 2 (turning 3 in a few months), and indoors he is the best boy. He doesn\u2019t bark much, loves to play, not destructive with anything except his own toys (which is fine). He grazes on his food and water without scarfing it down, and is pretty much potty trained. Even knows some tricks like \u201coff\u201d, \u201csit\u201d, \u201cshake\u201d, etc. \n\nThat said, Obi is kind of hellish once we go for walks. I do my best to do 2 walks a day and then some days we do a trip to the dog park and then a nighttime walk instead. Any car, person, or dog that Obi sees he immediately starts barking and pulling towards them. The barking is repetitive and loud, but his tail is always wagging and I can tell he just really wants to play with the dog. It\u2019s NEVER aggressive from what I can tell, but I\u2019ve already had a few interactions with people while walking him where they\u2019ll cross the street with their dogs or kids bc they think he\u2019s aggressive :(\n\nI would love some suggestions on how to train him against this. Admittedly, I\u2019ve tried a lot. I tried treats because he\u2019s very food motivated indoors, but he usually just spits them out on our walks. I use a harness, but I tried walking with his collar once and that didn\u2019t make a difference. We use a short leash, so I can hold him better. I tried a mesh muzzle, he got it off within minutes because he\u2019s so smart. I tried a clicker and he ignored it. Dog whistle was the same result. My partner and I tried to reinforce \u201cno\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d but his tail just keeps on wagging, not a care in the world. \n\nI have a feeling it might be that he\u2019s overstimulated? He came from the country and we now live in the city, so it\u2019s all new to him. That said, I\u2019m becoming concerned because I really love taking him with me as much as possible, but it becomes almost impossible to walk him if there\u2019s any other thing (person, car, dog) around. \n\nAny advice?? I\u2019m desperate. He\u2019s such a good boy and I just want to make progress. Nighttime he does a lot better, so I know it\u2019s a sensory thing, I just don\u2019t know what to do. Help! ",
