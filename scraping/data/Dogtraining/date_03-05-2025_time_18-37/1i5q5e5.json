    "selftext": "I have a 6yo rescue (aussie/beagle/plus mix). We've had her for a couple of years but we only have one dog. She's shown some not very good manners with other days so we pretty much just don't let her around other dogs. \n\nRight now, I'm at home for two weeks with my parents and they have two little dogs. I was trying to let my dog around the others with some boundaries (food up and toys gone) and generally not leaving them alone together, but my mom keeps \"forgetting\" them so my dog has \"attacked\" one of the dogs (this is not the first time when we've been home). I didn't see it but apparently my dog pinned down the other dog really quickly with a lot of noise and kind of went for the other dog's throat but didn't do anything. \n\nIt's really scary and we're definitely just keeping them totally separate. But my question is how do you know when dogs are actually really dangerous vs just communicating. Sometimes, I'll see other dogs or videos and a dog will seem to flip shit but they're just communicating and the dogs will work it out. \n\nA note is that my dog does it suddenly, it's not like she shows a bunch of signs first. Like a toy was left out, and the other dog I guess tried to get it from my dog and she immediately threw him on his back. So my guess is that this is a sign that it's not good communication.\n\nBut she has also loved to play with the other dog in the yard, running and chasing each other and the other dog is super submissive. Is it definitely the best idea to keep them totally separate?",

There are a bunch of baby gates around in the house so we definitely don't leave them alone together at all. My dog weighs almost twice as much as the other dog but the little one is actually taller than her. (She's not overweight, she's just stumpy and tanky and the other is a very lanky young dog.) When she attacked him, my mom just screamed at her and she kind of pulled at her and it was okay. She didn't really seem upset at all and she didn't try to go back at him or anything. She just wandered off casually. My mom wanted to buy a muzzle but I don't feel like that's a great option for right now because I'm not just gonna slap one on her and this isn't the best environment for getting her comfortable.",
