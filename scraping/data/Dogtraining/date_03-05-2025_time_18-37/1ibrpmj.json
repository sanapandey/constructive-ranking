    "selftext": "Does anyone have recommendations for an app that you can/have used to build and track a dog training plan? Most apps specifically centered around dog training are either working with a virtual trainer or guiding you through a prescribed plan (e.g., 30 steps to a good recall, week 1 = teaching sit/down/stay, etc), and this is not what I am looking for. I am looking for a good app or resource where I can input and track goals, exercises, milestones, daily training work, etc, and keep an eye on the different things we are training and distribute them better throughout the day/week/month. I think something like a habit tracker or even a physical exercise/training app is more what I'm looking for, but most of those are too specifically geared toward those purposes and have many features that would be extraneous for me. \n\nHad anyone used an app to track something like progress/goals in a dog sport like agility or scentwork - any activity that has skills that build and advance over time?",

Traditional habit tracking apps, such as HabitNow, Finch, Disciplined, and others, are too specific to wellness and work/study habits and would get in the way of some of the ways I am trying to use it.",
