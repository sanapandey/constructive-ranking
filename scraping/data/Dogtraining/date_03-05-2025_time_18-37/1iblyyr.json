    "selftext": "I have had a purebred Texas Heeler for about 3 years now. I've had her since she was 4 weeks old. She is an extremely smart dog who knows the names of her toys, many tricks, and the names of me and my family. she has always been a fearful dog, which I have taken into consideration throughout training her. we have lots of routines, walks, and playtime throughout the week. I know that dog personalities are different, and she will bark more because she is naturally fearful, but it is getting to the point of it being unbearable. She only barks inside the house and in the yard, but it will be at everything. jingling keys, opening the door, walking up and down the stairs. if she sees the neighbors outside she will claw at the windows and franticly bark and sometimes I have to physically push her to get her to get down. It's like i'm on an episode of 'My Dog from Hell.' \n\nI don't know if this is a territorial thing that has developed or if she is just going through another fear stage because it's a new behavior that's been going on for a while and getting worse. I have a feeling it also might be a compulsive behavior because whenever we get her to stop barking, she goes to each and every window, and we have a lot.\n\n Any advice is appreciated!",

            "body": "I dealt with something similar with my own Texas heeler, Brandy, and I know how frustrating it can be! Does she bark at mostly noises or the sight of people? I\u2019ve had some success with blocking visual triggers, using white noise from various YouTube videos, and rewarding calm behavior before the barking starts. Also, teaching an alternative behavior like \u2018go to your bed\u2019 when they hear a trigger can help. If it\u2019s getting worse over time, a trainer or behaviorist might be a good option. Hope you find something that helps!",
