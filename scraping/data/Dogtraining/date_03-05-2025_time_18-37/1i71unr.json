    "selftext": "I have a 19 month old Vizsla. She is the SWEETEST dog however, she has not been on the trails as often like the summer time and since then, she was attacked by my brother\u2019s dog. \n\nThis has led her to regress in her training and cause me some concern. \n1.) now she blows off recall \n2.) she has started barking at other dogs on the trail. \n\nThis is not okay and we want to help her so we took her to a dog training place and I don\u2019t think if this specific program is right for her. \n\nWe took her, met with the trainer and of course, she was an angel  . \n\nWe did everything to try & trigger her but nope\u2026she was completely neutral and unphased by the facility\u2019s dog \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. \n\nNow we have a decision to make. The trainer still recommended their aggression & reactivity course for $1100. However, they were saying she really isn\u2019t aggressive at all but lacks confidence and needs a strengthened recall which part of me feels like I could train her\u2026but idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. I\u2019m not in denial that she has issues. I just feel like maybe they\u2019re not as intense as this program. Thoughts? ",

Your dog shouldn\u2019t be put in a position to fail at recall - keep him on the line until you are confident you can recall him from distractions.\u00a0",

Go back to basics training and do it all over again, I'd definitely do that before forking out all that money. I'd probably look for someone who'd be happy to go out on a trail and work out any aggression issues over time.",

I also would not drop that much money unless i was certain this was what was needed- you seem unsure about the program itself?  Finding a good personal trainer to do a couple sessions i found really helpful- the trainer watches you and trains you to train your dog, so maybe look into that too?",

It sounds like that is what is happening.\n\nBe patient for the adolescent phase to end and in the meantime go back to basics on recall. If you did it once you can do it again.\n\nAs for reactivity on trail, train attention to you and tackle the barking issue head on. Make sure you\u2019re rewarding all the silent periods on the walk. If a dog ever goes past and he doesn\u2019t react, click and reward. If he barks, try to keep moving and wait until the next time he ignores the dog, big jackpot click and reward!!\n\nIF he\u2019s very reactive to all dogs on the trail, try to set up a training day with friendly dog owners. Essentially start far away, and practise walking a bit closer and closer, always rewarding calmness and not barking.",
