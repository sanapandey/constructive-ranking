    "selftext": "My parents (almost 60) are getting a puppy(10 weeks). In the past their dogs (rescues) have not been trained well. I'm hoping they have a plan for consistency with training. \n\nI'm their adult daughter with a 10 month old baby. I'm worried about visiting while they're adjusting to training and getting their puppy acclimated to the home. My baby is a fast crawler, and nearing walking stages. \n\nAny advice for puppy and baby relations? What boundaries should I have in place? \nShould I wait to see how training is going before introduction?",

Just as pools are inherently unsafe for toddlers without any particular intent and hence should be thoroughly fenced off to prevent access, so too dogs are inherently unsafe for toddlers and should be fenced off with a baby gate, playpen, crate etc. Keep a fence between the two of them so that calm, polite interactions can be set up without stress.",

My parents have a 40 kg rescue dog who since they were toddlers has bitten my nieces, knocked them over and stolen food from them (rarely, but once is too many times). Parents refuse to train the dog and only yell at him or smack him \ud83d\ude2d they've been told NUMEROUS times he is NOT allowed to be near the kids but they don't listen. I'm terrified to have kids of my own because I don't trust them to be responsible dog owners and responsible grandparents. I have a rescue pup myself who was advertised as \"good with kids of all ages\" but he is VERY BIG and doesn't know his size. He is 100% supervised when the kids are over (now 3 and 6). He is separated from them whenever there is food involved. If I'm walking out of the room,  either the kids or the dogs are coming with me because I refuse to leave them alone together. The kids are coached on dog manners and body language. I have these rules even with my 6yo dog who is THE MOST GENTLE GIRL IN THE WORLD \u2764\ufe0f because you never know what will happen with kids involved, e.g. if they pull their tail, poke their eyes, kick them...",
