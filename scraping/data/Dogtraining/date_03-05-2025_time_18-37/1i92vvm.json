    "selftext": "Backstory:\n\nWe have two dogs currently. Both are neutered males. One is 8 years old and the other is 9 years old (this is the one that marks). We have all lived together for the past \\~6 years. The marking started when we moved into our current house about 4 years ago. There is nothing wrong with him medically, it is not any form of incontinence. We know the previous owners of this home had dogs but I don\u2019t know how much that could have to do with this starting and continuing for 4 years.\u00a0\n\nThe Issue:\u00a0\n\nI know he knows he shouldn\u2019t be marking in the house. He only ever does it when we are not in the room so I have never actively caught him doing it and therefore have not been able to \u201ccorrect\u201d him or deter him during the act. It happens intermittently and in a few of the same locations but not always. Mainly on corners of walls or furniture. Each time I find a spot, I clean it with an enzyme cleaner designed to prevent dogs from repeatedly marking and remove their scent. Which doesn\u2019t seem to help much..\u00a0\n\nWhat I am looking for:\u00a0\n\nWe will be moving within the next year to a new build house. So no previous dog scent that he doesn\u2019t know will be there. But, I want to be proactive during the move-in process to acclimate him as best as possible and make him feel at home so he doesn\u2019t feel the need or urge to mark in the new place. I would love any guidance on training/tips/methods for helping to prevent this. We plan to create a dog door and fenced area in the new home but it will not be done upon move-in and so there will be a period of time where the dogs have less free outdoor access than they currently do.\u00a0\n\nAdditional Info:\u00a0\n\nHe gets walked almost daily; usually about a mile. He is a small dog, 15lbs. And we live in a fairly good weather area so both dogs have access to the outside almost all day much of the time via dog door to a securely fenced back yard. I am positive the marking happens only when the back door is closed and he can\u2019t get outside; ie when I am not home or have it closed due to weather or nighttime etc. I am home pretty much every day with them for a majority of the day and let them out on demand whenever they go to the door. Which he does regularly when he wants to be outside if the door isn\u2019t open.\u00a0\n\nThanks for reading and any positive tips and advice is welcome! \n\n",

            "body": "Hi. Sounds tough! \u00a0Clearly you have been trying your best and thought this through.\u00a0\n\nI would recommend working on this now rather than when you move. The longer he pees indoors the more engrained it will become.\u00a0\n\nYou could try using a UV light to find more spots that need to be saturated in enzyme cleaner.\u00a0\n\nYou could try tethering.\u00a0\n\nI would recommend against letting him free roam your house\u2026 try a play pen or crate.\u00a0\n\nThis is what worked for us: see my very detailed comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/11yzj6x/comment/jda6btd/). It works best if you follow every instruction to a \u201cT\u201d, if your schedule permits. It\u2019s exhausting but better than the alternative in my opinion. (I was fortunate and was at home fulltime while house training. I don\u2019t know how to adapt this for those that are working outside their home.)\n\nBest of luck with the pup and the new house!",

The marking is always small amounts but still quite annoying! \n\nCould you explain more on how you would recommend tethering? I have considered going back to using a crate whenever unsupervised and may just need to use that method while we adjust to the new house.",
