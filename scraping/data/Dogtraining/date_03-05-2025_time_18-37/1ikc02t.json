    "selftext": "My dad just adopted a 1 year old dog (Dodo) from the shelter and we currently own an almost 2 year old dog (Lucy). Dodo was found as a stray and had one owner that had him for around 4 months and it is my understanding he was kept tethered outside 3/4 months with them due to him not being able to be potty trained (he was potty trained within 2 days of being with us). The new dog is very very hyper and excitable. Lucy is also fairly hyper (she is an Aussie) but not nearly to the point he is (apparently catahoula leopard mix) It may also be relevant to share that they are both fixed. Lucy has shown 0 interest in other dogs since being young. She doesn\u2019t show signs of being aggressive if she sees another dog but has made it clear she does not like being approached. She immediately shies away from other dogs. \n\nWe have had Dodo for about 6 days and kept them separated for the most part as my girl was showing clear signs of being uncomfortable around him at first and straight out avoiding him. We have made attempts at socializing them the last couple of days by keeping him on leash and letting her approach or letting her come in the room with him in the crate. We do not force her to interact with him but let her do so if she chooses. She makes frequent attempts to approach him if he is calm and he lunges for her in an obviously playful way. At this point she does little \u201chops\u201d backwards, out of his reach but stays close. Today she outright pranced up to him when he was on leash as if he were not there and he jumped on top of her. I can\u2019t say exactly what happened as it happened very quickly. She did not bite him but showed teeth. It very well could have been playful or defensive. I split them up pretty soon after that hoping it wouldn\u2019t escalate as I didn\u2019t really see what either of their body language looked like. 5 minutes later she was back but they interacted in what I know now is \u201cboxing\u201d, standing on their hind legs and batting at each other with front paws. I just want to make sure that I am doing the correct thing by socializing them this way. I don\u2019t know if I should slow down their interactions or just allow them to play without interfering, and just hope that it does not escalate. When will I know it is \u201ctime\u201d? ",
