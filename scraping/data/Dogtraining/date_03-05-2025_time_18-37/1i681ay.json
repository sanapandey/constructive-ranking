    "selftext": "So my dog a small female has been used to peeing in a yard and on walks but we recently moved to an apartment on the third floor about three days ago. I used to let her out every morning before work about 4 am with just enough time to bring her in after doing her business then making it to work on time. I recently built a diy turf box for the patio to try to make it so I don't have to take her down three flights of stairs every morning. I will do it but the place we moved to is significantly farther from place of work. Any advice to get her to use the turf box just for first in the morning bathroom breaks. I know that I have to use the restroom when I wake up so I'm certain she has to.",
