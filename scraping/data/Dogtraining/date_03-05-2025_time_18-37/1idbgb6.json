    "selftext": "TW: I talk about some mistreatment of animals here. Please don't read if this will effect you negatively.\n\nFirst of all, he is a good boy 90% of the time, they are bad owners. Not just with the dog but also with their cats. I moved in about two months ago I have done all that I know how to do to make things better for all animals but my main concern is the dog. He's a large poodle mix(this is important later).\n\n  \n\n\nA typical day in our house looks like this:\n\n\n\n8 AM: My roommates go to work, they lock him in his little fence with his bed, which until last week after I complained was just a thin blanket on the floor. Up until I moved in he'd stay there, with no food, no water, no toys, and no going outside until they got home which can be anywhere from 5pm to 11pm. Since I moved in I go let him out.\n\n\n\n9 AM: We go for a walk, he does not get walked by his owners.\n\n\n\n10 AM: We get back from our walk and I do some work while sitting on the couch with him.\n\n  \n\n\n12 PM: I take a break from work make lunch and play with the dog for about half an hour, then go back to doing school and just hanging out with him. \n\n\n\n4 PM: I take another break and we go for another, shorter walk, usually just around the block. We play some more and then I head upstairs for any meetings I have or work I have to do in my office. \n\n\n\nFrom then on I check on him every hour, letting him out if he needs it, I'll usually play with him if they're not back from work yet. One of my biggest issues happens when they get home. He is always very excited to see them, he knows what their vehicles sound like and he starts whining and occasionally barking. The barking is a bit annoying but he's excited so I usually calmly but firmly tell him to be quiet. Once they open the door, he loses it every single time and my one roommate always just screams at him for it. There's no trying to correct his behaviour whenever he gets into trouble. \n\n\n\nIt's usually never his fault, the only bad things he does really is bark at people if he's in the yard(roommates don't correct this behaviour). He'll occasionally steal trash but my roommates are straight up disgusting people and don't clean. I've corrected this by cleaning their trash but I know once I move out that it will be a mess again. \n\n\n\nHe's recently learned he can jump over his fence the other day, so I sat down there and walked him back every time he jumped out, got him to lay down then we'd start over. Once he started catching on I'd leave him in the fence unattended, checking in every 15 minutes, if he was in the fence I let him out and we played for a little while and he got pets. If he jumped out he got walked back in, told to lay down and we start over. I've been doing this for two days and while I don't really mind it does take away from how much work I get done so if anyone has some tips for me on that one.\n\n\n\nNow I'm not new to dogs, I've always trained mine to understand both verbal and hand cues and I have done the same with this dog. I've tried talking to my roommates, tried teaching them the commands I taught him and to explain that dogs will respond better to proper techniques and not just screaming. \n\n  \nI honestly just don't know what to do anymore. I know I mentioned he's poodle mix, well they won't get him groomed unless he's matting. He was actually all matted when I first moved in and they only took him because my boyfriend paid for it. I'm at the point where I honestly just consider calling someone to come take the pets. They don't really care for them well at all. Like sure they pet them and cuddle them and feed them but that is the extent of care these animals receive. They didn't have toys until I moved in, no scratch posts for those cats (keep in mind all of these animals are at least three years old). They will cat little pile for literal months, the water bowl they used for two years had never been clean. \n\n  \nI know that I will probably end up giving them the ultimatum when I move out that either I take the pets, I come check up on them regularly, or I call it in. I just feel like such a jerk doing it. All of the animals are absolute sweethearts, and it's clear they love their owners but it's also becoming more and more clear to me that these people don't love their pets enough to take care of them properly. \n\n",
