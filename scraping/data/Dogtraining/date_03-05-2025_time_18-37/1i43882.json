    "selftext": "Hi everyone. Had my dog Bismarck for a good 9-10 months now. Made a ton of progress and 80% of the time he's fine with other dogs while walking. The only issue we've noticed (and it's not every period) he gets aggressive with other male dogs when my wife starts her period. This is whether she is on the walk or not. Came home last night and he had peed on the side of the toilet and ripped up some minor packaging. But was happy to see me. We went to walk and he started on a male dog after sniffing him for a couple of seconds. He gets a bit \"uppity\" during this time not naughty per day but back chatty (huskys lol) normally he's very quiet. Any suggestions? I dont want to constantly have anxiety about letting him near other dogs for one week of the month. He also harasses the wife and sniffs her bits during this time. He's neutered but he also leaks? So I don't know if he was neutered wrong?",

Whether it\u2019s literally smelling iron, sensing hormonal changes we can\u2019t detect or literally finding different and fun to play with packages in the bathroom, it could be a mix. \n\nNoticing hormonal changes in the leuteal phase days before she begins her new cycle could, with some pattern recognition which huskies are known for, cause protective behavior. But my experience is less with males. Hormones for women flip flop dramatically and dogs can smell it in urine, on breath. My dog becomes a little baby when I\u2019m sad. PMS is the end of a cycle and you\u2019re not bleeding; what folks commonly think of as \u201cthe period\u201d isn\u2019t the end, it\u2019s actually the start of a cycle. Emotional liability as you menstruate isn\u2019t hormonal so much as the mental /emotional /financial load of keeping yourself clean and pain free when your body is leaking and it\u2019s embarrassing and literally more work - it\u2019s actually the beginning of a menstrual cycle where folks tend to have way more energy at last, more initiative. But the hormone changes during the last few days before menstruation often make people feel depressed, tearful, it can be accompanied by a lot of pain. Dogs notice that and want to be more pliant and submissive and - in my experience with several huskies now - more protective of me as I\u2019ve come out of that more vulnerable state. \n\nGet him distracted. If you notice protection behaviours correct them gently and redirect energy instead of punishing or isolating him. To me IMO it means he\u2019s well bonded to your family, I\u2019m actually kind of impressed. Marking the toilet areas is like a reminder and a possession thing, a bit misguided but given his age it seems like he\u2019s confused maybe to our perspective but honestly he must love your partner and though you\u2019d want to make sure he\u2019s peeing outside more than usual to reduce the chance of marking/keeping fun novel products out of reach\u2026 it\u2019s kinda sweet. \n\nHave you paid the dog tax?

It's like they're drawing attention to the fact.  \n\nHuskies have a reputation for not necessarily getting along well with other same-sex dogs.  If your dog has not been socialized on a regular basis with other dogs, he might be somewhat lacking in the dog's social skills department. \n\nRealizing that that push to socialize dogs at dog parks was a terrible idea. Especially coming out of covid. A lot of dogs weren't socialized as puppies. Do not feel the pressure to allow your dog to socialize with other dogs, it's not worth the risk of a dog fight.  \n\nIf your dog is under a year old, you should still have some puppy proofing in place. I have found that most dogs get into trouble if left alone for too long, even up until their second or 3rd birthday.    Just make sure he gets lots of physical and mental exercise. A tired dog is a happy dog.",

Some male dogs will leak little drops of that type of fluid from the penis when they are anxious. My dog did this for the first two weeks after I adopted him (those were rough days for both of us) and then it stopped completely once we settled it. It did start up again for another two weeks after I went on vacation and boarded him and has been a regular thing every time I board him. \n\nYour partners cycle might be triggering anxiety for your dog, which can cause the fluid leaking. Reactiveness and guarding behaviors are absolutely anxiety related for dogs. It may be possible that your dog (like mine) takes some time to recover from this kind of stress. \n\nWork on training a \"look at me\" command. This means asking your dog to focus on you so that when you are on walks and you see another dog your dog will look at you and ignore the other dog. Then you can use this command when your partner is on their cycle and you are worried your dog might pick a fight. You will have to train \"look at me\" when your dog is not already stressed. Once it's well understood in 'easy scenarios' then do the exact same training when your dog is the most reactive.",

Some of the things you describe sound like they may be rooted in separation anxiety. But the only way to tell for sure is to watch on camera for non-stop panic-like behavior that he never shows in your presence, and pacing between things that smell like you (maybe recently touched) and trying to escape through the barrier they last you leave through. Otherwise, if the \"panic\" behavior seems more random, or at random intervals for random amounts of time, it may be the result of boredom instead of separation panic.\n\nKeep in mind that if your dog does show separation anxiety behavior, you may have to address that first. It can be very difficult to train such a dog against reactivity and emotional impulses because his mind is too busy worrying about whether and when you're going to leave him, preventing him from focusing on the training you may be trying to do.\n\nGood luck!",
