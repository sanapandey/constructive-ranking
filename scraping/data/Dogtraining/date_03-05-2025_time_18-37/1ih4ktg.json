    "selftext": "The run-in happened maybe 5 days ago, it scared the dog (Bucky) enough that he let out a little pee while scrambling backwards. Now it's like he sees dad as a threat whenever dad is walking around. Bucky's hackles go up, he growls, but doesn't bare teeth. He can be like this for several minutes if dad keeps standing up. If Bucky gets a chance to sneak behind he'll sniff dad and then he'll be chiller, though still apprehensive. Once my dad sits on the couch the attitude completely changes, Bucky will go up to him face first wanting attention, and then climb up to cuddle next to him.\n\nI already know the biggest issue is my dad has spent the least time with Bucky out of all of us, since he's the most busy. He's tagged along on a couple walks and given him treats here and there, but otherwise all the training, feeding, walking and playing is done by my mom and I. We're going to have him participate in giving treats, training exercises and walks more. Other things we started doing are not yelling at Bucky, but pushing him off the couch if it happens when he's on the couch, we hug my dad when it happens, we give treats and good boys when he's nice and sniffs my dad, and my dad knows not to approach him when standing and ignore it when he growls. Is there anything else we should or shouldn't be doing?\n\nWe have had him for a little over 3 weeks now, he's 1 year old and a rescue. He's been adapting well so far but I think misses being surrounded by other dogs. I tried keeping this brief, if there's anything you need clarified please ask.",

I need help with figuring out how to desensitize the dog to \\*one person walking around\\* when that person has responsibilities and needs to do his own thing. For Priority #1 on that page, I can't block the dog from seeing/hearing my dad walking around the house. And Priority #2, the dog always has a choice to retreat to other areas of the house but instead he feels like he has to confront my dad when he gets like this, maybe because everyone else is near my dad as well and he doesn't want to be alone. But that's not something we want to change. If I alone take him to another part of the house that will be problematic too because he wants to check up on my mom from time to time and spend time with her.\n\nAlso just hoping for confirmation that the specific training we're doing can be beneficial at all.",

            "body": "So you - or more specifically, your dad - will need to work the standard protocol of a fearful dog. There are 2 parts to it: Management and Training.\n\nThe first part is management, as it can and needs to be implemented immediately. When your dad is up and about and close to the dog, you will all need to watch for the dog's stress signals (dogs have very clear body language for when they start to feel stressed, way before it escalates to things like raised hackles or growls or snaps; if you're not familiar, look them up). If the dog starts showing any, your dad needs to immediately either sit down or back away from the dog, to remove the trigger freaking the dog out. Adult male figures can also appear very intimidating to dogs, especially small dogs, especially if your dad is a bigger and/or taller guy. Try not to lean over or approach the dog directly while standing up; instead, squat or kneel and let the dog come to you, sniff you out, and realize you're a familiar loved companion. Raised voices are also intimidating to dogs, especially adult male voices since dogs save their loudest, most aggressive type of barking for trying to intimidate other people or animals encroaching on their space (territory). Tell your dad to try to avoid raising his voice, if it happens sometimes, not just at the dog, but at anyone in the house\n\nThe second part is training. Keep training sessions short but frequent, and use high-value treats, like small cut-up pieces of boiled chicken breast (my dog goes more nuts for these than anything else). While your dad is standing, have him call the dog toward him. If he reacts positively in any way, have him toss a treat just past the dog (so the dog does not have to advance any further toward your dad to get it). As soon as the dog takes the treat, have your dad retreat away to relax the dog's stress. Then repeat for up to 10-15 mins; the dog will let you know when he's had enough. It may just be a couple of reps for only a minute or two at first, so be patient. If the dog is chasing you around for the treats, see if he'll do it for something lower value, like kibble, or even no food at all - just lots of love, praise, and attention. In the meantime, be sure to follow all the management steps above when not training, to avoid stressing the dog to a level that escalates to aggression.\n\nYou should continue to see notable progress in this training from week to week, if not quicker - it depends on the dog. Do not push him. Do not yell at him or otherwise punish him (dogs do not have the cognitive ability to understand what they are being disciplined for and will just end up further fearing you). If you do not see steady, notable improvement as mentioned, you will need to engage an ACVB-certified veterinary behaviorist (not to be confused with an obedience trainer or a conventional medical veterinarian). These people are effectively dog psychologists who can help you figure out both what you may be doing less-than-optimally and/or whether your dog might need the help of meds to achieve an appropriate behavior depending on your goals, especially since you mentioned aggression has been at play here.\n\nGood luck!",

By pushing him off the couch, you are \u201cpunishing\u201d his fear. The strategy would be counter-conditioning your dad standing to be a positive thing. Start with your dad sitting on the floor and give him treats if he\u2019s calm. Then move in gradual steps to your dad being closer and closer to standing, rewarding only when he\u2019s calm. I would also recommend having you or your mom give the treats rather than your dad, as he trusts you and may be hesitant to take them from your dad.",

When my brother visited with his dog their first-time meeting went pretty well, but then we all went to chill in the living room, Bucky and I sat on the couch where we often hang out together, and if my brother or his dog would walk nearby Bucky growled at them (mostly at the dog though). I asked about that specific occurrence on r/dogadvice and someone suggested pushing him off (not maliciously ofc) as a way to show he doesn't own that space. But as I've been reading the wiki on this sub and reading the way you put it I understand it's not helpful.",
