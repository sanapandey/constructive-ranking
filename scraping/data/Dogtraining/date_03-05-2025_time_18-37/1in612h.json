    "selftext": "I have worked really hard to crate train my pup for about 15 months now. My plan has always been to let her in bed eventually. She is okay with the crate, certainly doesn\u2019t love it, but accepts it. \n\nHowever, for months now she has been waking up and crying to get out earlier and earlier. Basically between 4-6 every morning. She will go potty at that time but I have wondered if that is really what she wants, or even if she needs to go potty because she has gotten herself all worked up. \n\nLast weekend I decided to sleep on the couch and tie her leash to it so she wouldn\u2019t wander off to find mischief. Sure enough she was in no rush to wake up and slept like an angel until I woke up both days. I even felt like our bond immediately improved. Should I take this as a sign that she should sleep with me? I still plan to use the crate daily and when I leave b/c I wouldn\u2019t trust her with a full run of the house yet. ",
