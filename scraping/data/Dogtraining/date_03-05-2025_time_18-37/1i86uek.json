    "selftext": "Long post warning - but I would appreciate any advice about the situation.\n\nPascal is a ridgeback mix that my fiancee and I adopted from a shelter as a companion for our black lab of the same age. When we adopted him he was a year old and we've had him for a year now, so he's 2 years old, the same age as our lab. \n\nIt was obvious from the start that he was not socialized at all, possibly kept in a crate most of the time. He did not know about toys or chews. His shelter records explain that his mom started attacking her babies so they had to be separated. He was neutered around 4 months old. He is extremely eager to make us, his owners, happy. He wants to do what we ask of him and craves attention and approval. He is extremely food motivated and we work on all the basic dog training things with him, which he can do reliably. He's made tons of progress since we got him.\n\nWe used to bring both dogs to the dog park regularly, one or twice a week for the first 3-4 months that we had Pascal. Until we had two separate instances of unfixed dogs around the same age as our guys humping Pascal and him telling them to f*ck off ending in a scuffle and the black lab jumping in to help (the only injury was the lab had a small nic very near his eyeball). It was so sad and scary and unpleasant that we haven't taken them back except to play in the empty fenced in area.\nSince then, we have been trying to bring Pascal around areas with dogs and people while on leash and with treats. We have also gone where people and dogs are and just sat and tried to get him to do nothing. We could definitely be doing these things more frequently, no doubt. We also do neighborhood walks and make an effort to be near people and dogs walking, kids playing, delivery trucks/mail trucks, etc. We have been working on \"quiet\" paired with \"bark\" because he barks inssessantly at anything and nothing in the backyard and out the front windows. He barks at the same old couple walking every day and the mail truck. The barking drives us crazy. So that's the first issue. \n\nThe second issue is being around our family, as I have two young nieces. He's alright for the most part but will get too excited if they scream or jump around and he will start barking very loudly and scarily, but wag his tail. He also does this with new people in the house. We've tried giving the guest high value treats (cheese and good training treats), which he will accept but then randomly go off with the scary barking. We just started with putting him in the crate when people come in so he can even just exist in the same room as everyone. He scares my dad who is a big guy and has been around large dogs is whole life. Pascal also has gotten attacked (while supervised) by my sisters dog who has her own history (this is after several previous good interactions), which left him with a couple of small puncture wounds. He has since left her alone (as opposed to trying to play). So he basically cannot be in any social situation that isn't just my fiancee and myself and our pets in our house. He is reactive to/with other reactive dogs. He wants to meet them and play so badly, but pushes boundaries and our lab doesn't correct him and anything we do during interactions with other dogs makes no difference in the moment.\n\nHere's the most recent development which has me feeling so, so sick. Last night we gave the dogs some very high value treats that they've never had before: pig snouts. All of this took place with close supervision, my fiancee and I on the couch while the dogs were on the floor near by. Pascal took his snout to his bed (next to the couch) and was munching away. I had taken it a couple of times to put a blanket underneath him to chew over and had no issues taking the snout. The black lab was not very interested. He chewed a couple of times but let it fall to the floor (6 feet from Pascal). Our orange tabby cat walked by Pascal and he growled (he growls when playing and is generally super vocal). I immediately got up and moved the cat and confronted Pascal. I got near his face and said \"no\" strongly several times, he is usually responsive to my corrections. I should have taken the pig snout then, but for some dumb reason I didn't. I understand now that this was resource guarding - this was the moment to intervene and that it wasn't his normal toy/play growling. Maybe 5 mins later the orange cat walks over near the OTHER pig snout, sitting out in the open on the floor, 6 feet from Pascal. Pascal jumps up and attacks the cat. He did not bite the cat as there were no wounds and there was no blood. Just a few wet spots of saliva. We immediately jumped up and separated them and pinned Cal by this neck. It was clear that he wouldn't have broken away from the situation on his own. He continued to flail his mouth around and growl when he had him down, but was not trying to bite us. We took him out in the backyard right after that on leash and harness for everyone to calm down. We have kept Pascal and the cat separated until this morning because our heat is out and only one room is above 60degrees. So we don't want to kick the cats out of there. He is on a leash and harness in the house and my fiancee is watching like a hawk and giving him the \"leave it\" when he even looks at one of the cats. Pascal and the orange cat are both ignoring each other this morning, but the cat did seem weary of the lab when I was with them before going to work. In the past, both dogs will run after the cats until they retreat to one of the \"cat only\" places we have in the house. The dogs have never previously put their mouth on the cats or try to get them in a mean way and it all seems playful, though it's a habit we were trying to break. \n\nSo I need any advice you guys can give. Until last night I was so into training him and we actually have an appointment for a trainer to come to the house next week to evaluate Pascal and teach us more ways we can be training him. After this event I don't know if I can keep this dog. He so, so sweet and has grown very attached to us. I don't really believe in returning a dog to the shelter or rehoming just because you decide you just don't want the dog anymore. He drives me insane with the barking and I want a dog who can be around anyone in any situation. I KNOW training can achieve those things and that was the plan we were moving forward with, but can we come back from the incident with the high value treat?  To be clear, we were seeking training advice before this event and were fully prepared to spend the time and energy to teach him to be the dog we want him to be. This new event just makes me wonder if I'll ever be comfortable with him in the house and around the cats and the lab. Would he have attacked the lab if he went back for the second pig snout? What about my nieces? How can I let him be around them ever after this? \n\nAlso, of note, the orange cat broke his jaw while outside at my parents (hasn't gone outside since) and has just fully recovered from that and dental surgery mid-2024. This cat is my best buddy and it's not fair for him to be afraid and get chased around the house. The cat is super social, follows me around, and wants to be where people are. I don't want to limit his roam of the house for something that wasn't his fault. I can't imagine them even being in the same room anymore. It breaks my heart thinking about finding Pascal a new home especially because I would want it to be with someone who understands his training needs and won't return him to the shelter. It also seems unfair to re-home him because we are the most stable thing he's ever had and is absolutely in love with us and the lab. \n\nWhat do I do???",

            "body": "TLDR:\n\nFor reactive and/or resource guarding dogs:\n\n- no high-value treats (bones, pig snout)\n\n- no dog parks\n\n- a good rescue will not place a reactive dog with children and other pets.\u00a0\n\n- If your dog barks incessantly it may be a sign of resource guarding or being over stimulated.\u00a0\n\n- If people are scared of your dog, take it seriously. start\u00a0training **with an ACVB trainer**\n\n- do not pin your dog down by the neck.\u00a0\n\n- Working with a non-ACVB trainer could be a huge mistake.\u00a0\n\n- take everyone\u2019s safety into consideration\u2026 rehoming this dog to a home without other pets and without children may be the most responsible option. \u00a0\n\n\u2014-\n\nLong comment. \u00a0Hope that is ok.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m going to speak sometimes bluntly here.\u00a0\n\nI blame the rescue for not requiring a no-children and no pets home for this dog.\u00a0\n\nI think bones and pigs ears/snouts should come with a warning label \u201cif you have a reactive dog, do not allow other pets in the room while your dog enjoys this treat\u201d. And \u201cdo not attempt to take this away from your reactive dog.\n\nI\u2019ll preface this below with apologies if I am wrong. It\u2019s just my take on this. \u00a0\n\n\u00a0You took in a year old ridgeback mix, not socialized, possibly neglected shelter dog whose mother attacked her puppies \u00a0\n\nA challenge for sure \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n> He is extremely eager to please,\u00a0craves attention and approval, and food\n\nWe used to bring both dogs to the dog park\u00a0regularly,\n\nI don\u2019t recommend dog parks. \u00a0It sets your dog free to deal with dogs and owners you don\u2019t know if they are safe or dangerous and the fencing can add stress. \u00a0There is no way to know if the dogs there have ticks, fleas, vaccines, a good temperament or not. \u00a0Toys there would potentially increase risks \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n> instances of unfixed dogs around the same age as our guys humping Pascal, resulting in a sad and scary scuffle and injury\n\n\n\nUnpleasant scenarios are to be expected at dog parks. I\u2019m not clear on why owners put their dogs in the situation. There is a pattern here that 100% of the time it is the other dog\u2019s fault when actually the owner either should not have brought their reactive dog to the dog park or did not notice the body language that lead up to the skuffle.\n\n\n\n> we haven't taken them back except to play in the empty fenced in area.\u00a0We have also gone where people and dogs are and just sat and tried to get him to do nothing.\n\n\n\nA better plan.\n\n\n\n> he barks inssessantly at in the backyard and out the front windows.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn addition to attempts to desensitize him, Have you attempted to reduce stimulation (covering the windows at his level with a temporary glass frosted stickers/film? \u00a0How did that work?\n\n> two young nieces, scream or jump around\u00a0he will start barking very loudly and scarily\n\n\n\nHe sounds over stimulated. putting him in the crate sounds wise.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> He scares my dad who is a big guy and has been around large dogs is whole life.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis gut feeling needs to be taken seriously and addressed through training with an ACVB trainer \u00a0\n\n\n\nScuffle with another dog (sister\u2019s), resulted in a couple of small puncture wounds. \u00a0\n\n\n\n> He is reactive to/with other reactive dogs.\u00a0\n\n\n\nHe is reactive with other dogs. \u00a0The other dog\u2019s reactivity is not your place to judge, focus on, \u00a0nor resolve.\n\n\n\n> our lab doesn't correct him\u00a0\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be blunt, It\u2019s your job.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> anything we do during interactions with other dogs makes no difference in the moment.\n\nThis is the reason to consult a ACVB trainer \u00a0\n\n> Last night we gave the dogs some very high value treats that they've never had before: pig snouts.\u00a0\n\n\n\nImho Not recommended in the same room \u00a0for any reactive dog that has had scuffles resulting in injury \u00a0\n\n\n\n> I had taken it a couple of times to put a blanket underneath him to chew over and had no issues taking the snout.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFor a reactive dog only ever take something if you trade for something of higher value \u00a0\n\n\n\n> Our orange tabby cat walked by Pascal and he growled\n\n\n\nA resource guarding warning rather than playful , no?\n\n\n\n\n\n> I immediately got up and moved the cat and confronted Pascal. I got near his face and said \"no\" strongly several times, he is usually responsive to my corrections.\n\n\n\nPunishment tends to be not recommended here. Rewarding behavior and shaping the environment in advance to avoid problems is wiser.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> \u00a0I should have taken the pig snout then, but for some dumb reason I didn't.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNo, he should have been given the pig snout in a secluded area away from people and animals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> pinned Cal by this neck.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDominance theory? \u00a0Not recommended. See the Wiki/About here on dominance theory. \u00a0this is actually horrible and making your issues worse.\n\n\n\n> We took him out in the backyard right after that on leash and harness for everyone to calm down.\n\n\n\nIn other words this is the separation that would have been helpful prior to giving the pig\u2019s ears.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> He is on a leash and harness in the house and my fiancee is watching like a hawk and giving him the \"leave it\" when he even looks at one of the cats.\u00a0In the past, both dogs will run after the cats until they retreat to one of the \"cat only\" places we have in the house.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNot all dogs belong in a household with cats.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> we actually have an appointment for a trainer to come to the house next week to evaluate Pascal and teach us more ways we can be training him.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWorking with a non-ACVB trainer could be a huge mistake.\u00a0\n\n\n\n> I don't really believe in returning a dog to the shelter or rehoming just because you decide you just don't want the dog anymore.\u00a0\n\nRight \u00a0but for the safety of your previously owned animals it might be the most responsible choice \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n> \u00a0This new event just makes me wonder if I'll ever be comfortable with him in the house and around the cats and the lab.\u00a0\n\n\n\nYou might want to take your father\u2019s gut feeling and your nieces safety into consideration \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n> \u00a0It also seems unfair to re-home him because we are the most stable thing he's ever had and is absolutely in love with us and the lab.\n\n\n\nIf you keep him in a setting with other animals and it escalates to a bite pattern, not only is it not considering the safety of others, it will increase the possibility of Pascal being euthanized \u00a0\n\n\n\nSome dogs belong in homes without children and pets \u00a0",

                    "body": "Thank you for your breakdown and thoughts! We are definitely learning a lot and are already implementing most of what you have said. The trainer we've reached out to is an ACVB trainer - getting that started next week.\n\nIn the shelter, Pascal regularly played with 10+ dogs at a time. They said he did great in the large group play rooms and never had any issues. My coworker volunteers there and said he was fantastic with her kids (8 and 13, so slightly older than my nieces). So that was a big factor in our decision. I will say, they called him a lab and we had never heard of a ridgeback and he only has a ridge when his hackles are up. We have obviously knew he wasn't just a lab but thought he could be a mix. Knowing what I know now about hounds and ridgebacks I wouldn't have gotten one (personal preference).\n\nIt's weird about the treats bc we have given them tons of high reward treats in the past, both in his crate and isolated and out and about. Pig ears, beef tracheas, etc. and he's never guarded any of them. He and the lab trade their chews often, even. I can see how the snout seemed more like food, though. He has only ever guarded his spot on the bed, which we use a treat to lure him off. He's never guarded his food or any other treat. \n\nThe pinning by the neck was not something we have ever done before and in my reading after this incident I have since learned that it is detrimental.\n\nI look forward to working with a pro and seeing what we can do with him.",
