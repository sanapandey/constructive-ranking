    "selftext": "Hi guys I\u2019m currently trying to train my Lab/pitbull mix basic obedience skills but ultimately would want him to train for protectiveness. My question is could I retrain him in Czech language after teaching him in English. Or do you guys think I should use Czech when it comes to protectiveness only?? Thank you in advance ",
