    "selftext": "Hi everyone! I recently adopted a 5yo French Bulldog. She's a total snuggle bug and lover, but she's a former mill mama and doesn't like to share me with my cat.\n\nMy cat is doing better with her than he ever has done with a dog, but when the cat tries to jump on my lap or snuggle, she will either growl at the cat or try to snap at him.\n\nHow can I help her so she doesn't feel like she needs to resource guard me? I want to be able to snuggle my cat without drama. \n\n  \nThanks in advance!",

Set up a comfy place for your dog to lie near-ish where you sit - eg a comfy corner 2m away. Do this without your cat in the room. Ask your dog to go lie down there. Click and reward. Keep rewarding by throwing a treat in there every so often and telling him he\u2019s doing good. When he\u2019s consistently lying down, relaxed - might take a few days - move onto step 2\n\n2. Get your dog sitting happily in his happy corner. Introduce the cat slowly. Ideally a friend would come into the room holding the cat, but not sit close to you. Be super good at rewarding the dog sitting calmly. He may get up. Try again, or end the session and try again later, or work more on step 1. (if he\u2019s very reactive, you\u2019ll need to work lots on step 1 before introducing cat. And go very slowly. In an extreme case, if he really goes mad on seeing the cat, you could try excluding him for 1min (taking him to another room) when he goes mad but that is rarely necessary)\n\n3. Gradually move the cat closer to you. So maybe your friend would sit closer to you. Always keep rewarding dog. Rinse and repeat. Until the friend is giving you the cat but your rewarding and praising doggo lots.\n\nEventually doggo will learn that it\u2019s great to sit in his comfy corner watching you with the cat because then he gets tasty treats.\n\nGeneral tips \n- make sure you\u2019re using treats he really likes \n- try when he\u2019s had a good walk and is more relaxed \n- make sure he\u2019s getting lots of affection generally",
