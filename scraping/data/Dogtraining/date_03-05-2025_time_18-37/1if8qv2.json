    "selftext": "My girlfriends pup is 6 y/o. He had some developmental issues which make him unsteady on his hind legs. They are actually longer than his front legs.\n\nHe has never been willing to go down more than 2 steps at a time. I have been working with him for a while and now he is getting more comfortable on my staircase, but this is not transferring to other stair cases. He also can not do top to bottom,  but he can do most of the way up to the bottom. He is too scared to start the process but will finish it if put in the middle.\n\nHe can climb stairs, but will not climb my stairs, we think because of the gaps between them.\n\nAny tips/techniques/guidance? It would be really cool if this little guy could do stairs on his own.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1if8qv2/video/qj787u7mqjge1/player\n\n",

That will tackle the root cause of his difficulties and then the stair stuff will be helped by it too. There\u2019s a Facebook group you should check out called Canine Conditioning and Body Awareness Exercises.",
