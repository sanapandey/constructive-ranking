    "selftext": "Hello! I have a bernedoodle puppy who is SUPER SMART and a breeze to trian...for most things. Within the first two weeks I got him, he's picked up 'sit' 'stay' 'shake' 'spin' and sort of got 'lay down'. \n'Lay down' gets a weird reaction from him, like he doesn't like to do it. I'll say the command, and sometimes he'll bark, or whine, or do a little tantrum dance or run away. He just hates 'lay down' . I trained him by first luring him to the ground with treats and then gradually started trying to remove the lure, and that's when he started reacting poorly to it. Not sure what is going on with him, and I am wondering if anyone else has dealt with a dog who reacts oddly to a specific command, yet will learn others with ease? ",

Most often, it just says \"poor training\" but doesn't give any practical advice. I have some decent experience with training dogs in the past, and have never encountered this, and also given that he is picking up everything else i am teaching him, I am wondering if there is something deeper going on here. Insight from others would honestly be so helpful right now.",

            "body": "You can reward \u201cstay\u201d after he is down. Also mark the down with \u201cgood\u201d each time before the treat. Then stay and immediately \u201cgood stay\u201d and treat. Then you can increase the time of stay and treat again. So you\u2019re not just asking down but stay as well and increasing duration but giving treats while down. So now the act of downing isn\u2019t a barrier since more treats are flowing.  Perhaps the first few times either he popped up and still got a treat or he got frustrated in that down position without reward?  Just guessing tho. The history isn\u2019t as important as just moving forward with a positive action. Let me know if this helps!",
