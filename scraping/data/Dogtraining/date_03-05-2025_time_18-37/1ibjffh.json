    "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI have a 3 year old small dog. I live in an apartment so he has been trained to go to the bathroom while on leash on walks. I\u2019m in a city so he is almost never off leash outside (it wouldn\u2019t be safe). I\u2019ve recently started to go to a cafe nearby where I bring him inside with me to order.  He has pooped inside twice!! He also did this at a different cafe when I was visiting my family out of town. I have never had an issue with him pooping inside before so this is very strange to me. My guess is he thinks he can poop anywhere where he is on a leash? He has only pooped inside when he\u2019s been on leash. Does that make sense as a reason? Any advice on how to stop this behavior? \n\nThanks!\n\nAdditional info: I do have a different leash a and harness I can train him with if people think that will help and the leash is a cue for pooping, but ideally I\u2019d like to keep using the one I have cause I love it.

Also I think this doesn\u2019t fall into general house training - he doesn\u2019t go to the bathroom while inside UNLESS on leash",
