    "selftext": "I have a 4 yo mutt who is very smart and neurotic.  We have had cats since she was a puppy.  She used to be friendly with our cats but about 6 months ago she started chasing them away if they try to come near us when she is around.  She is still fine with cats unless the cats are getting attention from us.  Can someone please help me make a training plan to help this behavior?",
