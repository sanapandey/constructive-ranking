    "selftext": "Hi all! I have a 13 week old Amstaff puppy and am just looking for some advice/input on where we are at with training. \nI am going to list what he does know, with some info on each topic to give as much info as possible. Then I am going to list things I am very much interested in mastering. \nI guess I am just looking for some reassurance that we are on track given his age, and also some tips, tricks, advice on bettering the foundation we do have. \n\nWhat he knows:\nSit - will typically sit at any time, without fail and no treat necessary\n\nLay down - he will lay down with a treat but I have to bring my hand to the ground with the treat, he will not lay down if I am standing and just give the command\n\nPaw - he will almost always give paw with a treat, sometimes without one as well\n\nCome - he does know come, but if there are many distractions he absolutely does not listen. Sometimes will come without a treat, often time will come with a treat, but again not 100% if distracted. I work in an office so when he is seeing all the people and getting love and attention, he has no desire to listen to the come command\n\nStay - we are working on stay, he will usually stay while I take a few steps backwards, but too much  distance he won't hold the stay \n\nPotty Training - he is using the bathroom outside with minimal accidents. Sometimes he will start barking for no apparent reason, which I take him out and usually he will poop. I can also notice when he starts sniffing a lot and his butt puckers that he needs to poop. He will pee everytime I take him outside, however it seems if he needs to go there is no sign or warning, he will just go on the floor - this doesn't happen very often because I ensure to take him out atleast every hour and/or after waking up from a nap, playing, and shortly after eating/drinking\n\nCrate training - he seems to enjoy his crate. Very seldom does he whine or bark. He has stopped trying to bolt out of it when put in, I do not need to push his head in to close the crate. Sometimes he will go in on his own for a lay down. He does not seem to understand the command of going in though. I have been using \"house\" as the name and have thrown treats in while saying house, and say yes when he goes in. He just does not seem to be catching on though and will not just go in without being placed in. He sleeps in his crate at night time and now goes usually a full 8 hours without making a noise.\n\nFeeding - he definitely understands when his food times are. I feed him in his crate to give positive associations. I have a slow feeder that I use at breakfast and lunch, and a snuffle rug for dinner. He will sit when I have the food, but as soon as I move to place it down, he goes insane and bolts for the bowl. If I hold him back it's like he is running in the air. He just does not stay calm enough or even \"stay\" at all.  That being said, he shows no sign of food aggression, I can touch him and take his bowl away without issue \n\nLeash Training - I have had him on a leash since 8 weeks old to take him out for pottying as I am in an apartment and cannot let him loose outside with all the cars. He will walk short distances (from my building to the next building where my work is) but often times he will sit down and then start pulling backwards if he does not want to walk. He will on occasion pull as well if he really wants to go somewhere. He also will try and bite his harness everytime while I am putting it on, and also will bite his leash when putting it on. \n\nThings I really want to work on/improve/master:\n\nBarking - he definitely is a talker. However he can be so sassy.. if he is doing something wrong and told \"no\" sometimes he will just bark back. When he is hyper and has the zoomies, he will often just bark so loud at me and not stop. If you tell him \"shh\" or \"no\" he will bark more. \n\nInteracting with Cats - I have 2 cats, one of which is completely segregated as she will 1000% attack him if he goes close. The other cat is very friendly, however the puppy just chases and tries to pin him down. The cat has given him a few smacks with his paw (without claws out) but the puppy will not approach him calmly.. he sees him and will immediately chase. When the cat jumps out of reach, puppy will sit and bark at the cat continuously and will not come when called. I'd really like for him to stop chasing and be gentle with the cat. \n\nRecall - as mentioned above he does know come, but I want it to be immediate, and happen with distractions as I eventually want to allow him off leash. \n\nLeave it - I want to ensure again, that he can safely be off leash and leave things alone if the pose a danger. I also think this will help with the cats if he can understand and leave them alone as well when told \n\nLeash training - I want him to walk on a loose leash, by my side and not pull to race to where he wants to go. Also would like him to stop trying to bite the harness and leash while it is being put on\n\nCrate training - would like him to go in when told, as opposed to needing him to be placed in\n\nFeeding - I want him to be able to sit and wait for a release word before going after the food, instead of trying to plow through me as soon as I try and place the bowl down \n\n\nI feel like I have a pretty good foundation started, and I know its not always helpful to compare, but sometimes I see puppies that look his age or even younger, mastering things he is just not grasping and I want to ensure I set myself and him up for success to be an amazing dog! \n\nThank you so much to anyone who made it this far!! I appreciate any/all advice and feedback ",

            "body": "For feeding I slowly put the bowl down. If dog moves towards the bowl I lift the bowl back up. Then slowly back down. I kept doing this until I was able to put the bowl down completely. Then I say \u201cokay\u201d for them to eat. In the beginning just wait for a single second of waiting until giving them the release. Slowly up the time for them to wait. You can do multiple reps of this each meal time, like only put a portion of their food in the bowl for them to eat. Does that make sense?\n\nI don\u2019t make my dog wait a crazy long amount of time I just wait for them to look at me.",

            "body": "Hello! Like you said, I think it\u2019s important not to compare you and your dog to others since each person\u2019s situation is different. It seems like you\u2019re doing great and might want to work on fading the lure/treats when training. \n\nFor my dog, I always started by luring with the treat in my hand until he 100% got it every time. After many, many repititions of that, I \u201clure\u201d with my hand and wait to give the treat until *after* he completes the trick. I\u2019m extremely fast with marking as soon as he completes the task I gave him. Then you can make it harder for your puppy by adding in distractions or making it harder (i.e. at a distance). \n\nAlso in regards to leash walking, are you wanting to teach \u201cheel\u201d where your puppy never leaves your side, or just \u201cloose leash walking\u201d where your dog doesn\u2019t pull but can walk ahead/behind/sniff/pee/etc.?",
