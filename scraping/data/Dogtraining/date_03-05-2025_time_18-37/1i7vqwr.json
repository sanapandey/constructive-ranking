    "selftext": "So just a quick background my dog is a rescue pit who is super sweet but a little timid at times. We took him to a trainer for a 2 week board and train where he seemed to have learned sit and climb(somewhat) where he\u2019s normally pretty good at holding both positions until we release him. \n\nI have really wanted to start training him more seriously so I thought it would be fun to teach him down as an easy next step. He seems to have learned this command but now when training it\u2019s like he just goes between sit and down quickly because he knows are the 2 positions that get him rewards. What can I do differently so he\u2019s just not like going through all of the things he knows just to try to get the treat. I tried to like nudge him to sit back up with my foot if he goes down when I say sit but even after multiple training sessions of this it still seems to be what he wants to do even tho before he even knew down he could hold a sit no problem.\n\nI will try to get a video and post at a later time but wasn\u2019t sure if any advice could be given.",
