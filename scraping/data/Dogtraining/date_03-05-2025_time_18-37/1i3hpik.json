    "selftext": "My wife and I have two corgis, an 8yo male (Kingsley) and a 3yo female (Ruth). They get good exercise and are great dogs. They eat enough for their lifestyle and their weight has stayed consistent for years. And yet, our girl barks us awake every morning for breakfast\u2014this morning it happened at 4:45am. They sleep together in a gated off section of our bedroom.\n\nWhen she was a puppy, she would often do this, but it used to be connected to the sun rising\u2014earlier in the summer, later in the winter, which we could stomach. Lately, she\u2019s just begun deciding when to wake us up and we\u2019re sort of at our wit\u2019s end, but don\u2019t know what the fix is.\n\nI\u2019ve owned dogs for long enough to understand that this is probably our fault. I wake up early (5:30 or so) to exercise about 4 days a week, and I used to leave the bedroom without taking them out of their pen or giving them food, but after I left Ruth would begin barking and drive my wife crazy. In an attempt to help alleviate this, I began letting them out and feeding them on the mornings when I woke up, after which, the dogs are content to hop up onto our bed and sleep at my wife\u2019s feet until she wakes up around 7. These corgis are VERY food motivated and Ruth has clearly learned that when I wake up early, it\u2019s time to get breakfast and move to the better bed. The problems are that I don\u2019t wake up early every day of the week and that she no longer waits for me, which means a lot of sleep-in mornings have turned into 4:30 wake-up calls with anger and frustration  about how we\u2019ve let it get to this point.\n\nI know that this is our doing. I know that we\u2019ve reinforced that when she barks she gets breakfast and to go cuddle with my wife. What I don\u2019t know how to do is undo the damage and get Ruth to stop ruining our sleep. Waking up every morning to sharp corgi barking is killing me and starting my days off filled with adrenaline and anger. Do we just spend a couple of weeks ignoring her until a more normal breakfast time? Since I\u2019m often up and out of the house early anyway, I\u2019m also worried that my wife is going to bear the brunt of breaking this habit. \n\nPlease help us, r/dogtraining, you\u2019re our only hope.",

We have downstairs neighbors with toddlers who wake up early (between 4:30 and 5:30 every morning) and commence screaming and sprinting around the house immediately, which I think is Ruth\u2019s cue that it\u2019s time to wake up and have breakfast. Typically, her barking begins after the neighbors wake up. We have talked to the neighbors about this issue and nothing has changed. We have white noise machines and fans running to drown out the sound. We are in the process of finding a new rental, but until that happens, I don\u2019t think the A will change.\n\n  \nThe \u201dC\u201d we have tried to change by not letting them out of their pen after I wake up; shushing Ruth when she barks with our \u201cgo to bed\u201d command, which quiets her for \\~3-10 minutes at a time; and not feeding them immediately after waking up, as I spend \\~15 minutes getting ready before I leave the house. I know that we need to change the C, I just don\u2019t know what to change!",

            "body": "This is the method I used to change my dog whining early morning for me, and allowed me to sleep in later, which may work for you. It takes some patience, and you will have to wake up earlier than expected.\n\nSet an alarm 15-30 mins BEFORE your dog usually barks and wakes you up (I think it helps if the dog hears the alarm too). So if its 4:30, you need to wake up at 4:00 (yes I know its sounds really bad, but there is a method here). So you wake up, which in turn wakes them up at 4:00. Then the next day, set an alarm for 4:15, which again should wake them up not the other way around. Day after set it for 4:45, day after 5:00, day after 5:30, etc etc etc to whenever you feel is a normal time to get up (you can adjust the times you wake up and how fast you increase the times depending on if its working or not). More gradually push back the time at the beginning, so they understand. If you do it first day at 4:00 then next day 5:00 it likely wont work and they will bark at 4:30. Gradual to start, then increase longer later on if you want. This SHOULD hopefully gradually move your dogs internal clock back and by them not practising the behaviour of whining/barking to wake you up, you reverse the roles kinda, so they will wait for you to wake up usually. Eventually you shouldnt need the alarm anymore, but it can be helpful to keep using the alarm if its working. My theory is they will be waiting for the alarm noise, but eventually you will fade it out and it will never come, and they wont care anymore and just wait for you to wake up. At least thats how it worked for my dog. Im not sure if it will work for you but its worth a try maybe.\n\nIn terms of the food/barking issue, I dont really know the best way for that, but I would say as you push back the alarm, you can maybe feed them when you wake up if you want and again that feeding time will move back later and later to eventually you can just feed them when you wake up like normal.\n\nAlso exercise/mental stimulation definitely helps. If your dog is bored and not tired often, they wont want to sleep as much. When my dog is really tired, he will sleep forever.",

            "body": "Do they bark when you\u2019re feeding them also? Or just to wake you up? \nIf they bark when you are putting their food together, associate barking with stopping the food. Start putting it in the bowl. Put it down and walk away if they bark. Wait maybe 15 seconds after they stop barking, then go back and keep putting the food together. Repeat as long as it takes for them to quietly wait for food, and only make forward progress when they\u2019re not barking. It usually doesn\u2019t take long. Even one small bark and you have to stop making the food. \nIf they only bark to wake you up, then are quiet for food, the above won\u2019t work. But you can use a similar method to barking at night to go outside. If my puppy barked, I would wake up, take him outside and be as boring as possible, put him back and then go back to bed. If he did it immediately after, I\u2019d put him on a leash and do a lap in the house since I was sure he didn\u2019t need to pee. He learned that barking works if there\u2019s a bathroom emergency, which is good, but that barking does not get him attention at all, and that it was actually pretty boring when he barked. So he stopped. Since they\u2019re not barking to go outside, you can try to just associate it with the walking inside. Bark= walk on leash and be very boring around the house. When they figure out it doesn\u2019t get them food faster, they\u2019ll stop. You have to be very consistent though.",

When the music turns off, he knows I'll be coming in to let him out of his crate and for breakfast.  However, if I want to sleep in, I just turn the  Alexa back on that is next to the puppy's crate via the app on my phone. I've been able to get an extra hour of sleep this way! Lol. But usually, I tried to stick to a 6- 6:30 schedule. When we leave him at somebody's house to puppy sit, I've had reports that he wakes them up at 4:30 to 5:30 a.m. by barking, which he never does at our house. I suspect when there's no music, he just goes rogue and wakes up whenever he wants.",
