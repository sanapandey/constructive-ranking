    "selftext": "My puppy was born October 10th and has been with us since December 16th. She's had no problem adapting to the change, learning the commands I give her, and doing what she's told whenever I'm around. She'll very rarely have accidents inside and it's usually just a few dribbles on the carpet.\n\nThe only issue is I work 12 hours a day 5-6 days a week. The time I'm home, she listens Great, is cuddly, sweet, and a joy to be around. When I go to work, things take a 180. My partner punishes her the same way I do, rewards with treats the same way, and undergoes training with her the same way. And yet She'll intentionally piss on the floor or on my partner, bites them aggressively, and eats the other dogs' food after having plenty for herself.\n\nLike I said, she doesn't do any of this while I'm home and Google has told me it's likely she doesn't view my partner as a part of the hierarchy.\n\nThe puppy is an Australian Shepherd.",

            "body": "This is a really tough situation, I'm sorry. Dogs can (and do) have different relationships with the family and each relationship often has to be built up from the ground up. Your partner might not do anything wrong, it might just land different for your puppy. So I feel like one issue could be that their relationship not being stable enough and your dog struggling with separation from you.\n\nDoes your partner play or do fun things with your dog? Do they have a strong bond? What is their relationship like? A lot of dog training depends on the bond and relationship you otherwise have with the dog. In your partner's place, I would find it tricky to bond with your dog, so I have a lot of empathy for them, but they're kind of the adult & the human here, so they should take the first step :) Find ways or activities your partner and the dog can bond, learn to trust each other, with no punishment or pressure. That activity can also be the training they already do with treats and lots of positive reinforcement! Starting with easy tasks helps, so it becomes a fun experience your dog will look forward to.\n\n>She'll intentionally piss on the floor or on my partner, bites them aggressively,\n\nThese two of these sound like it could totally be fear-based. I would really ease off on punishments and focus on relationship-building here.\n\nRegarding potty: Your partner should make sure to follow a strict routine while you're away with enough play and exercise, maybe taking them out even a bit more often than you would. It's possible for example, that they feel a bit more uneasy without you, therefore sleep less, and dogs have to pee & poop more often when they're awake. Does she get enough rest during the day (for puppies that age it should be between 16-20 hours a day, truly wild...)?\n\nYour partner should also make a Very Big Deal out of every potty success with high value treats. Does your dog happily go outside with your partner to pee? Could it be possible that they find some part of that process a bit scary (like leashing, harnessing, getting a collar put on)? My partner is bigger than me and it took our rescue dog a bit of time to be just as ok with him harnessing her as she is with me doing it.\n\nRegarding the biting: if I were you, I would look up the dog ladder/scale of aggression. If a dog gets to snapping or biting, then it might be the case that their earlier signs have been missed. These \"skips\" could develop from honest mistakes, but it's good to look out for early signs of discomfort (like lip-licking, turning away, etc.). I would also consult an R+ (positive reinforcement-based) trainer here if your budget allows.\n\n>and eats the other dogs' food after having plenty for herself\n\nI would simply feed the dogs separately (separated with baby gates). Make the good thing easy, the bad thing hard.\n\nThere's also the issue of whether separation from you in particular is hard for your dog. Have you left her completely alone before (for even 10 minutes or a half hour)?  How does she do with that? I believe this can also be helped by your dog and partner's relationship improving, but where you can, you can sneak in a few times of leaving your puppy for shorter bursts of time too on days when you're otherwise home. In these cases I would crate them, but it's super important that your puppy already has a strong positive association with their crate before ever locking them in there, because that could make separation anxiety worse. You could feed them there, throw random treats in there throughout the day (play crate games), etc.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't put too much stake in the hierarchy-based approach. The alpha-theory of dog behavior is actually based on a big misunderstanding/oversight on the researcher's part. It was based on wolves (not dogs, who were a completely different evolutionary path partially based on their closer ties to humans and their families than their own packs) in captivity, in tight enclosements, who were really agitated and didn't know each other beforehand. So it does not even describe the natural behavior of wolves, let alone dogs. The scientist who first described it has denounced this idea and withdrew the theory himself.\n\n  \nGood luck and I hope y'all figure this out soon!",
