    "selftext": "We adopted a beautiful lab x golden retriever mix 3 years ago. He\u2019s gentle, loves the kids and they love petting and playing around him. However, he looks terrified all the time. If you roll a ball at him, he looks like he could evaporate. He runs off. I bought him toys and he hated them. I bought squeaky toys that all the dogs I had in the past loved, but this one ran away from it. I bought a Kong to stuff kibbles inside and get his mind busy but he pushed it far away from his side. I tried teaching him to play fetch a few times and he hated it. If I throw the ball a few feet away, he runs the other way. He ate the kibbles in my hand anyway. \n\nHe\u2019s been with us for 3 years but act like a stranger. He is well fed, groomed, vaccinated as required, completely cared for but he seems to be locked up in his mind. If I take him outside, he will play in the yard. He zooms around the yard and barks at me playfully. But he doesn\u2019t bark indoors and won\u2019t bark even if the house is crashing. He has no interest in engaging anyone. I placed a football next to him and he never moved an inch for hours because he didn\u2019t want to touch or move the ball. He just wants to sit in a spot, eat, sleep all day, poop and repeat the same tomorrow. \n\nI take him for walks every evening around the neighborhood and he heels well, enjoys walks but that\u2019s it. My kids feel disappointed sometimes when they place their toys next to him but he moves awkwardly like it bites. I don\u2019t know what his story is and wish to help him recover but my husband doesn\u2019t like him as much. He sees him as a burden and a boring guest, instead of a pet we should enjoy his company. He hinted getting rid of the dog a few times but I don\u2019t want to. I keep feeling he will come around but I don\u2019t know how long.\n\nHow can I help this dog?",
