    "selftext": "My 4 year old housetrained dog will not stop pooping inside. He is obviously marking his territory since he only does it near the kid's rooms or where other dogs have been. We walk him regularly and he has access to a large yard, but clearly prefers to mark. We are truly at our wits end and would love any advice. We try to catch him in the act, but he is sneaky. We thoroughly clean the carpet every time so there is no scent left. We are moving soon and are so nervous that the stress (he is already on an anxiety medication) may cause him to poop where he will have access downstairs. Any advice is so appreciated. ",
