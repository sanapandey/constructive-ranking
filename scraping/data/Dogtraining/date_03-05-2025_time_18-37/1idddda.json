    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019m looking for advice on how to stop my 11-month-old Cavalier x Beagle from scratching at doors whenever she\u2019s frustrated or can\u2019t access something she wants.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a response to being left alone\u2014she\u2019ll scratch at closet doors, baby gates, and even cupboard doors. The most obvious trigger is when one or both of us leave a room, even if she\u2019s not actually alone (e.g., my husband leaves, but I stay, and she still scratches). But she\u2019ll also scratch if something upsets her, like if our cat jumps onto a surface she can\u2019t reach. It feels like a tantrum rather than true separation anxiety.\n\nBackground & What We\u2019ve Tried:\n\n\u2022 Learned Behavior: She was neglected in her previous home, left outside on a concrete patio where she could see people inside but was ignored. She scratched compulsively at the sliding glass doors to try to get attention.\n\n\u2022 Well Crate-Trained: She settles perfectly in her crate and never scratches in there. She also doesn\u2019t mind baby gates as long as she can still see us.\n\n\u2022 Training & Reinforcement: \u2022\u2022\u2022 Rewarding calm behavior \u2013 We\u2019ve used marker words like \u201cquiet\u201d and rewarded her when she\u2019s calm, but it doesn\u2019t seem to translate to the door-scratching moments. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Ignoring the behavior \u2013 She eventually stops, but not before causing damage (she\u2019s nearly destroyed a door with a lockable doggy door in it). \u2022\u2022\u2022 Redirecting with toys/chews \u2013 Sometimes works, but when she\u2019s \u201cin the zone,\u201d she ignores them and goes right back to scratching. \u2022\u2022\u2022Exercise & Enrichment: She gets regular walks and playtime, including mental stimulation with training and puzzle toys. \u2022\u2022\u2022 Teaching an alternative behavior: We\u2019ve worked on commands like \u201cplace\u201d and rewarding her for staying in her bed or crate, but she won\u2019t generalize this when she\u2019s in a scratching mood. \u2022\u2022\u2022Interrupt & guide away \u2013 If we physically move her or pick her up, she stops, but that\u2019s not sustainable long-term. Calling her or squeaking a toy rarely works once she\u2019s fixated.\n\nWhat I\u2019m Looking For:\n\nHow do I help her unlearn this habit without making her feel ignored, since neglect is a big part of her past? Are there any other strategies we should try to break this frustration scratching?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

            "body": "Ohhh poor all of you in this situation! This must be so frustrating, especially since you're already doing so much!\n\nRather than a tantrum, I would approach it as a (maladaptive) coping or self-soothing mechanism. I would approach it from two angles: training and management (making sure she doesn't get to rehearse it in the meantime).\n\nManagement first:\n\n>Calling her or squeaking a toy rarely works once she\u2019s fixated.\n\nThis is gonna suck but try and catch her before she's fixated :/ I would say picking her up in this situation might not be a good idea. Her issue is already not getting to exercise her agency, picking her up might just make it worse in the long run. Have you tried doing a few tricks in a row with her in these situations (rather than just giving her a chew or calling her away once)? It might be helpful to keep her attention with a string of commands. If this is not helpful, keep her on a leash, especially when you know that a pottential trigger is coming up (like if one of you leaves, it could be worth tethering her to the other). If you both leave, crating her could be an option since she's comfortable with that, but looking out for signs of separation anxiety.\n\nTraining:  \nI agree with you that this does not look like pure separation anxiety (more like a general frustration tolerance issue), but it does seem like your departures cause non-zero distress for her. I think it would be worth doing a structured separation anxiety protocol (starting from just going to the door and then sitting back, I've seen it under the name of Door is a Bore).\n\nI would train to increase her frustration tolerance in general. It's super easy to do with food, you can start with things like having her wait a few seconds before dinner with her bowl on the ground already (you might be doing this already!), little games where you walk down a \"path\" of treats on leash (treats spaced out \\~2m/5ft on the ground and she has to wait to be released to each of them). You can also do it with toys: while playing tug, ask them to drop it while you hold on and she has to wait a few seconds before grabbing it again. If she finds toys more rewarding, I would actually start with food (whatever's easiest for her).\n\nBtw, with \"place\", could it be the case that you \"skipped some steps\" with generalizing the behavior? Can she do it when she's super excited (like a friend visiting)?\n\nThis is where I would start, but some other things that might work:  \n\\- Is it possible to provide her with situations where she \\_can\\_ dig (so activity-specific enrichment)? I'm thinking beaches, forests, sand pits and the like. Doing something similarly \"destructive\" could also help. My dog gets her kibble dinner from cardboard boxes and toilet paper rolls and she lives for that.  \n\\-You could also consider putting the behavior itself on cue: for example, get/make a scratchboard (a plywood board with sandpaper taped on it with double-sided tape) and teach her to \"scratch\". Putting a maladaptive behavior on cue sometimes helps with it being restricted to that environment.\n\n  \nGood luck with everything, your dog is so lucky to have humans like y'all who are willing to work so hard for her!",
