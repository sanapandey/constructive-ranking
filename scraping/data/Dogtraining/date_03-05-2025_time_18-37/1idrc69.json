    "selftext": "My four month old puppy has mastered going on the potty pads. However, he won't go outside. I even bring the pads out and give the command but he will hold it until we get inside. Within 5 minutes, he will go inside on the pad. I wish I could stay outside until he goes there but it's winter in New England and I work from home. I have stayed out up to 45 minutes! Is there anything else we can try? I read the guide and am following it as best I can. Didn't see anything about this particular problem though. Thank you!",
