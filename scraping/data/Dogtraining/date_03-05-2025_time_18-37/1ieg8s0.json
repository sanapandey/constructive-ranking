    "selftext": "My beagle just turned 1.  He is super loving and playful, but he is super anxious about anyone leaving.  That means someone leaving the car (with other people in the car), leaving the house(with or without other people with him).  He is too smart for his own good and knows when my wife and I are probably going to leave based off of cues like us getting ready.  He will know its coming and get anxious to the point where he shakes and hides and if you try and get him he gets defensive where he will nip/bite.  He mellows out once he in being held.  I have to put him in the crate because he will not go in if he suspects us leaving.  No amount of treats or peanut butter matter, he will ignore it until we come back.  We come back and he has done nothing but wallow in his sorrow and then go back in and take the treat somewhere else.  We leave the tv on, have a camera, put treats and lots of toys, doesn't matter.  He has to be in a crate because he is bites and tries to swallow things in the house.  We have a large and small crate, he likes neither of them.  He cant even have a bed in the crate now because he digs it up and I am scared he will have a belly full of bed when I come home.  He also jumps really high, and does this more when anxious and If i leave for a minute and he is by himself he ends up on the counter.. I am just at a loss what to do.  He also can be a big grump if you try and move him while he is sleepy.  On top of all of this he barks incessantly when anxious too. Thankfully we live in a rural area, but its annoying if he does it in the car for sure. We love him to death and are looking for a trainer but just curious if anyone has some suggestions.  We have been trying different methods and techniques since he was a baby but it has never gotten better no matter what we do. ",

With him being destructive when alone I am worried that a crate is the only option, even though the guide says crates are not suggested for true separation anxiety.  I am looking into a trainer but was hopeful for some suggestions or something from this community please. thanks",
