    "selftext": "Baby is 12 years old this month and for months now she does this bizarre thing when I take her out where she just sits in the grass and stares at me when she finishes taking care of her business. \n\nI originally thought she just wants to spend more time outside and enjoying nature but now I'm thinking she's just doing it to be a pain in the butt. I believe what happened is she originally started doing it because she wanted to relax outside but then I lured her in with a treat and now she believes she's entitled to one everytime she goes outside because she's literally just sit there and stare at me from across the yard.\n\nI've tried to go cold turkey on the treat offerings but if she catches me when I'm tired (she'll sometimes scratch my door to wake me up in the middle of the night if she really needs to go) I might offer her a treat so I can quickly go back to bed.  \n",

I get that the videos are intended for young dogs but whatever the outcome, they might teach you a different way to think about your dog more positively.\u00a0",

            "body": "This is the method our trainer recommended to teach recall. Maybe you would like to work on some of this when it\u2019s not a pee break (just to reinforce)?\n\nGet the best treats (meat, cheese, dried liver)\n\nDon\u2019t starve your dog but do practice when your pup is hungry, just before meals. Triple check to make sure (kibble + treats) that the pup isn\u2019t over fed.\u00a0\n\nStart easy (indoors, fewest distractions).\u00a0\n\nCombine calling (only once)\u00a0\u00a0with a body language signal (clap hands, slap your leg, etc). Dogs find signals/sounds/gestures easier than words.\n\nTurn and move away from your dog (as you call and do the gesture). Running away, for a dog, is like an invitation to come play. It makes it fun.\u00a0\n\nReact super excited when doggo comes:\u00a0\u00a0praise, rubs, play, dance, high pitched voice (it doesn\u2019t matter if the neighbors think you are crazy). It\u2019s like pooch just won the lottery. Over the top. Some owners make the mistake of patting/rubbing\u00a0\u00a0the dog\u2019s head as a way of saying \u201cGood boy\u201d but some dogs dislike that so they are less likely to come when called next time.\u00a0\n\nWhen you shift from indoors to outdoors use a long leash (attached to a halter not their collar) until they come 100% of the time.\u00a0\n\nNever call if they won\u2019t come. It\u2019s important not to practice/repeat them ignoring your calls. Hard to be consistent about this one. If she won\u2019t come on one call, she should be on a long leash.\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t call more than once.\u00a0\n\nIf your dog ignores you, don\u2019t up the reward to get them to come because this trains them not to come. If your dog ignores you, use the long line. End the training session and next time try it in an easier scenario (possibly indoors).\u00a0\n\nAvoid accidentally punishing your dog when it comes when called. For instance, if you call your dog to you but then do something to it that it doesn\u2019t like (give medicine, put a harness on, or a bath), then it\u2019s going to be very hesitant to come to you.\u00a0\u00a0During play sessions with other dogs, call your dog, after they come, then release to play (so they don\u2019t associate recall = leaving).\u00a0\n\nWhen it\u2019s urgent, don\u2019t get stern. Instead be cheerful and excited and turn to run away as you call. As if to say \u201ccome now and we\u2019ll have so much fun!!!\u201d (which works well) - rather than \u201cCome or else you are in **BIG TROUBLE** (which works less often).\u00a0\n\nPractice every single day, multiple times a day. Never stop.\u00a0",
