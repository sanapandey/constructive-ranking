    "selftext": "Hi all. \nI have a 2 yr old Corgi mix who is the sweetest most well behaved boy, and a 1 year old hound mix who is a menace to society with no socialization.\nThey have been in training classes for 6 weeks, him to build his confidence and her for.... everything, really.\nMostly it's gone well but we CANNOT break her of the jealousy with toys. \nIf we give them both the exact same toy, she drops hers and grabs his from him (he lets her). If we then give him the other toy, she drops it and takes it from him again. She really will not let him chew on ANYTHING. \nWe have been crating her with her toy while he chews on his and she refuses to chew on hers, instead just whining and barking. When she calms, I let her out and show her her toy, but when I let her go it's straight to his bone again, no matter what.\nDoes anyone have advice? I'm at my wits end. I just want my poor boy to enjoy his bone in peace.",
