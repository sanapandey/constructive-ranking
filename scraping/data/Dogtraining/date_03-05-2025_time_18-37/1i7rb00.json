    "selftext": "Adopted a dog from the pound. 10 month old, 22 pound mutt (probably chihuahua and something else). Had him for 6 weeks.\n\nFirst problem is reactivity. Barks and lunges at other people and especially other dogs on walks. Wouldn't stop barking at visitors and relatives. Accidently ran out my door without a leash twice. Barked at the mailman and another person but stopped lunging a few feet away.\n\nHas possible separation anxiety but that is improving. When I leave, WIFI camera shows he would whimper and howl for half an hour and then go to sleep.\n\nVery affectionate dog and follows me everywhere. However, snaps at me on several occasion. When I try to get it off my bed by grabbing his collar. When I touched his paws and nails just to get accustomed to nail cutting. When I a gave it a smooch on the head. He didn't bite me, but his tooth did scratch my forehead.\n\nBarks and whimpers all night when I leave it in his play pen or when I let it loose but shut my bedroom door.\n\nAm I expecting prescribed behavioral medication to fix this? I'm thinking of returning him to the shelter. It's only been 6 weeks, and I don't want him to bond with me too much. It's a small, young dog which often get adopted quickly. I live alone, so I figured a family can handle these problems better.",

Please let him be with a patient, loving family that will appreciate him, spend time with him and put the work in before you cause any more damage. Especially if he ends up biting you. That will make it almost impossible to rehome him.",

                    "body": "Thank you very much for the advice. This is my first dog. Addressing the criticism of saying that I should not have a dog because I thought about returning it, the shelter does allow fostering which can be as long as several months which they say will help the dog decompress. I considered fostering first but the person at the shelter said if I adopted, I have a 10 day trial period in which I can bring the dog back.\n\nAlso during fostering, if someone else wants to adopt the dog, you have to bring the dog back.\n\nSo if returning a dog is inhumane, why does the shelter have a fostering program?\n\nAlso I visited the dog several times for a month starting when the owner surrendered it on 11/24 and I adopted it in 12/24. This is after making frequent visits to the shelter for 6 months to look for the right dog.\n\nAlso I forgot to mention that the shelter informed me at the last minute that the dog was on anxiety medication (Trazodone) during the application process. This is due to the problem I mentioned. Barking, crying, and not sleeping all night in an enclosure like in my playpen. They never said I had to continue with the medication. \n\nKeep in mind, during that month, I had a printout of behavioral notes. Also had a meeting with the dog with the shelter volunteer. None informed me that the dog was on medication. Also the dog was sharing the kennel with a smaller dog and display no reactivity towards me or the volunteer. So I don't understand the reactivity to other people and dogs when I took it home. Maybe the dog was medicated in the shelter.\n\nThe dog bonded with me very quickly and is very clingy. He licks my face, ears, and lips. He even demands I pet it. So I don't understand why it snapped at me for the kiss.\n\nThe dog can sleep on the floor in my room but it jumps on my bed. Many times it is laying on my legs, so I can't move around. Since snapping at me on two occasions for trying to move he by the collar, I have since used treats to lure him off my bed. However, he will jump on the bed again sometimes throughout the night, and I have to repeat it. I close the bedroom door and he will whimper outside the door all night.",

The first 3 months were very difficult and we thought of taking her back, but ultimately decided against it.\n\nThere is no right answer and I can't tell you if keeping your dog is right for you, but I want to say what you are going through sounds normal and there is definitely hope that it will get better.\n\nWe definitely made mistakes with our dog, she is also our first dog also from a shelter so I feel like we are in a similar situation. What I wish I did differently the most is respect her boundaries, let her come to me and not let my expectations of what \"my dog\" needs to be to affect our relationship. This is going to sound weird, but your dog is also a person. He has boundaries, comfort levels, expectations, wants, etc. \n\nI really mean this: put your self in your dog's shoes. Imagine being an adopted kid, would you want a virtual stranger that brought you to his home kissing your head? You have no reason to think that you will stay in that home, you just wait and see what happens. It doesn't feel necessarily like \"home\", you've only been there 6 weeks. \nMay sound silly but I found it to apply to us. I have also kissed my dog and I also was snapped at, and looking back now I'm thinking \"That was very unfair to my dog who just found herself in a new situation which she doesn't understand, and I only kissed her because I felt like it, because she looks cute.\" I wouldn't want a stranger to kiss me because they think I'm cute or for some reason they think I belong to them. As I said, this is all from the perspective of the dog. \n\nHowever, because things feel difficult now doesn't mean they will stay difficult. Both you and your dog will learn about each other's habits and things will get easier. That doesn't mean it is right for you to keep your dog, only you can decide that. I just wanted to share my experience because I also had a similarly very difficult time. \n\nFeel free to comment under this and I will try to reply\n\nEdit to add: if your dog wanted to bite you, he would bite you. He is choosing to instead nip and send you a signal saying he is uncomfortable, it is up to you to learn to listen what he is saying",

It\u2019s also possible that it was the stress of being in a shelter that lead to it needing medication, and it might not need it anymore in a home. You can discuss this with your vet. \n\nJust because you want to have a cuddle with someone when you like them and you\u2019re sitting on the sofa together, doesn\u2019t mean that you will like it when they come up to you, hold you and kiss unexpectedly. Or that you will want to have a cuddle with them whilst you happily reading a book or engrossed in a game. You can choose when and what type of affection you would like from others, and your dog can choose what kind of affection, and when, it would like it from you. I hope that helps your understanding. \n\nIf the dog sleeps more happily it would likely be best to continue this. Continue to lure it back into its comfortable bed on the floor (some people will give the dog an old duvet that smells of them on the floor to help them adjust to sleeping on the floor and not on the bed) and you\u2019ll find in time the dog will happily sleep on the floor bed / duvet. Making it as comfortable and happy a place to sleep will help.",

Reactive dogs and dogs with behavior issues are NOT for first time dog owners, and if you don't understand dog body language you are setting both of you up for failure. It sounds like this dog is being as good as he can be and is really trying NOT to bite, but he is giving plenty of warnings. If you continue to ignore them, a bite history could literally get him killed. Even if the dog has no bite history, if he picks a fight while on a leash another dog can give very serious injuries. Small dogs tend to get horrible injuries on their butts and backs because they get picked up by the other dog while trying to run.\n\nThere's a huge \"once you have the dog, you can't ever give it up\" mentality, but it's harmful. Why would you want this dog to struggle in a house it is not comfortable in? Why would you want an owner to struggle bonding with a dog because it's not the right match? \n\nYes, this dog can absolutely settle and may have behavior changes for the better if you give him more time. But there is no shame in finding a home that is better suited for the dog if the settling doesn't happen. \n\nI'd vote for giving the dog more time, personally. Do your work looking into how handle reactive or fear-aggressive dogs. Learn how to set both of you up for success. If there is no change after 3-6 months, the RESPONSIBLE thing to do is re-home if you can not handle having a reactive dog.",

I\u2019d really avoid getting in the dog\u2019s space especially this early on. Let him come to you or initiate contact. Throw treats away from yourself/behind the pup. This gives the dog a \u201cretreat\u201d option. Don\u2019t worry yet about grooming. It can wait. Most dogs are pretty particular about their feet and don\u2019t appreciate them getting touched. \n\nAre you able to read signs that the dog is anxious? Sometimes it looks like excitement. It sounds like fear based reactions to me. Is there no warning before a bite? No growl or bark? You need to be nearby without invading the dog\u2019s space. Practice luring him when you need him to move and \u201ctrade\u201d if you need him to drop something. He will learn that you can be trusted, but you have to show him that you\u2019ll respect his bodily autonomy. So many people put their hands all in the face of little dogs.

Practice being in the same space while allowing the pup to decide how much contact is ok. My girl is a rescue and now I can kiss and cuddle her but that was not the case when we first met. She needed time and I had to learn to read her. I still back off when she\u2019s been handled a lot, we still throw treats away from ourselves especially after a bath, groomer or vet visit.

Vet care is expensive. \n\nThere\u2019s no point making comparisons between pets and children, it\u2019s just not useful. My pet isn\u2019t a person but she\u2019s a creature for whom I\u2019m responsible. In some ways it\u2019s worse than dealing with a human child, because you can at least explain what\u2019s happening if a child is a bit older. My poor pup was hurt and had no idea why or why she couldn\u2019t come home. It was hellish. If there\u2019s an upper limit on the amount of medical care you\u2019ll provide, well I just hope like hell nothing bad ever happens to your dog. I\u2019m not talking about an old dog who gets incurable cancer. My girl is young and healthy and that\u2019s why she was able to  bounce back with proper care.",

Sensitivity around collar and feet is pretty classic, someone used a collar to cause pain or pin the dog down.\n\nYou can probably fix it, but it will require a lot of training and positive reinforcement. You give the dog treats while doing something that makes them slightly uncomfortable, so they associate the bad thing with treats and becomes a positive association. I'd highly recommend a positive reinforcement only trainer to help you along the process. If you do it wrong it will compound the issue and make it worse.\n\nHowever, if you don't feel like you can give the dog that much attention and work, you're right, it would be best to give him back sooner rather than later.",

Medication at this age and at this stage of your adoption isn't something anyone would probably recommend or prescribe, because it isn't a long-term issue. Dogs need months to feel comfortable when adopted, and a big part of that is consistency. Resource guarding sounds like it might be an issue with furniture, so keeping him out of your bedroom (pressure gate in the doorway) is a good place to start.\nI would set up with a behavioral trainer and have a serious conversation about what will be involved time and effort wise. There's nothing wrong with deciding you aren't a good fit and giving the dog the opportunity to have a family that can provide that time. If you do decide to keep him, the training and time put in can end up being a great experience for you both as well.",

We wanted him to be a chill brewery dog that went everywhere. That was never going to be him. So, we set new goals for him (stop biting, be less stressed when meeting strangers).\n\nShe determined that he had some trauma about hands, so we did homework assignments daily with him (getting him to boop an open palm, downward facing hand, and closed fist with his nose for a high value treat and being pet from behind while someone else gave high value treat from front). We placed decoy dogs and used friends as decoys to learn his body language when he spots a \u201cthreat\u201d and how to reward him for not reacting. \n\nHe was 8 when we got him and lived another 7 years as a pretty good dog. He never ended up liking strangers, but he stopped biting them. The training was expensive and time consuming, but worth it.",

Has bitten me several times over the years. I love her. She loves me and is very attached. I know that if someone else had adopted her, they would have put her down long ago. I am so glad that I adopted her, even though sometimes she is quite vicious. She can be just that sweet too. I've gotten to know when to back off. When she calms down she always comes to me for a kiss. She is my baby. She is 8 now. She sleeps with me. Cannot be crated. Still pees in the house sometimes. But I love her and our cuddles. I'm bringing her to get groomed today and I know I will have a hard time. The groomer needs to muzzle her. She trembles the whole way there. When we get home we will eat, I will share my dessert with her, and we will cuddle and play. I may get bit trying to get her in the car, but I wouldn't give her up for anything. It was so hard in the beginning. It was well over a year before I learned exactly how to deal with her. Wherever I sit, she wants to be on my lap. She is very insecure, and is afraid of everything. I can t put her sweater on her without getting bit, but I've learned how to do it with the least amount of aggression. She needs lots of love and reassurance. I love her so much. I need her love as much as she needs mine. Be patient. Be loving. It's a long hard road, but it's worth it. I am still coping with a vicious dog, but I've learned how to deal.

You sound hesitant with working with him or even keeping him. Probably be best to find a rescue that can adopt him with the reactivity if you go this route of getting rid of him.\n\nBut if you do consider another dog I wouldn\u2019t recommend getting any random shelter dog. Find a dog you would feel comfortable with and know the history of the dog before deciding to take a dog home. Maybe do so research on dogs and figure out what dog would better suit you. \n\nThis is something that is not an easy decision, if you really love this dog then work on his behaviors and research what to do. If you don\u2019t then please take some time alone again before getting another dog. Research behaviors of dogs and come to terms that any dog will still need training, bathroom breaks and plenty of love and compassion before getting a dog.",
