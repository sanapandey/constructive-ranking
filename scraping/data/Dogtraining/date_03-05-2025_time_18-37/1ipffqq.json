    "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI have a 7 year old corgi and adopted a  3 month old shepherd mix 2 weeks ago. I raised the corgi from when she was 9 weeks old and she is well behaved other than hating the car. She is hesitant to go in, won't accept treats in the car, and pants and trembles the entire time. As a pup, I used to take her to the dog park frequently and she was not anxious in the car then. I can't quite pinpoint when it started, but it developed over time and never went away. The vet prescribed anxiety medicine, but all it did was make her seem frozen in fear. She rides in her bed, in a hammock in the backseat.\n\nI recently adopted a 3 month old shepherd mix, and would love to drive to see family and take both dogs (~3 hrs) but am concerned the older dog will pass her anxiety to the puppy. I've been slowly introducing the puppy to the car and going for short rides (she is in a soft crate) but she still cries as soon as she runs out of peanut butter in her Kong.\n\nIs the anxiety passing to the puppy inevitable? If I can get the puppy to be confident in the car first, could her confidence positively affect the older dog? Just not sure what to do, but trying to avoid 2 car anxious dogs at all costs! They are friends and play together in the house.",
