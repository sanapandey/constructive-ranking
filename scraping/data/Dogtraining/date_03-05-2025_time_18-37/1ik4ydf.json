    "selftext": "We have an 11yo female Maltese dog that was previously house trained well without accidents. She recently started peeing inside again and although we've really tried every tip in the book we can't get her to stop.\n\nWe adopted her over a year ago after her previous owner went to an elderly care home. She had a hard time getting used to living with us but she's changed so much and seems much more at ease now. But even when she was very stressed there were never any accidents. \n\nSo she started peeing inside a few months ago. We've been to the vet, she's had labs, ultrasounds and every possible test done but there seems to be nothing wrong with her medically. And she's deliberately peeing inside, it's not accidental urine loss. She doesn't seem confused, she always pees in the same spot and knows really well not to do it when we're around. So it doesn't seem like dementia either.\nWe've tried letting her out more, tried positively reinforcing peeing outside, tried crate training but nothing seems to work in the long term. She won't pee in the crate nor will she pee somewhere else if she doesn't have access to that particular spot. But as soon as she has unsupervised access to that spot she'll do it again. It's like she decided this place is her personal toilet. Unfortunately we can't restrict access to that spot permanently since it's in our main living area, but it's behind a corner so we can't keep an eye on it all the time.\n\nWe're really desperate, she gets angry when we try to send her outside more often and she even bit my husband a few times when he picked her up to go pee. We have a baby and small child, so we can't keep her if she's aggressive, we don't want our kids to be crawling around in dog pee and rehoming is not an option since she's so anxious. I'm really hoping for a tip that will work because I feel like we're out of options.",

            "body": "What are you using to clean the accident? Dogs have a much better sense of smell than people do, so even if you can't smell it anymore, your dog likely can. Unless you're using an enzymatic cleaner, such as Nature's Miracle. You can't use Lysol or soap and water to clean it. \nSince it's only in the one spot, it's likely because she can still smell the urine. To dogs, if it smells like a bathroom, it is a bathroom. She will continue to pee here if you don't clean it with an enzymatic cleaner. \n\nWhat's your reaction to your dog when you catch her in the act of peeing in that spot?",
