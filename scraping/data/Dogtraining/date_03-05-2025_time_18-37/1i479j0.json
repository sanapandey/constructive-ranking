    "selftext": "I am going to try to keep this from being too long. I have been training dogs for 22 years and own my own dog training business, but that doesn't mean that I don't learn something every day from other people and trainers. I am seeking advice for my own dogs.\n\nI have 5 dogs. Female Lab, spayed 9 1/2 years old. Male Aussie, Neutered 5 years old. Male Golden Retriever, neutered 5 1/2 years old. Male Golden Retriever, neutered 3 1/2 years old. Male Golden Retriever, will be neutered at the end of this month, 15 months old.\n\nMy issue is with my 3 1/2 year old Golden Retriever, Flynn. He is the first dog I've ever purchased from a breeder and I made a mistake with choosing the breeder. He's drop dead gorgeous, but is timid and has anxiety. When he was younger I took him to training classes, took him with me on errands where dogs were allowed and had him around other dogs all the time. He is very (overly) attached to the 5 1/2 year old Golden. They are best buddies and inseparable. That is the only one of our other dogs that he's never gotten into a scrap with.\n\nThe biggest issue he has is our youngest Golden, who is a very easy going, typical Golden. We brought the youngest home when he was 10 weeks old. Immediately I noticed that Flynn was \"weird\" about him, enough so that I did not trust him around the puppy unless I had the puppy on a leash or the puppy was crated. I just figured it would take time, but it never changed. Flynn's body language will stiffen up if the youngest even sniffs him. When the puppy was 4 months old, my husband decided to take him, Flynn and the oldest Golden out on the deck to play. It made me incredibly anxious, so I stayed in the house. The three of them played together fairly well (I could see them through the door). After 30 minutes or so, they all laid down around my husband's chair. Unfortunately, my husband was looking at his phone so he didn't see what the trigger was, but Flynn attacked the puppy. My husband pulled him off, but then lost his grip and Flynn went after him again. By then I was out and pulled Flynn off and put him in the house. Fortunately the puppy only had a torn ear and didn't need vet care.\n\nI contacted a veterinary behaviorist and drove 3 hours with Flynn and the puppy about a month later to see her. I was rather disappointed. All she did was listen to my story and then put Flynn on the fluoxetine (which I agree he needed). She didn't even want to see what I meant about weird body language by having me bring the puppy in on a leash (Flynn never approached the puppy to attack him or growl at him, he only did that if the puppy approached him to smell him). \n\nFlynn had gotten into it several times with our Aussie. It got to the point where the Aussie could no longer go out in the yard when Flynn was out there. Flynn has also gone after our Lab one time. The one trigger I've noticed is that if the other dog growls at Flynn, his immediate response is to attack. All the dogs live in harmony in the house (both Flynn and the Aussie are on Fluoxetine), except the puppy who has to be crated if Flynn is out of our bedroom, so our lives are basically crate and rotate. The puppy gets along with all the other dogs just fine. \n\nHere's the weirdest part for me. Flynn ADORES the puppy when the puppy is in his crate. He goes over with perfectly relaxed and happy body language and kisses him through the crate. Every night, the puppy goes out last and then he comes back to the bedroom to his cubby (a closet I turned into his bedroom) and gets some loving from me while Flynn stands and watches, then the puppy goes into his cubby and I close the gate and Flynn is right there kissing him and wagging his tail with relaxed body language. My feeling is that Flynn knows the puppy can't \"get him\" when he's crated, so he can be friendly and relaxed. Last night the puppy walked over to Flynn before going outside and Flynn immediately stiffened up and as I reached over to move him away, he was growling (at the puppy). Then the puppy came in and went into his cubby and Flynn was kissing him.\n\nSince the behaviorist wasn't able to help, we've just been managing them. It's winter here now, but after the puppy is neutered and it warms up some, I plan on walking the two of them together every morning in the hopes it might create some sort of bond with them.\n\nSo I am hoping that someone here might be able to shed some light on something I can't figure out.\n\n ",

            "body": "what's our ideal scenario?  Are you aiming for complete integration or just peaceful coexistence through management?  I assume you've ruled out any pain issues - joint pain etc?  Has a pain trial been done?  \n\nSure sounds like Flynn has a bubble around him that he doesn't like being invaded.  How does Flynn do on parallel walks?  What have you tried so far to help build Flyn's confidence - especially since being put on fluoxetine?  \n\nWondering if you could consider training a flight cue or an emergency disengage to help redirect him when he's feeling tense near other dogs.  This could give him an alternative choice rather than fight.  Have you done a co-relaxation protocol?  I'd do this with a barrier between the two for safety...   leash if necessary.",

                    "body": "Ideally I'd like them to peacefully co-exist. I don't know if I can ever trust Flynn to be alone with the puppy. There is no pain as far as I know, we've had x-rays done on Flynn when he was younger because he was chewing the hair on his ankles and I wanted to be sure it wasn't because of pain, now I realize it's like a human biting their nails. He's also a flea nibbler on our bed, but only on our bed, when he's really happy.\n\nFlynn's bubble is only with the puppy. The Aussie has a bubble with all the dogs, he doesn't want them in his space and now they all respect that.\n\nAny time the puppy is out on his way either to bed, or to the door in the morning, I always use a very happy, upbeat tone when speaking to him, so he doesn't associate the puppy with being scolded. He's always very happy go lucky in those situations, as long as the puppy doesn't approach him.\n\nThe walks will start soon, the puppy gets neutered tomorrow and our weather has finally warmed up enough where we can get a good morning walk in. I do think that might help because I'll only be taking Flynn and the puppy (after the puppy heals).\n\nWhen the puppy was younger, I would put him on a leash and have him hang out with me and the other dogs, but there was never initiation on  Flynn's part to meet him. I do think it's a fearful reaction. I know at the breeder's house, they had the 12 puppies and 8 adult dogs. One of the adult dogs was a Jack Russell mix and she was very possessive over her ball and would go after the puppies if they even looked at the ball. Also, they had two older cranky dogs who were food possessive. This breeder had the puppies out with these adult dogs from the time they were 6 weeks old, so I can't swear he didn't have something happen during his early fear period.",
