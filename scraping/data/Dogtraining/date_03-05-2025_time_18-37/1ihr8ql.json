    "selftext": "Hello. I have a one year old Jack Russell/Blue Heeler mix. He\u2019s a great dog and is very smart. However, he likes to take off and sprint around our allotment and unfortunately he\u2019s extremely fast, so if he doesn\u2019t want to come back or be caught he won\u2019t be. He always comes back on his own and knows exactly where he lives. This is causing some issues with our HOA neighborhood. We have little kids so he gets out when they open the doors to leave for school etc. This happens maybe a handful of times a month. \n\nIs this something I can curb somehow or hire a trainer for? ",
