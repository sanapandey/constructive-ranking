My sister is currently fostering her and loves her.\n\nShe has separation anxiety where she has destroyed the blinds so she stays in her crate while my sister is gone.\n\nI have a cat that likes her personal space so I want to set up our place so my cat has her space and the dog has her own. But the dog needs space where she won\u2019t destroy anything.\n\nThe dog likes to sleep in the bed as she feels safe this way, but the way my house is set up I would prefer to keep her on the main floor while we sleep so it can be \u201cher\u201d space and upstairs can be my cats space while they are getting used to each other.\n\nIs it okay to keep her downstairs while we sleep? Will this help with her separation anxiety or make it worse?\n\nI do plan to get her trained and seek professional advice on how to help her anxiety. But I am just wondering if it\u2019s even a possibility to get her at this point with the layout of the house.\n\nPlease only opinions from people who are professionals or have personal experience.",

Even if you need to replace the crate so your sister still has one.  Changing environment is going to cause some upset in the dog's routine.  \n\nYou need to rebuild a healthy routine and it should not involve over attachment so the dog does not freak out when it's left alone. \n\nSo don't give over emotional greetings when you come home. Don't make a huge show when you leave. And you don't spend 100% of your time while you are home with the dog under your feet. That's going to be hard with that particular breed but the dog needs to learn how to be independent. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable for the dog to sleep on the first floor of your house, in its crate if necessary.  \n\nIt's actually advisable that you not give a dog the full run of your house when it first comes home.   In the beginning it's best if the dog, with its crate, is spending most of its time in one room. Preferably the room nearest to the exit to the yard because you may need to review toilet training. \n\nThis breed also needs lots of exercise and mental stimulation which it should get first thing in the morning so that it is not full of energy and anxiety when you leave the house.  \n\nHighly recommend you find someone in your area who is very familiar with this breed/breed mix and get some training.",

It's impossible to be in the main living area of the house by yourself.   \n\nYou can crate the dog.  Cover the crate.  The dog will be aware you are there if you're moving around the room, and can smell you, but can't see you.  Even if you only do this for a few minutes, do it several times a day. You can also work on a place cue.  'place' can be the dog's bed, a special mat. You teach the dog to go to that place and settle down and stay there until they're released.  It's handy when you want them to wait for their meals to be served, or not rush the door when somebody comes to visit.  It's not some spot in your house to sit there and wait with anxiety, they have to learn to be calm when they are on their 'place'.   \n\nAnd just not constantly interacting with the dog.   Some dogs try to 'velcro', and want to sit on your lap, or be physically in contact with you. Don't let them.  \n\nDo your own thing.  Read, watch TV, knit, whatever you like that doesn't involve the dog \n\n   Since I take in other people's dogs, and I have a foster coming later this month, I have cameras. I can take a break and go to the bathroom and watch them on the camera. I can go outside for a couple of minutes to walk out to get the mail. Putter in my garden, shovel my walk. Do laundry, cook a meal.   House cleaning!  Which is the perfect time to ban the dog to the crate, cover it with a sheet, vacuum, mop the floors, dust.   \n\n It doesn't seem like much but these short times not directly interacting with your dog, or leaving him alone and then coming back are very reassuring to a dog who does suffer from separation anxiety.\n\n Especially if you go through all the motions you would normally do to be gone for a longer time... You gather your things, use the potty before you leave, take the dog out to go potty before you leave, you gather your coat, your bag, your keys, water bottle.   Looks like you're going to be gone for hours, but then you're gone for 5 minutes, just to watch them on the camera to make sure they're not freaking out.",

            "body": "I agree that the dog needs to be cat tested first. This is because Malinois can have a high prey drive and it only takes one mistake and you could lose your cat. The cat was there first, so before adopting or taking in any dog make sure that both cat and dog can be with each other. \n\nI have two cats, they are ten years old and I've had three rescues and am fostering one right now. One of them was a Galgo (Spanish greyhound), the other were also hunting breeds. \n\nThe first thing you should do is test the dog to see how it behaves around the cat. The shelters and organizations where I adopted the rescues from, do it this way: \n\n1. Make sure both cat and dog are in their respective crates either in your or your sisters house, somewhere familiar.\n2. Make sure the dog can see the crates cat from a safe distance, a few feet. \n3. Observe how the dog reacts to the cat. Does it whine, bark, paw, and try to get at the cat? Lunge? Act anxious or nervous? Does it ignore the cat? \n\nIf the dog shows aggressive or very fearful behavior: lunging, snarling, hackles raised, teeth bared etc. game over. We're talking about an adult dog here that could easily kill a cat. \n\nAlso, pay attention to body language a closed mouth, hard stare, stiff posture and silence doesn't mean that the dog is friendly, it means that it's fixated on the cat and might still go after it if the cat were to move, run or show prey like behavior.\n\nIf the dog is very interested in the cat, whining, barking and trying to get to it, this can signal a high prey drive, frustration or simple curiosity, but know that this type of behavior means that the dog will most likely chase or follow the cat around the house. I wouldn't allow a dog like this access to the cat, because even if the intentions of the dog are good, the cat might get spooked, run away and trigger the prey drive in the dog, or try to defend or correct rude dog behavior which can result in both animals being hurt. \n\nIdeally you want the dog to be interested and calm, curious but not too fixated and definitely not frantic. Again, a silent dog with a closed mouth, hard stare and hyper focus on the cat is not a good thing. \n\nIf the dog is relaxed or just mildly curious, ears perked, tail wagging but not too stiff, soft eyes and open mouth you can attempt the next step. \n\n5. Put a leash on the dog and let him come a bit closer, but don't let him come up to the carrier to sniff the cat. This is because the poor cat is cooped up and might hiss, cry or be freaked out. \n\nCheck the dogs reaction again. Does it try to pull towards the carrier to get to the cat. Can you get the dog to sit and take a treat or get it to follow you on a leash inside the room? If not that means that the dog is probably over the threshold and too fixated on the cat or nervous. Put the dog back into the crate until it calms down. \n\nIdeally you want the dog to be curious or uninterested and able to follow your commands, take treats and allow it to be distracted away from the cat. You can then slowly walk a circle around the crate, making sure that there is enough space between the dog and the crate. \n\nAnother option is to have the dog on a leash with a muzzle. Don't just put on the muzzle for the first time when testing with the cat, but make sure the dog is trained before hand to wear it. Release the cat in a place where it can jump high up like a table, windowsill, cat tree or shelf. Stand with the dog near his crate and just watch his reaction. \n\nWhen the cat is somewhere high you can bring the dog closer to maybe even sniff at the cat, but make sure that the cat is comfortable. It has to have the option to leave if it wants to and hiss and even swipe at the dog (cut nails first) if it's acting too rude. This is crucial to see how the dog behaves because some dogs are okay with the crated cat, but become too prey focused when they see movement or react defensively when the cat tries to correct them. \n\nPraise calm behavior around the cat and let the dog follow you away from the cat if it becomes too excited or forceful. \n\nThis may seem like a lot, but I grew up in places where street dogs chased and killed cats. I've heard horror stories of people adopting hunting dogs with high prey drive that lost their cats, even though the shelter said that they were safe. Maybe the cat they tested it on was assertive and didn't trigger the prey drive, but their cat at home did. \n\nAlso, just because the dog will accept the cat inside the home, that doesn't mean that it won't chase or attack the cat in the yard. This is another hard lesson I've heard owners of hunting breeds tell me. Different environment, different rules. \n\nMy current foster dog is perfect in the home with our two kitties, but will chase the neighborhood cats in the yard, teeth bared and lunging at them and I have no doubts that if he caught one he would strangle it, so I'm very careful. This is a dog who grew up with cats and still shows herding behaviour (Australian shepherd mix) towards them. \n\nMy Galgo on the other hand loved all the neighborhood cats and would give them kisses and they would rub up against his legs. But this was a dog that showed no interest in the cats at all during the test or when I brought him into the house, even though he never lived in a home or with cats before. \n\nFinally, even if all of this goes well there can be jealousy. For me that's the biggest issue I had to contend with when getting Velcro rescues, that they wanted to have the same privileges as the cats (couch, bed, table, lap) and that they would try to limit the cats access to me by body blocking or chasing away the cats, sniffing rudely until the cats left themselves etc. \n\nDogs and cats need to be taught how to live together, and it's not impossible if the dog shows the right behavior, but if you see any heightened prey drive it's just not worth the risk imo. Even if they were on separate floors, all it takes is for your cat to accidentally wander downstairs etc and you could have a tragedy on your hands. \n\nThat doesn't mean it's impossible if the dog shows just mild curiosity and interest or better yet very little interest, but keep in mind that you will need to train both cat and dog to live peacefully together. \n\nGood luck and let me know how it went!",

Heck I would consider myself an experienced dog person with almost 15 years direct owner experience and a lifetime of exposure to dogs of all types and I would not adopt this dog.\n\nIt's likely this dog is not getting it's mental stimulation and drive needs met.

Its big enough for your dog, and hell more comfy than a dog bed that goes flat! Plus, it mimics your bed she likes so much. Creature comfort might help her relax.\n\nThe rest i'd try maybe finding out if she likes cheese or peanut butter, buy a few Kong toys, put her favorite in it, freeze it (lasts longer), and give it to her when you leave.\n\nOh, and place your yesterday's shirt in her dog bed to leave her with your smell. Some dogs it comforts them. \n\n15 minutes before you leave, dont touch, talk or look at her. Just relax. Ill explain. Think as if you're just getting the mail outside, even if leaving for the day. Dogs feel your emotions. If you feel \"omg poor her I feel bad leaving her alone\" she'll feel it and it'll trigger her. Dogs dont understand the complexity or situation of your emotions. She only sees you feeling sad for her. She doesnt know why. She thinks something's wrong. Then she goes crazy when you leave. So breathe in, breathe out, we're just chilling. You dont say bye and all the drama when you just go outside to pick up your mail, right? You dont look talk or touch your dog, neither say big goodbyes Im going out 36 seconds getting the mail. Just act the same when you leave for work. Be chill. \n\nFYI my dog had separation anxiety. He was a barker. Non stop. His barking gave me anxiety fearing being kicked out, and he would get anxiety from my anxiety he's causing me. Horrible. I had to work a long time with him.

I can't just go like \"welp my tv show is finished, I'll just run off grab my keys and leave right now\". I have to be slow, relax, grab my keys slowly, wait a bit, when I see him get nervous, I tell him to go to his bed, not stand around the door, it makes him worse. He lies in his bed, I wait til he relaxes, then leave camly. \n\nIts difficult sometimes, but I love my dog. My velcro dog is a great cuddler.",

            "body": "Just 1 question, how much excessive does she get? Mals and Shepard r working dogs. They have an EXCESSIVE amount of energy, as well as being extremely smart. She prob gets bored very easily. I walk dogs and am around dogs constantly. If she\u2019s not getting a daily 30, at least, preferably an hour walk before u leave and when u get home, destruction and chaos, unfortunately r bound to happen. About the sleeping, I\u2019m a little confused. Is the pup used to sleeping w your sister, in the same room, every night? If so, I wouldn\u2019t move her out of your sisters room. For the kitty, maybe set up somewhere comfy that\u2019s too high for the pup to get to, that\u2019s specifically for kitty. Or if u own your house, u could making kitty doors in doors for the rooms, so kitty can go where she wants and puppy can\u2019t get to her. GL, separation anxiety is tough, hopefully u can figure something out that works for everyone. Because, the last option would b meds. 1 of the girls I walk is on anxiety meds. She used to b a hot mess, but over the years walking her so many ppl who know her have seen a huge difference! She used to only trust me and her humans, now she\u2019s asocial butterfly and goes to say hi to all the humans and dogs we see on the trail!! It wonderful to have witnessed she been a part of!! We walk where dogs r allowed to b off leash.",

However a year ago he started getting major separation anxiety.  Chewed my doors to try and get out. I had a appt with a virtual vet as mine was not available at that time. She suggested meds. I give him them at least a hour before work and only then or if I have to go anywhere for a few hours. They work great, it calms him and he is happy and so am I.",
