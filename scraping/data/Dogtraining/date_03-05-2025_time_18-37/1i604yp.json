    "selftext": "Need some advice on an issue that\u2019s been going on for a while with our 3.5 year old rescue dog. We adopted her at 6 months old when her original owner returned her to the rescue org due to personal reasons. When we brought her home we were told that she was fully potty trained which turned out to be true. She had maybe one accident in the house in the first few weeks and then she was perfectly settled. When we picked her up the fosters gave us the items her original owners surrendered her with, which included a bunch of potty pads. She is 35 pounds (but tall) and we never planned to use them, nor did we need to, so we never did. For about a year she never had any accidents until one day she peed on one of our bath mats in the bathroom. We thought at the time that it was just a one off, since we took her out regularly. A couple weeks goes by and she does it again.  Then the behavior just stops. Over the next year and few months we move from an apartment to a house, and still have no problems. Then a few months ago she starts peeing on the bath mats every so often again. We start trying to keep the door closed, or hang the mat over the tub when not in use which helps until the times when we forget. Even if she has just gone out within the hour, if she finds the bath mat she will pee on it. This weekend, the mat was hung over the tub and somehow she managed to fully pee on it even though it wasn\u2019t touching the floor. I\u2019m not really sure what to do. The reason I mentioned the potty pads before is because I wonder if her previous owner used them and maybe she thinks the bath mat is a peed pad? Not sure. Would greatly appreciate any advice or tips to get her to stop this!! ",

                    "body": "I read the poops/pees wiki and none of the instructions are applicable to me as my dog is house trained except for our bath mat specifically. She is on a schedule, and she pees when I let her outside. While I agree she likes the surface of the bath mat to pee on, she is also perfectly happy peeing on the grass. She also doesn\u2019t pee on any other carpets. Every time she pees on the bath mat we spray it with enzyme spray and wash it on hot in the washer. We have also replaced bath mats with new ones and she still pees on the new ones. She is uncrated because she doesn\u2019t pee anywhere inside except on the bath mat, and it\u2019s not worth beginning to crate her at 3.5 years old just to prevent her peeing on the bath mat. We can close the door, and we try to, but sometimes we forget of course, it\u2019s our only bathroom in a house with two people. We give her positive reinforcement when she pees outside everytime. She very much knows that\u2019s where she is supposed to potty. She does not have a medical issue, that wouldn\u2019t make sense as the only place she pees is the bath mat. If we don\u2019t have the bath mat down she won\u2019t pee anywhere inside the house. We let her out/walk her several times a day - often more than four or five times and for substantial amounts of time. Often when she\u2019s pees on the bath mat it\u2019s within an hour of just having gone out. She stands by the door to the backyard when she actually needs to pee to let us know she needs to go out. She never pees on the bath mat in our presence or even when we are upstairs where the bathroom is. She sneaks upstairs to do it and doesn\u2019t give any other signs of needing to pee before she does. She doesn\u2019t spend a ton of time in our bathroom, so it\u2019s not her home the same way the other living areas are, but she does come in there sometimes and hang out with us when we are in there showering/getting ready. Let me know if I missed anything.",

Sometimes a sniff test doesn\u2019t cut it.\u00a0",
