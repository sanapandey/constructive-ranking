    "selftext": "I adopted a 4 month old Malinois mix and she\u2019s picking up on basic training well. She also seems to have potty training down pretty well at my partner\u2019s place (house with fenced backyard); we go out frequently, she goes to the grass and pees/ poops, we celebrate, we go inside. However, at my place (an apartment with landscaping and some grassy areas) she\u2019s struggling to make the connection. \n\nI take her out quite often, go to the grassy areas, and walk her around on the leash for quite a while sniffing. There are a couple spots she has peed or pooped, and I take her to those spots to see if that will prompt her. I have left a rag with her pee on it in one spot, and have left some of her poop in another spot (sorry neighbors!). She also finds other dogs\u2019 poop but that doesn\u2019t prompt her either. It seems like she\u2019s not sure why we\u2019re out there, and will come inside only to pee/poop on the floor a little while later. Whenever it happens I take her outside right away, and clean up all messes thoroughly with an enzymatic cleaner to eliminate the smell.\n\nI have a crate coming in a couple days, and will start crate training at that point but until then I\u2019m not sure what to do. Just stick with it? She gets it at my partner\u2019s place, so I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll make the connection here soon as well. Just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing something! ",
