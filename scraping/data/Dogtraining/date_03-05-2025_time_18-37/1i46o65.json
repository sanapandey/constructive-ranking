    "selftext": "Hi,\nI would really love some advice. 3 weeks ago we got a gorgeous 6 month old kitten. We have a couple of dogs and we knew it would be a process to get them introduced to and comfortable with each other but I'm a bit perplexed at the behaviour of my female Standard Poodle. For background, I've done quite a lot of obedience training with her in the past and she is normally very well behaved. She has been introduced to a cat who is the resident cat at our veterinarian's rooms and she always seems excited to see the cat and wants to be friendly with that cat. She is a very maternal dog. 3 years ago we got a Coton de Tulear puppy and she would mother the puppy, licking and grooming her and being protective of her.\n\nHowever, since we got the kitten, her behaviour has been confusing. We have kept her separate from the kitten except for repeated brief introductions. My Poodle will whine at the door and bang on the door to get to the room where the kitten is. She does this for hours. When she does get to see the kitten, she will bark in an uncharacteristic high-pitched manner. When we let her get close, she starts licking the kitten, then nuzzling/ grooming as she did with the Coton, but then it progresses to nipping, biting and lunging. Of course, when the kitten runs, she chases her and is desperate to get into her hidey holes. Her behaviour doesn't seem aggressive to me, but the lunging and nipping/ biting is concerning. We don\u2019t seem to have made much progress in 3 weeks. Our little Coton and the kitten are unfazed by each other and play with each other.\n\nMy questions are:\n1. Do you agree that my Poodle is not being aggressive?\n2. Any ideas on how to make progress to get my Poodle to be more calm around the kitten? The kitten is obviously very unimpressed with her and hisses and swipes at her. We're having to keep them separated nearly 24/7 and it is seriously disrupting the household. The kitten is pure delight - a loving, playful girl - and we really don't want to have to surrender her.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice, thanks.",

We even tried NO! and a swat on the nose if she lunges/ bites, which is not something I have ever done before as we've always done gentle, positive reinforcement training. However, her behaviour does not seem to be getting any better.",

There seems a trend in recent years to move away from the term \u201caggressive\u201d and toward terms like anxious, territorial, resource guarding,\u00a0overstimulation, reactive, and/or unwanted.\u00a0\n\nHere\u2019s a demonstration video that might be helpful about using rewards, repetition, and distance:\n\n[Diesel, barking & lunging at scooters](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tdFK5rGbjJ0)\n\nIt would be wise to make sure the kitten can retreat to a safe spot at all times.\u00a0",
