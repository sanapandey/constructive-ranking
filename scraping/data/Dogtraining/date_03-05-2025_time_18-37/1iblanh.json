    "selftext": "I've had my almost one-year-old husky since he was six weeks old, and recently, he's been showing severe separation anxiety, particularly when it comes to my mother. Although she doesn't live with us, she shares the same property, and that's where the problem seems to stem from.\n\nWhenever he's in his crate and hears her car leave, he immediately starts panicking\u2014tearing apart his bed or destroying anything nearby. If he's not in the crate, he\u2019s learned to open the door just to get to her. He then runs after her car, sometimes even trying to open the gate to the road.\n\nWhat's worrying me more is that it almost feels like his training is regressing. He's starting to respond less and less to commands, and during these episodes, he doesn't even respond to his name. It\u2019s been really tough on me, and it\u2019s starting to frustrate the rest of the family as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

After that it\u2019s just normal desensitization. Mom does all her getting ready to leave, then doesn\u2019t leave. Get ready, open the door, don\u2019t leave. Etc etc. Break it down and see where he needs more support.",

Do not give in, this is a crucial time to reinforce boundaries! \n\nOn the separation issues, my husky is similar, he HATES when people leave even if I'm still home! We've been working on desensitizing him to the leaving rituals e.g. touch keys, don't leave, put shoes on, don't leave, touch the front door, don't leave, start car, come back inside etc.etc. it's a slow process but it does seem to work. If I'm home and someone else is leaving, I'll try to give him something really great like a tasty treat or play a fun game to show that it's not a bad thing.",

What have you actually done to stop this behavior?  Have you gone to a vet? Gotten anxiety meds? Also, if this is a sudden behavior change, it could be neurological and you\u2019d want to see a specialist.",

What sort of things do you do with your dog, like how often do you play with them and have positive social interactions with them? How often do you walk them?\n\nSome behaviors don't stem from \"lack of training\". Sometimes they stem from quality of care. Is it possible your dog feels mistreated or understimulated, and feels safer, more cared for, and more comfortable with your mom?",

One of the \u201cmodern\u201d approaches is to drug them in order to keep them calm with prozac and similar stuff.\n\nShelters are full of them.\n\nInvestigate your dog breed before getting it and check if it fits your lifestyle.\nI don\u2019t see Husky fitting modern lifestyle of like 99% of humans except you are in Alaska, Siberia or similar places and need pulling/hunting companion.",

He's half husky and half something else (we don't really know), so he doesn't have a super heavy coat, something else I worried about when we got him. \n\nMe and my partner live a very active lifestyle and often include him in daily runs and walks. We also have 8 anchers of land for him to run around almost all day with 4 other dogs to play with. I don't believe his issue is a too much energy thing since he's only in his crate or inside a few hours a day and at night.",

Very clear it is not a Siberian husky. At the very least it's mixed with Malamute or German Shepherd. It's huge. Way beyond the normal size of a Siberian husky.  \n\nA huskies worst enemy is boredom. It will relieve the boredom on its own. It is not a dog that should be left for long periods of time. Time to look into doggy daycare",
