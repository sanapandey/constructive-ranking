    "selftext": "\n\nHi everyone, I\u2019ve had my rescue dog, Roki, for a year now. She\u2019s a mutt\u2014German Shepherd, Labrador, and Pit Bull mix. Early on, the vet suggested putting her on Prozac, but I decided to wait and see how she did without it since she was so young her personality hadn\u2019t developed. I\u2019m thinking I may have to revisit that option now. The thing is, she\u2019s still terrified of walks outside. She hates the sidewalk, cars, and being around people in public.  I end up having to carry to 55 pound dog around! (Im a 28 year old girl).\n\n\nHowever, she *loves* hiking. When we\u2019re on the trails, she\u2019s a completely different dog\u2014relaxed, happy, and totally fine seeing people. She also adores other dogs, and the only way she'll walk on the street is if she's with my sister\u2019s German Shepherd.  \n\nI\u2019m about to move to New York, and I need to figure out a solution for her. Has anyone dealt with something similar? Any advice on how to help her feel safe on city streets? ",
