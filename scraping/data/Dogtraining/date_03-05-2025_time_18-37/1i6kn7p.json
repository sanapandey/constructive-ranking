    "selftext": "Hi!\n\nI recently moved to a new area and Ive noticed that my dog acts extremely anxious after a long walk. She will only calm down after I pet her for a few minutes. Wondering why she might be behaving this way? Is it the new environment? What can I do to make her less anxious when we return from a walk?",
