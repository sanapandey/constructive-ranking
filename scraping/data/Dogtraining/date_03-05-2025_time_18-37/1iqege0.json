    "selftext": "I am watching a dog for my friend, and the dog is maybe 3-4 years old- but really controlling of the environment- I\u2019m not a dog person, but I need help on how to figure out these responses. \n\n1: When I go near her to pet her, she\u2019s perfectly fine with it, but then shortly after like one or two pets, she starts to snap at me. I even let her sniff me beforehand, and she does know me, this is NOT the first time I\u2019ve checked in on her while her owner is away.\n\n2: She doesn\u2019t even respond to her name- I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s eligible for this list, but I feel it\u2019s slightly concerning. I own cats, who do respond to their name, despite being untrained to do so.\n\n3: I had forgotten about not all animals being kid friendly, and assumed that they were. (that\u2019s my fault, I know- but this dog also lives in a house of 6 kids below the age of 14.) The kid I was with did really well, kept his distance, and was very calm and gentle, kneeling down on the ground about 5-7 feet away so the dog could sniff him before petting, but when she went over, she immediately started barking and growling.\n\n4: She does resource guarding- it\u2019s terrifying though- because I can\u2019t go within 5 feet of her bowl without attitude. I went over to clean up dog poop near her kennel which was in front of her food, and she nearly bit me. I was probably 2-3 feet away, and didn\u2019t even put my hands near her food.\n\nI\u2019m just a sitter trying to make sure this dog doesn\u2019t get too lonely, but while also keeping it fed and watered- but I think the dog may be a hazard to people\u2019s safety, and I don\u2019t feel like I can do much as I\u2019m not there too often. I just want to know what I can do while I\u2019m there in brief moments, I\u2019m lost and very concerned for the children in the house.",

                    "body": "I think that's the sort of crux - the expectation at this point isn't for you to resolve the behavior issue but you do need to manage it.  \n\n>1: When I go near her to pet her, she\u2019s perfectly fine with it, but then shortly after like one or two pets, she starts to snap at me. I even let her sniff me beforehand, and she does know me, this is NOT the first time I\u2019ve checked in on her while her owner is away.\n\nThere are any number of reasons a dog may not wish to be touched.  So generally if this was a sudden change of behavior, a vet visit would be in order to rule out pain or other potential medical issues.  That said, sniffing you is not specifically giving consent.  Sniffing gathers information for sure - but you need to look at the dog's body language in those moments.  Here's our resource for [canine communication](https://old.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/caninecommunication) and you might benefit from learning how to perform a [consent test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cGDYI-s-cQ).  \n\n>2: She doesn\u2019t even respond to her name- I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s eligible for this list, but I feel it\u2019s slightly concerning. I own cats, who do respond to their name, despite being untrained to do so.\n\nWhile you may not have explicitly trained your cats to respond to their name, they most certainly have been taught to respond to their names :)  Your cats were likely reinforced in one way or another for responding to their name.  With dogs, we also can explicitly or unknowingly train to respond to their name.  As we don't know the learning history of this dog and what their owners have done or lack of action...   we don't really know whether this is actually concerning or not.  \n\nAdditionally, while you may have checked in with the dog in the past, given the details of the current situation, do you think it's possible this dog could be trying to cope with a sudden change? Their family is gone...   their routine may be disrupted.  Stress responses can sometimes lead to regression in behavior.  \n\nGrab yourself some treats, sit down and allow the dog to approach you, or you can toss the treat towards the dog at a distance they are comfortable with.  Say their name and give the treat.  This can help build some trust between you as well as condition the name to mean good things to be expected.",

Keep the dog safe and keep everyone else safe.  \n\n>4: She does resource guarding- it\u2019s terrifying though- because I can\u2019t go within 5 feet of her bowl without attitude. I went over to clean up dog poop near her kennel which was in front of her food, and she nearly bit me. I was probably 2-3 feet away, and didn\u2019t even put my hands near her food.\n\nHere is where significant management needs to come into play to keep you and everyone safe.  Read our wiki section on [Resource Guarding](https://old.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/guarding) \n\nWhen feeding, you'll want to feed in a secure area - where she will not be disturbed. That can be in the kennel itself or in a room....   we simply want to set up that while she's eating, there is no accidental proximity that makes her feel threatened.  Don't take the food away, don't interrupt the meal or clean near her bowl when she's eating.  \n\nWhen she's done and you need access to the space - to clean or to remove the empty bowl...  bring a cookie with you...   you're going to toss that cookie away from the area for her to go get.  Then you can access the space and do what needs doing.",
