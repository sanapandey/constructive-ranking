    "selftext": "So I have a one year old catahoula/pit and he just chews everything! If you walk outside to get the mail and come back he has something he shouldn\u2019t and with him being an agile dog it\u2019s hard to put stuff out of his reach that will not be out of reach for me because i\u2019m short lmao. I have spent literal hundreds on \u201cindestructible\u201d toys, he can\u2019t even have a bed or pad in his cage because he destroys it, and I am not the type to get rid of a dog for stuff like this even though it is annoying. But what can I do? I really am trying to not go spend thousands getting professionally trained and have it not work and I just wasted that money. Everything i read says \u201cbuy toys, go play outside, pick everything up\u201d but really none of these things do anything. What can I do to finally stop his destructive habit?!?",
