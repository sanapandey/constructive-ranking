    "selftext": "As the title says, we just obtained a puppy a month ago. And I can't help it, but I lost control every time she uses the bathroom in the house. I try to remind myself she is still learning, but it fills me with rage every time she chews up a puppy pads only to poop or pee right next to it. I'll take her outside watch her pee, only to come in and 10.minutes later poop or pee. We are trying to train her right but when it's just me, I get the urge to hit her and be mean to her because I just can't fathom how she can be so smart in some ways and be so stupid when it comes to going outside. Even though I know hitting is not the way to go it feels like doing it the right way isn't working either. I know she's going to have accidents but nothing rages me more than waking up in the morning to crap all over her pen or pee right on the floor next to a chewed up puppy pad. But how do you keep yourself from losing control. I've never been one to get angry like this over an animal. I have two kids I love and have never hit them out of anger for doing something that irritated me to no end, but with this dog it's like I feel like it's okay to be mean to her when she has an accident.
