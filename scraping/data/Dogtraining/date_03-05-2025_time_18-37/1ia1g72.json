    "selftext": "Hi, this is a long and pretty niche post but I was hoping someone on here could help me out. \n\nI (25) have a 6 year old female beagle. I adopted her from a rescue when she was about 5 months old so I've had her basically her whole life. My family and I neglected to train her properly, but overall she's a pretty good dog despite that. There are a few things I'm hoping to work with her on. I've started working on crate training as when she's left alone she screams. It's not like barking or howling, \"dog screaming\" is the easiest way to describe it. I think she's grown so used to at least one person being within sight that she doesn't know how to handle being without someone. I currently live with my parents but I'm hoping to move out soon-ish and take her with me. Buf if I move into an apartment or anything with close neighbors, she obviously can't be screaming while I'm at work. \n\nLiving here, my dad is almost always home and accessible to her, so shes very used to his presence. This is where the kind of niche part comes in. My room and a den are in the basement. Everything else is upstairs, kitchen, bathroom, and access to outside. My mother isn't a very kind person and the other day my mother screamed at my dog for wanting to go out in the backyard (she's used to being able to go out there for a bathroom) and I saw my dog cower in fear and that was kind of the last straw. She's smacked her before and she yells at her constantly and my dog has (in my belief) developed some anxiety from this treatment. She chronically licks peoples skin or the carpet and she's terrified of being alone. She's very smart and active and I know she could thrive in better circumstances, so I want to devote more time and effort to her. Part of this for me, is somehow training her to stay in the basement when everyone besides me is still upstairs. I honestly have no idea where to start or if this is even possible. My house is built so there's a door at the top of the basement stairs, but if my dog went and whined at that door, my parents would lose it. And I know if I just started immediately locking her down here that's exactly what would happen. Currently I'm just working on crate training as the first step which I think I have an alright understanding of. It's the keeping my dog in the basement without whining that I'm worried about when we get there. She'll be able to hear people upstairs and there will be times she'll have to be alone. \n\nI'm hoping the crate will help but I obviously don't want to keep her in there when I'm home, but I'll have to prevent her from wanting to go upstairs somehow. I guess I'd also want her to be able to tell me when she needs to go outside so I could take her upstairs and out for a walk. I know this is a huge ask of her, basically changing her whole life and all of her habits, but she really is a good girl and deserves better. \n\nI guess just as a final note, we're just at the start of crate training. She still has a while to go on that before she can be left alone without any noise. But any advice about the keeping her in the basement, or even advice about crate training would be very appreciated. TYIA!",

They are also veterinarians so they would be attuned to any physical/medical issues/solutions, and they have a training in dog psychology.\u00a0\u00a0Worth every penny.\u00a0\u00a0(These trainers are sometimes referred to as \u201cDiplomates.\u201d)\n\nIf you go this route, I hope you will add an update to let us know how things are going.\u00a0\n\nWishing you the best of luck.\u00a0",
