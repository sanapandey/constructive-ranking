    "selftext": "We have 3 dogs, a Pomeranian (4.5years - Salem), Pomsky (3.5 years- Han), American Eskimo/Husky (2.5 years - Chewbacca).\n\nHan is EXTREMELY anxious, we think because of his collapsable trachia, and submissive pees all the time, will go outside to pee but INSIDE to poop. He will do this outside but very rarely. He's very aggressive to other dogs, and we've worked on this for most of the time, he's just not getting it. He is very aggressive on leash, deep grows while walking even though no one is around, pulls until he chokes himself or throws up due to hyperventilating.\n\nChewbacca is food aggressive, when separated with his chosen toy he just whines and cries and will not play with it unless he gets what the other dogs have (even if same toy). \n\nWe have dogs in every neighborhood backyard and they got absolutely insane when they are out. \n\nI'm working with the husky on commands (like sit, and stay), and he's getting sit but when other dogs are around he loses all ability to listen, when we separate the other dogs, they know he's getting treats so attack the door and cry and bark and distract him. The other dogs mainly the Pomsky are not getting the commands.\n\nWe are at our wits end, we have a new baby in the house, and her toys are getting taken (he will sneak when we aren't in the room) and then husky is being possessive of them. We don't want to rehome but we don't have $5k per dog to train. \n\nWhat is the best way to train multiple dogs? Separating them isn't working as well as we would have hoped.",

When problems this significant arise, I would not trust anyone else. It\u2019s true that the wrong trainer (even one that has chosen to call themselves a behaviorist) can make the problem worse.  \n\nACVB = American College of Veterinary Behaviorists. \n\nThese trainers are Sometimes referred to as \u201cDiplomates.\u201d\n\nTry widening the search area to 500 miles and/or request a virtual visit.  I am certain this is your best option. \n\nBest of luck. :)",
