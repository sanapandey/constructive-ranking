    "selftext": "We recently rescued a 5 month old pup (male terrier mix, about 30lbs) to join our 3 year old rescue (male lab mix, 55lbs). Both boys are fixed and they are getting along great after 10 days, sharing toys, sleeping together, eating together and reciprocating play inside. The one thing we\u2019re concerned with is how the adult dog plays with the puppy outside. About 80% of the time they\u2019ll romp around together with the pup following our adult dog, but about 20% of the time, our adult dog starts getting too excited and will run over the pup and start going after him. I always stay close to them while we\u2019re outside and intervene. As soon as I back our adult dog off, the pup will go back after him and get him worked up again. We\u2019re working on the \u201cenough\u201d command and it works well inside, but the adult gets too locked in to listen outside. Any tips for making sure they play safely outside?",

            "body": "Is the running over of the pup the most concerning aspect? If the puppy is going after your adult dog for more, that is a good sign that they were having a good time. It\u2019s really a good idea to train dogs to listen even when they are excited, because that\u2019s when you\u2019ll need them to listen the most in real life situations. When my dogs were getting acquainted I would watch for ques that they weren\u2019t respecting boundaries being set by the other dog. Just something as simple as calling them to you and then letting them go back to playing once you give the green light (if they both want to). \nI don\u2019t let my dogs play inside really, it gets complicated in so many situations, like in the event of bringing them to an elderly relatives house etc. \nso once they come inside, they also know, no playing, hard stop. It can act as a good home base too, if one of them is sick of playing but the other isn\u2019t. They should both have a way to escape the other and take a break if they need it, the older dog especially.",

                    "body": "The running over concerns me a bit from a safety perspective because of the current size difference, I did a bad job explaining in the original post, but I think my primary concern is it seems like borderline bullying by my older dog, the pup will either go behind me or sit up against the fence when the adult starts getting riled up. The adult will keep going at him and running loops until I grab him. The adult dogs hackles will sometimes come up a little bit, but his hackles have always come up sometimes when he would get going chasing a ball or toys outside so I think it\u2019s more of an excitement than aggression thing. It looks like the puppy does not like it in the moment and is a little scared, but if a grab the adults lead to separate, the puppy goes back at him within seconds.",
