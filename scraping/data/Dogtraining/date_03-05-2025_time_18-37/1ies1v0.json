    "selftext": "My dog is a black mouth cur mix, about 1.5 years old now, and I\u2019ve had him now for around 9-10 months. He was shy at first, but quickly became an absolute insane torrent of energy and excitement. \n\nHe\u2019s jumpy with women and barky with men. He\u2019s thankfully been good with my cats (well, they find him way too crazy and don\u2019t particularly like him but he seems to love and want to play with him), and with dogs is a very mixed bag. \n\nI used to take him to the dog beach and he would have a great time, socializing with other dogs and humans. But recently he\u2019s started to have this thing with certain dogs where if when he\u2019s trying to greet them and they show him any sort of aggression, he goes crazy, barking incessantly and trying to lunge on my leash. He\u2019s never bit a dog before but I\u2019ve obviously never let him greet a dog after he starts doing that. Other times he\u2019s fine \u2014 especially when he\u2019s greeting very small dogs, which he seems to love and is pretty gentle with (I think that\u2019s why he likes my cats), or if he\u2019s approached a chill dog that hasn\u2019t stared at him back or not looked at him much. But large dogs he tends to dislike, even if they\u2019re fairly docile, and other dogs he\u2019ll go crazy with if they show him any sort of \u201cback off\u201d body language. And it\u2019s almost always on a leash that I\u2019ve noticed this. I\u2019ve almost never seen him act this way around groups of dogs and he\u2019s weirdly never had an issue at dog parks and beaches with multiple dogs. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of gutting for me. I\u2019ve taken him to classes and had a private trainer with mixed success. I think with the initial classes he did better because he didn\u2019t have this weird streak with dog interactions at first, but it could\u2019ve been because the dog of several dogs seemed to make him happy like I mentioned before. \n\nThe good thing is he seems pretty smart and he seems to have an aptitude for learning, as he\u2019s well crate-trained, knows a decent amount of commands, and we\u2019ve improved a lot on walks (I\u2019ve trained him to constantly look back at me for treats). He\u2019s also pretty receptive to me when I call for him \u2014 usually stopping whatever he\u2019s doing and coming to me. \n\nWith the private trainer we worked a lot on relaxation and distraction. The biggest improvement I\u2019ve seen is the aforementioned walking stuff and the getting his attention stuff, but once he goes crazy, I can\u2019t get his attention.\n\nIt really bums me out, as I don\u2019t want to be thought of as the person with \u201cthe misbehaved, crazy dog\u201d and bothering people, and I want him to succeed. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to keep him from being insane, better with men, and not crazy with other dogs. But we\u2019ll invariably have a freakout, and it really upsets me each time. ",
