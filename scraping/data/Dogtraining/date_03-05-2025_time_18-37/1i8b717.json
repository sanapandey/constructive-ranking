    "selftext": "We adopted a 75# Pyrenees/Shepherd (?) mix about two months ago from the local shelter. She\u2019s 1-2 years old, with lots of puppy energy, but very smart and better behaved than a lot of our past rescues.  She would chomp & jump at first but has made huge progress there, decent progress on a leash, is excellent in the car, & is not at all destructive - in other words, she seems very trainable. \nQuestion:  My teen daughter has special needs & is not very verbal.  Dog is fine with her 90% of the time - they\u2019ve snuggled on the couch & dog will happily take treats from her  (all supervised!).  But when my girl is sitting at the kitchen table, the dog will start randomly barking at her.  She\u2019s Pyrenees, and I understand they\u2019re barky, but this seemed aggressive.  She seems to lunge a bit when my girl gets up from the table.  My girl can move fast so maybe it triggers some prey reaction in the dog?  The dog is fine with everyone else at the table / while others are eating.  The first couple times I admit I overreacted and yelled at the dog, out of pure instinct, which didn\u2019t help.  We put chairs around my girl while she\u2019s eating, out of an abundance of caution, and I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to praise the dog when she\u2019s sitting quietly nearby.  Trying to find a trainer to come observe behavior in house (\ud83d\ude33) but in the meantime am trying to build the relationship, mostly by having my daughter hand out lots of treats when they\u2019re together.  Dog was not really begging otherwise, so not worried about encouraging that at the table - but maybe I should be? \nn.b. I once tried to have my daughter help feed the dog - huge mistake. The dog eats in the laundry room, but her food is in the kitchen & my girl was holding the bowl as I scooped - dog definitely lunged. I was between them so my girl was safe, but I caught a tooth (was scraped, not punctured). \nThe dog was a little skittish about HER food, which is why she eats in the laundry room, always alone, but no prior issues in *delivering* the food, nor around people food.  I know not to try that again, but my daughter is basically adult sized so should be able to provide meals, not be seen as competition for them.\nIn short, I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m training from - reactivity, prey response, resource guarding, previous experience with bad kids?  Have researched all but this is such an isolated weird behavior and she\u2019s otherwise pretty well behaved - it\u2019s unnerving. Any suggestions beyond copious treats?  ",
