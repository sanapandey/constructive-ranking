    "selftext": "Hello,\nPlease help! I have 5 beagles (3 female, 2 male). Here\u2019s some backstory: The oldest beagle is a 5-year-old female, followed by a 3-year-old male, a 2-year-old female, and the youngest two, who are both 1-year-old (a male and a female). I\u2019ve done extensive research, read wikis, and looked up many resources, but I\u2019m still unsure why this behavior began. I'll try to explain everything in my own words.\n\nAll 5 of these beagles are spoiled and loved, so I don\u2019t understand why these behaviors started, but here\u2019s what\u2019s been happening:\n\nOne day, the oldest male suddenly \u201cattacked\u201d the now 2-year-old female on multiple occasions. I put \u201cattacked\u201d in quotes because it was more like him holding her down, not necessarily fighting, but it was loud and aggressive. We\u2019d pull him off, and he would try to get back at her. She never fought back but just tried to get away. This started when she was about 7 months old. Fast forward, and they had puppies, which are now the youngest two. He stopped \u201cattacking\u201d the female, but then it transitioned to the puppies. When they were first born, he would \u201cattack\u201d the female in the same way, but recently, he\u2019s been doing this to the male puppy. This behavior has gotten progressively worse.\n\nMost of the time, the 3-year-old male pins down the 1-year-old male. The younger dog tries to get away and cries/whines, but now he\u2019s started fighting back, which has led to cuts on his ear.\n\nIn the past week, anytime the 1-year-old male does almost anything (such as standing up from laying down across the room), the 3-year-old male starts growling and shaking. It\u2019s unpredictable\u2014sometimes nothing happens when the younger male moves around, but other times, just the sight of him triggers the older male, and he becomes aggressive. Tonight, for the first time ever, while my dad was trying to pull the 3-year-old off the 1-year-old, he accidentally bit my dad\u2019s finger. He has never shown aggression towards people before, especially not us, the people he lives with.\n\nI can confidently say the 3-year-old male has never been abused nor attacked by another animal, so I\u2019m confused as to why this behavior began. Our vet suggested anxiety pills, but I want to do more for him. I want to give all of my dogs the best life possible, which is why I\u2019m reaching out for help.\n\nAs for how we discipline, once we pull him off, we place him in either my parents' or my brother\u2019s room by himself for a little while to cool off. We also express that we\u2019re upset with him right as it happens (by saying things like \u201cbad boy\u201d or \u201cno\u201d). We don\u2019t discipline the other dogs because they\u2019ve never started these altercations, even though the younger male is now starting to stand his ground. However, I\u2019m concerned cause I don\u2019t want either of them to get hurt.\n\nIs there anything I can do to stop this behavior? Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

I have consulted with my vet and we tried some anxiety meds but they didn\u2019t seem like they did anything so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s it either.",

            "body": "I'd start by neutering the dogs.\nHaving a bunch of intact male dogs is kind of asking for a lot of the behavior you're concerned about. A sexually mature dog will be aggressive to other dogs (female and male) to secure \"their\" bitch.\n\nThe dog(s) instigating/attacking the other dogs should be on a leash when you're home and in a crate when you're gone. Don't let him have free roam. He's terrorizing your other pets and that's no bueno. He needs to know that behavior isn't acceptable and keeping him on the leash; you can pull him right back to you when he gets uppity. He'll start to learn he can't get by with it. When he's been doing good for a while, let him off leash. If it starts again-- leash.\n\nNeuter him and any other dogs in your home. \n\nThere are a lot of low cost spay and neuter programs available in larger cities. Get connected with your local animal shelter and ask about spay/neuter programs and get them fixed before you have even more to work with. The local shelter here charges $45 per animal.",

A neutered dog is a better companion animal and there's no worry about increasing the surplus population of stray pets out there. Shelters would be empty if everyone neutered their pets.\n\nIt *will not* change his behavior completely. He'll be the same dog, yeah. But, his focus on getting a girlfriend will shift some and impact his behavior-- mellow him out a lil.\n\nHim being on a leash with you constantly in the home will change things. After a week or two on the leash, if he's not attempting to instigate, let him off under supervision. If he starts up on his bullshit, back on the leash immediately. I'd also crate him when you're gone/asleep, otherwise, your other pets suffer.",

At all.\u00a0Some thoughts in hopes one or more might be helpful:\n\n1. \u00a0If you are genuinely concerned about injury you may want to consider a muzzle. There is excellent information in About/Wiki here about muzzles (including Muzzle Up Pup).\n\n2. \u00a0If you want to do more,\u00a0The gold standard in trainers are Veterinary Behaviorists who are board certified by the ACVB or CAAB. You can use [this link](https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709) (you might have to use 500 miles as your search criteria), then request an online consult if they are not near.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes one session is sufficient. They are amazing (life changing) but they are expensive and there are few.  (I am interested to hear back afterwards if you choose this route.)\n\n3. \u00a0Reward the behavior you want repeated. Count out 10-20 treats per dog per day to reward best behavior. Give rewards for good behavior to remind the dogs what you prefer. Saying \u201cno\u201d can be confusing in some instances. I\u2019ve heard that Sometimes dogs repeat unwanted behaviors - for the attention they receive after (even if it is a negative response).\u00a0\n\n4. \u00a0Give all the dogs more opportunities for exercise, restful separation/sleep, and the mental stimulation of training, \u00a0snifaris, and licking (popsicles, frozen stuffed kongs, etc.)",
