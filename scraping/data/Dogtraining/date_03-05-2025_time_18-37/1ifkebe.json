    "selftext": "Ok weird one for you... We have a one year old Jackapoo.. we're convinced he came from a Puppy farm but that's a whole other story. Anyway, he won't go up the stairs in the house. We've tried everything but he just won't, he's terrified bless him! We've tried treats, pulling him (gently) on his lead but nothing works!\nThe weird thing is, if we're our on a walk and come across steps he's absolutely fine and doesn't think anything of bounding up the steps over bridges etc. it's literally just the stairs at home he won't deal with...\nAny ideas?!\n\nUpdate a few weeks later after trying the suggestions below. He's still terrified. Nothing works!",

Chances are that he will soon decide to go up that one step. If so, praise him profusely, let him eat the treats and the next day, repeat with him on the next highest step, etc. just one step a day so he doesn\u2019t get stressed.",
