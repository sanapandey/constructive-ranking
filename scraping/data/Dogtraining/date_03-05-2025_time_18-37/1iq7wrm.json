    "selftext": "Hi! I accidentally scent trained my dog for his ball. (His name is Goob\u2014 it\u2019s short for Cooper) We\u2019d play hide and seek with it where I was marking walls and furniture with his ball and then hiding it. If his favorite ball wasn\u2019t available, we would do the same thing with another ball and he has been pretty successful. He\u2019s gotten good at checking up higher lately\u2014 I\u2019ve gotten trickier. He searches very throughly. Goob lives for hide and seek ball. He wants to do that 25/8. \n\nMy question is, what kind of scent training jobs do you think he would be good at? Or what are some plausible options that he and I can work on at home? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love working. His dad is a working dog too. I know there\u2019s search and rescue (but with the possibility of not finding someone alive might be too much for him) or allergy or bomb sniffing. But those seem one versed or scary. Any tips would be helpful! Thank you in advance! ",

            "body": "Welcome to the world of nosework! Nosework is the accessible sport version of training a detection dog. Instead of training the dog to find explosives or narcotics, you can train your dog to find \"target odors\" like birch or clove and compete! In the US, NACSW is the premier venue (and a wonderful community) for competitive nosework. You can find in-person courses to learn, or take an online course - FDSA has a very good nosework 101 class they frequently offer.\n\n\nI compete in nosework with my two dogs (and have a third that will eventually) and am totally addicted - dogs love the sport and it is a very valuable part of my time with my dogs. If you have any particular questions, I'd be happy to answer best I can!",
