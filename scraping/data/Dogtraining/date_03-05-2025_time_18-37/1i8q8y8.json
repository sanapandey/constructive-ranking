    "selftext": "I have looked through the community resources and read the community guidelines and wasn't able to find what I need help with, maybe somebody can point me to the right direction.\n\nEnglish is my second language, apologies in advance if I fail to express myself correctly and apologies for the long post. \n\nBACKGROUND:\n3 years ago we adopted a 9 month old, terribly traumatised (mudi mix) pooch. They found her stuck in mud, beaten up, malnourished. Her first adoptive family kept her for a few months but given up on her due to severe behavioural issues (chewing, fearfulness, aggression, reactiveness, the whole lot). We already had a 13 year old puli and a 2 year old vizsla, both of them very well trained, balanced and confident, we took her in to save her from being put down. \n\nIt was a very slow progress but she made huge steps, became the most loving, sweetest ball of fur, I fell in love with her. She is very intelligent, takes a few repetitions only to teach her new tricks, however she has almost no food drive (but loves praise). One thing we always struggled with: she just won't trust anyone (human) outside of us. We socialise her, have frequent (daily) visitors but the progress is barely noticeable. I have to add, we live in rural Hungary and have a huge garden so going on walks isn't an everyday thing and even when we go, we don't meet people nor other dogs (just rabbits and deer).\n\nShe became best friend almost instantly with our vizsla, who had a huge part in building her confidence. For the past 3 years they were inseparable, playing, wrestling, 'hunting' being mischievous together in oir garden all day. \n\nTHE PROBLEM:\nNow onto the issue itself. We lost our vizsla to kidney failure a few days ago and besides having to deal with our grief and having a huge hole in our hearts, our rescue is showing alarming signs of regression and I don't know how to approach the situation, I worry about her and want her to feel better. Everything got turned up to 100: fearfulness (barking, hiding, growling even if a fly buzzez), resource guarding (location: entire room if the old puli is coming in), she is on edge all day and can't seem to relax, almost anything can be a trigger. My heart is breaking for her. \n\nWe don't have the financial means to hire a trainer and Youtube hasn't been helpful so far. Can anyone point me to the right direction (resources, books, advice) on how to approach the situation? How to build her confidence after the loss of her best doggie friend? I know she feels our sadness too and I try and give her so much of my loving attention (today we will have a long and pleasant grooming session etc.). I am at home with them all day and will be for the next month, I want to help her as much as I can. \n\nThank you everyone who got to the end of my post. ",

Will calming music help or leaving the tv on even if you\u2019re just in the other room? I agree a behaviorist could help, but some of my dogs have taken grief extremely hard. Give her lots of treats if she will take them, maybe leave a snuffle mat out. She could also be \u201cwaiting\u201d for your other dog to come home, so if you see pacing at the door or looking out the window, you can try to distract with a treat or toy. One of our dogs lost a little bit of trust after we put a housemate down, but overtime it kind of clicked that her friend wasn\u2019t coming back, and it wasn\u2019t our \u201cfault\u201d",

Best friend's smell is still everywhere because we were all hanging out on the same carpet every evening, them sleeping on it. Even in the final days. We hoovered and mopped since, but didn't have a deep clean.\nToday I've given her a big grooming session that she loves and managed to get her excited about treats and rewarded calm behaviour. \n\nGood news is, today is my birthday and we had my parents visit us. She's made a big step forward: not barking once everyone has settled. She did go to her corner and was peaking out of there, but previously she always barked very loudly and growled. She was laying down, paying attention to everyone . I asked my parents to not approach her and not to make too much eye contact/staring. Total success, she even sneaked up to my mom to sniff her.\n\nOne step at a time, I am happy I have the opportunity to stay home (with a broken leg) for an other month so I can help her as much as possible.\n\nThank you again for your answer!",

Crying together, snuggling, being around her old stuff. And majorly, we had a new puppy who brought him out of his shell. Granted, we got her 1 month before our Sheba (her name, not her breed) died.\n\nGive your pup something to be confident in again. We help give our dogs confidence by saying \"go home\" and they lead us on walks, or \"find ____\" and they get tons of praise.\n\nDepression is terrible. I feel for you and your pup \ud83d\udc94.",

It's too late now, I should've done that, I was misinformed previously and told not to let her see the euthanasia itself either or sniff the dog that has passed. She did spend the few nights & days with the best friend leading up to the day, seeing her suffer but once poochie was dead I didn't allow her near to sniff her but instead separated her and put her in her kennel until we buried the other pooch. I wouldn't want a re-do because it was a very painful week and day for all of us but next time I will make sure everyone is present after the fact and can sniff and say goodbye.\n\nSince it's legal in our country, we dug a deep grave for her in our garden and put planted a pear tree over her grave. Our rescue saw the burial itself and I caught her sitting/laying by the grave since, for prolonged periods of time (she never really just sits in that area of our backyard).\n\nThank you for your advice.",

                            "body": "So I partly agree with whoever you were misinformed by. It is NOT smart to let another pet witness an euthanasia. Multiple factors play into this. Safety, the other dog may panic and act unexpectedly. They might even try to \"protect\" the other pet. You can fully focus on your dying pet. Mentally it will relieve you from a lot of stress by having to cope with a dying pet and having to keep an eye on another one at the same time. But do let them smell the body, let them sit with them as long as they need. They will show when they're done, might be after 5 minutes with some, other ones take up to 30 minutes. They will walk away, leave the body alone and \"do something else\". That's when they know and you can take the body away. Trust me they know.\n\nKnow that it's not your fault that you were misinformed. Absolutely zero blame to you. You sound like an amazing pet parent.\u2764\ufe0f",

Unfortunately it isn't the same over here and I must try my best, given the resources around me. \n\nIn these rural areas people don't even keep their dogs in the house, 90% of dogs are guard dogs in our area, some are chained up and fed corn flour (seriously, my heart is breaking for them). The adoption process is far from what it is in more 'developed' countries, shelters (there's only one in the county) are still kill shelters. Finding the right professional would is an issue on it's own. Imagine, we are often judged for letting our dogs inside the house and the old lady puli even sleeps in our bed.. It's just a very different culture. In the capital I know it's a bit better, but rural areas have decades of catching up to do.",
