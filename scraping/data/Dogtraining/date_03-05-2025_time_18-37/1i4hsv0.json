    "selftext": "I know this has been probably asked quite a few times but looking for some advice. We just adopted a 1.5 year old boxer mix. Incredibly sweet dog but I cannot get him to go pee outside. We\u2019ve had for 1 day now so I know it hasn\u2019t been long but I will walk him for 20 mins and he will do nothing. We come back inside and within 2 minutes he will pee. Trying to be consistent, I take him out every 1-2 hours for 20-30 minutes. Could it really just be that\u2019s he envoys outside so he won\u2019t go? Any help/advice would be appreciated. ",
