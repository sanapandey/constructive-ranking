    "selftext": "We have a 6 year old doodle. She was very well behaved and sweet until we got a puppy. She will growl and show her teeth at the puppy when she is snuggling her humans or sleeping and wants to be left alone. We thought this was normal until recently she started growling and showing her teeth at her humans when we accidentally touch her while she\u2019s sleeping or laying down. We are about to have a baby and it\u2019s making me very nervous. Any suggestions? ",
