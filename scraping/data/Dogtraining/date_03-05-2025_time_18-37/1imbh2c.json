    "selftext": "I rescued/adopted a very sweet, Standard Poodle puppy when she was 5 months old (she was a breeder release). She just turned 10 months. She had Giardia which caused the runs. At one point she developed a urinary tract infection that's gone now.The Giardia was treated too and is also gone. However, she still sometimes has soft serve poopies. I work from home so she's rarely alone. I've housebroken several dogs, this girl is a problem! I've tried everthing from getting her on routines, tethering her to me, to tons of praising with treats. I've tried bells hung on a doorknob, a touchpad at the door linked to music...I clean with an enzymatic cleaner. Elektra doesn't seem to understand the link to \"asking\" to go out. She just squats and lets it flyyyyy! Ugh. I keep asking people if they've ever heard of a dog that couldn't be housebroken? Your thoughts?",
