    "selftext": "Hey \n\nSo our previously incredibly confident springer spaniel has developed an abject terror response to our frying pan when we're cooking. He's never done this previously (quite the opposite since he knows it means food is cooking..!).\n\nMy husband says that yesterday, while cooking dinner when I was out, there was a flash in the pan type 'fire' which was more of a sudden flame and went out again but it did set off the fire alarm. \n\nToday, our dog wouldn't go near the kitchen and when I put the frying pan on tonight, he was shaking uncontrollably for a decent period of time. \n\nWe don't know the pan is definitely the cause but it seems likely given what we've seen. \n\nThe problem is, the kitchen is the centre of our house. Its a tiny house and literally in the middle. So to go into the garden, upstairs, to the bathroom, the living room, or out the front door, he has to go through the kitchen, which he is terrified of doing right now.\n\nHe was willing to eat a bit of peanut butter near the hob but was still a bit shaky doing so and then didn't want to come in from the back garden afterwards.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how we might approach this for him? We don't want him to have be so fearful because that's awful for him. He's never really shown a fear response to much before, and certainly not in this way.",

            "body": "If possible, right now, I would try and keep the frying pan where he can't see it while you need to walk thru the kitchen with him. \n\nBut! So you don't need to do that forever, start doing some threshold work with him & the pan. Have the pan on the floor all the way across the place, but where he can still see it, and treat for him looking at it (if he's still too stressed move it further). You want him to gain his confidence with it again. No \"scary\" things with it, just slowly moving it around/closer so he knows it's okay. Treat him while your partner is cooking with it, and showing him that's okay too. \n\nIs that the first time your alarm has ever gone off? If so, I would practice setting it off on the test function and working with showing him that that's okay too. I live in an apartment building, and ours goes off often enough from other units doing things. My dog doesn't like it, but knows that even if it's going off, we're chill about it\n\nI hope this helps a bit, hopefully others might have some more advice for you \ud83e\udd7a best of luck \ud83e\udd1e",

                    "body": "I like your advice! My first thought for the pan was different, though, and I'm curious about your opinion since we seem aligned in the rest of the advice.  What has worked in the past for me is putting the object that scares the dog in an area he's comfortable with and then just leave it for the dog to sniff it out and get used to it. It can take days for them to approach it, but if you leave the pan out in a very accessible area for your dog and don't interact with it yourself,  eventually, it will be demystified. This method requires little effort on the human's part, some verbal encouragement if they start getting closer to it and you happen to notice, and making sure the dog can avoid it if they really want to.  Other than that,  the dog will do the work themselves at their own pace, most of the time, without a big round of treat training.",

Whenever he goes through the kitchen, give a treat! Keep a container of treats handy for rewarding being in the kitchen. Just build a positive association as much as possible. Scattering his kibble on the ground or hand feeding it to him would encourage him to spend time in there.\n\nBut he might also just forget about it in a few days.

While all of the advice here is certainly well meaning, it\u2019s possible you will need to take a combination of approaches to addressing it and is best done under the guidance of a trainer.\n\nApproaching desensitization too quickly for the dog or incorrectly can not only worsen the problem, but in my own experience, actually created a type of \u201ccontagion\u201d that made my dog even more likely to develop phobias. Eventually, she developed a phobia of myself after 4 years of living in my home because of the way I walked by her once. I had to disengage, ignore her for a few weeks and take a slow, controlled approach to \u201creintroduction\u201d.\n\nI worked with a local trainer specializing in spooky dogs, but trainer Amy Cook has some good resources online. My situation may be on the extreme side, but my opinion is that this is something best handled under the supervision of a professional, and even potentially consider medication as a tool to help you through this.

The noise is way less traumatizing, and it runs a self-test every month that you get a warning about on your phone, then a recorded spoken warning before it goes off, which gives me time to get ready with treats and/oror a Thundershirt or whatever else is helpful for the dog.

            "body": "Our old dog went through this. Suddenly hated the frying pan despite no obvious cause; I assume he probably got a tiny hot splatter of oil on his nose or face one day when I was frying something. Whenever I turned on the hood fan over the stove he\u2019d hightail it out of the kitchen, even if I wasn\u2019t cooking anything yet at that moment. And once he heard the sizzle sound of something being added to hot oil he was definitely gone. \n\n\nOur house layout wasn\u2019t a problem in that regard. But I didn\u2019t like that he was so scared so I just made a point of giving him a treat every time I turned on the hood fan or started frying something (like if he was already in the kitchen with me, I\u2019d have a treat ready and immediately offer it to him at the the same time as starting up the fan.) He\u2019d take the treat and quickly bail, but I think it helped to ease his fear a little bit. Positive association.  If your dog wanted to go somewhere else in the house badly enough he\u2019d make a break for it through the kitchen; if he would rather avoid the kitchen during frying pan time, so be it. Forcing or coaxing him into the kitchen with treats when he\u2019s already scared isn\u2019t going to improve his anxiety about it.  You could instead have a treat in your hand, get his attention and let him see you have the treat, and then toss it out to him (like to the periphery of the kitchen maybe?) at the same time as pulling out the frying pan. \n\n\nAlso tbh the way we got our dog better with other trigger objects (like the vacuum) was to just have it out in the open and put treats all around it randomly for him to find and eat. You could just leave a frying pan on the floor for a few weeks and randomly put a treat on the floor next to it, to increase positive association.",
