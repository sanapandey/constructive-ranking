    "selftext": "\nHi all! I went through all the guides and wikis, but I think my situation may be a bit more complicated, so I\u2019m hoping for some tips and advice. I have 4 dogs, one is a new puppy and my second oldest is having some trouble getting used to him. I have a 5 year old female corgi, a 3 year old male Aussie mix (rescue), a 2 year old female Corgi, and a new 11 week old male Pomeranian. The 3 year old is a very anxious guy, we\u2019ve worked through a lot of his triggers. It\u2019s important to note that he did not react or behave like this when the 2 year old was a puppy. He definitely doesn\u2019t like change though, he gets very nervous if we move, go new places, meet new people, etc., but he is never aggressive in those situations. We introduced the new guy behind some gates and not near his food bowls, beds, couch, etc., as neutral as we could get in negative temp weather. I also didn\u2019t want to introduce them on leash, because the 3 year old can be a bit leash reactive and usually does a bit better off leash. \n\nAs for his behavior now, he does ok when the puppy is sleeping or calmly playing, but when he gets very excited or jumps on me, he will bark at the puppy and lunge to get near him. He never goes for a bite or nip, it\u2019s more akin to a correction. I believe he is probably resource guarding or trying to protect me, so I have been rewarding calm behavior and good interactions with treats, and when he exhibits that behavior I put him in a kennel time out.\n\nThe new puppy is kennel training as well, so my 3 year old is getting a lot of alone time and cuddles to hopefully reassure him that I\u2019m not replacing him, as he definitely does get jealous. \n\nMy 3 year old lived with an older male dog for his whole puppyhood, and normally does pretty well with males, but he hasn\u2019t been around a male puppy in a long time, so I\u2019m not sure if that could be the reason. Both sides of our family have dogs, 4 on one side and 1 on the other and he does great with all of them, despite them being crazy or energetic, and jumping on me, but they are also all females. \n\nSo as for questions I have, is there anything else I can be doing to help my 3 year old become more comfortable with the baby? He has gotten a bit better since we first brought the baby home, so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s something he just needs to get used to, but I also don\u2019t want him to scare the baby. \nShould I be allowing some of the corrections to happen so the baby learns his boundaries when he\u2019s being crazy? How can I stop him from feeling like he needs to protect or resource guard me while also reassuring him that it\u2019s ok? Should I be doing anything differently like rotating them completely while he gets used to him, or should I still let them have interactions?\n\nEdit: Something else of note, he does have a current trazodone prescription for extremely stressful situations and we have tried fluoxetine in the past, but weaned him off of that. Would it help if I used a small dose of trazodone to hopefully help dull some of the anxiety he is feeling with the changes? \n\nThank you guys! Sorry for the long post. Also a little background, I\u2019m a dog groomer and my fianc\u00e9e works at a kennel, so we are pretty well versed in dog stuff in general, but not as much in the training side of things. ",
