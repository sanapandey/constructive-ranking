    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nOur family is at a bit of a loss with how to help the newest addition to our family, Tommy. We\u2019re hoping for advice and guidance as we navigate this journey with him. Here\u2019s a little background on Tommy, how he joined our family, and the challenges we\u2019re currently facing.\n\n# Tommy\u2019s Background and How He Joined Us\n\nBefore bringing Tommy into our home, we already had a 2-year-old (now 3) mini Boxer named Darwin. Darwin is an incredible dog\u2014the best we\u2019ve ever had\u2014and we all adore him. A few months ago, we heard that the breeder Darwin came from was retiring and selling off her breeding dogs. That\u2019s how Tommy came into the picture.\n\nTommy, a 4 \u00bd-year-old mini Boxer, is actually Darwin\u2019s father, which is a really special connection. However, Tommy was kennel-raised for his entire life, and we don\u2019t know much about his first four years. Based on his behavior and the condition he was in when he came to us, it\u2019s clear that Tommy experienced, at the very least, significant neglect.\n\nWhen Tommy arrived, he was nervous, covered in feces, and had to be lifted into and out of the car. He didn\u2019t seem to understand the concept of being indoors\u2014he ran into our sliding glass door because he didn\u2019t know he couldn\u2019t walk through it. He had clearly never worn a collar or been walked on a leash. It\u2019s likely that he had little, if any, interaction with humans beyond basic care in the kennel.\n\n# Tommy\u2019s Progress\n\nDespite his rough start, Tommy has made incredible strides in just under three months. When he first came home, he was so nervous that he\u2019d run away if we looked at him for too long. Now, he\u2019s comfortable enough to sit with us on the couch and even sleeps in our beds. (This is a personal preference for our family, and we enjoy it more than the dogs do!)\n\nOne of our biggest successes has been training Tommy to go outside to use the bathroom. This was something we weren\u2019t sure how long it would take given his background, but he\u2019s picked it up really well, and we\u2019re so proud of him for that.\n\nHe\u2019s also formed an incredible bond with Darwin. They are best buddies\u2014they follow each other around, play together, and even snuggle up on the couch. They share food and water bowls without any issues (our dogs are free-fed), but they have a funny quirk: they *have* to have the toy or bone the other has, even if we have two identical items. They\u2019ll just sit and watch the other dog with longing, but they\u2019re never aggressive. I house- and dog-sit frequently, so I know this isn\u2019t unusual in multi-dog households, but it\u2019s an entertaining behavior nonetheless!\n\nOn walks, Tommy is friendly with other neighborhood dogs, and we\u2019ve been able to walk him dozens of times. That said, he still trails behind and stops altogether if we try to slow down and get him to walk beside us.\n\n# The Challenges We\u2019re Facing\n\nWhile Tommy has made incredible progress, we\u2019re struggling to teach him basic commands like \u201csit,\u201d \u201clay,\u201d \u201cstay,\u201d and \u201ctouch.\u201d He\u2019s not highly food-motivated, and his nervousness around people makes training particularly challenging. If we say a command too loudly or with too much firmness, he becomes frightened and won\u2019t even take a treat.\n\nWe\u2019ve trained dogs before\u2014Darwin, for instance, is wonderfully trained\u2014but Tommy\u2019s nervousness is something we\u2019ve never encountered at this level. He flinches if someone raises their hand for him to sniff, which suggests he may not have had positive interactions with humans in the past.\n\n# Our Goal\n\nWe want to help Tommy feel safe and secure while teaching him basic commands to make his life (and ours) easier. We\u2019re not aiming for anything advanced, just simple obedience so he can live more comfortably and confidently. Right now, we\u2019re at a bit of a loss on how to approach training without overwhelming him.\n\n# Additional Context\n\nWhen Tommy first came home, he was so nervous that he had to be lifted everywhere. He\u2019s since gotten used to being walked, but his lack of confidence still shows. We\u2019re proud of how far he\u2019s come, but we\u2019re unsure how to bridge the gap between where he is now and where we\u2019d like him to be.\n\nIf you\u2019ve had experience with a dog like Tommy, or if you have tips on training a nervous and non-food-motivated dog, we\u2019d be so grateful for your advice. Thank you for taking the time to read about Tommy and our journey with him\u2014we truly want to give him the best life possible. If it matters at all, we are a family of 4 adults. Our parents who are in their early 50s and my sister and I who are early to mid 20s. \n\n  \nThank you for any help that you are able to give!",

I have been pretty detailled in my post about what we are struggling with, and even after reading the wiki pages, we still just don't know what to do with Tommy. He's a unique situation, that the general advice from the wiki pages just don't totally apply, and we just really want to help our boy.",
