    "selftext": "Hi I recently got a blind at birth dog who we think is a husky mix, whenever i take her outside she gets freaked out by the wind then starts barking which makes all the other dogs in the neighborhood start barking, what can I do to have her bark less I understand her barking at the wind but once the other dogs also start barking she can\u2019t stop, i don\u2019t think she understands they aren\u2019t there. hearing the dogs also makes her get really aggressive and she starts guarding me so I\u2019m worried this might spiral into her actually attacking a dog .(she also can\u2019t really seem to smell anything unless it\u2019s right under her nose which makes treat training hard)",
