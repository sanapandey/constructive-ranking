    "selftext": "We have an almost 5-year old mini Australian shepherd that we got during the pandemic. He was our WORLD for all those years, my husband and I continued to work out of our apartment and our dog, who doesn\u2019t really bark and is very well mannered, was constantly cuddling with us and had his favorite spot in the couch to rest. Pretty much our lives so so revolved around him and we took him exploring to many off-leash parks, beaches etc. We invested a lot of time into his training as a puppy and he\u2019s a very gentle dog.\n\nI got pregnant last year and he started behaving a bit differently. He\u2019d often sleep further away and turned away when I would ask him to sniff my belly.\n\nAs my due date approached we also moved homes, and our dog stayed with my parents for about 3 weeks while we were packing, renoing and moving. We expected that our dog would have at least one week adjusting to the new home before baby arrived, but surprise - he came early and our dog had to come into the new home AND meet new baby at the same time. This was almost 4 months ago.\n\nSince then our dog seems constantly restless and sad. We kept our bed but he doesn\u2019t snuggle up to us anymore. When I\u2019m with the baby he sleeps outside the room and often seeks validation that he\u2019s allowed up on the bed. He doesn\u2019t want to come near the baby anymore although at the start he was always trying to lick him which we unfortunately didn\u2019t allow, and that seemed to visibly stress him out. We keep the baby in his gated playpen but our dog is constantly pawing at it, and seems confused about why he can\u2019t have the baby\u2019s toys. He\u2019s started to whine more, get louder and bark at neighbours and guests, and generally seems so distant around us. We try to give him as much love and cuddles as we used to but of course it\u2019s not the same as it was and my heart breaks for him. One night he threw up in his crate in the middle of the night and we were so sleep deprived we didn\u2019t hear him and he slept in there until morning \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2dthe dog mom guilt is absolutely brutal.\n\nFrankly we don\u2019t know where to go from here. Our dog is mainly disinterested in the baby (is that good or bad?), but hasn\u2019t settled in the home enough to shake off the stress. Looking for any tips, encouragement, or solidarity.",
