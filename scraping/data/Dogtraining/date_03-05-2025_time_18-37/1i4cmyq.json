    "selftext": "Please help! We have a 2 year old male Aussie. He is our baby boy. We are struggling so much!! We have had training since we got him at 8 weeks old. He has basic manners down. He has amazing recall when we go hiking and such. He was the sweetest most loving boy until March last year when I got cancer. He started to get very protective and aggressive towards some people and dogs. He is perfectly fine with some people and some dogs, but not all and there isn\u2019t a rhyme or reason for who he likes and doesn\u2019t. We don\u2019t take him out places anymore except for hiking or trail walks because he needs exercise. He had been doing well when we have friends over our apartment, until recently. We put him on leash and have him go to place as soon as there is a knock. Then we allow our friends inside. We let them come in and get settled. He has to stay in place until he calms down completely. And he will stay there for a very long time. Our friend was in the living room and he was on place while I was in the kitchen cooking. He didn\u2019t move!That had been working so well. But last night, a glass broke on the floor so we had him go on the porch with dad while we cleaned up. During this a male friend went to the bathroom. We cleaned up and our dog came back inside. He was chilling and then our friend came out of the bathroom and he just snapped. We are lucky he didn\u2019t bite him but he did get his shirt and put a hole in it. It\u2019s to the point that I now don\u2019t trust our dog in our home. We were okay not bringing him out to public places while we worked on training but now I can\u2019t even have people come over. And the problem is that I don\u2019t know how to start fixing this. We can go get more training for reactivity but whenever we go meet with a trainer our dog is \u201cperfect\u201d. He never shows these behaviors in those settings. The problem is in our home in those group situations. What should we do? Where should we go from here? Please help! Thanks for reading this!",

We have met with trainers and work on what they tell us at home (place training, how to introduce our dog to people) but when we take a step forward our dog takes two steps back. Even with the training we have received and continue to implement it\u2019s just not working. We don\u2019t know what else to do at this point. He acts perfect with trainers so they don\u2019t see the aggression or reactivity. We are just lost now",

We tried crate training as a puppy but he just never liked it. We never used it as a punishment or anything. We fed him in his crate and everything but he just cried. We only don\u2019t trust with visitors. He is fine with just my bf and I. We have checked with the vet and it\u2019s not physical. We also tried muzzle training. We must have done something wrong at some point because if I even touch the muzzle he barks and runs away and freaks out. We went through muzzle training with our trainer too so we tried to do it the best way possible. Our previous training has never used aversive methods. We are in talks with two highly skilled trainers the problem is money. We are both teachers and just don\u2019t make enough to afford multi thousand dollar training.",

Not allowing the dog in the same room as visitors.",
