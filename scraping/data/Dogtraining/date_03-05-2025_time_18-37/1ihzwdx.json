    "selftext": "So I have two shepherd mutts that absolutely love chewing on things they shouldn't when they start to get bored. \n\nI'm caught on the whole \"don't give dogs chewies that aren't flexible because they could break their teeth\" (so stuff like bones and hooves would be a no-go). But, alternatively, they're shredding dogs so soft chewies don't last them and are more like treats for them instead of something to keep them preoccupied while I work.\n\nSo is there a happy medium here that I'm missing? \n\nWhen I have extra, I do give them cardboard that they are allowed to shred to their hearts content in restricted areas of the house (to make cleanup easier), so they are getting the tear part of their prey drive satiated. (I do want to eventually move them to partial heads of lettuce that way its also refreshing to them instead of running the risk of causing a bowel obstruction.)",

A good middle ground would be rubber or nylon chew toys like West Paw\u2019s Zogoflex line or the Kong Extreme. They have some give but are tough enough for power chewers. Himalayan yak chews are also great\u2014hard at first but soften as they chew, making them last longer than standard treats. Raw, frozen marrow bones (with supervision) can be a safe option too since they\u2019re softer than cooked bones.\n\nIf they love shredding, consider tightly rolled jute tug toys or even supervised sessions with a fleece rope toy\u2014they can tear into it a bit but not swallow large pieces. Your idea of lettuce is interesting, too! Maybe try frozen carrots for a crunchy, safe alternative. Hope that helps!",
