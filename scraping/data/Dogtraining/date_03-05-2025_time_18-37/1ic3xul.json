This class teaches your team the learning structure and skills that will be utilized throughout all other agility classes: Clicker training, principles of operant conditioning, obedience and positional cues related to agility, focus, impulse control, drive, play and working through distraction. Introduction to agility equipment will occur as appropriate for the skill level of team, but will not be the focus of Foundation Essentials. These skills will carry over to all future training and subsequently, this class should be repeated as necessary. Dogs of any age including puppies.\u00a0**Once proficient, or with prior instructor approval, your team may enroll in any of the four Foundation Concentration classes.**\" \n\nand\n\n \"Your starting point in the sport of agility. You begin with Agility Foundation Essentials and move on to each of the four Agility Foundation Concentrations when your team is ready. Teams will learn initial skills necessary to succeed in the sport. This skill-set will provide the foundation that all other agility skills will be built upon. Time and effort spent building a strong foundation makes all other agility training easier for you and your dog. The teamwork between handler and dog are developed and strengthened in foundations. \n\nPREREQUISITES: Basic obedience skills such as sit, down, stay, focus on handler. No aggressive dogs. Minimum age 6 months. \n\nENROLLMENT LIMIT: 6 Teams.\"\n\n  \nI want to do the actual course... not sure if this is it..",

It sounds like you will work on rewarding your dog, on getting your dog into various physicians around your body, and maybe very slow introductions to very basic equipment.  \n\nWhen you say \u201cdo the actual course\u201d are you meaning running full sequences on equipment?  If that is what you were wanting to do, has your dog already been through a basic foundation course?  \n\nAgility is taught very slowly intentionally. It is extremely easy for a dog to be injured, scared, or develop really bad habits when introduced to the equipment too quickly.",

I have suggested people with active, intelligent dogs that need a certain level of enrichment to take classes like this, barn hunt, flyball, scent work, dock diving... Even if it turns out not to be the right thing for the dog, it's a great way to create a great bond between handler and dog.   I know someone who started her doodle in rally-o, and has moved on to Barn hunts. Dog has a blast and she's very proud of his accomplishments.  And she had never owned a dog before!",

They definitely need activity and enrichment.   This is why when they start mixing poodles with other breeds they create a nightmare.
