So I am supposed to start indoors. But we need to go potty immediately, 3-5 times per day! What do I do then? And my dog needs \\*exercise\\*. We want to go on a daily 4-5 mile walk with her. Do we have to wait for weeks or months until we can give her proper exercise? This doesn't seem reasonable.\n\nThanks for your thoughts!\n\nMarkus",

I have not seen  clarity on the following question: How can you just start indoors? You \\*have\\* to go potty, so immediately I am outside in a high-distraction environment (NYC). And in fact, we need to give \\*exercise\\* to our dog (no?), like the 4-5 mile walks in Prospect Park that we love to go on (and we need exercise, too). Are we \\*not\\* to exercise our (new) dog until we've mastered the loose leash walking? I think she'll go crazy.\n\nThanks,\n\nMarkus",

            "body": "How old is your dog? You don't want to walk your dog for miles until they're around 9/12 months. Look it up for your dog. When they are still developing, it can cause issues. It is mainly if you were to take him hiking, but 3 miles can be bad for some puppies. \n\nPotty training is short breaks and you want to be very consistent. Put your dog on a long leash so that he won't pull very much. \n\nAll training starts inside, WITHOUT distractions. If your puppy doesnt know how to walk, pulls, is super hyper and doesn't listen to you inside, they're not gonna listen when there are a million smellls, noises and dogs+ people everywhere. \n\nLoose leash walking- you communicate through the leash and have to each your puppy how to turn off leash pressure. First, pick a side. Right or left and keep them there. When they get to the end of the leash, stop. Wait for your puppy to come to the right side or call them. Be very enthusiastic for all training and use high value treats (freeze dried, cheese, hot dogs etc). Another exercise to practice is walking in circles or just like super random. You want to make a lot of different directional changes to get your puppy to look to you for guidance. I always walk in circles, 10 times to the left, turn 10 times to the right. And give traats for every few steps. For puppies amd small dogs, use a long spoon with peanut butter or plain GREEK yogurt. (I usually freeze it but not necessary) you have to give treats at their level and at your side, not in front. Give treats in the hand where they're at. Do not cross over and give puppy treats from your right hand if they're on your left side because thst will cause them to walk in front which is what he don't want. If you give the treats too high, that can cause the puppy to jump.\n\nAnytime you take just one step and your puppy pulls and gets away with it bc they want to see a neighbor or smell a tree to pee, that is reinforcing the pulling.",

            "body": "I got some great advice about loose leash walking/walking manners that has worked really well for me. When you first start training your dog to walk politely on leash, take walks with either a distance OR a time goal. If you plan to walk for 30 minutes, plan to be okay with only walking two blocks, if that's what it takes. If you plan on walking to the store, plan to be okay with it taking two hours, if that's what it needs. Stop as often as you need to, for as long as you need to, if your dog is pulling, and use whichever techniques (e.g., stop and wait, turn around and walk back, ask for an alternative behavior and then release, etc). As they mature and the training starts to stick, you can start to relax your time-or-distance rule until they can be expected to walk politely at your normal pace.\n\nThis strategy is also great for building neutrality about the world. Let them look at things that they are concerned about/interested in for as long as they want, until they choose to disengage from them on their own, and then reward the disengagement from the thing by excitedly continuing walking, or reward them for looking back at you (note: if they are over-excited about a thing and are barking/lunging at it or disturbing it in some way, obviously this doesn't apply, help them disengage and get away from it). \n\nDefinitely follow the advice of others about the distances that are appropriate for your dog. If your dog is still a puppy, their joints may be too young and underdeveloped to walk 4-5 miles safely. You can exercise your dog in shorter bursts and work on their mental exercise with training and enrichment to keep them from being restless and bored.",

If your dog accepts the leash then just put it on and go out.

I\u2019m also kind of against flexi leashes (never used them and I have had only chihuahuas) the dog should have one lenght leash so they would know how much they can move away from you during a walk.

Doing this requires a big effort on the part of your doggo to ignore all the fun stuff passing them by (smells). Besides, the more they get to interact and explore their environment, the more tired they will be. \n\nThere are two kinds of walks- a training walk and just walking for funzies. You can incorporate a training walk INTO the fun walk. Starting out with a wild animal at the end of the leash is fine and even expected! Give them a several minutes to saturate on their environment, then start paying (giving treats) for attention. As in- the microsecond they look at you, you pop a high value treat in their mouth. Then, let them go back to being a dog. Pretty soon you'll start to get more an more check-ins- especially if the treats you're using are higher value than what is in the environment. Now you can gradually start asking for more.\n\nDogs live their lives through their noses. If you can balance what they want with what you want you will both enjoy your walk.",

Then switch to the flat collar and a short lead for the last part home as training for loose leash walking. Slowly these last parts of the walk become longer until almost all of the walk is relaxed (after the initial 5 minutes of zoomies because I have Boxers). They also become more relaxed on the long lead with time as they discover that they can actually take their time sniffing. The only exception is my now almost 5 year old female who still pulls with every little bit of excitement but to be honest, I only got her with 12 months and it is hard to be consistent if a puppy is allowed to pull for the first year of life. She can walk in a loose heal or real heal, but only under command, otherwise she is free to pull a little as long as she doesn't go too crazy.\nWith my now puppy (9 mo) I did the same as with my older male, so only introduce the leash at 5-6 months old, before that they just waddle besides me freely. Now they only know to walk proper on a leash because otherwise they are free and allowed to go crazy :) There are a lot of methods out there, you have to stick with one that fits you and keep it a good 2-3 months very consistently and then you will see improvement",

The only rules are that I decide where we are going, no pulling on the tether (I just stop and wait when she pulls), and we mind our own business (rewards come when a distraction - like a other dog- happen and she checks in with me after focusing on the distraction). This way you can get out and get some exercise will reinforcing some of the foundations for later (like eye contact, ignoring distractions, and not pulling).

            "body": "Leash training starts on day 1 of ownership. It doesn't matter what you do. Your dog is *learning*. \n\nFirst, how old is your dog? The reason small puppies are told to wait before leash training is because they haven't yet gotten all their shots and so walking on contaminatrd soil will make them sick. Parvo is real so patience is a must. They need to have at least their second round of shots before you start. For longer hikes they should have their rabies shot also just in case.\n\nSecond, will your adult dog need to be leashed when pottying? If not then you don't have to worry about leasing for potty training. If you do live somewhere where they do need to be leashed for potty training then yes start leashing for potty training. For super young puppies I'd have then sit by the door, then leash them, then carry them outside to the piddle spot, piddle and praise then carry them inside, unless and another treat. That sets them up for the habit of being a big dog who sits by the door when they need to potty and who knows that we go nowhere without the leash. Plus if you carry the little puppy it lessens the chance of an accident on a way, which sets the dog up for a successful potty run every time.\n\nThird, yes I'd work on leash training inside first. If your puppy is leashed to you then it won't be able to sneak off and eat your shoes or poop under your bed. For me having free range of the house is an earned privilege, not a right. Keep puppy on a leash so they can get used to it dragging/ganging by their face and can start to understand what gets them tangled and what gets them not. Figuring all that out before they go outside helps them so that when they do go outside they can focus on that adventure instead having to focus on how to walk with a leash. If you work on it during early puppyhood then your dog will be trained by the the time their physically ready for 4-5 mile.",

So you train all the stuff you need for a good walk, then start short walls, increasing time based on pups abilities",
