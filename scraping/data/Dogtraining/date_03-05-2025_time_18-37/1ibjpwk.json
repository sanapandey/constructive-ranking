    "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9e and I recently adopted an 8-month-old puppy, Penny, from a shelter four days ago. The shelter listed her as a Lab-Husky mix, but we think she might be more of a Lab-Kelpie mix. This Saturday, we\u2019re planning to introduce Penny to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family dog, Lucy, who lives at her parents\u2019 house about an hour away. Lucy is a 4-year-old Chocolate Lab that we\u2019ve known since she was a puppy.\n\nTo help the dogs meet successfully, we\u2019re thinking of starting at a neutral location like a dog park. Our plan is to begin with \u201cpass-by walks\u201d to let them get acquainted from a distance. Once they seem more comfortable, we\u2019ll allow them to interact through a chain-link fence.\n\nOne concern is that my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family will also be meeting Penny for the first time, which means there will be 3-4 people there. To avoid overwhelming her, we\u2019re considering introducing Penny to the family first. After that, we\u2019d have one person walk Penny and another walk Lucy for their introduction, rather than having a large group present, which could cause unnecessary stress. Would that be a good plan?\n\nIf the initial meeting goes well, we\u2019d probably head back to their house to visit. However, I\u2019m wondering if it might be too soon to bring Penny into Lucy\u2019s \u201cterritory.\u201d Should we play it by ear and see how both dogs react, or would it be better to hold off on going to their house until a later time?",
