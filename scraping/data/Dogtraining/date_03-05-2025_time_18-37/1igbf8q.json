    "selftext": "Hello, everyone. i am in serious need of help with potty training my 7mo cane corso girl. we have had her since 8 weeks & literally nothing we do works. she is not consistent AT ALL. we did the every hour then 2 hours then 3 then 4 & she does great for 2 days then for 2 weeks has multiple accidents inside. we tried bells, she\u2019s terrified of them. we praise when she goes outside. we got a cage divider. she will lay in her pee. thankfully she won\u2019t poop inside but she pees & lays in it to hide it. i am coming to my wits end & am seriously needing help. she can hold it for about 3 hours then 6 hours other days. (going off the per month / per hour they can hold) we recently took her to the vet bc we thought she could have a UTI & after all the work ups, nothing is wrong with her & she\u2019s just not grasping the concept. for reference, i usually get home from work at 12pm the latest & my boyfriend goes in at 8 am so she\u2019s alone 4 hours & does GREAT. but when we\u2019re home she has the accidents. we also have a cat but i\u2019ve monitored & the cat doesn\u2019t go near her to scare her or excite her. she won\u2019t whine to go out, just pee & lay her whole body over it. please help.",
