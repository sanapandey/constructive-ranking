    "selftext": "Our 15 month old cavashon loves too sniff and eat garbage whenever she can. We live in a city where there are lots of discarded food scraps available regularly. She also has a very easily upset stomach and tons of food sensativities.  Any high value treats we have tried lead to diarrhea if given more than sparingly.  I can't keep making monthly trips to the vet for meds and treatment. Does anyone have any help we can use to train this puppy to stop hurting herself. ",
