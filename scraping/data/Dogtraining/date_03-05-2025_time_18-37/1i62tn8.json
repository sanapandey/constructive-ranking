    "selftext": "So I\u2019ve had dogs all my life and I always thought it\u2019d be great for my dog to sleep with me, but my parents never allowed it when I was younger. Now that I\u2019m an adult and have my own dog, I trained it to sleep with me in my bed since day one. My dog, a beautiful short haired black and tan 4 year old dachshund, sleeps every night with me but has his own doggy beds where he naps during the day. \n\nNow that I\u2019m moving and planning on buying a new bed, I don\u2019t really want him sleeping with me anymore. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I LOVE cuddling with him every night, but he gets my bed sooo dirty. Last night I changed the sheets and this morning my bed was covered in hair and also he has that yellowish discharge that all male dogs have and it keeps staying my bed even though I try to clean him as much as possible. I\u2019m getting tired of having to change sheets so often and my bed always feeling dirty no matter what I do. Cus yea, I can vacuum the dog hair but he still leaves those stains and I find them gross cus he likes to sleep cuddled close to my face, so the stains are also close to my face. Also, washing the sheets so often is wearing them down faster than it should, and it all just feels like a lot of work. I\u2019d like for my bed to stay clean longer. \n\nNow that I\u2019m moving to a different place, I thought it would be the perfect time to teach him to sleep in his own bed even if it\u2019s in my room. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips?? Or maybe some tips on how to keep my bed clean? Like I\u2019d love to keep sleeping with him but being unable to keep my room clean for longer than a day without changing the sheets and having to un-stain them is driving me crazy.\n\nPlease help!",
