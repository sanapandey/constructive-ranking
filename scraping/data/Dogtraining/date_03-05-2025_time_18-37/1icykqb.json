I\u2019m trying to find new ways to help each dog enjoy training by using what they were bred to do. For example using scent work for hound dogs. I am dyslexic so I want suggestions that are easy and fun to read. I want to learn more about the 7 groups of dogs and the breeds that consist of each group as well any suggestions are appreciated. I will also accept articles or podcasts/lectures really any form of information about this topic. I also specifically train using positive reinforcement! Thank you!",
