    "selftext": "Hi! I'm looking for advice on promoting independence in my deaf and vision-impaired dog. I adopted my dog two months ago (in November), and now that I have a better understanding of her baseline and disabilities, I want to create a tailored training plan utilizing positive reinforcement.\n\nShe is an amazing dog (and quite adorable). However,  since I've brought her home she's really struggled with letting me out of her sight and tends to shadow me constantly. I believe a large part of her anxiety comes from the deafness/vision impairment which is why I wanted to begin by asking others in this group. She's non destructive and can be left home alone with ease. In fact working long night shifts it's pretty routine, and from pet cameras I know she just sleeps the whole time. When home she respects closed doors and will go lay down; if I'm in the bedroom, bathroom, etc. However if I'm anywhere else she is there CONSTANTLY. To the point that she's learned to strategically sit on my foot or touching me so that she knows if I leave the room. It's difficult to have guests over because she does not respect space or boundaries. She doesn't jump up... more so wiggles and squirms as close as possible and really likes putting her nose in faces. \n\nHere's our main focal points:\n\n\u2022 Crate Training \n\u2022 Seperation anxiety/inability to settle\n\u2022 Grounding on walks\n\nI'm working on crate training and teaching her that it's a safe space, hoping that having a cue to go to her kennel will encourage her to take space on her own. Right now, she cries a lot when the door is closed. To help with this, I've started feeding her meals in the crate and rewarding her whenever she enters on her own.\n\nI'm also increasing enrichment activities and providing more daytime stimulation, as she has a lot of energy. While I try to walk her often, I'm struggling with her grounding. When we go outside, she potties immediately and then wants to go right back inside. Even with treat bribes, she refuses to walk.\n\nAnother thing I'm considering is using melatonin, especially during crate training. She's currently undergoing heartworm treatment, and after vet visits, the medication they give her leaves her noticeably calmer. She still watches me move around but doesn\u2019t feel the need to get up and follow, which makes me wonder if melatonin could help her relax in similar situations.\n\nAny and all advice to the above is welcome! Just looking for insight from others that have worked through these behaviors and what did or did not work for your pup. Thanks!",

            "body": "Hi there. \n\nI\u2019m a separation anxiety specialist. \n\nThe behavior that you are seeing is not separation anxiety but possibly some attention seeking behavior or hyper attachment to you. \n\nI would not use crate training for this, especially since she is showing so much stress in it. \n\nInstead I would work on teaching relaxation on mat with you in a room and then with you moving around. \n\nHere is a relaxation protocol that I use for clients;\nLet\u2019s start to work on this [Relaxation protocol](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hjidAsrl7Gjcx8BE496d5a3IUHu_JaH1) to learn how to stay on a mat when we are moving around. This will help him feel more secure and not need to follow you all the time\n\n[Training of phases](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18QruUYB2H98JKgKuxcaBQYRvGHPB0GQo) -  this is raw training sessions.There are going to be various dogs in here showing how to work through the phases. You will also see that I adapt phases for things that my dog needs. You can customize the training plans for your dog\u2019s needs. \n\nWe want to point to the mat, say your go to mat word and then reward when any part of the body hits the mat. We are not cueing into a position, we are waiting for the dog to chose relaxation and lying down on their own\n\nBest of luck! Let me know if you have questions",

            "body": "It's really wise of her to want to spend a lot of time bonding with you. Her neurology is growing new connections while she's in proximity to you. It's been horribly difficult for her to have these difficulties while not knowing what her home is and who she can trust.if you just let her be Velcro as much as possible with acceptance and love, then she will eventually feel it. All of my rescues it takes them quite a while before they really feel like they are safe. And the ones who have neurological damage it takes much longer. So with your dog it's going to take longer. But she will get there. Thank you for being so good to her.",
