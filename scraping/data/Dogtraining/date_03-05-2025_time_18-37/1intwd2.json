    "selftext": "I have let my dog roam as he pleases because he stays in a general area I\u2019m aware of. Recently my neighbor told me he\u2019s been terrorizing them, he has been doing this for the 2 years he\u2019s been alive and I had no idea. He chases their kids, he digs under their chicken coop and destroys property. They finally gave me the details of his nonsense this morning. He loves walking around our yard and laying down in the sun and listening to the outside. I\u2019ve been trying to plan how I\u2019m going to train him to live a life where he isn\u2019t free to roam. \n2 walks a day, only allowed outside while supervised, training session mid day if I\u2019m home and enrichment if I\u2019m not. \nI need tips on how I\u2019m gonna keep him happy while not letting him be free outside all he wants. Im mostly worried because he has been doing th same thing for so long.  this will completely change his schedule and he loves his creature comforts like everyone else. His is being able to take multiple hour naps in the dirt outside and I don\u2019t want to watch him do that. ",

Be careful about no accidents whilst tied out though",

We have about an acre closed in with 5ft goat fencing and cedar posts where they are free to roam as they please. They get daily walks to fulfill their enrichment needs, plus added enrichment through trick training, scent work, chews, etc.",

Parents lived in an agricultural area; a herd of sheep were installed in a field across the road. Taj, being a sight hound (chases prey), went across the road, leaped the fence, killing 6 sheep, injuring 30 others.  Parents were billed several thousand $$ for damages. \n\nTaj was sent to the San Diego Humane Society; he was rescued and thereafter won awards in dog shows. \n\nIf your dog exhibits Afghan traits, as well as having a lighter Afghan body type, your fence should be more than 5\u2019 high.",

You could get a 30 or 50 foot line you can put him out on so he can still get his dirt naps in without being able to leave your yard. You could also fence a portion of the property that you want him to be in. Otherwise, just experimenting with his walk length and intervals until it seems like he is fulfilled along with the enrichment you mentioned.",

Beautiful, but headstrong and dumber than dirt.   Ended up giving him away, a thousand dollar show dog back in the 80\u2019s. The lady I gave him to entered him in shows at least locally, and I think he did well.  She had fun, and I ended up with a half block lab, half golden retriever a few years later.  Magic dog.
