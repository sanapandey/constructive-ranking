    "selftext": "My dog ( Eurasier male from May 2023) had sugery on tuesday and needs to calm the fuck down. He does not.. This all makes sense because of his age and personality but I don't know how to help him. He isn't allowed to walk a lot and no jumping, running for 12 weeks. We already have sniffing mats, chewing and slow feeding but shouldn't put on weight because the strain that can cause.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for what to teach him or how to keep his brain busy and his weeks a bit more manageble \n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for this, for Iroh but also a bit for myself and relavating my human emotions into this. I will pick up the sedatives and find steal some cups for training the little sniffer \n\nThe operation was a emergency sugery for 5 cut tendons in his left front paw. If you break a glass, don't trow it in the glass please. He started a zoomie happy and without issues and it didn't end that way",

They don\u2019t make themselves miserable by *thinking* about being bored and dreading it the same way we can.\n\nWhen a dog is actually truly bored by not having enough stimulus/exercise you can tell because they are manifesting some kind of negative behavior, like destructive self-chewing. If they aren\u2019t\u2026 then they probably aren\u2019t miserably bored. When my dogs\u2019 needs are met, they laze around the house for hours quite contentedly. Being zonked on drugs in a crate for a little while to help them heal is different than a human being laid up in a hospital. You aren\u2019t upending their entire world you\u2019re just modifying their routine for a bit.\n\nWorst case scenario would you rather have your buddy be a bit under-stimulated or would you rather have them pull stitches and require a return to the vet and a reset of the recovery clock?",

            "body": "Medication for sure! I'm surprised they didn't send you home without Trazodone, to be honest. Call your vet and ask them for something to help keep him calm. \n\nThat being said, meds are often not enough for young, high energy dogs. Some ideas to consider: \n\n--puzzle feeders/sniff mat (you already have-great!)\n\n-- frozen Kongs or Toppls stuffed with wet food or kibble soaked in broth\n\n--look up DIY enrichment ideas. Some can be made in the cheap out of cardboard boxes, toilet paper rolls, muffin tins, towels, etc. \n\n-- use his meals (if kibble) for low-energy \"find it\" or nose work games. Hide a bit of kibble under a cup or bowl, tell him to find it, and let him knock it over and eat it. Once he's proficient, introduce a second cup with nothing underneath. If he correctly identifies the cup with the kibble, he gets an extra snack! See how many extra cups you can add before he gets confused. If he gets really good, hide the kibble when he's not looking or is in another room, then lead him over (on leash, to minimize running) and have him sniff out the right one. \n\nNote: for all of the food options above, id recommend just using his regular meals instead of adding calories with extra treats. While he's in recovery, ditch his food bowl completely and feed all his meals in an enriching way. \n\n--trick training. Shake a paw, nose touching various objects, play dead, paw targeting various objects, army crawl, beg/sit pretty, etc all might be options depending on where his incision is and how bendy/stretchy he's allowed to be. I like the Tricktionary by Kyra Sundance (there's an app for it too) for all kinds of fun tricks. Just stick to low-energy or stationary options.\n\n--obedience training: unless you compete in obedience shows, there's always something you can work on! Work on impulse control skills (stay, wait, leave it), giving and maintaining eye contact, or more advanced skills like a full obedience heel with him glued to your hip (obviously do this in moderation). Teach him to come to your right or left side, circle behind you, stand between your legs, etc.\n\n--if your dog has basic obedience down, look into beginner RallyO! This is a chill dog sport that's kind of a combo of agility and obedience, where you go through a course and do different obedience cues (stay, sit,  etc) at each station. Set up a course in your living room and do a sedate, slow-paced walkthrough. \n\n--doggy massage: this sounds like hoodoo but dogs *love* it and find it very calming. Look up some videos or guides on line and experiment with what your dog likes. Mine likes shoulder rubs, long strokes down the spine, and ear massages.",

Nothing too exciting - when my young border collie had surgery we spent probably collectively dozens of hours just pulling out random stuff, letting her look at it and wonder what it is, spinning it around and letting her think about how some things spin well and some don't, some things do something when you click a button, etc. If they're already worked up this will just frustrate them because they can't play with it, but if they're getting depressed in their crate this is a good way to keep them thinking and keep their spirit up and help prevent them from getting worked up in the first place.\n\n2. Teach him words, and if he picks them up well this is a good time to work on actual linguistic concepts not just names of things or specific commands. Abstract concepts like \"later\" and \"where?\", or combining adjectives or verbs with the nouns (for example, the distinction between a yellow ball and a blue ball, and then the distinction between other yellow and blue things). This kind of linguistic processing takes a *lot* of thought.",
