    "selftext": "I recently rescued a GSD off the streets. She was sick and in and out of the vet for a few weeks. During that time she was extremely docile and listened. Now that she's healed, she's all over the place.\n\nMy GSD is about 1yr. She listens sometimes. However, she does not listen when she's distracted. I can't seem to break her distraction. I've tried commands, sounds, toys, pressure, but nothing seems to work.\n\nHer focus is also challenging when trying to train her. She'll mindlessly listen to some commands like sit and shake (aka paw). I've been trying to teach her lay-down, but it's a work in progress. The issue is, it's like her brain is empty. She's not all the way there, she just wants the reward. If she doesn't do what I want her to do, she doesn't get rewarded. When I don't reward her, she doesn't listen and becomes distracted.\n\nWhen I take her on walks she typically walks next to me with minimal pulling until there's another dog. Which there a lot of, pretty much all our neighbors have at least one. Iv'e tried giving her attention whenever we see a dog so she learns to give less attention to other dogs, however no matter what I do she will not focus on me.\n\nShe also has a habit of running out of the gate and down the street to our neighbors houses. She doesn't listen to recalls 99% of the time, and when I chase after her she runs further away. I drag her back to my house by pulling her by her collar. She doesn't understand the concept of something she does being wrong. She does the same thing when she runs into the house.\n\nSometimes when she does something bad she gets scared and pees. I'm almost 99% sure it's because of her history on the streets. Especially paired with the facts she's scared of bridges. But, it could also be a lack of trust she has.\n\nI know she's capable of achieving high levels of focus and learning tricks and rules. She learned sit and shake in less than a week by watching our other dog do those commands.\n\nI can't afford a professional trainer. I've done research by reading books/websites and watching various videos.\n\nDoes anyone have tips on how to get my dog to focus on me when they are distracted?",
