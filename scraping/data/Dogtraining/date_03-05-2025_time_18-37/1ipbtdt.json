    "selftext": "My dog's 7 and has been sleeping with me every night in bed for around 5 years. He used to rarely get up in the middle of the night and if he did it was to go pee. But recently he has been getting up every night. He jumps off the bed and sits on the ground and whimpers. I think he needs to go pee or do something so I get off the bed. But when I do that and try to shove his butt to go outside he just jumps back on the bed to sleep.\n\nEvery night before I go to bed I make sure he goes outside to go pee and he may drink some water if he's feeling like it. Any adivce?",
