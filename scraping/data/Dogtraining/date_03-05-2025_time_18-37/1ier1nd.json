    "selftext": "Hi folks! I hope this is the right place to post this. My dog is wrapping up Canine Good Citizen training, and I\u2019m confident she will pass the CGC evaluation soon. I\u2019d like to take additional classes (either group or private) for the CGC-A or CGC-U, mainly because I plan to take her to indoor pet-friendly areas (like my local mall, Home Depot, etc.) during the summer, and I want her to be well-behaved.\n\nI've asked around, but most trainers seem to only offer CGC training and not the advanced levels. The other classes I\u2019ve found focus on scent work or trick training, which isn\u2019t what I\u2019m looking for.\n\nDoes anyone have advice on how I can find a dog trainer willing to work with me toward these goals? I've called a couple of trainers in my area, but so far have been redirected to take rally classes or go on a waitlist until someone can offer those classes. ",

When I called to a couple places, I was told that the directory information was not up-to-date and was encouraged to keep calling dog trainers. I have found one reputable training location nearby that does the training, but has no training classes available until the spring. I was also able to find a dog show judge who evaluates, but does not offer classes.",
