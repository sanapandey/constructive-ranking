    "selftext": "Hello all, I read the wiki on house training. My GSP was not potty trained at all when I got him. He used to mark inside but I neutered him within 3 days of having him. When he pees inside if I caught him midstream it\u2019d be a NO followed by rushing outside. At first he was scared of stairs so I\u2019d carry him but taught him to go down by putting treats and now he goes down them no problem. I think I may have accidentally taught him to pee inside is to be let outside. Like he will run downstairs and on his way up he will pee if I don\u2019t beat him to the top of the stairs before he gets to the bottom.  If I am in the bathroom or shower or anything like in the kitchen and I don\u2019t hear him go down but when I hear him run back up there\u2019s pee on the stairs. He does this for pooping too. \n\nHow can I change his \u201calert\u201d for going outside?",
