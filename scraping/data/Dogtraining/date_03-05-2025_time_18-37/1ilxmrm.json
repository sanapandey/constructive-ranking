    "selftext": "I have a 1.5/yo neutered male goldendoodle who is very high-energy, occasionally mouthy when he gets excited. He is extremely friendly and loves all other dogs, and has never had an aggressive bone in his body. \n\nI've also just adopted a 12-week-old Australian Shepherd puppy, who is also high-energy. I've been trying to introduce them to each other in neutral, controlled settings, but they get so rambunctious with each other, I can't tell if they're playing or if they hate each other. Both dogs will be getting in the play position and having wagging tails, neither growling. But they seem to just take turns biting each other in the face, and it freaks me out lol. When the little one seems overwhelmed and stressed, I pull my big dog away, but then the little one starts bounding after him! Or my big dog will chase him and pin him to the ground by the neck, which also freaks me out. My puppy will roll around in submissive postures, and my 50 lb doodle will dance around him and I'm so terrified he's going to just step on him and kill him or something. But my puppy shows literally no sign of fear around him. Neither dog will settle at all if the other is in the room, even for hours, they will be going at it non-stop until I physically separate them. The behavior seems aggressive to me, but also, like not?? If that makes any sense at all. The actions themselves are aggressive (biting, pinning, chasing, etc) but their body language seems friendly to me. I don't want to make a mistake and have something terrible happen, please let me know what i should do. I am also worried that my doodle being mouthy with my puppy and biting his face constantly will teach my puppy to be mouthy as well (he's currently not very). Any advice on how to stop this behavior?
