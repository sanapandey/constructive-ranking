    "selftext": "I have a 12yo goldendoodle who I walk in the neighborhood. The nearby school football field doubles as an unofficial dog park in the afternoons that we often walk by but never join.  There is one dog in this group who goes completely berserk when he sees my dog, even from as far as 50 yards away. This dog becomes uncontrollable to its owner and has now twice run outside of the fenced in area and attacked my dog. Other than that, these two dogs have never met.  That dog is able to apparently play with the other off-leash dogs without any issues. I've met the dog once without my dog, and it seemed normal and friendly.  \n\nAny idea what causes something like this, and how I can suggest the owners might address it through training? It's like my dog must have slept with this dog's mother in another life - there's a blood vendetta there. ",
