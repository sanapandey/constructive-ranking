    "selftext": "I have a 5 year old Belgian Malinois, he's trained pretty darn good and has never been too mischievous or destructive. I've left him out since he was about a year old and he was fine when it was just us two, he would play with his Kong or nap in his spot and besides a time or two going into the garbage for a snack, I've never had problems with him.\n\nMy girlfriend and I live with each other and have been for almost two years now. When we moved in with her is when it started to change.\n\nWhen I'm the last to leave the house he's good. He looks out the window, naps, plays, all around good boy. After some time he's come to accept his new home.\n\nWhen my girlfriend is the last to leave the house he's the complete opposite. He will surf the counter grab spices, go into the cooking utensils, grab anything He can reach which is most things and then chew on them. He got fixated on one spot on the couch and ended completely gutting it..\n\nI've had her walk him, do hours of obedience, feed him every day, we've done \"pack walks\" where she will walk ahead of us and \"lead the pack\", all in an effort for him to figure the hierarchy.\n\nIt's been almost two years and he still acts up whenever she's the last to leave the house or when she comes home and he gets excited. He gets lots of excercise both physical and mental, has multiple toys (kongs, no soft toys, nothing fabric or otherwise similar to furniture) I'm at a loss and any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I've tried different methods to get my dog to not misbehave and destroy things and just don't know I its something I should do, my girlfriend should do, or something we should do together. He knows these things aren't OK, he just acts out when my girlfriend leaves him.",
