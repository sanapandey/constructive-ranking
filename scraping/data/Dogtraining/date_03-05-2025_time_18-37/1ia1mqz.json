    "selftext": "My 3 1/2 yr old bernadoodle wakes me up twice every night to go out and look around . Once she feels like everything is okay she comes back in. She sits on my side of the bed and waits and growls at me until I get up. If she is in bed she pushes into me to wake me up. I have tried to ignore it but that doesn\u2019t work. Ideas? ",
