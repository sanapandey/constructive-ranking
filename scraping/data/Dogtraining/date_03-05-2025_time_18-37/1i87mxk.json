    "selftext": "My dog is 8 and has a nasty habit of \"correcting\" other dogs and children by nipping. It usually is not a problem because I do not live with other dogs or children. However, I may be staying with my parents and nieces for the foreseeable future. When someone comes through the door that the children are excited to see, my dog goes over and tries to nip their fingers. Usually, I catch her in time but there have been two times where she is fast enough to get to them and scares them pretty badly. When this happens, I tell her no and then make everyone ignore her for a few minutes. She typically acts really good for the rest of the day but the next it is back to nipping. Is there something else I should be doing?",

Further, I did not find anything under \"other\" that was specific to how to stop nipping in this case. She is a good dog but anxious and it takes a lot of mental energy and time to keep her calm. I am willing to work with her on it and she has improved so much since I got her 2 years ago.",
