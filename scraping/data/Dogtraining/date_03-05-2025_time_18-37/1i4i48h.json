    "selftext": "I have a 4 year old yellow lab who is an such a good boy, however in a very lab way he loves to eat things when on off leash walks. He has good recall EXCEPT when there is a pile of mud, sticks or bark or the occasional poop. We have been using a citronella spray collar for about a year to try to deter this behaviour but he's starting to ignore it, I guess it's not bothersome enough. I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar, and what helped? I'm hesitant to use a shock collar, but I would really like to put a stop to this behaviour.\n\nIt makes off leash walks unenjoyable as I constantly yell leave it and spray the collar to no avail. Most of all im worried he's going to damage his digestive system, or get a blockage! I know I can obviously avoid this by walking him on leash only, but he is such a friendly well behaved dog besides this and really enjoys to run off leash on trails and play with other dogs.",

You have to have rewards. Save some of your dogs breakfast when you take leash walks for rewards for leave it.  If you're not sure how to train this, you'll find dozens of YouTube videos that will teach you how. \n\nMy neighbor has three dogs and one of them is a poop eater, and  also will eat dirt. I've heard it's called pica (sp?) there's a variety of different reasons that dogs might do this. Some say it's because they have an upset stomach. Some say that they're missing nutrients. You might check with your vet to see if they have some suggestions.",

Then say \u201cLeave it\u201d and give a treat. Back up, walk in another room, then approach again, say \u201cLeave it\u201d and reward. You want him to automatically look at you when you say \u201cLeave It\u201d expecting a treat from you if he doesn\u2019t get the treats on the lid. Then gradually closer, never grabbing the treats on the lid, always looking at you when you say \u201cLeave It\u201d and always rewarded for looking at you rather than the treats on the lid.\u00a0\n\nEventually, take it outdoors, same set up. Treats on lid, walking near it on leash. \u201cLeave It\u201d. Looks at you instead. Reward.\u00a0\n\nEventually you will be able to say \u201cLeave It\u201d anywhere, anytime whether he sees a dead frog or a tampon, or McDonald\u2019s trash or pee\u00a0\u00a0and 100% know your dog will look at you instead.\n\nThat\u2019s what worked for us but we have a likely easier to train dog. \u00a0\n\nAnother option would be a basket muzzle.\u00a0",

Have you talked to your vet about this? Can you catch the behavior and give your dog high value treats for *not* eating the dirt, poop etc..? Using a shock collar to zap your dog every time it tries to eat something off the ground could cause a whole host of problems as it is very difficult to make a punishment clearly connected to an action for dogs in this case. You could end up creating a fear of a whole host of things that your dog thinks it's being punished for instead, which can in turn become reactivity. \n\n  \nAlso worth noting that citronella sprays are toxic to dogs if ingested in higher doses and often contain pesticides, which are not good for dogs in any amount.",

The first thing I would address is a vet visit with a behavioural specialist vet to check if there is any underlying health conditions or if he is otherwise quite healthy it may be an indication of an anxiety disorder and something like an SSRI or other anxiety medication may help with this behaviour. In terms of what to do whilst on walks- generally punishment is nowhere near as effective for behaviour change compared to reinforcement (reward) so I'm not surprised the unpleasant scent collar isn't working and I wouldn't recommend a shock collar. I would carry treats with you and when you recall him and he does come make a big deal giving him lots of pats, \"good boys\" and a treat. Recall him randomly throughout your walks, not just when he finds a yummy pile so he really associates the positive reinforcement with coming to you, over time scale down how much of a big deal you make for him coming and make treats a sometimes thing as well as still sometimes still make a big fuss of telling him what a good boy he is but still always at a minimum say \"good boy\" when he comes. When he doesn't come, go over to him, put him on leash and make him walk on leash with little verbal interaction (make him know he's in trouble) for 5 or 10 minutes and then give him another chance at off leash walking. Good luck!",
