    "selftext": "For reference, I adopted my cat 2 years ago and adopted a 2 year old dog 6 months ago. I have been working with trainers with my dog and he\u2019s really such a good boy. Originally, I had him in the crate a lot, and then we started crate and place, and now he still in his crate, and spends time on place, but he also gets to roam around a bit(with a leash). (My cat is free roaming)\n\nThey have been introduced, but my dog loves to play and so now when he\u2019s roaming and sees my cat- he goes up to him a bit excitedly and wants to sniff him/play(not all the time). I\u2019ll let my dog sniff my cat a bit, but when my cat walks away i tell him to leave it. My cat doesn\u2019t seem super interested in him. \n\nBasically, my concern is if I let my dog start sleeping in the bed with me- which my cat already does- i\u2019m scared that he might try to play with him OR (biggest concern) that my cat will be uncomfortable/stressed because obviously cats love their space. (There has been ONE occasion where i fell asleep while he was out of the crate and he just slept on the ground by me the whole time, but still)\n\nSo does anyone have any advice for this?",
