Any advice with flooring, kennels, etc \n",

Good ventilation, good lighting and ability to cool it down on a hot day, and floors you can hose and bleach are important. Having water access to attach a hose and be able to fill water bowls is super helpful. Being able to open it right up to give people more space/ access to outdoors, and the ability to close it up/ put fence across so it's a sale off leash play space is handy.",

Kennels should have an emergency release in case of, well, an emergency. \n\nPlease also consider putting in place emergency safety protocols (ex; evacuation, fire response, etc) as that\u2019s a MAJOR problem in this industry, the daycares I\u2019ve worked for really don\u2019t care about the safety of the dogs or their employees and it has resulted in issues like what we experienced with District Dogs in Washington DC. As someone who experienced their neglect, and can confirm it was at least partially avoidable, I cannot recommend this point enough. I am desperate to see this change in our industry.",
