    "selftext": "We have a lovely 4.5 year old Korean rescue dog named Bernie. We got him when he was six months old in the middle of the pandemic. We don\u2019t entirely know what his life was like before us, but we guess it wasn\u2019t good due to his aversion to strangers. We\u2019ve worked hard on tha and have come far, but he\u2019s still not thrilled for about 20 minutes when we have guests over (barking and a bit of growling, no teeth). He\u2019s about 22lbs and looks kind of like a jack russell (though we dna tested him and he\u2019s just a mix of a bunch of small dogs).\n\nWe fostered a chihuahua named Pumpkin in late 2024. She was a year old and was a tornado! Very dominant, super energetic and always trying to get into trouble. When we first brought her home, Bernie was curious about her and they played a bit, though she would get too enthusiastic and a bit aggressive and we would step in and stop her when that happened. We made the point to give him loads of attention and focus, but when they were both out we\u2019d have to watch her like a hawk because she was a chewer who resisted potty training as much as possible. She found her forever home after about 6 weeks and Bernie lost his playmate. He seemed a bit confused for a day or two then life went back to business as usual.\n\nWe knew we wanted to add another dog to our home permanently and learned a lot from Pumpkin, which informed our choices. So we\u2019ve been watching all the rescues listings and a beautiful cavalier mix puppy named Meadow popped up. I applied, we had many interviews and explored her personality (sweet, loving, submissive and lower energy) and it seemed like a match. So we drove the 6+ hours to go pick her up yesterday! Bernie came with us and we met her at the foster mom\u2019s home and it went so well! Bernie sniffed her and explored and she went up to him and all was well. At least, until we all got back in the car to make the drive home.\n\nBernie wouldn\u2019t look at her in the car. When she moved to go sniff him, he let out a low growl (again, not teeth). Then he ignored her (and us!) for the rest of the ride home. She is incredibly docile and just laid down and napped most of the way. When we got home finally, he gave her a few sniffs, but is largely keeping his distance. I\u2019ve made the point to focus most of my attention on him and love on him a lot. He\u2019s allowed to sleep on our bed while she isn\u2019t. And this morning they were both on the floor in our living room and she made a tentative crawl towards him and he let out another two low growls and she retreated.\n\nI know it\u2019s unrealistic to expect them to be best friends out of the gate, but I don\u2019t want either of them to be stressed or scared. I do think Pumpkin may have taught Bernie to resource guard because when Meadow went to check out one of his (long neglected) toys, he growled and took it.\n\nI want this to go well! I want them both to be happy! What can I do to set this up for success? The occasional growls are the only thing worrying me. Bernie is very gentle and often submissive so this is bizarre from him. He has loads of dog friends in the neighborhood and never gets into scraps.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else? I feel so guilty!",
