    "selftext": "Hello, \n\nI have an 8 year old staffie, she is blind. \nShe has always liked sticks and she could be a bit of a pain to get away from them and to move on before, but it's gotten so bad that a day care lady and her friend took 2 hours to get her off the beach, she slipped 2 leads, and now she won't have my dog again. \nI also have a lady who comes to walk her as I'm disabled and today, I had to drive to go and get her because she wouldn't leave the sticks alone. \n\nIt is a genuine obsession. \n\nHow do I get her over it? She doesn't care about anything other than the sticks, no treat, not having another one to entice her will work, there's nothing she wants more than that stick. \n\nI now have to drive her a long way to get her looked after for a holiday 10 hours down, then come back up. Then 10 back down and up again. So 40 hours of driving just to get her looked after to go away, the fuel alone is \u00a3300. That's to take her to someone who knows her and has never seemed to have any problems with her. (I moved to Scotland). \n\nI'm at a loss, I am considering a trainer but wanted to see what I can do before spending so much money. \n\nThanks so much. ",

She's been to the vet recently and there is nothing wrong with her to cause a sudden obsession. She has eye issues but that was dealt with and she's still obsessed.",
