    "selftext": "Good day everyone. \nWe are looking at adopting 4 y/o pure bred GSD. This will be my 3rd GSD. Currently I have a 12 y/o GSD that I had since she was 8 weeks old. \nMy current old girl is a grazer, all her life since she was 8 weeks old she grazed, I had 7 y/o male GSD at one point. He also grazed and they both never overeat, had never fought for food, are from the same bowl. \nA new GSD I want to bring home and good boy, clean, well behaved and checks all the boxes for us. But he is very fast eater, has to use maze bowl to slow down his eating and only gets fet at certain time and certain amount. \nMy question is, how (if I can) train him to be a grazer and not have strict schedule for feeding. So both of them can eat as they need/want.\nThank you for your advice.",
