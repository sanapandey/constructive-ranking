    "selftext": "Buster is a \"mean\" cat, in that he seems to delight in causing fear in dogs and humans. I've been with my partner for 5 years and he still sees me as a threat to come between him and \"his man\". Constantly finding reasons to claw me as I walk by. I'm telling you all this to set the scene. \n\nMy dog Zeus is a rescue, I've had him for 8 months. He is 2.8 years old. He's the new edition in the family. Outside the home, Zeus shows good confidence with people, dogs, the environment. He takes things in stride and is generally receptive to my commands.\n\nIn the home, he become timid, unsure, and nervous. The cat could be around any corner. And fair enough because the cat has surprised him and slapped his face several times.\n\nIt's now been 8 months and the dog is still nervous around the cat. Slinks around, avoids looking in the direction of the cat. Gets stuck in areas because the cat is in between him a freedom. And the cat seems to enjoy it.\n\nI know that if Zeus just stood up for himself a couple times, Buster's bluff would shatter.\n\nTldr: How do I build up my dog's confidence around a mean cat?",
