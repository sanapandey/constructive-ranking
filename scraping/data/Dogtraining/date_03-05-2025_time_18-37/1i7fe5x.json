    "selftext": "Hi, my wife will soon join my workplace and we\u2019d like to bring both of our dogs to the office. One of them isn\u2019t a problem whatsoever, but our other rescue, Miko, is a bit trickier. \n\nBasic info: \n7yo Male, castrated, 10kg, typical village mutt, no discernable breed \n\nMiko is afraid of strangers, especially men. Walking on the street and people passing and ignoring him isn\u2019t a problem, likewise guests at home who ignore him - he\u2019ll sniff and leave them alone. So far so good. But if anyone tries to talk to him, he\u2019ll growl, and if they try to pet him, he\u2019ll bite, then immediately get ashamed. Rarely, for reasons unknown, he\u2019ll grab a pant leg if he\u2019s uncomfortable with someone.\n\nI did regular agility training with a behaviourist when we first got him four years ago. Since then he listens well, heeds commands and follows when told. He\u2019s gotten comfortable with a few close family members, but it\u2019s taken a lot of time.\n\nMy wife and I will work in different rooms - she\u2019ll have our nicer dog, I\u2019ll have Miko. My room will have around 16 people over a fairly large open-plan space. He has a harness that says \u201cDo not touch\u201d, but most people don\u2019t see it. We\u2019ve been thinking about getting the \u2018band\u2019 muzzle and training him to be comfortable with it - he hates wearing a normal muzzle. \n\nWhat can I do to make bringing him to the office a remotely viable option 2-3 months from now? I know if I can confidently make a solid case for him to my teammates, they\u2019d be willing to give it a shot. Any advice appreciated!",
