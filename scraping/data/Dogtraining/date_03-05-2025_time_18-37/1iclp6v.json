    "selftext": "6 year old pit mix. She's usually really calm and is quite the well behaved dog. However, over the last few weeks she's started getting into anything we leave on the counters/tables/desks/etc. when we leave the house. And when I say anything, I mean anything. Last night it was my wife's milk tea. Destroyed the can and slurped every last bit of it. Tonight it was prepackaged ramen. Got it off the counter and tore the packages open, devouring every last bit. Also tried to break into a sport drink bottle we had on the counter that was unopened. We just had her yearly check-up and everything was fine. She's also been aggressive with a roommate. While she's never really gotten along with him, it's been fear more than aggression, but now there's been a few times where she's gotten pretty aggressive when she sees him. We always keep them separated now, though. We can't be 100% sure of her history as she's a rescue, but all indications is that she definitely had food insecurity in the past, and she's always been highly food motived. Is it possible she's just bored and acting out? A worm and she's actually still hungry?",
