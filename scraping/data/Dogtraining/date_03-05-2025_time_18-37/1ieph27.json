    "selftext": "I have a very sweet and loving 2.5 year old super mutt. She is Boxer forward in appearance and some behaviors but also has Labrador, Aussie, Great Dane, and American Stratfordshire Terrier at pretty much equal levels. \n\nShe excelled at basic puppy training, and is eager to please and just a sweet and loving and fun dog. The behaviors that she has that are difficult to deal with are:\n\nShe sometimes will get very whiny on a walk, I think reacting to the sounds of distant dogs barking in the neighborhood. Otherwise she is good on a leash and when she sees an actual dog usually just wags her tail and keeps rolling.\n\nWhen I take her in the car without her sister dog (not literally sisters, different ages and mixes), she will whine, whine, whine. And cry. And whine.\n\nShe will go nuts every time a delivery truck drives down our cul-de-sac. Which is all the time. Is someone rings the bell, she\u2019s full on cujo.\n\nWound healing is impossible with her. She\u2019s compulsive. Maybe ocd if that is possible in a dog. She has twice broken a nail and the first one thankfully didn\u2019t have to be cut all the way down, but this most recent one did. Cones don\u2019t prevent her from licking. Read that again and take my word for it. Yes I\u2019ve tried a bigger size, yes I\u2019ve probably tried every dang thing you\u2019re doing to suggest and spent a crap ton of money on it. Even with the largest cone that won\u2019t just slide over her head, she is able to reach by placing her paw on the  arm of the couch and doing a full body twist (like in yoga) and stretch her neck to lick the paw. I\u2019ve caught her in the act. I\u2019ve tried every type of bandaging, recovery boot, recovery sock, etc and she destroys them the second I leave, and yes, I\u2019ve tried bitter spray. Yeah, I\u2019ve drugged her too.   (Trazadone and gabapentin). She\u2019s reopened her wound too many times to count and the vet has run out of ideas for me\u2026 she had another injury, to her nipple, that took forever to heal for the same reason, compulsive licking and reinjuring.  \n\nShe will bark for attention and really feeds off my other dog, who is much calmer but also feeds off her. They both are okay on a walk individually, but together, they can be very difficult. She gets the zoomies but I don\u2019t consider that a challenge just a data point. She is so anxious that I can\u2019t board her because the last time I did, for 6 days, she lost 10 pounds (like 20% of her body weight). She is just a neurotic shaking mess when boarding. \n\nShe used to get such separation anxiety that she destroyed my couch. She\u2019s better now, but I telework mostly. \n\nShe\u2019s calmed down a lot, but is still just a bit of an anxious ball of energy. \n\nWe do play a lot and walk her and try to get her energy out but she does seem to have boundless energy at times. \n\nI would love help with defining the problem so that I can get the right training (I thought her issue was reactivity but then when I looked at the behaviors described, they didn\u2019t match). Also if anyone has experience or thoughts on Prozac for dogs\u2026 \n\n\n\n",
