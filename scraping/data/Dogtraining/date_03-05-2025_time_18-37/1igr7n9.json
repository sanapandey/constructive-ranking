    "selftext": "My husband and I just adopted a puppy from our local shelter. We believe she is a retriever mix, but looks like a hound. She is 10 weeks old. We have a 10 yr old female cat and 4 yr old female cat. Our 4 year old female cat has a very dominant personality (orange cat energy). She is very friendly with all people, but is the \u201cboss\u201d with her cat sister as well. She has booped the puppy on the nose a few times when the puppy has gotten near to sniff her. Unfortunately, the puppy is now retaliating by chasing her and barking at her. I would like some advice on how to calm these interactions and make the dog not interested in the cat. I\u2019m just so nervous she\u2019s going to bite the cat.",
