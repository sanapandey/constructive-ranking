    "selftext": "I got a 7 month corgi/jack rusell mix about 3 weeks ago and I\u2019m having trouble getting her to eliminate in new places when we walk. I\u2019ve tried to change our route, taking super long walks, grabbing some of her poop and placing it in a good open area and she wont poop anywhere but the community area in my apartment (outside). \n\nI\u2019m just glad the she only goes out side because she wouldn\u2019t eliminate outside in the first week of having her. It was frustrating but also the coldest days of winter this year. One day, she decided to poop outside in the communal area and I was super happy, waited until she was finished to reward her with treats and praise, and she seems to have locked that place as her place to eliminate. I stopped giving her as many treats and praise as when she first started eliminating outside because I kind of want to break that association with the community area.\n\nI think this place has the least amount of distractions and noise which is maybe why its the only place that she will eliminate at. When ever we are on a walk, she\u2019s always looking at people, smelling things, not really paying attention to me, she smells other dogs pee and poop and doesn\u2019t give her the cue that she should also eliminate. I need to break this association before my apartment pulls out the lawn chairs, fire pit in the spring.\n\nThis subreddit seemed to have another older post that related to the same issue but I don\u2019t see updates on what helped change this behavior and I think its due for a refresher in 2025.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/s/9OJ9EbZRIL\n\nAlso, I\u2019m training her to sit, down, place, etc and I have a 90-95% success rate of her performing her action but she wont learn the command. I do a hand gesture, she gets in position, I say yes as soon as I see her limbs in position, I give her a treat right after and thats it. I have been including commands for about 1 week now and she looks away whenever I say the command. But she will do what I\u2019m asking if I perform a gesture.",

The only other post that I have seen with this issue was the one I added to the post and the \u201cplacing poop in other places\u201d idea came from them. I did see in the wiki the \u201cpotty\u201d command when your dog is pooping but my dog is having trouble learning commands. I think k Imm ready to receive some feedback.",
