    "selftext": "We have a pretty crazy little dude (Dalmatian/border collie mix, about 4.5 years old) who has very little impulse control and very big feelings, and he\u2019s not afraid to show them. Whenever I go to the back door (or even in the same room as the back door), he does the classic spin/bark bark bark/jump on door/bark bark bark. \n\nI\u2019ve tried practicing the \u201cchill out, my dude\u201d method by walking to the back door, then calming saying \u201cno\u201d and walking out when he goes bonkers. This hasn\u2019t really lead to any changes; he just barks and follows me back in and repeats the process when I walk back to the door.\n\nI suspect this ain\u2019t just related to the door, as he tends to do this type of things when she interprets anything as a cue to play or be active. I get up out of my office chair to pee? BARK BARK BARK JUMP SPIN BARK! I walk to the front door? BARK BARK BARK JUMP SPIN BARK! I enter the room with his crate where he gets fed even remotely near his lunchtime? BARK. Bark. b a r k.\n\nSo I think we just need to teach him calming cues. He\u2019s capable of relaxing and happily will do so, but any shift from stillness to movement gets him amped up.\n\n*The tricky part is that we are a two dog household.* Our older dog (Momo) is a horrible demon shit goblin and will get overstimulated when I have this younger dog (Beetle) in an enclosed room away from her via barrier frustration. We absolutely can\u2019t train them in the same room because they\u2019ll fight over treats.\n\nWhat types of techniques can I try to help shape calmness/impulse and emotional control in Beetle? He\u2019s clearly getting over aroused, but I don\u2019t know how to mitigate that!\n\nThanks, y\u2019all!",

There are a few TikToks from positive reinforcement trainers that I\u2019ve tried for impulse control, but our Beetle bug boy doesn\u2019t really respond well to them. \n\nWe\u2019ve tried the \u201clook at me\u201d game where I hold a treat and give it with a YES! when he makes eye contact with me as a reward for calmness and communication and focus on me\n\nWe\u2019ve tried practicing getting near the door/leaving  my chair/etc and then rewarding with play once he\u2019s calm  (in fact, as I typed this, I sat up and he popped up with me and did a slow spin, and I sat back down. He laid down and is still at attention to the back door, but is calmer now. I stood back up when he calmed down, approached the door, and he did the bark/spin/jump.)\n\nWe also took him and our other dog to a trainer about a year ago, but about 1/3 of the way through training, the trainer insisted on e collars, so we left and haven\u2019t looked back. What a waste.",
