    "selftext": "Hello! I have a 7 year old chocolate lab who has been an outdoor dog most of his life. I have recently got married so me and my wife decided to bring him inside because he truly is an inside dog inspite of being outside as long as he has.\n\nHe has always barked. Barks at literally everything from a horse 4 houses over to a UPS truck across the street. However for some reason it seems to be 10x worse when it comes to my brother in law. He is 18 and is staying in a room at our house, any noise he makes from a cough to a sneeze and our Lab barks like a manaic. If he walks out of his room, he runs to the back and barks while peeking around the corner. \n\nWe have tried to have my BIL sit down and pet him and all is good. Our lab just smells him doesn't bark or show any real signs of aggression. We are all confused, we thought at first it was due to to my wifes family being a different race (me Caucasian and her family African American) but I don't think that's the case as our lab only barks like this at my BIL. \n\nAny help or advice would be handy, we both work night shift and sometimes my lab keeps us both up because he is barking constantly and I feel terrible for fussing at him because he is beyond a good dog.\n\nWe have recently got a bark collar but for the life of us we can't get it to work on him. Even if we could he is so goofy I don't think he would even notice it was on him lol.",
