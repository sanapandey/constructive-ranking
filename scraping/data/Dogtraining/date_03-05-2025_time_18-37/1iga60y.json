    "selftext": "Hello, I just got my rescue chihuahua yesterday. She is 2.5 years old and was previously a breeder dog (had one set of pups and weened another). From my understanding, she was kept mostly in a crate and the breeder had a doggy door that she would use, but she knows to use pee pads. \n\nI know it\u2019ll take time to get her used to training for leash walking. I wish I could take her outside in a fenced area, but sadly I live in an apartment and it\u2019s very cold outside, so it would be tough for me to bring her out without a leash and sit with her to get comfy. She\u2019s only 5 lbs! \n\nSo I know what\u2019s best is to get her used to the feeling of a harness first (after she settles in around us more). \n\nMy questions are: I read online to have a set schedule with a new dog. If I wanted to have set outside bathroom times, should I just wait to start that schedule til she\u2019s comfortable on the leash in the house? I also read conflicting advice on leash length. Some places say get a longer leash so they feel like they have more freedom. I\u2019ve also read get a smaller one at first so they get used to feeling a leash.\n\nRight now, she\u2019s a very timid and sweet girl. She wants to stay in her crate, but loves to lick our hands and get belly rubs. I\u2019m ok with pee pads for now while we build trust, I\u2019m just planning her training long term!",

I read that you should start with a long leash and also that you should start with a short leash. I also wanted to specify my dogs breed to get tailored advice since she\u2019s so small and it\u2019s also cold and she\u2019s too small to be outside long. I just wanted those few details addressed.",

            "body": "I've been through this! Rescue, spent first 4 years in a cage. He had 0 understanding of the concept of leash walking.\n\nThings I learnt:\n\n- the dog is NOT going to walk properly like you see all the other normal dogs walk at first lol. She will be all over the place, but do not dive right into walk training. You won't get anywhere as she doesn't have a strong bond to you yet and will be too stimulated outside to even listen, let alone learn anything.\n- 90% of getting the dog to learn to walk like a normal dog (lol) is just time, routine, and repetition. Take the same routes regularly\n- as you say, routine is so important. As soon as the routine sinks in, you can plan her bathroom breaks (like you know she needs to poop right after breakfast or whatever)\n- don't overthink leash length. Just get a standard one because when you need to keep her close you will just pull it in. The ones with handles near the base are great though because it's good for keeping her close to you when you need like crossing the road.\n- Start small, get her used to the neighborhood, and then do longer routine walks. She might be scared of main roads at first, you can just go and visit them, stand there and watch, treat her and go home.\n- as mentioned above don't be discouraged if she doesn't seem to care or listen to you on walks. Give it time, you're just a random handler in her mind right now. In a few months of bonding and training her, she will be focused on you entirely and you will be able to start the outside training.",
