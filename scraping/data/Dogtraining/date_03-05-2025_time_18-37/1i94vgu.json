    "selftext": "Male chihuahua mix - 3.5lbs, 19 weeks old\n\nI don\u2019t know how to determine whether our puppy is getting potty training. \n\nWhen he is crated he doesn\u2019t have any accidents and can sleep through the night now with no accidents, so no issue there at all.\n\nI take him out when he gets up in the morning, after every meal and after a big water drinking session, and after intense playtime with our other dog. On top of that, I take him out every two hours regardless.\n\nHe goes potty outside with no issue, as in, whenever I take him out for a potty break he goes. I take him to the same place, as he goes I say \u201cgo potty!\u201d once, then say \u201cgood boy\u201d and give a treat immediately once he is done. He understands going potty means he gets a treat because he finishes his business and immediately turns to me to get that treat.\n\nBut he\u2019s still having accidents inside :( There\u2019s been maybe a two or three day stretch here and there where he has no accidents at all, and then the other day he peed twice inside (he\u2019s pooped inside maybe twice ever?). I feel like it\u2019ll be in the middle of him playing really hard he\u2019ll just pause and start peeing, or he\u2019ll wake up from a nap and immediately jump down and just go, but sometimes it does seem random. \n\nWe take him out after play time and after he gets up from a nap but man! Sometimes he\u2019s SO fast I don\u2019t even have time to take him out! Should I be waking him up from his naps? Should I put a timer on playtime with our other dog? Is he actually understanding potty training or are we taking him out so much he\u2019s technically not having accidents inside? I just can\u2019t tell! I want to implement a bell system that he can ring when he has to go, so I have a bell hanging up by the front door that I use his paw to ring when we go out for a potty break. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s too much for him right now and I should wait on that? Or is it a good time for that? \n\nHe does seem to be catching on to other things so I know he can learn. He\u2019s got sit, shake, and \u201cleave it\u201d down, and is halfway there on \u201clay down\u201d. So I know he\u2019s got it in him!\n\nThanks for any advice. ",

It works best if you follow every instruction to a \u201cT\u201d, if your schedule permits. It\u2019s exhausting but better than the alternative in my opinion. (I was fortunate and was at home fulltime while house training. I don\u2019t know how to adapt this for those that are working outside their home.)",
