    "selftext": "So, this issue is my fault. When I first got her over a year ago, she willingly submitted to nail clipping, but I accidentally clipped too far and caused her to bleed.\n\nSince then she wants no part of anyone messing with her claws. She won\u2019t let a groomer do it. She won\u2019t let either of us do it, even if offered unlimited treats. We tried an electric nail grinder- she won\u2019t accept that. We tried a nail file - she won\u2019t accept that. I\u2019m currently trying to desensitize her to the grinder by letting her lick a frozen peanut butter covered lick pad while the grinder runs nearby and sometimes I try to touch her paws. She\u2019s nervous, but allows a little, but we\u2019ve been doing this for weeks with little progression. She still won\u2019t let me touch her claws with the nail grinder. I\u2019ve been contemplating getting a grinding pad so she could do it herself - anyone have any success with those and how long did training take? \n\nIt had been under control bc I throw the ball for her in our paved back courtyard and she ground it down running, but our dog sitters didn\u2019t do this when we left for Christmas and her front nails have really gotten out of control. No amount of throwing the ball seems to get it back to her old baseline. Her back nails are fine. Any ideas on ways to throw the ball or get her to run to specifically grind down front paw nails? ",
