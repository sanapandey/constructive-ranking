    "selftext": "Hi! My two year old cattle dog/pitbull mix is weird about feeding time. She often needs to be coaxed into eating. We have three cats and she seems to be insecure about them being around when she eats. We have resorted to shutting them away while her food is out. Even when they are away, though, she will eat some and then just lay in front of her food. I usually end up having to stand next to the food and then she will start eating. It seems more like she is eating when I do that because she doesn\u2019t want me to take it away, rather than feeling more safe that I\u2019m standing there. \n\nI\u2019m feeling a little at a loss. I\u2019ve tried different food, adding wet food, letting her eat off her mat instead of the bowl, making a game of dinner, etc. but she still seems unsure about feeding time.\n\nAny help or suggestions are greatly appreciated!",
