    "selftext": "Ada is going on 8 years old. Puppy girl, Shya, is 6 months. Ada has always been trained to wait at her mat about 6 feet from food dish before her \"free\" command (which used to be \"okay\" until the puppy came along - I was scolded for using that word by our puppy trainer) allowing her to eat. I worked for weeks with the puppy on this while she was still eating separately at mealtimes in her crate. Then I worked with them side by side releasing one at a time with \"Shya free\" and \"ADA free\" correspondingly. \n\nThey were doing great! Had this down for a month or two. Only issues were sometimes a false launch by either one of them before their command was given. I would make whoever false-launched return to the mat, wait, then give the free command again.  Now, Shya the puppy is staying put when I tell her \"Shya free\" (along with a hand motioning toward her food bowl). I try to wait it out, only giving the command once or twice and waiting until she starts eating for verbal praise. She proceeds to eat her meal just hesitates with the release cue.\n\nI'm not sure how I can solve this... use a different release word for each pup? Shya now won't eat until she gets all fired up seeing her big sis Ada start eating. I have recently been trying to release Ada first, but that seemed to confuse things further haha. Ada knew she was supposed to wait for Shya, so she hesitates with her release word and doesn't want to be corrected for going too soon \ud83d\ude05 \n\nAny advice appreciated! Let me know if I can clarify anything about our process.\n\nShya is 6 months bernedoodle\nAda is 8 year old at Bernard/boxer mix",

I would have thought a very specific command for this would be confusing as it's more of an active command than an indicator of the end of a session. But I'm not releasing dogs from a very strict train so idk\n\nUsually when I release from a sit or wait or whatever, I'll say OK! And completely relax, but if they don't get it immediately I throw a bit of kibble down near them to encourage them to do their thing. A release command for a puppy may be a little confusing if the command is to stop paying attention, so it might need some encouragement?",

As long as the dogs aren't getting confused you should be fine to use whatever release word you want. I would also recommend going to a different trainer that doesn't scold you for going against their opinions",

Use leash to guide/hold back until it's her turn being released so that you have a solid barrier-free way of holding pup back. I would emphasize waiting for eye contact after you say pups name, then over emphasize (with pointed finger) that she's free and really pronounce the word.\n\nOnce you have focusing on you are part of the command, pup should understand more quickly since they will be less actively distracted by the other dog or the food.",

It could have been anything you were already using, even if it was a word like \"taco\" as long as it was used consistently for a specific action.\n\nIs feeding time the only time you do the wait and release? Wait is a good command to teach for a variety of reasons, especially for their safety unrelated to feeding time. Practice the commands unrelated to feeding times and reward frequently for the wait and again when she is released so she's learning the proper and positive ssociation for what wait means (don't move from where they are) and free (can move to wherever they want)  regardless of situational context (feeding time,  looking to run toward someone, running out the door,  etc)\n\nIs going to the mat done by giving them their equivalent of the \"place\" command so you say \"place\", they go to the mat, and then you also say \"wait\" once they are there? Trying to understand the full sequence of meal time routine and what the puppy is really associating with each word you are using.  Think the pup is misunderstanding what wait and free means at the moment. And you also tack on their name sthe first word before the actual command. If their name is used to get their attention to you and then there's a pause before free,  you are teaching free.  If there is no pause, pup is hearing \"Shya free \" as the command.\n\nGood luck!",

Put the mat pretty close to the empty bowl. Moments before feeding time,  do a few rounds of place/free. Release her quickly, i.e. don't work on duration or distance. Then, in the final round, place,  pour the food, and release her. All within 3-4 seconds. See if that helps her understand the routine more clearly and starts to see her meal as the reward.",

I reverted back to the hand signals I used for both \"free\" commands-- which happened to be the same --and paired with \"Ok.\" Dogs both figured it out within a couple days that they are being \"freed\" to eat at the same time. Too complex to make my poor old guy wait, and the puppy would actually wait, but it breaks my heart to see his sweet lab self start to drool if denied food for 0.001 sec more than his brother! \ud83d\ude02",

Your older dog\u2019s complete change is something I\u2019d be careful with. \n\nI know you said there is no anxiety or resource guarding around food, but your dog that previously didn\u2019t eat her breakfast or finish her food is now finishing her food in 30 seconds. She\u2019s not doing this because she\u2019s suddenly hungry in the morning and acting like a dog, she is doing it to consume and protect her resources and feels pressure. She no longer feels comfortable. Her change in behavior is notable and out of character and id be mindful that it could escalate further. \n\nMost grown dogs and puppies don\u2019t have issues, it\u2019s when the puppy becomes older. \n\nI think the puppy hesitating is normal, and may be picking up on the older dog\u2019s heightened response to the situation. I\u2019d give them both space to eat. \n\nI also wouldn\u2019t make one wait till the other is finished. This is creating unnecessary competition. \nPersonally I\u2019d put the puppies food in her crate, you can still release both dogs from the mat but close puppy in her crate until both dogs are done eating. Create space and relaxing calm spaces for them both to eat. \n\nI rescue and foster a lot of dogs and some dogs do inhale food out of hunger but it\u2019s usually the just out of the shelter, resource insecure behavior to incredibly quickly eat their food. And then after time of knowing their food is safe and predictable they relax. So for your dog to have gone from relaxed and not caring, not hungry to inhale is a red flag for me.",
