She is definitely a chewer and has chewed the door frame a few times, and more recently pulled tea towels off of the oven and chewed them. Now I\u2019m starting to worry that she\u2019s going to figure out how to get in the cupboards and start playing with cleaning supplies and foods she shouldn\u2019t have. She\u2019s never tried or shown any interest. Am I being crazy?",

It was expensive, but she took her puppy to that vet for an autopsy because she really needed closure. That beautiful sweet puppy's name was Angel.",

Crate training isn't that difficult and once they stop chewing on your things, you can gradually let them out during the night.\nI did the same with all my dogs, a few of them were chewers. No issues after crate training. \n\nIt is dangerous to leave your chewer out during the night because they might get into something that will possibly kill them.

The longer you let her continue having access to these items, the stronger the reinforcement is going to become until it's nearly impossible to break. And yes, this could escalate into other behaviors that you don't want. You need to restrict her access 100% from areas where she can access items that she chews and offer lots of different dog toys as a substitute. It's likely she's just bored. Crating is your friend for when you can't watch her. I would not leave her unsupervised until you know this behavior has stopped. \n\nOur 1 yr lab puppy is trained to not go into the kitchen at all for this very reason. Interestingly enough, a gate no taller than a toddler bed rail is sufficient to deter him from going in, even though he could easily step over it.
