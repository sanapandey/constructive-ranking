    "selftext": "I feel completely hopeless with my 14-month-old golden retriever. I HATE walking him- he is by far the worst dog I have ever experienced in regards to his outright defiance and inability to learn. My wife and I have been consistently training since we brought him home as a puppy, we took him to training classes as well as working with him daily since the day we got him at 8 weeks old. He isn't food-motivated (unless he's indoors and there's nothing better going on) and he also isn't toy-motivated. The only thing that has ever made a difference for him is time-outs in his pen and, as a result of this, we have a perfect dog indoors (it's literally like Jekyll and Hyde). Outdoors however is HELL due to pulling, whining and lunging at everything and everyone. We have tried almost every method in existence to help with his walking, including but not limited to:\n\n1. Head collars (despite slowly conditioning, he never got used to them and spent weeks jumping and trying to paw it off with both paws)\n2. Double leads. 3.Turning in the opposite direction when he pulls (runs in circles trying to guess the direction)\n3. Stopping entirely when he pulls (incessant whining and starts running again as soon as we move)\n4. Avoiding other dogs as best we can (impossible as we live in a very dog-friendly apartment by many other dog-friendly apartments to the point that 1 am isn't even a safe bet to be alone)\n5. Having him sit before greeting people (we try not to let him greet anyone at all but when he does we make him sit but it doesn't make a difference for people walking past or future encounters)\n6. Lure training (doesn't care about anything other than sniffing)\n7. Using sniffing as a reward (he loves to sniff so this helped improve the pulling when we're alone on the street but as soon as he sees dogs it's out of the window and the pulling and whining ensues)\n8. Almost every YouTube video tutorial under the sun (kikopup, Zak George to name two from my head)\n9. slip collars (he'd rather strangle himself)\n10. leash pressure training (this made the biggest difference but once again, out of the window when there are people/dogs)\n11. super high value treats (cheddar cheese is his favourite but no interest around dogs.\n\nHe does know the heel command but only chooses to listen to it when we're completely alone. I live in a city so I don't have a car so it's not even like I can drive him to a remote place to train. Every single time we step outside the door there are so many inconsiderate people with off-leash dogs that just make him crazy, then he's too overstimulated to listen to anything and spends the entire walk whining incessantly and lunging at anything with a pulse. I try my best to avoid people but he even jumps up on strangers that come out of the elevator. I don't think I can afford a private trainer but I feel like there's been no progress in the walking regard since he was about 6 months old. I miss when he used to be scared of dogs as a puppy. I guess the only thing I have to be thankful for is the fact that he doesn't bark. We honestly feel like the only reason he is so well-behaved indoors is due to the fact he knows we will put him in the pen if he isn't- he knows that can't happen outdoors so he doesn't care at all what we say. Is there anything that I'm missing? We can't avoid dogs or people due to where we live so that's not an option.",

I have social anxiety so I'd really rather avoid recruiting random people. I frequently reward him with sniff breaks and I always decline people interacting with him when he is behaving terribly. I reward calmness when possible with sniff breaks or treats if he takes them. I can't desensitize from afar given where I live because as soon as I step out the door there are dogs everywhere- I try to walk later at night/early in the morning but it's still unlikely that I won't encounter at least 2 dogs. The worst part about all of this is when he's finally allowed to greet the other dog, he hardly even cares and would rather sniff!",

Put him on lead, go outside the front door and play \"engage/disengage\" with him, even if your just stood on the doorstep or on the road near the house so he can see people and dogs passing but at a distance that it is possible for him to break eye contact, the second he breaks eye contact, give him the biggest celebration party of his life, you can throw high value treats around to make them more exciting, so fling one one way when hes on his way back fling one the other, so it's a game of chase, if he's still really not bothered by the food when he breaks eye contact run backwards or away from the dog shouting all the silly encouragement and then give him massive fuss and cuddles, give him so much more than he would get out of interacting with other people. I wouldn't let him great dogs or people at the moment untill he's able to actually process how he feels, if he's not interested when he greets the dog it's more likely barrier frustration (the lead preventing him from getting somewhere) than the actual dog. \n\nTakes a long time to train these things, have you tried giving him a ball or toy to carry? This works well with mine, he has  very conflicting feelings about dogs and people and carrying a ball works as a displacement behaviour so he can crunch it like a stress ball and it also stopped him jumping at my mum or friends on walks",

I dealt with this with my dog (to a less sever extent) and one of the issues my partner and I had was that one of us was more strict than the other. Despite both of us knowing how to fix the issues we weren't seeing any improvement because we weren't being consistent and weren't following the solution for enough time for it to settle in as a behaviour. \n\nKnowing that and what you've stated here I only really have 2 pieces of advice since you seem to have covered my typical fixes for this type of behaviour:\n\n1. Go to a very public place (a park ideally), sit down with your dog and just people watch. Reward them when they don't react and are calm (even if it's just praise) The idea is to to teach them to be calm or help them learn that they can be calm outside and in the presence of other people and dogs. This won't directly help with your leash issues but is something that helped us with the excitability. \n\n2. Hire an actual trainer or research a canine behaviourist. It seems like you are approaching your wits end and it may be time to seek professional help.",

We make sure she hasn't eaten yet and we have high-value treats.   \n  \nWhen I hear that dogs aren't food motivated, I always wonder about timing and type of treats. My dog will literally spit out kibble if I try to use it was a treat and has regularly spit out beef treats if she isn't hungry. Knowing this, we make sure to do her training and walking first thing in the morning when she is hungry. When we do that she is all of sudden food motivated :D \n\nIt sounds like the relationship with you dog is in a tough place. This may seem abstract but try to approach it with a sense of empathy and curiosity about what your dog wants and needs. Shifting from a mindset of your dog being obedient to it being a give and take relationship can be really helpful for managing frustration.",

I have found that being around those distractions or those points of interest really help. I like going to outside our local dog park. We don't go in and we start working on training. With the distraction of other dogs and people.  At first it might be 100 yards or more away. I worked at this distance for a while. Until he would listen his attention was on my and what I wanted. Then we would move a bit closer and repeat. Some times we would have to move farther away other times we would just sit 50 yards away from the entrance and sit and watch people and dogs go in and out. He would be rewarded for being neutral. He can stare but ultimately I want him to be able to listen to me and the more we can condition and understand that it's ok not to greet everyone and every dog the better.

                            "body": "The stop when he pulls method is the most effective method I\u2019ve found but it takes a ton of patience and environmental control. A few tips to try:\n\n1. You need to make sure your standards are super consistent. Don\u2019t wait until he gets to the end of the leash far from you - shorten the leash a bit and if there is any tautness at all stop and wait until he reconnects. The big big key is consistency - every time he pulls and you do not stop and let him keep pulling will set you back. He needs to learn that tension on the leash NEVER results in going where he wants to go. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s from the car to the front door, etc - you have to always have the same very high standard. \n2. You say he\u2019s a totally different dog at home - are you practicing at home? It\u2019s important for him to recognize the right way to walk in an environment he\u2019s receptive to learning, so I would try to practice leash walking in your yard, in your house, etc and keep the same standards. You can even practice walking next to you with a treat lure at first and then occasional treats off leash in the house. \n3. It\u2019s counter intuitive (maybe) but practicing off leash walking is super effective to help with pulling. You can practice using a long line and when he steps away from heel call him back and really reward. \n4. Work on eye contact games at home (you can google dog eye contact games). When he gets good at this, take him to practice in gradually more stimulating environments - empty parking lot, middle of a basketball court in the park, etc etc. sit somewhere and reward eye contact when a person walks by on the other side of the street. When walking make sure to reward every single check in when he looks back towards you. Huge party!\n\n\nThe big thing that stood out about your post is the note where you said he is only food motivated at home and that your wife was standing for 35 min before he looked back. That says to me that you are taking him to overstimulating environments where he is in the red zone, which is not a productive place to be learning and teaching. I\u2019d stop taking him to these places entirely right now. Take him to less stimulating places - if he won\u2019t take food there it\u2019s too much - I\u2019ve found corporate parking lots during off hours/weekends good practice areas. Stay away from any area with dogs or heavy foot traffic. Gradually you can work your way up to seeing a dog from across the street. DEFINITELY stay away from any place with dogs off leash - dogs coming up to him while he\u2019s pulling rewards the behavior. \n\nOne more push for practicing eye contact/name games at home. Really build the association of eye contact = treat and name = treat so that checkins while out and about become easier. \n\nGood luck!!",

While there isnt an easy solution to this behavior a tired dog will be a lot easier to train.\n\nWith my dog who is incredibly smart and stubborn we have to have a system where I give him what he needs and in exchange he gives me what I need. A well behaved dog. \n\nSo, when we started leash training we would let him pull on the way to the park where he got to play off leash. There we exercise him for 20 minutes or until he is tired. And on the way home we started training leash walking and he was so much more receptive towards it.\n\nIf he gets cooped up too much he completely stops listening to me, it\u2019s quite interesting how that works. Then I take him for hikes and runs and is best to being on just best behavior.\n\nSo I would create an exercise plan mental and physical. Something that regular and that he can count on. That can include training sessions at home like finding treats or toys, off leash running, maybe teach him fetch if he doesn\u2019t already d that. Sniffle mats etc also work great. I would look at free shaping. It\u2019s a way to teach you how to train a dog by rewarding in small steps.\n\nOnce after about 2 weeks of doing this regularly you re-start training. \n\nGo back to leash pressure work, where if you apply slight pressure in one direction and the dog turns towards that direction you reward. Even if he just looks in the direction you are pulling you reward. Pull right side dog looks right you reward. Keep doing this over and over and stay excited during this. It\u2019s supposed to be like play time. This teaches that the leash is communicating to him not just a nuisance. I would add a command like common, let\u2019s go or something along those lines. Practice at home first.\n\nI would also allow him to greet everyone for now. But only for a second. You let him sniff for like 5 seconds or so, and then use the leash pressure along with the command.

Similar energy.\n\nI'll also say that leash-walking was one of the hardest things to teach my first retriever. She was very smart and very energetic, and after trying on our own, we had to work with a trainer when she was 2 years old to get us on the right road.

And/or does he ever get the opportunity to socialize with dogs off leash? The activities that help my girl behave on walks happen not on walks. If I can get her 2 play dates a week where she can run, chase, wrestle, and be social with another dog friend to her heart's content, and maybe one other day of something very stimulating like a hike in the nature preserve (with portions off leash so she can do some running if empty of all other people and dogs, which it often is), she is much better behaved on walks. If I don't get her that additional activity, she can behave like a frustrated greeter in some situations and have a lot less impulse control. For instance, instead of walking normally on the pack walk we do every morning, she will be trying to instigate play with her pack friends and driving me nuts!  \n  \nI'm not a proponent of dog parks, but if you could find one that is empty at an off hour and run your dog there, that could help. What about developing some play date friends and rent sniff spots for play dates? Or even doggy day care, though there are mixed reviews on that. Our dog friends go and two of them love it.   \n  \nYou could do more brain games and training, but it just sounds like your dog is exploding with pent up energy and need for something more than walks and training.

If you are not using treats and toys in training, you are never going to be able to beat outside stimulus. Once one stranger ignores you the dog will forever remember that ignoring you=a fun time. \n\nWhen a dog is over threshold with excitement, itll get locked onto stimulus and struggle to understand commands, even if it wants to; or if youre able to get the dog to take a treat or toy, it wont be processing the information. Thats why its important to start as small as possible and work up. the second you feel frustrated or you notice your dog feeling frustrated, just stop and try again later. (The most important part!! You cant teach a dog that you are cool and fun while acting stressed!) \n\nMost importantly, keep expectations low, and make sure you mix this training in with something fun that you both like to do together.

Every time he's practicing the behavior because of people being stupid it's reinforced. You **must** manage the people or this behavior will continue and potentially escalate. Arousal is a problem, and if your dog eventually chooses violence you'll have no choice but to force space or risk his life. A muzzle will create that space because nobody wants to touch a dog or have their dog go near a dog in a muzzle. \n\nSecondly, I would reach out to a vet/board certified veterinary behaviorist because you cannot effectively manage triggers, which makes life worse for you. This may be a situation that medication is recommended because you can't control the triggers.\n\nThirdly, you mention he's not easily reinforced outside, this is due to the arousal. He's food motivated indoors so he's food motivated - he's just distracted and this is not a learning state. Imagine getting robbed and somebody asks you 7*8. Could you answer the question while you're actively getting robbed? Even if you knew it I'm 100% sure you couldn't answer it on the spot due to arousal. This is what your dog is dealing with. You have to be in a training state to be able to work with this. \n\nOnce you can avoid triggers, you can start working on differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO). This will allow the dog to learn to make better choices by rewarding basically anything besides getting hyped up. You still need to ensure that this dog greets nobody while hyped up ever, or your training will restart. I would highly recommend working with a trainer with IAABC accreditation on top of everything to guide you through this.",

I will say this: Reactivity training isn't done walking first. Sitting in a space where the dog is exposed yet safe and able to still hear you/see you through their own reactivity is ideal to begin. OP, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend looking into methods used for aggression reactivity (Distance exposure, meal time with reaction trigger ((no interest in cheese, but what if he hasn't had any dinner yet?)), etc.) but don't go allowing that frustration to yield all positive reinforcement out. A lot of aggression trainer will use havy negative reinforcement, and that isn't what I mean. Specifically, you want your high energy pup to act like he isn't absolutely nuts over stuff when he just *is*. Manage the expectation of what that looks like. He's going to fail, a lot, and that okay. That dog is only 14 months old. Recall the \"terrible twos\"? His energy is endless in comparison, *and* he used to be scared. Now he's bigger, braver, and bolder. How has your routine changed in comparison to his energy? He needs a LOT from you, which is an exhausting thought I know, but he's going to need your time and PATIENCE. Lots of it. Wait him out. \n\nI have a very happy go lucky AmStaff who is the friendliest guy on the planet and will go bonkers for some pets. He's two and a half. It's hard to tell a young dog to not be young to some extent, but you CAN reduce that energy. Hours of play time are needed for calm sniff walks with my boy, usually two hours of running fetch or an hour of heavy tug war. To expose him to environments, though, I brought a park chair and sat in places progressively closer to other dogs and human until he was no longer driven to cry for their attention or tug me to them. Why? Because it didn't work for six months. Six full months of sitting in the same spot doing the same damn thing with this dog. And now, despite the occasional failure, he takes naps as a dog walks by. But if I tell him \"free\", the game is on and he's crazy boy again. \n\nI know it's rough and exhausting. I cried in my fold up chair more times than I care to admit, not knowing what I got myself into. It was worth every minute and you got this, OP, and so does your pup.",

While we've also of course worked a lot on actual leash training where consistency is key, which means that if you're several people walking him, you need to be equally consistent in your method. \n\nHowever, outside of that I found that its been so important to build a good relationship with my dog. Trick training might be \"useless\" but my boy loves getting asked to do a spin and it simply improves our relationship and communication. Plus, mental training is good, especially if he's overly excited. \n\nI'd also just really hammer in the basics. If he's well behaved at home - good. But for working with him outside, I'd stay as close to home as possible to keep him from building on the excitement. Also, I have seen other people mentioning people watching. I'd recommend doing this close to home as well. Potentially even start practicing at home. As in, get your dog used to calming down if hes on a leash and you're sitting down. Move to the crowded park once he's mastered the calmer environments. Because working in steps and allowing him time to learn is important.\n\nAnd for dogs or other things that trigger him - distance. I also live in a neighbourhood with a lot of dogs so I know it's easier said than done but it will be very helpful for him.",

Find a distance where he isn\u2019t bothered by the dogs and reward him for paying attention to you and not the dogs.

One thing I did is I started using all of her meals for training (and if we don\u2019t get through all of the kibble by the end of the day it does go in her bowl) and also playing games with her that increase her food drive. For example, practicing engagement indoors where there are very few distractions and when she looks at me, I say \u201cyes\u201d and sort of run back a little bit or when I say \u201cbreak\u201d I toss the food so she chases it.

Once you have him somewhat used to hand feeding (always make sure he earns it, even simple things like a sit as well as new training), wait until you know he is hungry to work with new things.

It could take a total of one month or up to a few years depending. I have no context so I hope I am not just telling you what you already know! Also consistency is one of the biggest factors in shaping behavior. As well as with dogs, what you say actually doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s what you do. They don\u2019t listen very well until taught to. Cues have to be taught in every new environment (which can be quite difficult). Are you able to buy any \u201cnot friendly/do not pet\u201d patches? That could help deter people from coming TOO close. Are you able to get in a position where you could watch dogs from far away? A good training session starting with just observing and learning how to behave is usually the first step. What does your dog find rewarding? That\u2019s where hand feeding could come in (plus high value treats if food motivation comes) if it doesn\u2019t work out then you might have to get creative with what you know your dog does like.

We BIG TIME socialized him very early on, taking him out in public to meet people and dogs of every shape/size/color/age. He made lots of friends in the neighborhood and had great playdates. He was so good, until he wasn't. Something happened--we have no idea what--and he became highly reactive. To strangers, to people he regularly sees walking, to strange dogs, to dogs he knows, to cars, trucks, strollers, people running, people on bikes, DOGS ON TV. We hired a trainer. We try to keep him below threshold. Sometimes he sounds scary/agressive but sometimes it's a high-pitched, crazy frustrated whine. I think most of the time he's a frustrated greeter and just wants to play with anyone and anything, but the way he shows that freaks people out.\n\nWe tried a walk today before breakfast to see if he'd be more motivated by high value treats (that did seem to help a bit, but we still had a reactive episode). I signed up earlier this week to get in with a Behaviorist, which will happen in March. He's a love, and by far the most snuggly dog I've had, and he's extremely attached to me. But he scares the crap out of people and other dogs if I can't get him away fast enough and he reacts. I can't have him out in public like that.  We are in the suburbs in a relatively quiet residential area but had him in a walkable city for two weeks over the holidays so I really feel for you being in an apartment building--it was hell with triggers everywhere we went and him sometimes sounding like he was on the attack. One thing that I'm seeing here repeatedly is to go somewhere out in public and sit with him, which I've been meaning to try and as soon as we get some above-freezing weather, I'm going to try that. Hoping for both of our boys that age and maturity will help.",

When you think he is ready, try this back-and-forth method outside close to home. As he gets better on a leash walk further and further without changing direction. You can also reward him when he walks behind you. This will encourage him not to go in front of you.

She goes to him for 2 weeks, comes back to me and so on. Despite her \u2018legacy\u2019 with me, she is doing better than I ever thought possible and our bond is stronger, really beautiful. It will cost me around $10,000 CA by the time we\u2019re done but it is WORTH EVERY PENNY.",

Goldie owner here and I have experienced all of the above behaviour including my dog not being food motivated - which all turned out to be because of pain. A poke at the vets is not enough - their adrenaline will be pumping. A pain trial involves a few weeks on pain meds and seeing how it impacts behaviour. Any ethical and knowledgeable vet/behaviourist/trainer should be recommending a pain trial at this point. You cannot train away pain. Aside from that - make sure he\u2019s getting a decent amount of sleep and has a predictable routine. I could go on and on about things that could help solve this but pain trial is number 1 here.",

The only thing that helped her ultimately was routine. If she knew exactly where we were going and how long it would take she calmed down and walked nicely. If I took her somewhere new she would revert back to the same pulling behaviour. I don't know if it's a matter of how much more overstimulating the outside world is to dogs.",

Then he would eat all his meals there. If he chose not to eat due to distraction, I\u2019d simply bring him back home and try again the next mealtime. Eventually he would eat outdoors, and I\u2019d start building engagement and eventually play from there. Good luck!",
