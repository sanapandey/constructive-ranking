    "selftext": "my dog is 4 and for some reason, wont run to grab toys. my other dog is 13 and only ever wanted us to throw the toy down the hall so she could run and bring it back over and over until she either got tired or had to shit, which shes 10 pounds soaking wet so not long. \n\nwhen we got her we tried to teach her the same as our older dog, she just wanted to play tug of war though. Shes a corgi, so we thought we were going to have to train her not to chase people, but no, she wants us to chase her. when playing with her if we get the toy we will throw it down the hall, she MIGHT go get it ONCE, but most the time she sits down and gives you a nasty side eye, like she offended. \n\ni really didnt realized it was something you had to train into them, but because me other dog did it naturally im not really sure how too. its also a problem that she is food driven so she wont do tricks unless there is a treat involved. you can sit there and try to get her to do a trick without food, the will do one, you click or praise, but since there was no treat, if you try to get her to do another one she looks like you just stabbed her mom.\n\n&#x200B;",
