    "selftext": "I've seen a lot of people say that dogs licking their lips is a sign of anxiety. I've noticed that my dog does this whenever I rub his belly. But most of the time he's usually the one who asks me to rub his belly, and when I stop he paws at me until I start again. \n\nSo does he not like it when I rub his belly? Or does he?? Thanks in advance for the help.",

Like he comes at me, paws me to get my attention,  i try and assess if he wants be pet, and after a couple pets he rubs his face on my hand, licks his lips, whips his tail very quickly and then rolls on the back pawing my hand on the belly. I usually rub it a couple times to try and understand if he likes it and he goes ballistic trying to nib my hand and tippity tappity with his back leg like a rabbit. If i stop rubbing or take my hand away when he nibs it he immediately come and paws me. Rinse and repeat. I\u2019m at a loss",
