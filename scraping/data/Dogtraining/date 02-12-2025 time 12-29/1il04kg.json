    "selftext": "We came home to what was apparently a fight between our dogs (9 and 2). We\u2019ve had the older one for 2.5 years and the younger for 1.5. The older one had a split ear and bites on two of her legs. We went to the emergency vet who stitched her up and she is recovering. Our other dog has no injuries, was just covered in blood.\n\nThis was so random and we aren\u2019t sure what happened (we were gone and we have no cameras) but we don\u2019t know what to do. The younger dog has been in one other spat with one of our family\u2019s dogs (who is a hunting dog and has been in spats with many other dogs). We can\u2019t ever have this happen again and we have an 8mo who is crawling now which makes us even more nervous (the baby and younger dog are great friends and have never had issues).",
