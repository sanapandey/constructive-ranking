    "selftext": "PLEASE HELP!! My dog (1 year old cavapoo) has been driving me crazy, any time my husband goes out of town for work, she barks excessively at night time and now if he\u2019s late home from work she does the same thing. Every slight noise outside, anything at all just sets her off barking. This started about 6/7 months ago. I\u2019m currently pregnant and really worried about what to do because my husband travels regularly and I can\u2019t do this with a baby. My dog is more attached to me and I did all of the training in the beginning, she will not go on a walk with anyone but me (won\u2019t even walk on a leash with my husband by himself). She of course loves my husband but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s more attached to him than me so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s separation anxiety and I don\u2019t know what to do.  Any help would be great ",

The only wanting to walk with you? What does she do when your husband (or anyone else) tries to walk her? Lie down, try to pull back? When you would let her line go outside, would she return straight home, or stay?\n\nDoes the dog show guarding/protective behavior? With food, toys, lead, shoes, whatever..? Or towards you? Can your husband pet the dog while he/she is with you, or the other way around?\n\nI ask this because the barking can be because of multiple things, just excitement, (separation or else) anxiety, protective behavior.. And a dog already excited or anxious, so already in 'bark-mode', is pretty much impossible to train: you need to find the reason, so you can find a way to not let the dog get in that mode. Already in the mode, too late!",

She just lies down and refuses to move as soon as she gets out of the building with anyone but me but she\u2019ll happily walk with anybody once I\u2019m there. It\u2019s bizarre. \n\nShe shows no protective behavior at all normally!! She is so gentle, she curls up next to my husband when I\u2019m home, she loves him, when we\u2019re both home she\u2019ll happily sit over with him and just ignore me sometimes haha\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Not of me to her other people, and generally still a good girl, but...like...she was just a hair more on edge. She'd bark more at things, lay on me more, follow me room to room more. It was subtle, but there.\n\nAnyway, she went back to normal when I had the baby (and didn't transfer her actions to the baby, which was nice)\n\nSo maybe it's just that you're pregnant. However, I would fear she'd potentially be similar with a new baby to \"protect\" so you should definitely work on the nondesirable actions.",

Between the attachment to you while walking and the barking, this amount of anxiety and lack of impulse control will need someone there in your home with you to develop training protocols.\n You sound like you're off to a good start, but with a baby coming , your best bet for a reliable solution is a professional. \nYou won't need someone long term, behavioral trainers are more expensive, but the investment will make a huge difference. With the help you'll with walks and quiet during nap time/during the night, this will save all of you a lot of unnecessary stress.",

Check with your vet RE the melatonin before trying that since dosages vary by dog weight, but the white noise machine is an easy starting place. We also try to make sure he is properly tired and ready for bed (some days this is a struggle since his witching hour is typically right before bed). \n\nOur behaviourist also suggested making sure during the day he has access to the space he sleeps in at night so he can nap and chill out and develop the association that this place is for sleep. Previously he had always napped on the day bed in our office so we stopped letting him do that. \n\nWe do have regressions every so often but so far have always been able to get him back on track.",

My dog would bark at every little noise when my husband is at work (I work from home), but won't bark at all the noises when he's home. I think this was a mix of anticipating my husband to come home and fear of the outside sounds. My dog is also a rescue we got a few months ago, so this was also part \n\nWhat helped was counter conditioning the outside noises with treats. Basically, whenever I heard a noise outside, I'd throw him a treat and tell him to chill. I wouldn't give him a treat if he barked though. It was tricky at first because he was barking at literally everything. But after three or four days doing this consistently, he will now notice the sounds but 99% of the time, he doesn't bark. \n\nFor the walk stuff - Have you tried having your husband feed your dog? That could help them build their bond, she would learn she can count on him to meet her basic needs. Playing together or doing a training session could help. He could also try putting her leash on and walking her around the house while feeding her treats so your dog gets comfortable with the idea of letting him lead.",
