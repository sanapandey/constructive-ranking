    "selftext": "Hi! My pup is turning one, and he is right in his adolescence. I need some advice!\n\nMy dog learns fast and listens pretty well. However, when I bring him to places, he becomes hard to manage as he gets wayyy too excited, not following or listening to us. We make sure to take a walk and play with him before we head out, but it doesn't seem to help. He's gotten more reactive for a lil while, so maybe it's a phase, but I'd rather work on it with him. \n\nToday, I brought him to the pet store. He was SO excited to go. In the car, screaming/whining (he does that when he's very happy), outside the car he was still screaming and tugging at the leash. I didn't let him go to the pet store right away, as I was trying to calm him down first by asking him to sit down. He could hardly sit still for more than 2 seconds, and he would continuously scream and whine. I understand he's super excited, but I can't imagine what the other people around think is going on when they hear his banshee screams, lol.\n\nAsking for some advice I can try it before contacting my dog trainer! Thanks!",

He is great at them!But he lacks that outside the home and with specific triggers\n\n He is also tired out with exercise before we go out with him to try to minimize his excitement, to no avail\n\nMy dog is perfectly healthy and gets checked periodically.",
