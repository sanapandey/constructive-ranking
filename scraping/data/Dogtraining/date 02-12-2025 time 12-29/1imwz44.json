A dog with separation anxiety is one who displays stress when the one or more family members leave. Separation anxiety can vary from light stress to separation panic but at the heart of the matter is distress.\n\n**Does this sound familiar?** Lucky for you, this is a pretty common problem that many dog owners struggle with. It can feel isolating and frustrating, but we are here to help!\n\n***Resources***\n\n**Books**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Don't Leave Me!

            "body": "I really need a dose of hope that it\u2019s gonna get better with my dogs separation anxiety. I adopted what is most likely a 1 year old Aussiedoodle from a shelter just under two weeks ago, she was/is very even tempered and showed no signs of separation anxiety in the shelter. After bringing her home I realized she had some separation anxiety so I started reading and trying to train her, I took a week to work from home while working on her but now I need to get back to office and leave her alone but the longest I\u2019ve been able to leave her without her crashing out has been a hour. After that she gets destructive and today she destroyed my blinds and it looks like she may have left some of her own blood behind. I feel like I\u2019m doing everything I can, I take her on long walks and give her plenty of mental stimulation for when I\u2019m gone, she doesn\u2019t have much interest in toys in general, just lick mats and kongs. I\u2019m taking her to the vet tomorrow to get her checked and hopefully get some prescription for the anxiety but I\u2019m seriously losing my mind, I\u2019m so stressed about trying to train her correctly and I don\u2019t have the money to put her doggy daycare or have a sitter. Is there any hope for me and this dog?",
