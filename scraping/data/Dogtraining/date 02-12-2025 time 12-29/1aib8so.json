    "selftext": "Welcome to the Trick of the Month!\n\nThis month we'll be teaching our dogs to touch their noses to a target, the simplest target being your hand! This might be called nose targeting and can be used to build up to more complex tricks or used to get your dog's attention in a fun way.\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. Teach a dog the trick.\n2. Film the dog performing the trick.\n3. Upload a video/picture to the internet.\n4. Post a link to video or pictures of your results here in the comments.\n\n**Training Resources:**\n\n[Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/RWSJVwZybwo?si=Bb5991HQCKpyxS1A)\n\n[Text instructions from the AKC](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/training/the-power-of-touch-teach-your-dog-to-nose-target/)  \n\n\nPost questions and results on this thread. Good luck and happy training!",
