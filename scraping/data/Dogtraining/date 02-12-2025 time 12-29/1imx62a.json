    "selftext": "Our 9-month-old lab must have some sort of intense internal clock because he starts barking at exactly 6:15 every morning for us to let him out of his crate. He doesn\u2019t need to go to the bathroom as whenever we do come downstairs, he spends time playing before he tries to go outside, so I know he\u2019s not barking because of that.\n\nHowever, when he was very young puppy, he did have a few illnesses which led to us responding the second he barked, so I think he thinks he can determine when he comes out. \n\nWe try ignoring him until he\u2019s quiet for a couple minutes so as not to reinforce letting him out while barking, but ultimately as this is a morning behavior, so days we just have to get up and get moving for work and school.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried white noise, I\u2019ve tried just getting him earlier than him to help him have a week of getting up without barking, but it doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\n-we\u2019ve had him since 8 weeks old\n-he\u2019s been crate trained since then\n-he likes his crate and will happily go in when directed and spends time sleeping there on his own during the day \n-he has a crate cover \n-he sleeps in our front living room with our older lab (so downstairs, both crated separately).\n\nAny suggestions? He\u2019s the first of our labs to bark at all, let alone this. Thanks! ",

However, since I do think it is a boredom barking and he just wants to get out and play, we\u2019ve tried to increase his daytime enrichments so that he\u2019s more mentally worn out as well.",
