    "selftext": "Hello, I have a pug (Lillie) and she's really sweet, but I am unable to cut her nails and I don't know what to do. I have brought her to the groomers twice and both times they turned me away after Lillie starts freaking out. My mother brought her to the vet, and it took 3 people to hold her down and she was really freaking out, they ended up not being able to do anything though. I myself have tried, she's very comfortable letting me hold her paw, even letting the nail clipper touch her paw, but as soon as I try getting a firmer grip to ensure I don't hurt her, she starts moving, licking my hand, and will eventually become aggressive until I let go (then she is fine again). The issue stems from the first time we cut her nails, my father tried, but wasn't careful enough, and ended up hurting her. I am not sure what to do, can anyone give me advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",

Do this every night or a few nights a week. Start touching her back paws. After a few weeks start touching between her toes. After a few more weeks hold her paws. Then touch her nails. Then hold her nails. Move your fingers around her toes and move her toes back around. In 3 months of consistent training she should be really comfortable. Then it\u2019s time to get the clippers out. Start touching them to her feet. Before you actually cut her nails make sure you know how to do it right. If you cut them too short you will get the quick and it will hurt really bad. That will set you back to the beginning. Learn from a groomer or watch a YouTube video. The first time you cut her nails only cut the very tip off. As she gets more comfortable you can do more. \nI got a 9 year old chihuahua last year and he was the same way about his nails. He was CRAZY. I can now cut them myself, but we are still working on it. I am not doing the training as much as I recommended. I can cut one paw and then he gets squirmy and I have to do the next one the next night. It is 99% better than before. He was fighting for his life when he saw the clippers or got his paw grabbed when I first got him. \nI have three other dogs and I cut all their nails. I start training all my dogs to let me touch their paws as soon as I get them.",

(I like the Casfuy one with lights on Amazon) Since yours is fearful, you may have to dedicate yourself to conditioning her slowly. Break the process into very small bits - reward for each bit of bravery. Just slowly introduce the grinder - the sound the touch, the actual grinding. Also, try starting with the right front paw and working clockwise around the dog. Only do what is comfortable for your dog so if that means one nail, fine. Come back later or the next day and do the next nail. Give a tiny treat after each nail, later taper treats. If you always work clockwise you can easily see where you left off. You'll get all the nails in one setting eventually and give one treat at the end. Take it at the dog's pace and don't push to fast. Mine was super cautious at first but generally sleeps through nail grinding now.",

If groomers won\u2019t do it have a vet get them to a good level, and then focus on desensitization by snipping one per day, every single day.\n\nOtherwise as other people have suggested, sandpaper boards may be a good option. Either way will require focused training. I don\u2019t suggest the dremel though as they can be overwhelming sensory-wise to some dogs and it sounds like she\u2019s already been through a traumatic event.",

So like I always did, I told him it wouldn't hurt, and I proceeded to clip a back foot nail. I only took a bit off, but oh the blood. So it's cornflour and many apologies. And now the dog is highly suspicious of every move I make. We eventually pop down to the vet, and I ask if they can please trim his nails, with the warning that he is not happy about any of it. \n\nSo the new vet whisks him off to the back. We heard him complaining once or twice, and I felt a bit better that it wasn't just me having a hard time. Next thing he comes prancing down the passage, as chuffed as punch, while walking very casually on the lead being held by the vet, with three bandaged paws! \n\nThe poor vet is very apologetic, and explains although he settled down fine, and sat reasonably still, he has dark nails, and the quick is alot closer to the nail end than he expected. I burst out laughing, and said it was fine, I would have done alot worse, and that we know for next time. Meanwhile my dog is happily showing off his war wounds to anyone who will have a look. \n\nHe spent the next day and a bit running up and down the passage like a maniac, with the bandages, and sounded like a horse running up and down. \n\nIt was only one nail on each of the three paws that got a nick. He is outside alot, so his nails stay reasonably short, otherwise we just ask for a trim when he visits the vet for something. They have never cut too short again.",
