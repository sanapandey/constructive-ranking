    "selftext": "I know questions like these are posted all the time, but we need some help! My partner and I recently adopted a four year old toy poodle from the humane society. She is a wonderful addition to our family and we love her so much already. Unfortunately, she lacks any training at all and has anxious attachment, along with just general anxiety. We have learned that she was not potty trained but instead pee pad trained so we are trying to teach her to go outside. She also has no leash manners, barks, and pulls to get to other dogs and people to say hi. She gets highly anxious outside and is constantly alert for any sounds or changes. More pressing is her anxious attachment. She has zero reaction to me leaving the home, but my partner works from home and she is already attached to her. She whines when she leaves even if others are in the home and will relieve herself when my partner leaves. She loves her crate so we attempted to leave her in the crate when we left and she barked for the entire time and relieved herself in it. We have read advice from others on this site as well as our other friends but are unsure of where to start. We're new dog owners, we really want to take good care of our dog but are struggling with trying not to let an anxious dog take control of our entire life \ud83d\ude43",
