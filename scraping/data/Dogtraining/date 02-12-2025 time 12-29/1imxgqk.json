    "selftext": "I've seen a lot of people say that dogs licking their lips is a sign of anxiety. I've noticed that my dog does this whenever I rub his belly. But most of the time he's usually the one who asks me to rub his belly, and when I stop he paws at me until I start again. \n\nSo does he not like it when I rub his belly? Or does he?? Thanks in advance for the help.",
