    "selftext": "Hi everyone so recently I've come across a few issues that I'd like to address, both dogs are the same age, breed, sex, from the same litter.\n\nThey're both large dogs, over 1 year old.\n\n1. They were both house trained well, so I got rid of the dog crate, all well for around 6mo or so, then they started going inside again. So the crate had to come back, nothing about the routine changed and they don't toilet in their bed area (crate, dog bed, car etc), they're house trained so I don't understand why, they're fine doing 4 or 5hrs alone without accident during the day but leave them over night, 12am - 5am and they'll toilet inside.\n\n2. They go to work with me and I'll let them out in a morning before going into the unit, they both do their toilet trips, I read that some dogs do more than one sitting so I started leaving them out for longer to the point that they've got their excitement out and start mooching about, bring them inside and within 30 mins there's a 'parcel','puddle' or both waiting for me at the back of the unit while I'm out of sight at the front of the unit, but why? I'd prefer to train it out rather than cater to it by doing another toilet trip half an hour later because chances are they'll see it as play time or still wait until they're inside regardless.\n\n3. In a morning, first thing, I'll let them out into the garden for a play and toilet time, they both shake off as soon as they're out of the crate rather than shaking outside, sometimes do it and sometimes don't, 1 does it more than the other, I understand it's a dog behaviour but I'd like to train them to do it outside, there's enough hair clean up as is without them adding to it by shaking every morning.\n\n4. During the \"first thing in the morning\" let out, dog 1 will walk normally/slightly sped up pace from the cage across the carpet and across the laminate floor no problem at all, but dog 2 (seems to not be maturing) will do the same thing but regardless of speed, seems to struggle with the laminate, only first thing in the morning, any other time it's no problem at all, it's obviously excitement but dog 1 manages fine and understands claws don't work on hard floor, dog 2 tries clawing their way to the door, if running dog 2 will slide straight into the washing machine and then struggle all the way to the door, I've walked them both to the door before and dog 2 will be fine until I stand to the side and say \"ok\" to let them know to go outside at which point dog 1 will walk out and dog 2 will try to sprint from 2ft away from the door, the only option is to walk dog 2 out of the door but then I'll still have issue 3 because they're not getting out fast enough.\n\nThanks for reading.",
