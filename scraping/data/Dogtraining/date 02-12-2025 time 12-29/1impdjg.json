    "selftext": "I taught my dog a \u201ctake it\u201d and \u201cdrop it\u201d and while we did it a little while ago and he\u2019s a bit rusty, he\u2019s basically still fully got it. \n\nHe\u2019s near flawless and holding it until drop it, within reason. I can seem to get him to sit while holding it successfully. \n\nHowever I can\u2019t really get him to do anything else while still holding it. A spin and he drops it then spins. I get him to come over or touch a spot, and he\u2019ll basically move and drop it on the way?\n\nAny ideas how I can reinforce the holding it until the drop it, including layering in other known commands?\n\nMy ultimate goal is to upgrade this to a \u201cclean up\u201d of sorts, going to grab an item, carrying it over to a box, and dropping it there",
