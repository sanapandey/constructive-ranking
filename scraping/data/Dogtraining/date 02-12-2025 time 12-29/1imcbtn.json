    "selftext": "My lovely senior dog is around 10 years old and spends most of her days just sleeping. I've been trying to get her to be more active by playing with her and her toys, and I usually take her outside when I'm doing yard work or shoveling snow. We typically enjoy daily walks, but with about 10 feet of snow recently, it\u2019s tough to get her out. On our walks, she moves very slowly, and I hoped she\u2019d pick up the pace as we walked more often, but she's been maintaining that slow speed for weeks, even months now. \n\nWhen I try to play with her, she often won\u2019t fetch the ball or show interest in her stuffed animals. If she does engage, it lasts only about 20 seconds to 5 minutes before she goes back to her favorite spot to lie down. I'm not sure what to do at this point. She\u2019s never been overly energetic, but this current lack of enthusiasm seems off. The only time I see her perk up is during mealtime. Any advice on how to encourage her to be more active would be greatly appreciated!",
