    "selftext": "I have a 10+ year old golden retriever who does some stuff that puzzles me. I don\u2019t mean to sound overly blunt or unkind, I just don\u2019t know how else to phrase this. \n\nIt seems like he doesn\u2019t do anything contently on his own if I (or someone else) is available. When he was a puppy he was not like this to the point of dysfunction. \n\nIt\u2019s just him and I in my home for now. He stares me down 24/7 for direction, guidance, praise, food/water, walks, comfort, ect. But then no matter what I give him, it\u2019s never enough. He doesn\u2019t want to hear what I have to say, yet constantly seeks out my guidance/leadership. It\u2019s getting to the point where it stresses me out so much and I resent having to spend all my energy trying to keep him happy and that seems impossible. \n\nIf I pet him for 5 minutes, he\u2019s *very upset* when I stop like I didn\u2019t just pet him for five minutes straight. \n\nWe go on a mile walk? Not good enough. He also wants to go to the other side of the complex and he\u2019s offended you won\u2019t let him. We go on a quarter mile walk? Not good enough. We go to a park for a day trip? Not good enough. What\u2019s next? \n\nHe gets let out on the porch after asking. Not good enough. What can you give him next? \n\nHe has very little interest in his toys when I am around. On the rare occasions he does use them he seems genuinely happy and I want that for him! I love to see him chewing on an antler happily. I don\u2019t understand the (what seems like) anhedonia. \n\nHe won\u2019t just go outside on the porch and be happy by himself for a little while. He is averse to chewing on his bone, which he used to enjoy. He loses interest watching out the window after 30 seconds maybe, and he\u2019s laying there sighing like he\u2019s miserable and staring at me like I\u2019ve both disappointed and betrayed him for not entertaining him 24/7. He goes out for fresh air, it\u2019s nice for 2 minutes then he\u2019s back to being miserable. He will play with his toy or flop around on the ground happily for a second or two, then he stops and hunkers down and sulks. Car rides are nice but as soon as they\u2019re over he wants other forms of entertainment. \n\nIt truly feels like it\u2019s always \u201cwhat can I have next?!\u201d then he almost instantly rejects that same thing, because he tires of it immediately, or that\u2019s not what he wanted. It feels like he doesn\u2019t even know what he wants! And I don\u2019t have anything left to give him. I\u2019ve tried toys, exercise, the vet, affection, music and or singing to him, fresh air and sunshine, socializing with animals, socializing with people, play. He is just\u2026.miserable if I\u2019m not sitting there actively cheering him up. I hate to see him suffer like that, and just want him to be able to do anything happily and independently. \n\nI know he\u2019s incredibly intelligent, and incredibly emotional for a dog. I also know he\u2019s very very spoiled. \n\nHow do I help him be more content independent of me? It truly feels to me that he is codependent to the point of making himself miserable. \n\nHe does deal with some pain because he\u2019s a senior dog. We are treating that. He gets regular walks, food twice a day, affection/praise, fun time. Everything I can think he might need. ",

Part of that is he loves the vet so much he gets excited and the endorphins act as natural pain killers. He has an iffy knee. Other than that he is deemed healthy. \n\nThis anxious/codependent type behavior got progressively worse when he turned about 1.5-2 years old.",
