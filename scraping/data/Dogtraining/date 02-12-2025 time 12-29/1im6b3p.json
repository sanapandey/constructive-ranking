    "selftext": "I was curious in how to deal with my dog's (shiba about 5 yrs. old) aggression with other dogs.\nI was walking her with my friend & her dog (a toy breed) for the first time and I realized how bad she can be with other dogs. She ignore the other dog mostly and would sit if their dog tried to smell her butt. This I think is all fine and is her normal behavior; however, my dog reacted with an instant growl & lunge when the other dog tries to get close to her face or walk into her. I was wondering what I should incorporate in future training to avoid this happening again. I don't want her snapping at other dogs, especially those smaller than her. \nHer current training with other dogs is to focus on me & continue walking. She hasn't had many opportunities to meet closely with other dogs other than the ones she knew since as a puppy. So, I am unsure trying to do this dog walk with this new dog was a good way to introduce the two dogs to each other.\nAny tips are welcome!",
