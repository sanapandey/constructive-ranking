    "selftext": "I\u2019m about two months into owing my first dog since I was a kid, and he is fantastic. Quickly learning essentials, listens to no, potty trained, I\u2019m so so proud of my little guy. When we play with him, we find he loves to play bite, he is very gentle, has never hurt us, and just likes to gently gnaw on hands  and arms while you move them around like he\u2019s trying to catch them. It\u2019s very cute and I love to play with home like that. \n\nThe problem is, the other day a friends daughter was over and her and the dog loved each other. They were having a great time for almost two hours when our little guy decided he wanted to play as described above. We saw it immediately, but before we could call him off he had gently nipped her arm, which didn\u2019t hurt her, but did scare her, and she understandably wouldn\u2019t play with him anymore. \n\nI love his play nips, but I understand why others wouldn\u2019t, and I really want to avoid a situation where he does hurt someone in the future. Should I discourage the play nipping, or is that a healthy behavior for his age? Is there something I could substitute instead? Thanks in advance\n\n1.5ish year old Corgi/Border Collie if it matters. \n\nTL;DR my dog loves to play with little nips and gnaws and I don\u2019t know if I should let it continue or not. ",
