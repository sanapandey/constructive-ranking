    "selftext": "As this year progresses, I, and many others I assume, am seeing a lack of a comprehensive response to the current fascist take over of the United States government. \n\nWhat I am seeing is many small organizations planning specific actions or protests in support of specific things; like Palestinian Liberation, Queer and Trans Liberation, and POC Liberation. \n\nWhich is good! These are important issues. I am definitely not trying to say these things are bad. All of the efforts are necessary. \n\nBut the issue I am seeing most often is that the turn outs are small. Either because of low support for this specific action, it was planned at an inconvenient time for most people (seeing a lot of stuff scheduled during the work day which keeps me from getting out, as I imagine it keeps others from getting out), or other issues. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be a doomer, don\u2019t get me wrong. Organizing seems super difficult, large scale organizing seems far worse. \n\nBut so many groups have different plans for different days. PSL is doing one thing, DSA is doing another, CPUSA is doing another. Not to mention smaller local groups. \n\nFrom what I know historically, popular fronts have been formed from socialists to anarchists and liberals to combat fascism and nationalism in say, Spain.\n\nIs there any merit to a coalition of leftist organizations to plan actions together with considerations for how to get the most turn out possible? Actions to resist the fascist take over as a whole, and not in support or against specific issues?\n\nSorry if these are silly questions or discussion, I\u2019m pretty ignorant about leftist organizing and want to know more about it as I\u2019m starting to join groups around me. \n\n(edited for using an inappropriate word, sorry guys)",

But after the Nazis seized power, Stalin was forced to abandon his isolation tactic and go back to the Popular Front strategy.\n\nThey did not return to the \"popular front\" strategy, it was something new for the seventh Comintern World Congress in 1935. The tactic before the sixth Comintern World Congress in 1928, where there was this ultra-left turn, was the united front. [The united front was predicated on proposing united fronts on concrete issues](https://www.marxists.org/archive/thalheimer/works/ufront20-23.html) with mass-organisations of the working-class, like the labor unions, and other workers' parties, like the Social-democrats in most European countries or Farmer-Labor parties in the US. These proposals was to aimed towards both the leadership and the rank-and-file. If it was refused it would should the rank-and-file that that their leaders did not want to fight for their interests. The Communists were also to remain an independent party.  \n\nThe popular front on the other hand built on a much larger \"cross-class\" popular front. [In the US this meant working with the Democrats](https://jacobin.com/2017/10/popular-front-communist-party-democrats). As opposed to before the ultra-left turn in 1928, they now for example did not try to organize an opposition in the labor unions - like with TUEL - but instead supported the labor bureaucracy. They worked to subordinate all expressions of independent working-class politics into the Democrats, from everything like unemployed organizations to Farmer-Labor parties and new industrial unions like CIO and UAW. \n\nIt also disregarded independence of the party. In countries where there were Social-democratic parties they [directed the Communist Parties to merge with the Social-democrats](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/dimitrov/works/1935/08_02.htm#s20). In most countries this failed but in Spain they did merge the youth-leagues. \n\n> Once Fascism is defeated, the workers can go back to trying to win power. Defeating Fascism is the priority, and you need to form alliances with anyone willing to fight Fascism.\n\nThere was no \"once Fascism is defeated\" clause in the popular front strategy, it was quickly made permanent. CPUSA is still in an endless string of \"popular fronts\" to support the [lesser evil](https://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1967/01/lesser.htm). They dissolved the Red International of Labor Unions in 1937, and Comintern itself in 1943. The Communist Parties were now going to find their own national road to socialism, built on \"popular fronts against monopoly capital\" and \"people's democracy\".",
