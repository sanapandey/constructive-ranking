    "selftext": "Basically what the title says, what are some of the best sources where their primarily focus is in-depth reporting developments within the labour movement. This can include any news about large trade unions, industry developments, and industrial disputes and strikes. These sources can include online websites, physical newspapers, academic journals or even YouTube channels.\n\nThis is because despite my personal politics, one of the careers I am interested in pursuing after Uni is policy research for trade unions so I want to develop my knowledge on current affairs rather than just historical examples of industry developments and industrial disputes which I know of through my education and my own research that I have done as a socialist.\n\nI am primarily interested in Europe and North America, but any sources would be appreciated.",

            "body": "There are no platforms or organs that cover labour struggles in a systemic and comprehensible way akin to what you are asking, unfortunately. Reports on those are usually dependent on either 1) concrete organisations (and their organs, if they have any) or 2) topic-specific and/or ideologically-close press, but in both cases they tend to be limited to their immediate areas (city, branch, country, state...). When foreign cases of labour struggle are dealt within those spaces, its usually either a result of 1) gained popularity or 2) specific relations within groups which facilitate information flow. Take, for example, People's Dispatch attempts to cover radical activism (usually linked to relations deriving from the organisations that lie behind it), or to TeleSur's coverage of left politics in Latin America (again, linked to pink tide-related movements).\n\nThe closest to what you are looking for would be think thanks or similar organisms which cover labour-related questions, but even then it is not this that they do. I don't think any of them actually focuses on providing this kind of information.\n\nThe best choice you have, then, is to use mainstream press' reports, and most specifically Reuters. Whilst their focus is obviously not aimed at studying movements, they cover a pretty decent range of labour struggles and tend to report mostly on demands, gains, and agreements. Here is a list of articles on the topic: https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/worker-rights/\n\nAs per academic-wise, I'm not particularly familiar with the area of study. All I know about are a couple of labour-oriented journals such as the Journal of Labor and Society, Global Political Economy (Bristol) or Labor History, as well as theoretical-oriented Marxist journals which nevertheless include contributions from activists and independent researchers (which often write more along those lines).",
