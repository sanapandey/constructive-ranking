They hand us a flood of bullshit as bait and it's nothing but a trap to waste our time. \n\nCutting to the chase like Chomsky does is an art. \n\n\"No, your article isn't science. It's an echo of the same old racism. We've heard it and moved on from it as a species. Do better.\"",

He has opened many eyes to the harms of American imperialism and has helped many people along their journey of seeing the world through a socialist lens.\n\nSome socialists find fault with him for certain opinions, but at the end of the day, I can't think of anyone in today's world who has led more people in the West to socialism and to challenging the American empire than Chomsky.",

But like a Bernie Sanders figure, if our conception of left politics, socialism in particular, ends with figures like them, we're in big trouble!",

This has been proven since 2018.\n\nThe funniest part is there is only one source younger than 2018 (2019) and the article was last updated in 2022. No one with this level of interest in the subject would have missed this study except someone being intellectually dishonest and avoiding bringing it up.",
