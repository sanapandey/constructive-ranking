I wasn't sure what tag to use or if this type of post is allowed, but I'm searching for suggestions and recommendations for union/ethically-made clothing with socialist slogans on it. \n\nMore specifically, I would die for a union-made, plain white tee that simply says \"Eat the rich\" on the front but searching high and low on the internet has only turned up mass-produced garbage. \n\nThank you!",
