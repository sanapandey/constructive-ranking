    "selftext": "\\[I originally posted this on r/Socialism_101 but didn't really get a satisfying answer that worked for me, so I'll repost here\\]\n\nOnline, it seems like some people say the vast majority of Cubans support the party and the revolution while another group say the vast majority want it overthrown and all gone. What's the actual truth and is there any good data from independent polling organizations on what % of Cubans support the Communist Party?\n\nThe closest data I can find is the US government memo that said \"[The majority of Cubans support\u00a0Castro\u00a0(the lowest estimate I have seen is 50 percent).](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v06/d499)\", claiming Cuba must be brutally punished to try to turn the population against the government. However, this memo is now over 6 decades old and a lot can change in over sixty years. Any more recent data?",

What's for sure is that abstentionism is on the rise, even though it's still lower than in most countries:\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47365085](https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47365085)\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/cuba-elections-national-assembly-voter-turnout-b36c16e04f1177d9d1ec555c492e6faa](https://apnews.com/article/cuba-elections-national-assembly-voter-turnout-b36c16e04f1177d9d1ec555c492e6faa)\n\nThen there's also a lot of propaganda out there claiming that Cubans absolutely loathe their government:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1To-Kw0DIhDpCV4U4cy2otzlKfpPIVDSW/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1To-Kw0DIhDpCV4U4cy2otzlKfpPIVDSW/view)\n\n[https://eu.cibercuba.com/noticias/2024-12-14-u1-e207888-s27061-nid293793-regimen-afirma-mayoria-cubanos-apoyan-revolucion?utm\\_medium=buffer&utm\\_source=facebook&utm\\_campaign=cibercuba\\_noticias](https://eu.cibercuba.com/noticias/2024-12-14-u1-e207888-s27061-nid293793-regimen-afirma-mayoria-cubanos-apoyan-revolucion?utm_medium=buffer&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=cibercuba_noticias)\n\nThe only somewhat nuanced survey I've seen from independent sources comes from this report (2023-2024) from CubaData, and I'd argue that it still has some liberal bias:\n\n[https://cubadata.com/wp-content/publicaciones/2024-estudio-segundo-panel-multidimensional-cuba/index.html#page=39](https://cubadata.com/wp-content/publicaciones/2024-estudio-segundo-panel-multidimensional-cuba/index.html#page=39)\n\nIt claims that around 50% of the population don't think socialism is viable. It also says that 28,4% are still socialists, 49,9% are pragmatic and 21,7% are liberals. Bare in mind that this survey was carried out through mobile devices, so it probably reflects mostly the opinion of the youth. As always, take this information with a pinch of salt.",
