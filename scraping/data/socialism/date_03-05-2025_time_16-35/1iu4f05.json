    "selftext": "If you haven't read it Edward Bernays wrote a book in 1928 titled \"Propaganda\". In it he argued that people are best influenced by sources and leaders they already trust, independent of whatever campaign you are pursuing. He invented the \"physician recommended\" idea in his campaign to help the pork industry sell bacon.\n\nAll that is to say social media is the most effective expression of his idea one could invent. It's a system in which you literally pick who you follow and trust. And you pick those sources from a selection curated by the owner's algorithm.\n\nHow does this relate to the dismantling of the agencies that have traditionally spread official narratives (USAID and NED)? Those organizations have functioned to curate content for traditional news media and journalism. I don't think those are necessary for spreading narratives in a social media environment. You don't have to get around typical journalistic standards of reporting and fact finding. So on one hand they are an unnecessary expense and on another there are competing interests within the US government that can influence narratives one way or another. Whereas a social media platform is under the sole control of ownership, not subject to any nominally democratic influences the US government is.\n\nThis is just a thought I've been chewing on for a while that I wanted to share.",

Other than a plethora of books from him and about him, there\u2019s also a documentary called The Century of the Self, it\u2019s on YouTube, if you\u2019re interested. It makes it sound like it\u2019s almost a mind control thing (which seems to be part of BBC\u2019s and specially Adam Curtis alarmist and sensationalist tone, not to mention lack of understanding of Freud) but it\u2019s somewhat good in a few things (even if only for knowing a bit more of historical facts).",

Between the narration and the soundtrack it seems like the intention is to instill a sense of social dread which I personally deeply dislike, because social dread is too easy to confuse with realism and a moral and emotional sense of revolt. But to me it\u2019s just a conduit to a paralyzing fear.\n\nI know that\u2019s a very personal response but this is actually the first time I ever thought about my discomfort with the documentary (which I guess is what it is, more a discomfort than an actual critic).",

I think his impact on society is enormous, yet no one even knows who he is, let alone what he\u2019s done (unless you\u2019re a marketing major, or involved in propaganda). I found this post because I\u2019m preparing to do some of my own research into his impact on current events and did a quick search on Reddit thinking there\u2019d be a sub, but no, there isn\u2019t. There\u2019s a sub Reddit for everything, except the father of propaganda!?",

There\u2019s another name I\u2019d suggest for your research, which is how I originally found Bernays: Walter Lippmann. He\u2019s somewhat tangential but if you\u2019d like to map the idea tree behind Bernays, he belongs there, together with the less savoury figure of Goebbels.\n\nAs to him not being known, I think this is a weird case of a very impactful person becoming niche knowledge. And the reason why there isn\u2019t a sub is because, in a sense, Reddit is Bernays\u2019 sub.",
