He was a journalist in Germany and witnessed a lot of the events first-hand. One thing that stuck out to me was him talking about people that seemed completely disconnected from reality. They would parrot propaganda talking points that were ludicrous as if they were fact - sound familiar?\n\nKeep in mind that Shirer was a man of his time, and the book will reflect that. (He had some fascination with \"sexual deviance\" and that dovetails with his opinion on gay people.)\n\nYou'll have to separate his first-hand experiences from his historical analysis - especially because it was written before more research had come out and before the USSR/Russia had released important documents.",

Paxton examines the various traits that define Fascism and differentiate it from conservative authoritarianism, military dictatorship, even Marxism-Leninism. In his final chapter is where you will find his definition of Fascism, but the entire book is worth a read, so one better understands the differences between other Ideologies. \n\n\"Behemoth\" by F. Neumann is both a primary source and scholarly investigation into the rise of the Nazis. Neumann lived in Germany at the time and describes their sharp rise in popularity and the sharp right/left divide.\n\n\"Wages of Destruction\" by A. Tooze is a comprehensive academic text that examines the Nazi project in its totality. From its unlikely beginnings to its bitter end (or did it truly end?).",

So no preconceptions about the endpoint of Nazism (although like what's happening now, lots of folks were able to pretty accurately predict where it was headed)\n\nIt's a fictional novel about how a far right fascist might rise to power in America. Effectively it's a book about what a Nazi political takeover looks like. It's startlingly similar to the Trump movement.",
