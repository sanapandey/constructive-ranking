                    "body": "The one thing I dont get about the PSL is their desire to abolish nuclear energy.\n\nMy understanding is this:  \nModern reactors are incredibly safe, can be constructed much cheaper than we currently allow (due to regulatory hold-overs from ancient reactor designs), and importantly, is the only carbon-lite energy alternative which can both (1) work with the current design of our transmission infrastructure and (2) meet the needs of an increasingly energy-hungry world (the climate collapse is inevitable, and maintaining livable cities is going to require a LOT of energy). Being anti-nuclear today feels like... idk, living in the 1980s and being anti-airliner because of all the plane crashes in the 20s and 30s. Modern reactors are about as similar to contemporary reactors as a gameboy is to your iphone.\n\nWhat I feel like a solution should look like:  \nNuclear should of be supplemented by renewable energy (and eventually, the other way around). One of our top, non-negotiable goals to slow the climate crisis should be to shut down every fossil fuel plant ASAP, and nuclear is the fastest alternative. Should we eventually be renewable-centric? Yes. But time is of the essence, and a renewable grid is going to take rebuilding pretty much the whole damn thing. \"Zero carbon in 25 years, replaced with nuclear\" is a LOT better than \"zero carbon in 50 years, replaced with renewables\".\n\nI hate to be kinda \"single issue voter\"y about this, but I've just never head a good argument against nuclear that didn't basically boil down to \"but muh Chernobyl\".\n\n(also sorry for writing an essay at you-- its totally OK if you don't have an answer to this. Just something I've been thinking about for a while, as i've considered joining the PSL)",

If its true, one must admit that Thorium is much cleaner and safer as well as geothermal. It only wasn't used in the US and most countries because it was used to make weapons. I know the PSL is pretty big about ending foreign wars and even if one does not want to do away with nuclear weapons, the US nor Russia need anymore. So the standard nuclear plants don't really hold any advantage over Thorium based reactors now. China is making huge gains on nuclear fusion. Should it ever be sustained long term any fission reactor would be irrelevant. I'm unsure on the Party's opinion, but anyone  should agree the current system is far from the best.",

I'm open-minded to being wrong about fission power, but if their stance is basically \"because fission isn't as good as renewables in an ideal society\" then they're simply being utopian.",

Hopefully there's more to dig into there as it was a large movement with a lot of writing about nuclear energy.\n\nMy basic understanding was that we can't justify building more nuclear infrastructure *under capitalism*, because it's disaster prone and expected to get worse as deregulation becomes an increasingly explicit policy choice. The comparison to air travel is apt; and now we're worried about having a functioning ATC and FAA for the first time in our lifetimes. The difference is that a single plane crash is scary but a single nuclear disaster can poison millions of people.",
