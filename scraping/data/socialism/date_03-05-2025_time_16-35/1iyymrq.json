The USSRs devotion to fighting fascism is unquestionable, as evidenced by the countless works written against it, the sending of aid against the fascists in Spain, whilst in contrast  fascist parties were springing up all over the western world, and signed the treaty out of desperation, in need of time.\n\nThe capitalist nations were never nearly as opposed; fascism obviously never posed any kind of threat near what socialism called for. They only opposed fascism because of its obsession with war and its threat to conquer their own capital, never for any ideological or even moral reasons (otherwise they would have banned fascist parties in their own nations). \n\nIn 1939 though, thinking from the USSRs perspective. It's alone, France and the UK reject its proposals. Germany far outproduces it even despite the success of the five year plans, has far more experience in war. And it's 1939, not 2025. What has Nazi Germany done that is worse than that of the UK, France, or any of the other colonizing nations? The full extent of the horrors of the concentration camps were not known, obviously the wehrmacht had not burned and pillaged its way across the SSRs yet. Fascism was still a relatively nascent ideology, all the Nazis had done was conquer rival capitalist nations, many of whom's crimes via colonialism and imperialism are extremely comparable to the Holocaust. From what the USSR knew back then, the Nazis were not much worse and are arguably not, even today, the worst people around (the British or French might claim that title). The far worse crime, imo, is propping up Nazis _after_ their crimes have been uncovered, as was done by the West, spreading Nazi propaganda during the cold war, accepting thousands of Nazis fleeing persecution for their crimes, recruiting and restoring their power. The USSR did what it did for the sake of its own survival; the west did what they did for the sake of the Nazis' survival and the USSRs collapse. It is only because of countries like the US, UK, and Canada, that Nazism survived past 1945 to this day.\n\nanyways, last point to add: Should signing a treaty with the UK be seen as similarly unacceptable, given its famines in India, role in the slave trade, genocides in Africa? Or the US, with its genocide of the native Americans and segregation that continued even after the Nazis fell that was the inspiration for Nazi racial policies?",

Another facet of the 1939\u201341 Nazi\u2013Soviet partnership was extensive economic and military cooperation, which further undermines the idea of the USSR as consistently anti-fascist. During the nearly two years of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact\u2019s operation (August 1939 to June 1941), Stalin\u2019s government supplied Nazi Germany with huge quantities of vital raw materials and food \u2013 resources that Hitler needed to wage war in Europe. The Soviet Union and Germany signed a major trade agreement in 1940, and a follow-up pact in early 1941, in which the USSR agreed to deliver hundreds of millions of Reichsmarks worth of commodities to the Reich\u200b\n\n\n\n* 1,000,000 tons of grain (feed grain and legumes) to help feed Germany\u2019s population and army,\n* 900,000 tons of oil (fuel and other petroleum products vital for tanks, trucks, and industry),\n* 100,000 tons of cotton, plus huge quantities of metals and other materials \u2013 *500,000 tons of phosphates, 100,000 tons of chrome ore, 500,000 tons of iron ore, 300,000 tons of scrap iron* \u2013 along with smaller amounts of rare metals like *platinum*, and other goods like lumber\u200b\n\nIn total, these deliveries were valued at 650 million Reichsmarks\u200b\n\nThe USSR was essentially propping up the Nazi war economy at a time when Britain and France had cut off German access to overseas supplies. Soviet oil powered German planes and vehicles; Soviet grain fed the Wehrmacht; Soviet iron and chromium helped build Nazi tanks and weapons. Hitler himself acknowledged that the economic pact with Stalin was an enormous boon.",

I think it can be considered a great diplomatic achievement. They did not have to enter into a conflict with a neighbor, and at the same time they gained large territories that were so necessary for the inevitable war with Germany.",

Add Pilsudsky\u2019s ambitions about enlarging Poland even further and yeah, no doubt that getting back its lands and avoiding (how it was seen back then) war with Germany was much more appealing than being the only power on continent that wouldn\u2019t have any sort of a non-aggression treaty with Germans and letting them take all the Polish territories moving the borders further into USSR.",

However, both were on the \"out\" of the European powers; in the USSR's case, this was because of the recent revolution (Which virtually every European power joined in on to try and support the whites in that war) and the simple fact they were a socialist nation and this was viewed as a threat. In Germany's case, the lead-up to Poland obviously put them at odds with the traditional European powers. So the Soviets and the Nazis ended up being each others allies of convenience, with the Soviets supplying a lot of raw material (Oil - and IIRC, iron) to the Nazis, and even helping in Poland. Additionally, Stalin did this because he wanted to postpone a war with Germany for as long as possible - he did not believe the red army was prepared to fight the Nazis. \n\nEven at the time, this was not viewed as a long-term alliance by the Allies - after the invasion of Poland, the Allies notably refused to declare war against the USSR despite doing so against Germany, under the belief that declaring war against the USSR would lose a future ally against Hitler - a correct assessment, as history proved. This was despite Poland demanding that the Allies should declare war on the USSR as a matter of their defense treaty and the obvious fact the USSR aided Nazi Germany.",

The Soviet Union had no interest in aiding Germany's goal of turning Eastern Europe into \"living space\" for Germans and exterminating millions of Jews, Romanis, Slavs, disabled people, communists, etc., in a Holocaust. The Red Army did enter Polish territory while Poland was in the midst of being invaded by the Germans, but the USSR did not do this to help Germany defeat Poland, which was already on the cusp of losing Warsaw. They did it to redraw their borders at the Curzon Line and to avoid conceding space to the Germans. The Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was not an alliance but a non-aggression pact in which both sides agreed to tolerate each other, provided they did not cross certain lines and continued their trading relationship. The USSR wanted to protect Czechoslovakia from falling into German hands, but the Munich Agreement prevented this, so the Soviets had to strike a deal with the Germans, in which the Germans promised not to cross the Curzon Line or interfere with Soviet foreign policy regarding Moldova, the Baltic States, and Finland. The Germans agreed to this because, after Poland, their priority was to deal with Norway and France first, and they wanted to secure the eastern flank for the time being.\n\nA forgotten aspect of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact is how it disrupted the Japanese army\u2019s plan to invade Siberia in what would have been a two-front war alongside Germany. Instead, Japan shifted its strategy towards expanding in the Pacific when Germany signed that non-aggression, it eventually led to the Soviet Union signing a neutrality pact with Japan in 1941.",
