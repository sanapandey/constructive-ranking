Idk too much about dsa or psl as far as organizing but they both ran presidential campaigns which is good for spreading revolutionary ideas but it also seems like they could be reformists. Try em out and see what feels right though",

All of these groups have chapters in the same big city in my state that I live about 2ish hours from so I guess I\u2019ve got a lot of research to do. Thanks!",
