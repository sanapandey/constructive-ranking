We line up for lunch and as everyone reaches for their mandatory pint of milk we notice the chocolate milk is gone. When we ask we\u2019re told \u201cwe\u2019re not doing chocolate milk anymore, sorry kids.\u201d\n\nNow everybody\u2019s pissed, we\u2019d watched for a few years as our lunches got worse and worse before becoming barely edible but we still had our chocolate milk, our one little sweet treat during the school day, and that made it all worth it, and they DARE take that away from us?\n\nThe first day, we\u2019re all just mad, angrily sipping our low-fat and skim and 2% milk pints. The second day though, something started. Now some kids would usually put their unopened milk over by the dishwasher, it\u2019d still get thrown out after lunch if someone needed it during lunch they could take it. This was our great weapon. \n\nNow lunch was served with two grades split between the cafeteria. 8th ate with 7th, 6th with 5th. The 8th graders told the 7th graders \u201cdon\u2019t drink your milk. Just put it in the milk spot by the dishwasher.\u201d The 7th graders who had friends in 6th grade passed the message on to them, and the 6th graders told the 5th graders. \n\nDay one of this little milk strike, the pile of unopened milk pints was bigger than usual. What was usually less than a dozen milks became about twenty. This strike went on for two weeks and by the second Friday the milk pile had grown into a mountain. I have a distinct memory burned into my head of the poor cafeteria lady trying to pull the huge pile of milk closer to herself so she could throw it away (shout out to the cafeteria women, yall were troopers). \n\nBut after that final Friday, we had our weekend, came back Monday ready to continue our great milk strike when we hear it, the announcement that had the entire middle school wing cheering. The principals voice sounds over the speaker as he did every morning, and he almost sounded impressed with the students. The first thing he announced that morning was that we had our chocolate milk back in the cafeteria. I could hear the 8th graders below me roaring like they\u2019d won the Super Bowl, my 7th grade wing was the same, the 6th and 5th graders in the next wing over cheering. We had won.\n\nAt lunch we lined up and everyone got their chocolate milk. It was a different brand called TruMoo, it didn\u2019t taste as great, it was a healthier reduced sugar chocolate milk, but it was still good chocolate milk and a reasonable compromise for a bunch of middle schoolers to settle for. \n\nThey took a bunch of stuff off the lunch menus over the years, up into high school they took away Friday Subway sandwiches and the ice cream freezers, but no one in that entire school system touched the chocolate milk again. \n\nSo yeah, as the kid who was always \u201cWoke\u2122\u201d what radicalized me was my first ever protest and collective action.",

            "body": "I was firmly Socialist from my teens during the Thatcher years in the UK.\nWhat really radicalised me was the 2002/03 UK firefighters strike.\nAs a young, union official in the FBU (Fire Brigades Union), I spent much of my time rallying my brothers and sisters taking strike action, talking to people in our community, and *trying* to get our message out to the media.  What transpired was a valuable lesson in Class consciousness, Solidarity, Propaganda, and State repression.\nMy Fire Station was situated between a very wealthy, urban area, and a socially deprived, urban area.  Whilst on picket duty, we would get so much abuse from privileged fuckers driving past our station shouting from their fancy cars, \"get back to work, I'm paying your fucking wages\", was a favourite.  There was an extraordinary amount of people who thought you still get paid when you strike!\nAt the same time, on Giro Day (the unemployed used to receive a cheque every two weeks which they would cash at a local post office), people from the poor estate would cash their giros, and then come to our picket line offering us sometimes \u00a320, which was a huge chunk of their benefits.  we would, politely, turn them down, only to ask that they could pick us up a packet of biscuits to share from the local store.  As John Steinbeck stated many years ago. When you are in need, go to the poor people.  They (sometimes unconsciously) understand Class consciousness and Solidarity better than most.\nDuring the strike, anyone who chooses to scab, knows not to try and cross a firefighters picket.  This was due to a tacit agreement between firefighters and the government that *if* rescues were required, then firefighters on picket duty would ride their station appliances and carry out rescues.\nEvery single rescue that was carried out during the National strike was performed by striking firefighters leaving the picket line and serving their community.\nThe government knew this, as did the media.  Their response to our actions was very telling.\nDuring the strike, the military were drafted in to perform firefighting duties.  The navy supplied engineers to wear breathing apparatus, and the army supplied squaddies to firefight, externally.  They were under-resourced, and woefully under-equipped, but still did their best.  Any time we saw the military going to an incident we would wave and applaud them, as a way of showing our appreciation and Solidarity.  \nIn our city, we took a large donation of doughnuts to the local barracks where the military were being housed.  Approached by a very nervous sentry, we offered our cakes and our words of appreciation for their actions.  The sentry, relaxing, informed us that they had been instructed not to try and fraternise with the firefighters as we were likely to attack them!  A ridiculous slander, but pernicious Propaganda nonetheless. \nAs mentioned earlier, all rescues were carried out by striking firefighters, and when the military arrived, the incidents were handed over to them when no life risk was present.\nIn late 2002, the UK, serving as the lapdog of its US imperial master, was gearing up to the illegal invasion of Iraq.\nThe government and the press had a field day, portraying the evil firefighters stopping our brave military from preparing for wholesale slaughter, and went as far to imply that we, the firefighters, were materially supporting terrorism by our actions!\nThe entire print media (notable exceptions of the Morning Star, and the Daily Mirror), the TV media, and every single Government Minister with an opinion, turned out so much Propaganda that really ground away at our resolve.  The refusal to print any of our statements, or refusal to interview striking firefighters was down to the UK government's use of their draconian 'D notice' system.  This is where the government asks the media to not run stories that are considered against \"National interest\".  It's bullshit, but very effective, particularly in a country with a supine, sycophantic media, and an Establishment that hates a conscious Working Class.\n\nUltimately, we were forced to settle our dispute just as the US/UK commenced their \"Shock and Awe\" massacre of over 1 million Iraqis.\n\nI learned that the Establishment and their media will lie, threaten, besmirch, and outright silence any acts of dissension.\nThat a well respected section of society will be painted as terrorists if it suits state objectives.\nAnd that the Working Class has more class consciousness than it realises, and that;\nSolidarity, and Mutual Aid are key in protecting and liberating our communities in current and future struggles.  \u270c\ufe0f\u270a\ufe0f",

She's amazing for doing it and was bettering herself, but we all struggled and suffered and it shouldn't be like that.",

I remember reading an article saying they offered to turn Bin Laden over and Bush refused.\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/14/afghanistan.terrorism5\n\n\nI remember wondering how we could rationalize a full scale war over a terrorist attack that killed a few thousand, and why we didn't just have the trial and work with the Afghans to get this guy.\n\n\nThen came Iraq. And that made no sense to me. Why couldn't a country get WMD? We had WMD. I had also read about sanctions against Iraq from before killing kids. I didn't get it, and then we illegally invaded. And there were no WMD.\n\n\nThis went on and on (Syria, Libya, etc), radicalizing me against the govt. I realized they just BS us into war, and that nobody is allowed to ask obvious questions about proportionality. I asked myself how many foreign lives are worth 1 American life? Has anyone quantified it?\n\n\nWell, then came Ukraine. And in doing some reading about the USSR, I learned that most of what I had been told about Lenin and Stalin was garbage. And then came Gaza, where our country went full mask off genocide.\u00a0\n\n\nThat, coupled with the concentration of power, and examining what drives these wars and why our govt is so nasty to developing countries all over the world led me to the inescapable fact that Lenin was right about imperialism and capital. That is the only explanation. Then, I read and learned more and was even more grossed out by everything the US did, and I realized our country betrays the idea it sells us, going all the way back to its founding when the rich slavers threw Thomas Paine under the bus.\n\n\nPeople/things to look up:\nSchool of the Americas,\nKorean War,\nVietnam War and bombing of Cambodia and Laos,\nOperation Paperclip,\nOperation Northwoods,\nMKUltra,\nThomas Sankara,\nPatrice Lumumba,\nAnd then, I recommend reading some of the works of Stalin and Mao before blindly accepting narratives about them.\n\n\nAfter that, it would be interesting to see how anyone can defend what we do.\n\n\nOh yeah and there are many ways to the conclusion capitalism is the issue, not just antiwar. You could be an environmental or human rights activist like Greta, or someone who cares about giving everyone healthcare. You could be a labor activist in a union fighting for worker rights. There are tons of paths that eventually lead to the inescapable conclusion that capitalism is the problem. The profit and greed drives the wealthy to exploit, steal, and dominate in the most heinous and violent of ways to sustain this machine.",

I was born into post-USSR poverty but saw a drastic change in our life quality when my parents could move to Western Europe with their academic degrees. While growing up, I adopted their right-leaning views, which intensified during the emergence of the alt-right movement a decade ago. It's not hard to look back now and see why I had a very shallow view: USSR = socialism = bad life, and West = capitalism = good life.\n\nTwo things shifted my views towards the center about seven years ago. Firstly, university taught me to read scientific research, to look for sources, and to judge results and conclusions based on their quality. Knowing how research and experiments work revealed that the likes of Ben Shapiro and others really lacked any kind of evidence or substance. They sound smart, but are dishonest and don't really make any valid points.\n\nSecondly, I discovered creators like Contrapoints, Three Arrows, and Shaun. People that DO back their arguments with cited sources, unlike the alt-right figures I used to follow. Not only that, they present their arguments very logically and had such a different tone compared to alt-right content. Creators on the left presented arguments and information to educate people, while the alt-right creators I used to follow only intended to humiliate people. At that point I couldn't support my viewpoint anymore because it would be intellectually dishonest and against anything I learned at university.\n\nOver the past six or seven years, I've learned a lot more about the history of slavery, colonialism and Native American experiences too. It's only been about half a year since I've been taking a dive into socialism. First exploring different aspects of USSR and socialist history, and now more deeply into the actual theory. While I wouldn't say I'm \"fully\" radicalized yet (though getting close to it), I find socialist theory a lot more compelling than the capitalist narratives I believed in. I'd say that currently, I'm unlearning many assumptions I have about the world and developing a more nuanced understanding, particularly about Western interference in socialist countries, the notion of capitalist realism and the idea that humans are natural barterers.",

These people stood for the injustice of the inequality of economic outcomes and were being brutalized for it.\n\nYears later I actually learned what socialism was while studying philosophy. Bernie's brand of democratic socialism also really ressonated with me. The Trump administration angered me, and here I am.",

I was just getting out of high school and realized I didn\u2019t actually believe in what I was saying and the right wing wasn\u2019t for me. So I initially started listening to a few typical American \u201cleftists\u201d and suddenly YouTube suggested a channel I had never seen before \u201csecond thought\u201d and I was intrigued so I watched and listened. And at the same time I was also playing video games about automation and logistics and realized that the current system of the world isn\u2019t scalable in a way that would be sustainable on a larger scale than what we have now. My dreams are a space faring civilization and to possibly have to deal with the same issues as now but on a larger and more dystopian level would be sole crushing. I knew I had to think about what I actually wanted and a system that supported a possible complete automation of workforce. Communism is the end game with the interim of socialism and having scalable efficient systems and institutions is key. But another big thing was I\u2019m not really a fan of people telling me how to live and think so a more hands off approach to everyday society is ideal at least for me. So really what radicalized me is thinking about the future and realizing we aren\u2019t on the right path for a better world for our kids",
