Much of the rest of the text is the attempt to build a homogenous culture from that mixed multitude--creating shared conceptions of morality, origin stories, common enemies etc. Calling it immoral strips us from having a materialist understanding of how judaism came to be and what was happening in the world at the time of its formation. I recommend Norman Gottwald's \"The Hebrew Bible: a Socio-literary Introduction\" for a marxist  analysis of the writing of the torah.\n\nas a side note, whether any religion is immoral or not doesn't actually matter to me--what's more important is recognizing that it plays a HUGE role (particularly christianity) in US ideology/mental terrain. We have to understand how the ruling class wields religion to bolster their own hegemony and we have to learn how to wield religion to organize our class and win. As Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis explains in \"Poverty and the Bible\", we must work to understand how, \u201cthe Bible\u2014a text replete with references to economic justice and the scourge of indifference to the poor\u2014has been politicized to suggest that poverty is a result of the moral failures of the poor sinning against God, that ending poverty is impossible, and that the poor themselves have no role in impacting their poverty.\u201d \n\nthere is a good section of this article about how religion has been and can be wielded: [https://universityofthepoor.org/changing-minds-mental-fortresses-and-the-6-rs-part-4-of-6/](https://universityofthepoor.org/changing-minds-mental-fortresses-and-the-6-rs-part-4-of-6/)",

A jewish zionist won't be swayed by that, they'll probably feel attacked. As american jews, we are so heavily propagandized from an early age to have israel be part of our identity that they might think you're calling them a nazi. \n\nI would also add on that for any organizing conversation (which is essentially what OP is asking for help in doing), you need to listen to the issues of the person you're talking to. If they don't feel heard, they won't listen to you either. So it needs to be an actual conversation, not just sending a message on instagram. If they seem open after an initial conversation, offer to read and discuss something with them. Maybe watch the film israelism with them. Idk, but working class people can and do change their hearts and minds--but it's always built from a relationship and never from sending a few sentences over instagram.",

Answer: It wouldn't!\n\nThat tends to lead to a bit of a realisation that ethnonationalist states are inherently racist. At that point bring it back to a one secular, democratic (or socialist if they're that way inclined) state solution which treats all of it's citizens equally. They might not like the idea but you have to keep referencing to the humanity of the marginalised people. Use the liberation of Apartheid South Africa as an example for this point.\n\nIf they try to argue that Israel is democratic or secular then the counterpoint is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law%3A_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People aka 'Israel's Basic Law 2018' which gives Jewish people rights over all other religious groups (Right to return etc).\n\nIt'll give them something to think about if nothing else.

Convinced that the whole world is lying\n\nBecause it is based on the same type of religious indoctrination. To be absolutely fair to the Jewish people large parts of the world have actually plotted against them before. In these case I find leaning into it can sometime work as you won't go up against the instant denial which is the most difficult defense. \n\nSo ask them how they feel about the richest man in the world giving a nazi saulte to the most powerful one and nobody really batting an eye? And how come these guys are totally behind zionism? Do you really think they have your best interest at heart? after they are done deporting mexicans so you really not think that Jewish people will be next? Zionism is will be used a trap because now nobody will care about the another genocide after we got everyone to ignore the last one and undermined every international body set up to monitor and prevent it. \n\nThere are verses from the old testament, I can't remember exactly but it was about the punishment of the people at the fall of Nineveh and how nobody pitied them after what their cruelty wrought. This can work on the more religious. \n\nIf they deny the salute then embarrassment in front of family and peers can work. This worked on my father when he began to spout some anti science bullshit, I physically removed all of the technology that he is utterly dependent on even his glasses and refused to give it back until he begged, while I explained the science behind the tech he needed, he was very angry but it did work. Perhaps you could ask them very publicly to do the same gesture or something similar I hope even zionist would balk at this.",

But in general there\u2019s hardly any copy paste that will snap anyone from one deeply held opinion to the other.

But this is largely out of your control, and unrealistic.\n\nLong term strategy involves achieving mutual understanding, which requires sacrifice, patience, genuine curiosity, and more patience. Why do they believe what they believe?\n\nAnother long term strategy involves being willing to lose the relationship and wear them down over time with repeated relevant questions and counterpoints. Maybe your copy paste boilerplate is handy for repeatedly hammering the same point, but it\u2019s only effective over time if you don\u2019t get blocked.\n\nMy point is\u2026 there\u2019s no singular copy paste blurb that will work, only dogged persistence, conviction & patience.  It\u2019s an investment to which you might never get a return, because this person has others around them reinforcing their views.
