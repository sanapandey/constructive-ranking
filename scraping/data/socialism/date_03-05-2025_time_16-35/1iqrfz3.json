    "selftext": "I read multiple calls to international worker solidarity all over socialist websites to fight the rise of fascism in the world today. However, in my experience I see Nationalism among workers to be a far more powerful force. I think it was Orwell in one of his political essays who pointed to the fact that socialists underestimated nationalism in their struggles for international cooperation. I can\u2019t see any solutions to nationalism rearing its head every time when society is in a crisis. \n\nThoughts?\n\n ",

            "body": "It was the combination of socialism and nationalism that made Marxism-Leninism a powerful force in the 20th century, propelling it within the oppressed and underdeveloped nations of the world, where alliances were made between the proletariat and national-bourgeoisie to complete progressive national tasks, an example is New Democracy in China, or the alliance between islamist-nationalists and communists in Palestine today. Nationalism is bourgeois, and so is the right to self determination, but bourgeois is not the same as \"bad\", even though they have to eventually be completely liquidated as a class.\nI can\u2019t see any solutions to nationalism rearing its head every time when society is in a crisis.\n\n>I can\u2019t see any solutions to nationalism rearing its head every time when society is in a crisis. \n\nWhat do you mean by \"nationalism rearing its head\"?",

Canadian ruling class is mobilizing workers against American capital to increase their slice of the pie, that\u2019s what nationalism really is, one countries bourgeoisie using the workers as a class against the bourgeoisie of another country and their army of workers. \n\nIf you read the Canadian subreddits they are mad at Americans, they are doubtful of the Americans who come in and say \u201cI\u2019m a victim here too,\u201d and they blame Americans for the actions of their bourgeoisie, which everyone here knows they are not responsible for. \n\nThe response could be so much more powerful if the working class through the world boycotted American products and organized strikes against production at American companies and organized the workers at companies run by the bourgeoisie. They are working to end the legal right of Americans to strike, but they can\u2019t function without the workers and ultimately we all know might makes right. Legal or not, a broad walkout targeted at specific companies or industries is going to be effective.\n\nIf the American and Canadian workers worked together it wouldn\u2019t even matter what the elected rulers of those nations were doing, no one could stand up against the power and influence of a united working class.",

National liberation and the type of chest beating Maga nationalism going around at the minute are two different things. National liberation can of course be used as a way to combat the type of nationalism espoused by fascists. In the North of Ireland for example the provisional IRA utilised national liberation as a unifying principle to gain solidarity and support against the British Loyalists. Times of crisis tend to draw up big emotions in people, if you can redirect their sense of nationalism towards national liberation and against the Fascists Turing people against each other it could be a good way to gain more support for the labour movement.",
