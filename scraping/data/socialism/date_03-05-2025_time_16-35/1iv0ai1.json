    "selftext": "I have this thought every once in a while about the very real possibility that Trump or Musk has never had to do any type of chore or physical maintenance other than maybe brushing their own teeth. I also have wondered why others don't bring this up when talking to regular Americans, esp those who go hard for MAGA. Seems like a really easy way to kind of shatter an illusion. Must admit I've never brought this up to anyone else other than fellow socialist/communists. \n\n  \nTBH this question kind of haunts me. I cannot imagine living a life where I didn't have to do chores as a child. I can't imagine how not having to do the most basic of chores at a young age must shape you and your world view. ",

They are functionally not the same as everyday Americans. \n\nHow can we expect them to be the same as us and to hold the same values? \n\nHave they ever had to Penny pinch? Have they ever had to drive their own vehicles and been late to work because of traffic to get yelled at? Have these people ever had to wait on the side of the road? Hoping that a kind stranger would jump their car? \n\nThere is no relating to the ultra wealthy. They exist on a different planet.",

They can live their entire lives without having to meet a \"real\" person sometimes. They can completely censor all the evidence of their wrong doings out and take in the medias narrative that they, in fact, are heroes and victims of the rest of us and our regulations and basic human needs.\n\nWe need to start conveying this as part of the message we are spreading.

I feel a lot of sympathy for the children of abusive parents.\n\nTo be clear, I don't feel any sympathy for them as adults. They have the means to get therapy and they choose not to. Instead of having empathy for others, they choose to hurt others. There's no excuse for their horrendous actions. But when they were still children they did not have the ability to get therapy or to get away, and that's why I have sympathy for them when they were children. \n\nIt's tragic that they in turn raise children who are likely to continue to abuse the world. Generational trauma that then causes generational trauma in others, spreading out from itself like ripples in the water.",
