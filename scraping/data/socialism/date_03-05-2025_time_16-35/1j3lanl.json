His recent video on Trump's media performance with Zelensky and the destiny of America (basically saying the same thing he's been saying for a while, now reality just caught up to this predictions, lol) is excellent. Sadly, I feel like Americans are underrepresented in his audience, when the things he talks about would be very helpful to them.",
