    "selftext": "Hi all, new activist here. I wasn\u2019t sure where else to go since a lot of other subreddits relating to activism seem pretty small\u2026 but does anyone have any advice for holding independent community forums? My local representative is refusing to hold a town hall with his constituents, and I want to get some folks together to do something about it. I figure that the louder we get, the harder we\u2019ll be to ignore. \n\nWould I be better off just finding a local organization to work with? I\u2019m really struggling to identify these groups in my area. I don\u2019t even want a protest, per se. Just a forum for locals to express how they feel and get a temperature check for where we\u2019re at. Any insight would be really appreciated. ",
