Finally someone lays it out.  THANK YOU, YANIS!!\n\nThe point is that the leading contingent of the capitalist class has reached the end of their rope.  Their most forward-looking focus now is Assisted Enrichment via Inflation by means of the manipulation of the money supply by the Fed.  And yes, surveillance is part of their capabilities and it will be fully exploited to keep you in line.  But it's all about their wealth and growing it.\n\nSure, there will continue to be sales, new products to bait you, and all the hope and desire they can foster in you.  But the Big Promise of capitalism has hit the wall.  And after this new effort has spent itself out, there is one more strategy for them: take money directly out of your bank account for various  fabricated charges.\n\nThis is it folks.  Organize or surrender to the fascism.",

Usually no contracts or guarantees, just free money to make more money.\n\nAnd I do see tech as an existential threat to privacy and as more avenues for capital to monopolize but if you hear what he's saying, and read other texts about cloud capital, its just monopolies. Online Tech-Platform monopolies specifically. Essentially I think he's referring to the tech being private, but instrumental to markets.",
