From what I know, is that ships that port in Cuba are bared from US ports for 6 months, right? So why won't China use 1 or 2 ships to supply Cuba with what it needs? The Chinese military is already sanctioned by the US, so why if they are the \"entity\" or the official partner dealing with Cuba, there is nothing more the US can do, right?\n\nStuff like solar and wind energy wont make the island more independent and energy secure, while some small factories could supply spare parts needed instead of importing everything, etc.",
