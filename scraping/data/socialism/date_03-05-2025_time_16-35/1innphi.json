    "selftext": "I'll try not to ramble it's my first post. I am 19, non binary and I live in rural Appalachian. As you can guess, it's a very poor area, and most the people here adore the orange man, at least as of now. A part of me hates this place and I think about running away constantly, in an attempt to find friends and community. But the other part of me knows there are people just like me hiding away in this little town, and there is power in finding each other and building community. I don't really have a support system, just a couple friends. Life is hard rn and I prolly need therapy but I don't wanna do anything but make the world better. How can I start making change as a lonely autistic teen? How do I find like minded people locally? How can I make a lifeless town full of old people and dollar generals feel like home?",

            "body": "The unfortunate part (for you) is that rural regions are not usually among the first to awaken to the truth and to welcome change.  And leaving for the big city is more productive in many ways.  In addition, if you're looking for friends and a community of other autistic people, you can often find peer groups and support groups in cities.\n\nYou must lean left if you came to a socialist forum.  And you must realize that rural communities tend to be very right wing.  So be careful.  And finding and connecting with other left-leaning people can be risky in such communities to say the least.  I know because I live in one.",
