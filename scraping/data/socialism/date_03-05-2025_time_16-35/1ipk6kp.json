    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nSo I run an education and community outreach club that has a focus on advocating for activism and anti-capitalism education. I won't disclose the name of the club, but \"Socialism\" is in the name and were based in the northeastern US.\n\nAs part of our community outreach side of our mission, we fundraise for a charity of choice semesterly with baked goods. We sell everything for a dollar and all the funds go a charity.\n\nHistorically we donated to the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund. Last semester we tried something different and donated directly to a family on a go fund me, this was because of conserns of the money not making it to the Palestinian children.\n\nThat brings me to this semester, on the 14th, we're doing it again, but no one has settled on who to donate to. I would like to donate to someone established, such as an organization like PCRF, this is because of our student governement budget office having strict rules and may have to donate to someone established to make the process easier. However, I would also like other options in mind such as go fund mes where we know it'll go directly to someone.\n\nThis also doesn't have to be anything related to Palestine, I am open to other causes.",

They might need the funds and baked food your group can provide as it's hard right now for homeless outreach to gather resources due to the trade war. Alternatively, if there's a Food Not Bombs, you can collaborate with them and organise a potluck event. I know that they are anarchists and not quite MLs, but they take care of the material needs for whichever people they are helping, they usually have low funds.",
