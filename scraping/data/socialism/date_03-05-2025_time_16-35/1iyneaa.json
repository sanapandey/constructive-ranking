I totally understand the sympathy for China here doing right by the Tibetan people in putting an end to a horrendous situation. At the same time, the right to national self-determination has been argued convincingly by many, including many regarded Marxists. The initial liberation of Tibet from the lamas aside, it would seem that indeed, as OkTown663 argues, they should have a right to decide for themselves at this point. After liberating the people of Tibet, one may ask how long is long enough to establish stability and turn over decision-making to the Tibetan people from of the interference of the old ruling class. Is re-educating the working class for generations a legitimate practice before providing for self-rule?",
