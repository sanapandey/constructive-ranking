Every smaller \u201csocialist party\u201d with revolutionary aspirations needs to dissolve and join my party immediately. \u00a0These projects have been a complete failure: pathetic ultra-leftists who have achieved nothing but a meager vegan meal once a month in a public park, thinly veiled national chauvinistic \u201cprogressives\u201d, and pathetic \u201cdemocratic socialists\u201d (have we learned nothing from the failings of the Mensheviks?) begging for scraps from a bourgeois party that feasts off the blood of the worker. \u00a0Get on board with my party or get out of the way. \u00a0If you want a voice in the Communist movement then take part in the internal party democracy of our Democratic Centralist party structure.\n\n2. \u00a0Revolutionary defeatism is even more important now than ever. \u00a0We wished and worked towards the Tsar\u2019s losses in the Great War, but the Tsar and all of Old Russia\u2019s strength was but a gnat compared to the American Empire. \u00a0Lifting a finger to further aid the American war machine is a betrayal to international solidarity. \u00a0Any arguments against a growing fascism such as \u201che\u2019s undermining USAID\u201d or \u201cour military will be undermined\u201d or \u201cbut what about Russia?!\u201d are hiding behind a social chauvinism that cannot be apologized for.\n\n3. \u00a0Anarchist adventurism continues to undermine itself, it is only through the coordinated efforts of the working class through a Communist party guided by the cadres that we will liberate ourselves from these shackles. \u00a0They\u2019ve never succeeded in anything and still in 2025 they still insist upon their infantile \u201cpraxis\u201d.\n\n4. \u00a0The insufficiencies of unionism (and of all ultra-leftist \u201csocialisms\u201d surrounding it) are on full display today. \u00a0At best they have been expressions of worker discontent, at worst they were merely a pen in which worker resentments were allowed to tire themselves out by going in circles. \u00a0Now? \u00a0Now they are a mere echo of what they once were, a memory that we have allowed ourselves to color with rose tinted glasses. \u00a0It is only through the organization of the working class under a disciplined Marxist party organized as a Democratic Centralist structure that the bloodthirsty machine of capital can be stopped.\n\n/scene\n\nI could go on, I think a lot of his broad prescriptions would generally remain the same and he would do victory laps of \u201cI told you so\u201d and \u201cKerensky is at fault\u201d in the footnotes.",

Your feelings are temporary, weather is temporary, lives are finite, even fascism and authoritarian dictatorships are temporary. Empires all eventually crumble. Every building that was once solid and sturdy will eventually return to the earth. \n\nWhat makes humans special is our ability to form meaningful relationships, to organize, to love and to be loved. Do what is fulfilling and meaningful to you. Talk to your neighbours and do things with your friends.\n\nCommunity-level organizing is often overlooked but it\u2019s one of the most important things to do when you\u2019re trying to change a system. Find a local group to organize with. If you don\u2019t see change right away, don\u2019t beat yourself up. You aren\u2019t responsible for this system that pits the working man against his neighbours. In a system based upon oppressing the working class, it\u2019s necessary for the oppressor to create a scapegoat, someone to blame instead of the people truly at fault.\n\nDo only what you can. What is most important right now is prioritizing yourself and your loved ones. Get enough sleep, eat as healthy as you can, and try to go for walks even when it\u2019s hard. You deserve to feel joy even when it feels like the world is against you. \n\nYou will be okay, and remember, one day all of this will be nothing but a chapter in a history book. Grains of sand in the infinite vacuum of time. You may have to live through it, but you can find meaning in your own life, form connections, and make it a life worth living even if the system is against you. The ultimate act of rebellion is persisting and thriving even when the system is against you. \n\nKeep your head up, you will be okay.",

Our agency exists at a certain (difficult to define) level, and while it should be understood as creating a certain minimum responsibility (and we should honor that responsibility), there is absolutely an upper limit to our agency, which is ultimately less than we all wish it was. The true way in which we can change the world without destroying ourselves is to recognize our place in the world , and act in good faith to do what we can to achieve our goals in our time and place.

            "body": "I hope you were concerned before this administration because it certainly didn\u2019t start with them. The difference is that now it\u2019s just in your face.\n\nOur last administration funded a genocide on Palestine and prematurely labeled a pandemic as basically over / safe enough to unmask / vax & relax in the name of late-stage capitalism (because based on the numbers and what has happened since, we should have never unmasked + vax & relaxed.) Liberals vote shamed leftists + Palestinians for refusing to vote for a genocide enabling ex cop who wouldn\u2019t confirm at the bare fucking minimum that she would protect LGBTQ rights. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t, please read up on all of the nefarious things that have happened over the past 8 years, why the two party system is doomed, and did you remember the last time trump was in office, because this has already happened once before. \n\nYou should be scared, and not only because of this administration, but because of every step that has allowed us to get here. \n\nPlease do some reading and research of socialist & communist theory + how the pandemic + prematurely \u201cending\u201d it accelerated fascism / how fascism has always been present in the US - it doesn\u2019t begin and end with a blatantly bigoted admin - it has *been* here. Why weren\u2019t you scared before? That\u2019s the question everyone who is scared now should be asking themselves.\n\n\nOne thing you can do now aside from reading up on socialist + communist theory, Marxism, etc, is masking up again in a high quality, properly fitted  mask (KN95 or higher) and encourage those around you to do the same, because the pandemic never ended, and we participated in fascism by acting like it did. You can educate yourself on the scientific facts of covid-19 because advancements have been made + knowledge has been discovered into year 5 of the ongoing pandemic. You can protect yourself and others from contracting and spreading disease (we\u2019re in a quad-demic of covid-19, flu A, RSV + norovirus + tuberculosis is spreading and bird flu is here.)\n\n\nI made a post regarding this in the other communist sub I\u2019m in. It has some info / podcast recommendations and other good info and recommendations in the comments, please feel free to check it out: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/s/qIoAKhLUT5\n\n\nEdit: \n\nThis isn\u2019t chastisement - this is important information. If someone takes it as chastisement rather than information they can use to empower themselves + others and find resources to self educate - then that\u2019s not my problem. No one said it was a competition. Seems like you\u2019re projecting if you\u2019re reading it that way.",

It does need to be told to new comrades that, yes, this is kind of how it's been.\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to a genuine leftist movement is the Democratic Party's ability to soak in all the energy of new leftists and redirect it down the drain pipe. They moralize every issue and then swear they're the good guys here and our only hope. Then, when it's time for true action, they are complacent. And they've been doing this for multiple generations now. Every election cycle.\n\nIt will always be painful for somebody who's caught up in that to be dissolusioned and finally understand that they've been politically manipulated their entire life. There's no easy way to tell people this. And it does sting quite a bit.\n\nBut the good news is that once the illusion is broken, there is a much *bigger* world of socialist thought and action that has a richer history, a long list of heros, and many many people actively working on genuine change in today's world. Politics can be much more fulfilling than just constantly feeling like it's a one-way street (you give and they take). Just the concept that a person, personally, can be enriched and happy in political action is foreign for most people.\n\nSo, I don't know. Should we not tell people that they're being duped because it might hurt them in the short term?",
