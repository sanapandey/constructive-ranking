    "selftext": "\n\nI grew up near a military base in the south so, suffice it to say, I grew up fairly conservative. Anyways, I started thinking about how I listened  an episode of the Martyr Made podcast (I know, I know) about the Russian Revolution and all the atrocities supposedly committed by the Soviets during the Russian Civil War. Being somewhat sub-consciously brainwashed against communism already, the things I heard in that podcast made me come away with the opinion that the Soviets were worse than the Nazis. \n\nOf course, now I know that was a wild thing to think but I was thinking about that and just cringed. Does anybody else have any wild stuff they believed prior to their turn to the left?",

China has achieved this despite the hostility and punitive measures directed towards it by the Global North. Similarly, Cuba has overcome/endured a US embargo to deliver a better quality of life for workers throughout its history than almost all carribean countries.
