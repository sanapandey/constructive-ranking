    "selftext": "Gorbachev Introduced glasnost and perestroika to reform the Soviet system. These policies inadvertently eroded the ideological and institutional foundations of the USSR, accelerating its collapse. His policies of liberalization unleashed an economic chaos that the Soviet system was not able to contain.\n\nToday, Trump is pursuing a similar, if ideologically inverted, disruption of the US institutions. Attacking the deep state, undermining trust in media and elections, and prioritizing loyalty over expertise. He\u2019s enacting a purge of the permanent bureaucracy under the guise of draining the swamp, feeding off polarization and institutional distrust. These policies erode the very stability of the system paving the way to an unravelling akin to that of the USSR.\n\nGorbachev inherited a stagnant economy that he attempted to fix using market reforms with perestroika. These reforms took form of a shock therapy with sudden price liberalization, fiscal austerity, and privatization. An economic collapse followed as a result of hyperinflation, economic instability, and the rise of an oligarchic class. Similarly, Trump is busy slashing regulations and cutting corporate taxes, fuelling short-term growth that deepens wealth inequality and corporate consolidation. Like Gorbachev, he\u2019s ushering in a polarized economic landscape where faith in the system is rapidly dwindling among the public.\n\nThe economic unravelling of USSR revived nationalist movements, particularly in the Baltics and Ukraine, that undermined the unifying ideology. Similarly, amplified nationalism, in form of MAGA, is deepening cultural and regional divides in the US. Trump\u2019s rhetoric is rooted in divisive politics. Just as Soviet republics turned inward post-glasnost, prioritizing local grievances over collective unity, so are states like Texas, Florida, and California are increasingly talking about breaking with the union.\n\nGorbachev\u2019s reforms set the stage for Yeltsin who presided over the chaotic privatization of state assets, enabling a handful of oligarchs to seize control of Russia\u2019s oil, gas, and media empires. The shock therapy transition to capitalism led to a rapid rise of the kleptocrats. Similarly, Musk\u2019s companies target the remaining public services and industries for privatization. SpaceX aims to replace NASA, Tesla/Boring Co. are going after infrastructure, while X is hijacking public discourse. In this way, his wealth and influence mirror Yeltsin-era oligarchs\u2019 grip on strategic sectors. The main difference here is that Musk operates in a globalized capitalist system as opposed to the post-Soviet fire sale. Musk is actively using his platform and wealth to shape politics in his favor, and much like Russian oligarchs, he consistently prioritizes personal whims over systemic stability.\n\nYeltsin was sold as a democratic reformer but enabled a predatory elite. Many Russians initially saw capitalism as liberation, only to face a decade of despair as the reality of the system set in. Similarly, Musk markets himself as a visionary genius \u201csaving humanity\u201d with his vanity projects like Mars colonization, yet his ventures depend on public subsidies and exploitation of labor. The cult of the techno-oligarch distracts from the consolidation of power in private hands in a Yeltsin-esque bait-and-switch.\n\nThe USSR collapsed abruptly, while the US might face a slower erosion of its institutional norms. Yet both Trump and Gorbachev, despite opposing goals, represent disruptive forces that undermine the system through ideological gambles. Much as Gorbachev and Yeltsin did in their time, Trump\u2019s norm-breaking and Musk\u2019s oligarchic power are entrenching a new era of unaccountable elites.\n\nMarx was right! History repeats, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.",

            "body": "Good analysis, in my opinion. Just to add: I have commented elsewhere that, while some people continue to place their hopes in certain American institutions (the FBI, military, etc.) to rescue us from the madness, those organizations are deliberately fashioned as apolitical arms of the State. The same was true of the Soviet KGB, Party, and military, which lacked independent political agendas and identities which might have seen them confront Gorbachev (ordinarily a great and deeply desirable guarantee against instability). When the 1991 coup did happen, it was likely doomed from the start: poorly conceived, badly organized, and perhaps above all far too late; a reflection of how ill-suited and unprepared these institutions were to intervene against what was effectively a concerted and sustained effort to dismantle the state from the top down. I expect the same is true of the US. No one will come to save us from above, and if they do one day try, it will likely only accelerate the collapse.\n\nSo far, the only distinguishable potential saving grace for the US system is the courts (Congress has apparently ceded its own powers to Trump without a fight) but even those are greatly ideologically compromised and anyway depend on executive acquiescence to their rulings, lacking any independent enforcement mechanism of their own. I have serious doubts how long and how effectively they can act as a bulwark against the ongoing and rapid consolidation of power by Trump/Musk.",

Marxism is science.\n\n\u201cIn direct contrast to German philosophy which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, we do not set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and on the basis of their real life-process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life-process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life-process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. **Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness**, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence.\u201d [The German Ideology](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm)\n \nMarx lumps ideology in with religion and metaphysics, but omits to list science. Why? ideology is false, it is produced by class society and thus obscures the true essence of reality.

It is not just one of many worldviews to choose from at a buffet. \n\nYou should probably read [Materialism and Empiro-criticism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/), which will explain the Marxist theory of knowledge in much more depth, or [Where do Correct Ideas Come From?](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_01.htm) for a simple intro.",

I encourage you to read the texts you linked yourself and not just memorize phrases from them, but actually take the effort to understand what they're saying and how it apply that to your reasoning. Simply memorizing and regurgitating terms does not constitute as thinking. \n\nAn ideology encodes the fundamental values, norms, and beliefs that guide perception, decision-making, and interaction within the society. It's a system of values and assumptions that shapes how an individual perceives and interacts with the world. These are conceptual frameworks through which we interpret events, evaluate information, and form opinions.\n\nIdeologies rooted in the material conditions of a society, particularly its economic structure. The way in which goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed guides the evolution of the dominant ideology. This relationship between material reality and ideological constructs can be understood through the concept of base and superstructure. The base refers to the economic foundation of society, encompassing the forces and relations of production. The superstructure encompasses the cultural, political, and legal institutions that arise from this economic base. While the superstructure can influence the base, it is the economic base that plays the dominant role.\n\nCapitalism brought with it a shift in the economic base, characterized by industrialization, wage labor, and private ownership of the means of production. Marxism is an ideology that arose as a way to understand capitalist relations in a scientific manner.",
