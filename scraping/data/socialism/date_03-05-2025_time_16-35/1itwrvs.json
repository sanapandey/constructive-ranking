    "selftext": "The phase when an organism breaks down its own muscles and organs just to stay alive.\n\nSame here. What we witness with the gutting of social services and the very fabric of government under a de-facto kleptocratic ruler who wants to establish a nepotic dictatorship is what may have been the natural evolution of Capitalism all along: Its Catabolic phase.\n\nAny profits flowing to the rentier class are now from the destruction of other's standard of living and any accumulated wealth: Inflation, gutting of regulations meant o avert abject slavery and wage theft, pollution and corruption.\n\nThe masks are off... the true nature of the beast is for all to see. And there is no such thing as Eco-anything and Friendly whatever in this system. In the dialectic process we are now witnessing the synthesis of Feudalism and Capitalism, which will inevitably create a revolutionary reaction. In this last phase I believe the very nature of the Capitalistic system achieves its true expression and balance. That of a Cancer eating its host.\n\nAnd like a Cancer it needs to be treated ASAP or else the host dies.\n\nLike I suspect we may jump to either primitive Communism if a nuclear war happens (not good) or Communism ushered in through the correct use of technology and AI.\n\nTime is running out.",

Per Entropy 101 more chances of improper usage vs. proper one which requires a conscious effort to manage and control. By orders of magnitude.\n\nI believe of an idealized world represented like here when use of Science is for the benefit of all. Including scientific management of the means of production and resources so everyone gets a fair share and benefits and where greed and our tribal impulses are finally kept in check. The next 10 years will define the next Century... and the next Century the next Million years.\n\n[https://www.pinterest.com/pin/sovietwave--674132637950035057/](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/sovietwave--674132637950035057/)",

They eventually reach a point of too many elites fighting over shrinking profits, so now they must solve the problem. The new elites challenge the old system. Trump isn't new elites, he's in office to sort out his own personal problems; but he's a figurehead to represent Silicon Valley ghouls.\u00a0",
