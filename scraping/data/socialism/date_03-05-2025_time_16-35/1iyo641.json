Those can be about socialism as a political movement, about shared struggles, or about anything else.\n\nHave you recently started a show that deals with patriarchy and which you would like to recommend others to watch? Are you looking for a movie about social movements but don\u2019t know where to start? Watched a new release that you would like to discuss with others? Want to take a break from everything and just relax watching a movie but can't decide which one to choose?\n\nPlease share it with us!\n\nYours in solidarity, until the robots rebel.\n\n\\- Automod",

Amazing movie, and one of the stories that prompted me to be \"radicalized\" aka undo capitalist indoctrination. \n\n\n\nNot a movie but Severance is a masterpiece. Not explicitly anti capitalist but an interesting and meaningful exploration of things like corporatocracy, workplace ethics, the isolation created by the automization of work, etc",
