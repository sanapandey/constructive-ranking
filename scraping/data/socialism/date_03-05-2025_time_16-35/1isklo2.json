From what I\u2019ve seen, it seems like it\u2014considering that its main goal is to introduce the proletariat to communism. I could be wrong though. What do y\u2019all think?",

But it's not the best introduction, because no, it was not written to be a good introduction to socialism for workers in any place or time. It is only even secondarily concerned with convincing the average worker in Western Europe in 1848 (when it was written); it's primarily intended for a contemporary, politically active audience to help differentiate the Communist League from other flavors of socialism, few of which are still around.\n\nIf you're absolutely starting from scratch, I recommend more digestible content like youtube videos from Richard Wolff or Second Thought. For example, Wolff's fantastic \"Introduction to Marxism\" lecture:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Whccunka4\n\nIf you're somewhat more familiar with Marxist ideas, and want to start reading Marx & Engels directly, I highly recommend starting with \"Principles of Communism\", and then \"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\":\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm",

I\u2019d follow it up with What Is To Be Done by Vladimir Lenin, this book is slightly longer and goes over what communists should be doing to actually organize. Then I\u2019d read Wage, Labor and Capital; Value, Price and Profit; and Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism for a more thorough look at why capitalism is fundamentally exploitative. The next topic I\u2019d explore is dialectical/historical materialism, and the best books for basics on that would be Socialism: Utopian and Scientific; The State and Revolution; and The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. These will get you thinking about society in terms of class and relations to the means of production. Dialectics is a hard concept to fully grasp so I\u2019d follow those books up with the History of Philosophy: A Marxist Perspective by Alan Woods, thats the book that finally made me fully understand dialectics. \n\nAfter that, look into whatever topics interest you the most, like maybe a specific revolution, class dynamics in a specific time period, or look into studying different schools of Marxism like Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Left Communism, etc. Make sure when reading theory that it isn\u2019t just going in on ear and out the other, though. I had a problem with that when I first started bc theory can get a bit boring at times. What I did was start taking notes and using reading guides. Just search up \u201c*whatever book you\u2019re reading* reading guide\u201d and theres usually one for it by this communist.red website. Good luck!",

This book and \"The German Ideology\" used to be sold together as introduction of communism to people.\n\nIf you read the \"Communist Manifest\" you should also read \"The Coquest of Bread\" by Kropotkin because both are focused on how to do the revolution itself.\n\nI would not recommend Lenin, Trotsky, Mao, etc before reading the books mentioned above. They are Marxists but they have theories of their own that is not quite Marxist itself but inspired and oriented by Marxism, and they are more focused on \"create the material conditions for revolution\" where Marx theorized there would not have and where the revolution would not happens at first.\n\nAnd if you read Marxism-Leninism/Maoism and others autoritarians Marxists, you should also read libertarian Marxists/socialists so you can learn and understand the opositores views instead of alienated in only one type of Marxism/Communism.",

Marx isn't the last word on Marxism though, there's been a century and a half of developments in the interim. There are a lot of great thinkers in the last century who built on the ideas Marx first described. It's also worth familiarizing yourself more broadly with history, and even neoliberal theory - know thy enemy.",

            "body": "Marxist theory is divided into three groups describing and criticizing capitalism, developing and building theory IE material dialectics, and describing and advocating for socialism, communism, anarchism, etc. The manifesto is not really a heavy weight in any category.\n\n If you want the capitalism criticism, Lenin's, imperialism the highest stage of capitalism is great. The focus is on global colonial finance capitalism which is closer to what we have today, and it's only 140 pages unlike Kapital. \n\nIf you want something on material dialectics I like Mao's, on contradiction it's a good primer because mao actually had experience writing outside the Western philosophy tradition so I found it is more approachable.\n\nIf you want something to advocate for it's tricky because there has been a persistent struggle to birth communism into the world. But, the anarchists talk, and do, allot about  building alternatives to capitalism so, though I found it incredibly frustrating as Kropotkin just sort of hand waves away criticism and just insists that it won't be a problem. He does lots of ways we could do things by doing things. So conquest of bread is a good resource.\n\nI do think of all of these as primers. You're only going to get them most out of them by continually expanding your knowledge.",

It doesn't really explain socialist theory very well, so if you're already on the commie train and want to educate yourself I'd start with a Marx-Engels reader (there's a bunch of different versions) and also read the State and Revolution by Lenin.",
