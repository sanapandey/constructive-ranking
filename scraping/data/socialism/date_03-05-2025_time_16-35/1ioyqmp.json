With billionaires openly controlling politics and pushing their own interests, it\u2019s becoming harder to ignore that they don\u2019t care about the rest of us.\n\nDo you think more people will wake up to the reality that the system is rigged for the wealthy? Could this presidency be the breaking point that leads to a real movement toward socialism or even revolution?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts - are we reaching a tipping point?",

Technofeudalism is pre-collapse/current, Dark Enlightenment is post-collapse basically. \n\nBut I imagine the USA getting Balkanized in the case of a collapse.

And of course these oligarchs are technocrats\n\nEdit: if anything though they\u2019re concepts that are closely intertwined since Technofeudalism is more or less about the \u201cattention economy\u201d and how we may as well be serfs of this attention economy, which would be used as a distraction from the BS of said \u201cgov-corps\u201d",

But he says them as if he\u2019s an expert so these oligarchs either believe him or at least echo his talking points to fool impressionable people \n\nLikewise it\u2019s pretty damn disturbing to me that an anti-democratic ideology has picked up any steam; when I was younger I always pictured the tech bros as annoying libertarians but now it\u2019s much easier to see them as more nefarious than that. It\u2019s particularly problematic that Peter Thiel is so into it, with how many people he\u2019s brought up and now believe the same bs that he does (eg Zuck lmao)",

The casual cruelty people currently accept as 'normal' (like accepting homelessness as 'normal'), can only be exist so long as people dont see it.

When they don't show up, and they won't, people will get angry. \"What the hell, this isn't supposed to happen \\*here\\*. This is the first world(TM)!\"\n\nA lot of people will turn to fascists to solve their problems, but the fascists don't have a plan to rebuild homes, maintain the energy grid, or keeping people fed. At least not a good plan, or a plan that people will accept as the 'new normal'. All fascists can do is punish scapegoats (and oh boy, they will).\n\nMeanwhile, it'll be impossible for the bourgeoisie to hide the fact that they're mostly interested in building their own safe-houses, compounds, and off-shore retreats. At this point, I have to hope that people start to wake up that the capitalists actually \\*dont\\* have their best interests at heart, and will start ceasing property.\n\nIMO, the biggest question then becomes if the military & police can maintain ranks when its time to open fire on americans on a regular basis or turn people away from breadlines.

The fundamental distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and a dictatorship of the other classes \u2014 landlord dictatorship in the Middle Ages and bourgeois dictatorship in all civilized capitalist countries \u2014 consists in the fact that the dictatorship of landowners and bourgeoisie was a forcible suppression of the resistance offered by the vast majority of the population, namely, the working people. In contrast, proletarian dictatorship is a forcible suppression of the resistance of the exploiters, i.e., of an insignificant minority the population, the landlords and capitalists. \n\n> It follows that proletarian dictatorship must inevitably entail not only a change in the democratic forms and institutions, generally speaking, but precisely such change as provides an unparalleled extension of the actual enjoyment of democracy by those oppressed by capitalism\u2014the toiling classes. \n\n> [...] All this implies and presents to the toiling classes, i.e., the vast majority of the population, greater practical opportunities for enjoying democratic rights and liberties than ever existed before, even approximately, in the best and the most democratic bourgeois republics. \n    \nVladimir I.

Social media is absolutely a good tool for organizing if used effectively, but you are correct that in person also has its advantages. At the end of the day, like you said, we will need to reach people that are not already in the echo chamber or who chance their way into the echo chamber. We need to meet them in our neighborhoods and our workplaces. We are social creatures after all with responses to in-person interactions that cannot be replicated over the Internet. \n\nProtests can also be good, but they can also be wastes of time that just make us feel good. There's lots of ways to analyze a protest for effectiveness, but in general, does it have a defined goal (not just vaguely raising awareness of some issue or another) that can be measured or reflected on after a period of time? If not, how do you know if you wasted your time or not, and how do you know how to improve your tactics in the future? These are all broad questions in general targeted at any organization, not you specifically. Only your group is going to have the on-the-ground data of your situation to know what you should or shouldn't be doing, but the general idea is to have some sort of process whereby you can criticize your tactics to know what went well and what can be improved.",

What, generally speaking, are the symptoms of a revolutionary situation? We shall certainly not be mistaken if we indicate the following three major symptoms: (1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the \u201cupper classes\u201d, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for \u201cthe lower classes not to want\u201d to live in the old\u00a0\u00a0 way; it is also necessary that \u201cthe upper classes should be unable\u201d to live in the old way; (2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; (3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in \u201cpeace time\u201d, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis\u00a0*and by the \u201cupper classes\u201d themselves*\u00a0into independent historical action.\n\nWithout\u00a0these objective changes, which are independent of the will, not only of individual groups and parties but even of individual classes, a revolution, as a general rule, is impossible. The totality of all these objective changes is called a revolutionary situation.\" - The Collapse of the Second International\n\nWe're definitely at a point where us a good portion of us subjugated folks can't tolerate the current state of things, and we're arguable fast approaching a situation where a large portion of the ruling class are unable to live in the old way. What I think is less promising is the requisite political activity of the masses. It's certainly increasing, but I am not convinced that they are politically active in a revolutionary way, due in large part to the lack of a coherent and strong left in the US. If this truly is a revolutionary moment, though, and we the masses are not prepared, history shows that that tends to lead to full-blown fascism. Don't forget that it can still get much worse on both an acute and systemic level.\n\nBut hey, I'll love to be wrong.",

There\u2019s no reason we need the most marginalized to be sacrificed when they most often LEAD the revolution. \n\nThis idea that the world must experience Armageddon only for utopia to arrive afterwards due to glorious socialist/communist revolution is unpacked Christian End of times wrapped in class reductionism. \n\nCurrently women are fighting the class war by fighting for their right to bodily autonomy and their right to vote after they\u2019ve changed their last name. \n\nAsk yourself? Would you be willing to accept universal healthcare if trans people couldn\u2019t transition? Or immigrants weren\u2019t included? If so, then I\u2019m sorry but it leaves room for the exceptions to grow until it becomes dysfunctional and people are convinced to get rid of it. \n\nThis accelerationism is a way to ignore the harm that is occurring to minorities currently. Class reductionism is inherently against class solidarity. And the punitive reaction to people that aren\u2019t pushing for revolution in the immediacy is a deeply disturbing idea that just shows you (general) want violence more than you want change. \n\nThe black panthers were targeted for many reasons INCLUDING free breakfast programs. So ask how you can donate your labor? If you can\u2019t donate your labor, how can you donate your resources? If you can\u2019t donate your labor/resources, how can you donate your voice? \n\nThe revolution will not be bloody FOR YOU until the very last moments. So how will you spend the moments until then? Welcome to the resistance. The welcome package is in the mail.",

Other elements you need are a population who has gained true class consciousness, a party or \"army\" that is fiercely loyal and dedicated to a socialist revolution, and you need that \"army\" to strategically act even within reactionary governments operate.\n\n\nSo as much as it pains me, we do not have the elements in play to cause a revolution.\n\n\nEdit: Feel free to correct me where I am mistaken.
