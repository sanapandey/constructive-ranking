    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been seeing a trend recently of people throwing shade at vintage resellers because they are \u201cmaking clothes for \u201cpoor people\u201d more expensive\u201d. Even the vocabulary alone makes this sentence seem like radlib behavior. \n\nFull disclosure I do vend, and genuinely see value in being able to spot old clothes, wash/restore, style them, make them more accessible in an organized retail setting. What people seem to be getting angry at are people who overprice on items, but I feel like this more bad business practice rather than the industry try itself. \n\nJust wanted some input on what the leftist train of thought on this is. I do understand that the \u201csustainability\u201d economy isn\u2019t the end answer, but don\u2019t entirely see it as a form of greenwashing. ",

            "body": "My advice to you is to stop looking at socialism as a lens from which to be the most virtuous or how to be the least exploitative person on the planet. Obviously there is a difference between being a landlord and reselling clothes and the people who try to conflate the two make it a lot harder to build any kind of momentum around an actual revolution in our lifetime. Socialism is an economic system not a poverty cult and everybody makes some level of sacrifice in order to make a living.\u00a0",

There are massive warehouses brimming with unworn clothes going back decades. Technically, all clothing production could completely cease and humanity would not run out of clothes for several hundred years. Being a clothing reseller is actually a very smart and sustainable business. People get mad that they\u2019re selling the clothes for higher prices than they paid, but I know people who resell and it is actually a skill that requires effort. They drive around to non-picked through thrift shops wayyy out of the city, flea markets, yard sales, etc and they have a good eye for curation, they also have to promote their business on social media to turn a proper profit. People are mad about the prices because consoomerism has made everyone think they are entitled to cheap clothing. Clothing is almost never cheap, we\u2019re used to ultra-cheap clothing because most of it is made with slave labor. \n\nI also hate when people say \u201cUhm if you buy clothes at the thrift store you\u2019re taking them away from poor people.\u201d It\u2019s such a weird and factually incorrect take\u2026 Everyone has always gone to the thrift store, it\u2019s really not a thing to gatekeep. My mom grew up in an upper-middle class family in the 70s and 80s and her and her sisters liked going to the thrift store. It\u2019s like saying that middle-class or wealthy people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to check out books from the library. I think maybe what it actually is is that the rise of online commerce was always inevitably going to make thrifting *harder* than it was a few decades ago and people wanna find some radlib way to whine about it.

Your collection has to look like a cohesive piece of your own personal style, where any of the pieces you have can be put together to create an outfit. It takes true knowledge and appreciation for fashion to do that, and most people just looking to make a quick buck aren\u2019t successful when it comes to \u201ccurating vintage\u201d \n\nWhat your friend is doing seems to be flat out reselling, taking any item possible from the thrift store to upmark.

If they just like the color and don't know that it's Ralph Lauren, that is good enough for me! Also for the fact that clothing is somewhat a necessity and nice clothing can even help people get a leg up. It makes me wonder if its fair for a person shopping for a job interview could get something nice at Salvation Army for $5, but if it's at a curated storefront for $20, are they now priced out? \n\nI will say I think it'd be kind of rad if you got stuff from estate or yard sales in ownership class areas and opened a store in a working class area. I don't know enough about your gig or aim to be able to fully comment on ethics of it. I also just don't know much, or honestly care much, about \"curating vintage.\"\n\nLike another example is my city has two vintage/ resale clothing shops on the same block. One is very curated and feels very gentrified to me, but is fairly popular. The other is kind of chaotic, uses an old register, is black owned by an older lady, is cheaper, but less popular. I personally prefer the later one. It's ran by someone who helped build the area, and the other is by someone who dropped in a few years ago after the block got popular. In the end, they're both contributing positively to my city so I'm fine with both, as long as the gentrification doesn't price out the woman who has been there for decades and helped build that block. And that lowkey is kind of a separate issue and isn't directly the fault of the other vintage store.  \n\nAgain if this is your passion and hobby I'm not gonna die on this hill. Capitalism takes so much joy as it is, and it's certainly not causing catastrophic harm. There are much bigger fish to fry and I'm not the gatekeeper of who is a \"good leftist.\" But where I'm at with my personal politics, I think it's a really hard line to toe, especially as thrifting has become so mainstream. I'm personally not into clothes enough, so between that and feeling like it's questionable, I wouldn't partake. But that's just me!",

I personally think it has dulled the spark for those sorts of activities (exploring and collecting, especially on a budget), but I don't detect anything particularly socialist or non-socialist about it.\n\nClothes are different to books and comics of course because as you say you wash, iron, mend, etc., so you're restoring value.",

Places to even get used clothes is very difficult. The free places are all gone because people were taking so much and turning around and selling them to consignment shops or selling them online themselves. The thrift shops (all 3 of them in 3 different towns,  just a short 45 minutes apart) are open only a few hours during the week in the middle of the day.\nBeing able to go to a thrift shop and buy vintage takes resources and time. It\u2019s a privilege in some areas to have access to thrift stores at all. \nWhile I don\u2019t think reselling is as bad as landlords, I think some people use reselling in a way that can be harmful to others and furthers to promote capitalism over community",
