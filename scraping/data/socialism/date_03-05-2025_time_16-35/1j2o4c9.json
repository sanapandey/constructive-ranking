    "selftext": "Sorry if I worded the title weird but I\u2019m sure you get the idea. I\u2019m starting a communist community/discussion group in south east Nashville (specifically the Bellevue area) for education purposes and to point people in the right direction when it comes to what books to read, where to protest, and an overall safe space for people to freely speak their ideas without judgement. Feel free to dm me if interested. But mainly this post is to ask for good book recommendation about revolution, because we as a group are collectively reading books and discussing them in our meetings. I don\u2019t want this group to be some academic circle jerk of people flexing their knowledge I\u2019m actually trying to help build coalition to help start revolution (that means real activism) if anyone with greater experience has any suggestions I\u2019m more than willing to hear them out.

It's not too long, and some may call it a bit dated, but it was such an effective and prolific tool of revolutionaries that the US army still draws from it when trying to combat guerrilla forces. It's definitely worth a read.",

Ask your local library for books about these specific ones. Theory is good and all but I think it's equally if not more important to see how things shook out when applied to the real world.\n\nFrom my understanding Castro was a prolific writer and often reflected on Cuba's revolution. Could be good to start from there.",
