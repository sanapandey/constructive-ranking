Die Linke gained a lot of support and momentum particularly because of parting ways with Wagenknecht and her supporters and are now ideologically way more united, they would lose exactly that support if they considered working together with BSW again.",

In fact, some consider it a \"hard left\" party e.g.,\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20231024021004/https://www.politico.eu/article/german-politics-sahra-wagenknecht-left-wing-populist-launches-new-party/](https://web.archive.org/web/20231024021004/https://www.politico.eu/article/german-politics-sahra-wagenknecht-left-wing-populist-launches-new-party/)  \n\n\nI'm not sure you can say Die Linke has gained \"a lot\" of support and momentum, either. The infighting caused a big drop in their support (from  9.2% in the 2017 elections to 4.9% in 2021. If the current polls are correct, they have a bit of a late uptick now, but the combined vote of the BSW and Die Linke now is just a bit more than the 2017 results for Die Linke. The split has not really been beneficial.  \n  \nYeah, but I guess Die Linke is ideologically way more united. Like the Wee Free, as the Scots would say. \n\n(FWIW, I joined the Die Linke as an international member in 2019 after prior correspondence and a long visit to their offices in Berlin)",

Their leader is trying to sound a bit more like Trump though, whilst also distancing himself from Trump's foreign policy.\n\nAfD: Right-wing populists with ties to fascist organization, basically German MAGA at this point. Currently shunned by all major parties, though some in the CDU/CSU seem to be ready to start working with them.\n\nSPD: Social Democrats who completely sold themselves out to neoliberal reforms in the 2000s and have since spent most of their time as junior partners to the CDU/CSU. Currently the ruling party.\n\nGreens: Started out as anti-capitalist lefties in the 80s, joined the Social Democrats in their capitulation to neoliberalism in the 2000s, got really big during the climate protests and have since rolled back any slightly radical policies they have ever had. Really big on supporting Ukraine and Israel (like basically all other parties).\n\nLeft: The old East German Socialist Party came together with disappointed former SPD members in the 2000s to found this party. They've become less radical with every passing year, currently they are effectively social democrats with a couple of socialists remaining in the party. Used to be completely anti-war, now kind of split on both Ukraine and Palestine.\n\nBSW: Founded in 2023 by Sarah Wagenknecht, who used to be a leading figure in the Left Party but thought the party cared too much about LGBT people, women's rights and climate action and wasn't anti-immigration enough. Somehow still the most consistently pro-Palestinian party.\n\nFDP: These guys basically just do whatever big businesses want whenever they get the chance.\n\nWorth keeping in mind that a party needs 5% of the votes to get into parliament, so the Left Party, BSW and FDP can't be certain they'll get in yet.",

The biggest problem of the Left Party for the last six or seven years was that the leadership kept getting into public fights with each other. That's over now, Wagenknecht is free to do her anti-woke, anti-migration shtick, and die LINKE is free to carve out a coherent profile to the left of the SPD and Greens. BSW can even do some pro-Palestinian stuff without being held back by the Zionist current within the Left Party. Both of these parties are better off this way.\u00a0",
