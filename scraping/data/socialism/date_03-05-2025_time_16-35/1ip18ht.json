    "selftext": "Why does it seems as if the left grew with the rise of trump? My thread, and a few others have covered this topic. Seems like a hot topic here. I had a thought I don't want to lose while watching this hasan video. It may appear as if this is what has happened in recent history, so it would be safe to assume that's the norm. Fascism grows the left. This isn't what's occurring though. \n\nThe left has grown. Why? Well besides their own organizing efforts, their own motion? We have to understand the role of the democratic party in modern America as a role of false leftism and anti racism used to coopt the energy of mass movements. When this energy is coopted, the democratic party is almost like a false left vanguard that constantly rallies around this energy to win their elections against the Republicans. Outcry against racism and the far right has been heavily utilized by democrats long before trump. Not only would then go on to wage the same policies as the Republicans, and gaslight people about it, but they would support the same policies as the Republicans when they were holding power in office. An example would be how many voted for the Iraq War, but utilized people's mass protest against it to get energy for elections. \n\nOver the years this illusion has been getting destroyed, the veil has been lifting back and the democrats can no longer serve this role with the impactfulness they once had. This creates a vacuum where other forms of organizing begins to be looked towards as alternatives, the true left. The American democratic party can no longer play this role of social control, so they are becoming overtly aligned with the fascism that serves the class interests that drives their party. Even the more liberal progressive groups are now butting heads with the democrats. The push pull gaslighting method of elections doesn't work like it once did in America. ",

            "body": "This development in fascism is unique to the USA because one could accurately say that America is truly a one party system designed to appear like 2 parties. The democrats have lost the grip on the role they served in this one party system. Their response to their own people in hasans clips shows the veil is coming off. It's like when an abuser gaslighter such as diddy gets called out, they go from nice to angry with fire in their eyes, upset that anyone has the gall to critique them.",

We had a populist right-wing government flirting with fascism and isolationism. They were voted out due to their own incompetence and replaced with a bunch of do-nothing centrists who seem to spend more time chastising the left, supporting genocidal governments abroad and trying to appear \"tough on immigration\" than giving working people any real reason to re-elect them in a few years.\n\nThe only thing preventing the equivalent of a Trump 2nd term here is the absolute clownshow of our current right wing parties, they truly are a bunch of unserious, incompetent blowhards and they lack any sort of clear vision or leadership. But when you have people like Elon Musk actively trying to find and finance a new figurehead to lead the Reform Party it's only a matter of time before they find someone that people are willing to elect.",
