    "selftext": "Just a little insight to my life, I'm 21, i live in a relatively rural area in the north of England. it just feels to me that in order for me to even exist it just costs so much money. like senseless amounts of money just going to rent, paying/running/maintaining a car and just the bare necessities. I'm also a uni student and i work part time (all why living in an area that's got a lower cost of living).\n\nI feel like im losing when all i see is people talking about how all these people coming over are ruining the country but how isn't it obvious that most of the major issues we face now are just the result of so many of our governments selling off all public utilities, abysmal investment into any public infrastructure (besides more roads) and a complete disregard for basic economics.\n\nWhy are a small number of people making a massive profit off of the bare necessities that we all need to exist. its unbearable to me that there's a small number of people essentially draining all the money out of our pockets just so we can turn on on the taps or have a roof over our heads, or turn on the lights and worst of all just so we can eat.\n\nHow can so many politicians sit back and watch as everyone is being pushed into destitution?\n\nSupermarkets are making massive profits year on year and yet prices have yet to fall.\n\nHow can i participate in this economy if all my disposable income is just used to simply exist? i have to live frugally just to get by and i can't imagine that's gonna change all that much as life carries on. ill hopefully get a decent paying job from my degree(software engineering) but yet again I'm gonna be bankrupted by rent costs, travel costs, paying back my uni loan for the rest of my life, amongst other taxes and payments i have to make just to live.",

I look around and I either see people fine to live this status quo or people who believe the reasons their lives are so bad is because of minority groups and refugees. They\u2019re all so blind to what\u2019s happening and it terrifies me. \n\nI\u2019m not saying any of this in the sense of wanting to live a lazy and cushy life free of charge. But I want to live with more meaning than just survival, and I want to live for myself. This system doesn\u2019t support that, and I\u2019m not convinced I\u2019d be able to live comfortably outside of it. \n\nI\u2019d consider myself to be privileged to have a job and to live with my parents, there\u2019s people out there who don\u2019t have either of those. But I think it\u2019s also providing me more insight into why I\u2019m so tired of life. I\u2019m working a job to save money so I can move out, but to find work and affordable living feels so impossible. And to think that the company I work at will likely make people redundant to save costs instead of taking pay cuts from those who run it just angers me. Everything is just so selfish and inherently wrong, and I feel like everyday we\u2019re living in a nightmare of a world that\u2019s run on a system that shouldn\u2019t exist, for it will never have our benefits in mind.

Most of the US is very much the same.\n\nFor your own well-being and future, I would highly advise you to leave the UK for a country that has not been 110% captured by capital. I know you're worn down and tired, but you will need to find it in yourself to pick up a part-time job and/or side hustle, do nothing but work for ~6 months, save every penny you can, and then set off to embark on your life and all of the possibilities and potential that comes with that. \n\nThe few months of grinding away will be worth the lifetime of happiness and security you have in your new life.\n\nGood luck and stay safe comrade.",
