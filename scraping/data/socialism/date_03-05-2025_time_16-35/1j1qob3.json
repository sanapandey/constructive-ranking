                            "body": "Also the argument falls apart when you look at literally any aspect of modern life that isn't wage labor / enterpreneurship. 'Instinctual greed' is an unecessarily pessimistic view that necessitates the assumption that all acts with social benefit are inherently self-detrimental. Why would that be the case if as a species we survive and thrive on cooperation? What we see in practice is in fact the exact the opposite of 'instinctual greed'. \n\nThe domains of our personal lives that have significance to us and give us purpose/fullfillment are all social in nature. Families, friends, religion, charities, activism, passion projects; they're all rewarding because we enjoy seeing others benefit from our effort and feeling like we're part of a larger collective. The exact opposite is true for the domains of our lives that are purely selfish. Getting a salary raise off the back of our colleagues does not bring us joy, we don't get satisfaction from putting other people out of a job. It doesn't feel good to ignore homeless people begging for spare change. People who fight wars in the name of imperialism almost always come back with PTSD/anxiety/depression, not fullfillment. \n\nGreed is real, but it's a product of fear/distrust of others. Remove those factors and it stops existing entirely. Even the people lamenting on the futility of pushing for societal progress are expressing their own pain for living in a world that doesn't satisfy their need for community and solidarity. They are literally acknowledging that they agree with you and want a change in social relations, which is in direct contradiction to their own beliefs that we're all resisting that change.",

Benevolance and \"good will\" need not be relied on to uphold a succesful socialist system. This is what things like governments, laws, police like institutions are for. In the same way that police today punish those who murder and rob etc, police under a socialist system can punish those who act outside the bounds of what has been agreed upon as acceptable behavior by society democratically.\n3. A large part of the \"humans are greedy\" comes from flawed behaviorist psychologist experiments. These researchers were not getting the results they wanted from rats, and so they starved them in order to produce more \"pronounced\" or \"interesting\" results. The behavior of STARVED RATS was then wrongfully extrapolated to explain human behavior in our current system. You can read more about this in the book Misbehaving by Richard Thaler.",

What does that have to do with anything?\u201d Socialism does not depend on altruism, it is a structured system that reproduces itself just as capitalism does. Any system that requires altruism from everyone to succeed is doomed to fail but so is any system that requires a specific trait from every person living within it.\n\nIf they want to make the argument that greed is why a historical socialist system failed, make them spell it out, how did greed cause that? Because none of them died entirely by greed. Was there corruption? Yes, but mostly after the breakdown of the socialist system. Don\u2019t let them just get away with, \u201cit\u2019s why historically socialism failed.\u201d Without any further explanation. It\u2019s such a logical leap, yet it\u2019s a talking point everyone has been taught growing up in the USA at least.\n\nThe greed argument is a lot like the thing school children are taught about the Roman Empire falling because they couldn\u2019t communicate across the empire. Was it that or the heaps of invasions? The east/west division? The autocratic rulers draining the nation\u2019s resources for their own aggrandizement? The stagnation of technological progress in the western empire?\n\nOnce you dispel the greed bs you can teach them why historical socialist systems have failed which they will likely resist however their understanding will become more nuanced. Though, I\u2019m not sold that convincing everyone to support socialism is the way to reach a socialist system so proceed at your own prerogative.",

So why should greed be any different? If we were to measure greedy behavior we could probably find different amounts in different people. Moreover, we could likely influence the extent that people demonstrate greedy behavior by influencing the context in an experimental setting. \n\nThose that posit greed to be an immutable characteristic of human nature essentially argue that it remains undifferentiated between people and that *all other facets of motivation also remain undifferentiated.* However, this is obviously untrue, and it is much more likely that context and history provide the means and foundation for greedy behavior. If all people were driven primarily by greed, then we would see essentially the same pursuits regardless of an individual's context. \n\nThe whole concept is unfalsifiable and the position is pseudoscientific. Human nature lives with us as much as context, so by positioning greed within this framework, right wingers negate any criticism by referring to immutable, mystic, and vague human nature. But it is impossible to prove since human nature is inseparable from the individual. But, we know that is NOTHING in psychology that is purely human nature (a better term would be \"biological\". The science simply doesn't support the position.",

However what people miss is that this is not an individualist concept, what determines what is in ones best interest is their conditions and role in society, in other words their class. The owning class acting in their own self interest manifests differently than the workers also doing that. If the workers were in control their best interest would be to make food and housing free if not dirt cheap, while the owning class wants the opposite. Socialism has nothing to do with human greed but rather is all about which class of people gets to benefit from society and at whos expense. Lone individuals arent at fault, individuals only have the ability to do what they do insofar as the ruling classes allow them to do it. Individual greed is an extension of collective, class greed and therefore class struggle. We know we cant eliminate greed, nor are we concerned with that, its about replacing the ruling class with a new one. \n\nThe idea that human greed necessarily means capitalism is the most natural system is absurd. Countless non capitalist societies have existed, even in the west. To assume that we have reached the end of history and that no new ruling class can arise and we are at the peak of natural societal evolution is to ignore history.",

There are stories in there that address how a culture wards off greed so that the community can thrive, so you'll see it's not a denial of greed as a possibility in the human condition, but it really helps put in perspective that it's not just \"how we are.\" \n\nAnyway, it's kind of circular logic to say humans are inherently [insert part of human condition here] because we are many things. You could replace greedy with loving. The issue with statements like this is that they imply we are that thing to the exclusion of other things. Like we're either collaborative OR greedy--which is false. We have great capacity for both, and some humans are inclined one way or the other. \n\nThe truth is, what appears most inherent to us is what is cultivated by the system we live in. We live under extractive capitalism which rewards greed--therefore the conditions are created for humans to tend toward their capacity for greed. Under a more reciprocal philosophy such as what Robin Wall Kimerer describes in Braiding Sweetgrass, greed is not rewarded at all, and the conditions are created for humans to tend toward their capacity for mutual care. \n\nYou're going to struggle to argue that humans are not naturally greedy because humans naturally have the capacity to be a great many different ways, greedy is just one of them. We're largely products of our environment, and our environment determines how much of that potential gets expressed.",

If you use the money or resources to help your neighbor, you will starve. Capitalism is perfect at dividing the people so they can't band together to fight their class enemies. It's not just the \"i gotta get mine attitude\" if you help your neighbor, you will hurt yourself. \n\nHowever, if we are talking about an argument that you are having with someone who is likely overclocking their last brain cell like most of those people are. A good example is monopoly. Are you greedy when you play monopoly? Or are you just playing by the rules of the game? That is the intrinsic flaws with capitalism, it isn't companies or capitalists themselves. It is capitalism. Yes, capitalists are what keep the system in place and lie and cheat and spread propaganda and oppress us, but they wouldn't have any incentive to do that if it wasn't for our social structure. People complain about corporations and big pharma, and liberals point the finger at them, but they are merely playing by the rules. We are playing a game of monopoly where the banker starts out with all of the money and only gives you enough to continue working for them. We lost the moment the game started. \n\n\"Examining humans are capitalism, and determining that humans will be inherently greedy is like examining humans underwater and determining that they are inherently meant to drown.\" - don't remember. \n\nAlso, consider that people like us exist. People who aren't greedy and want a better world for everyone. There are 8 billion people. Let's be honest we aren't actually all the unique. It is impossible to calculate the amount of people who share these opinions. But we can be sure that it is a lot. The fact that we exist refutes that argument in itself. There are countries that we don't have contact with who's people feel the same, I am sure of it. It's simply a statical fallacy that humans are inherently greedy if so many of them can exist without being greedy.",

If you've never put human beings in a situation where they weren't incentivized to act badly and put at risk by being altruistic and looked at how they act under those conditions, you can't really make conclusions about the inherent nature of people.\n2) We have some examples of how people act when the systems we live under break down. As you can read more about in A Paradise Built in Hell by Rebecca Solnit, during times of disaster, a common assumption is that when the going gets tough, people will riot and kill and screw each other over to get what they need, but instead they work tirelessly without any indication of compensation, using whatever skills they have to make sure others are okay, even putting themselves in danger to do it. There are countless examples of altruism throughout history, including plenty of examples of people just being nice to each other on a day to day basis. The examples of people being horrible are, I'd argue, far fewer. It's just easier to see when the things that make you powerful and visible under this system are the terrible ones.

For something to be \"inherent\", it means it would exist before society and REGARDLESS of society. We would be greedy with even a small group of 2 to 3 people. This doesn't happen, the concept of greed starts only when the concept of resource hoarding gives a group an advantage over others. \n\nIn very short words and Engels explains this; \"Greed is human nature\" is a contradictio in adjuncto - a contradiction in terms.\n\n What Engels means with this is that greed presuposes society, while nature exists before society, meaning said terms are atemporal and contradictory at the point of the premise. Establishing said premise as something to dispel assumes even the premise on its own is a dispellable truth, but it falls flat even because the premise itself cannot be.\nI hope I made sense!",

It also found that if people are given time to think, bringing-ip, education and conditioning kicks in and they start to make selfish decisions.

I could go on and on but you should read \"A hopeful history of mankind\" it changed my world view. \n\nSo much of the \"humans are law and civilisation away from brutality\" rhetoric is propaganda to enforce law on the people. \n\nInstitutions, power, ideologies, nationalism, racism, abuse, trauma and fear make us greedy. We tend to think of people as greedy because instances of greed stick in our mind (because it's abhorrent to our nature) and because capitalism encourages extreme greed in high profile people.
