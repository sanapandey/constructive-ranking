    "selftext": "The closest answer I have seen came from socialism betrayed, basically saying that the more markets, competition, wage leveling were being introduced into the economy, the more it stagnated. (It\u2019s on page 258) \n\nAnd the Soviet growth was still very respectable before perestroika\u2026\n\nI guess I just want a more in depth answer on the economic stagnation of the USSR",

            "body": "The Soviet economy had stagnated well before perestroika, which is why perestroika became Soviet policy and Gorbachev was elevated to general secretary. There was a wide consensus that the economy was too centralized, and many sought more autonomy for workers, through councils or similar structures, as one component of a renewal of the economy.\n\nThere was a great sense that reforms were needed as Gorbachev began his tenure. Unfortunately, Gorbachev had no idea of what to do; he had a reputation as a reformer because he had instituted reforms in Soviet agriculture that had improved that sector. But he had no coherent plans and eventually instituted changes that put more responsibility on workers without giving them any more say in how things were run. Eventually, workers came to see perestroika as a failure that made conditions worse for them. After a few years of this, Gorbachev threw in the towel and began making bigger changes, this time instituting elements of capitalism. Doing so brought down the Soviet economy.\n\nWhat I have written here barely scratches the surface, and this can't be seriously addressed in a short post. If you are wanting to understand what happened, two books to read are these:\n\n*[It's Not Over: Learning from the Socialist Experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27180526-it-s-not-over)* by Pete Dolack. An overall history of the Soviet Union, but has a very large section on the last years of the Soviet Union and the Gorbachev era that details the economic issues.\n\n*[Soviet Workers and the Collapse of Perestroika](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147760373-soviet-workers-and-perestroika)* by Donald Filtzer is focused on the Gorbachev era and provides an excellent reading of how the Soviet economy worked in these years and its unravelling.",
