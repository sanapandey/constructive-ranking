    "selftext": "I wrote a story about how utterly nonsensical neoliberal housing systems are.\u00a0\n\nThis piece stemmed from an observation of the sheer quantity of car / parking infrastructures U.S. cities are capable of, yet somehow \u201chousing every American is such a complicated problem to solve.\u201d\u00a0\n\n[You can read it here!](https://hereandtogether.substack.com/p/why-are-cars-housed-before-people)\n\nI explore *the why? Why are 800,000 people unhoused in the \u201crichest country in the world?\u201d*\u00a0\n\nI believe it can be eye-opening to take a step back from the cynicism of the status-quo and realize just how out of whack the current world order is. Some hope may even be found beneath the rubble of nonsense.\n\nI hope this piece offers some clarity or hope admits grim political times.\n\nIf you like my writing and want to support my work you can[ subscribe to my newsletter here](https://hereandtogether.substack.com/subscribe)\u00a0(It\u2019s free!).\n\n",

            "body": "The really ironic thing is I don't believe there's any economic theory or idea in capitalism that suggests having an unproductive landlord class that rakes in higher and higher proportions of profit every year is in any way a good thing. Capitalists arose, not because of landed gentry, but in spite of them. Even a capitalist shouldn't accept these conditions. But it's not even feudalism either because we don't get access to productive land by renting. It's just a scam.",
