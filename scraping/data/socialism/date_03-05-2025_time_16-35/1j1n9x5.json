    "selftext": "India and China are two huge countries in the Asian continent each with population exceeding 1 Billion People. \n\nIn 1962 both the countries indulged in a war claiming many lives. It resulted in a Chinese victory with China annexing part of India known as Aksai Chin. This territory is claimed by india till date.\n\nWith India led by Nehru, although a leader of the Non Aligned movement he was closer to the USSR and personally was attracted to Socialism.\n\nChina obviously was led by Mao.\n\nI have always been curious of the analysis of Socialists about this war since during this time both the countries had governments which were left leaning.",
