    "selftext": "This happened after trumps previous victory against clinton. Here's what occurred the day of the event \n\n\"Cops had been waiting outside the store as early as 9:00 a.m. But later on, it looked like they were everywhere; blocks deep in either direction, out in large numbers, standing on corners, hanging around in all shapes and sizes of police vehicles, walking up and down the block, circling in packs of bicycle units. Counter terrorism trucks were parked at 7th and Bainbridge and were positioned with more police cars on the same corner.\n\nAn attendee left the bookstore and was followed by two police officers into a coffee shop, who monitored their activity and tailed them for blocks. More and more cops showed up, lining the street while filming and photographing everyone who entered or left the shop.\n\nConcerned at the large and hostile police presence, some people who wished to come to the talk, thought it better to leave. The police seemed to be about to do something. In fact, they already had. The day before, two police officers entered the Shoe and asked that they cancel the event. The police made nonsense claims that they feared the presence of antifascists would result in street conflict, and made accusations about Antifa\u2019s involvement with recent protest actions.\n\nWe want to reiterate: Philadelphia Police tried to stop this event.\n\nThey were trying to shut down a free, open-to-the-public speaking engagement about antifascism with author and political scholar Matthew Lyons. Lyons went on anyway and spoke to a standing room only crowd regarding his most recent work, \u201cCtrl-Alt-Delete: Antifascist Report on the Alternative Right.\u201d So many people turned up for the talk we ran out of room, and those who could fit inside got to learn about the rising tide of alt-right ideology and fascist activity. We hope that the cops watching and filming us through the windows enjoyed the talk as well; they obviously have an intense interest in fascism.\n\nThis behavior should sound the alarm. The state is poised to crack down on communities simply based on political ideology. Radical spaces, groups and associations are being targeted. Philly Antifa and antifascists everywhere are being threatened. We will not accept a world in which it is possible to silence a public talk at a bookstore. We must work together now to resist this blatant repression.\"\n\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://metrophiladelphia.com/police-deny-attempts-to-intimidate-philly-antifa/\n\n",

As they approached the sketchball noticed them and walked quickly away. As the anarchist drove away, the sketchball then crossed the street in front of the comrade\u2019s car, covering his face with his hand to avoid being seen. The sketchball then turned into the Evergreen Plaza building, which houses the Olympia FBI offices.\"",

In a city like philly or nyc you can't even park a box truck without getting tagged, seems like another day in the city to me not \"terror\". Philly isn't NYC.. it's probably the only major left leaning city that has minimum restrictions on arms. I don't believe open carry is legal within city limits, but it is legal in PA. I wonder if this law against open carry has anything to do with the long history of armed black revolutionaries in philly. That being said you can easily legally obtain any type of gun in that city, and take it to urban ranges. Like I said philly is not NYC.",
