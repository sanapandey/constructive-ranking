Sorry if they don't pass your purity check because they don't want to get rid of Israel or smth, but it's not like a lot of Germans would be in favor of that anyways. Stopping Israel's genocidal aggressions and stopping to send them weapons is something you could actually get broad support from Germans from.",

They even include this in their programing for the upcoming election (https://www.die-linke.de/bundestagswahl-2025/wahlprogramm/).\n\n*\"Wir fordern diplomatischen Initiativen, die auf einen sofortigen Waffenstillstand und einen nachhaltigen Friedensprozess in Israel und Pal\u00e4stina dr\u00e4ngen. Wir fordern eine Beendigung der deutschen Waffenexporte nach Israel, die Anerkennung Pal\u00e4stinas als eigener Staat in den Grenzen von 1967 und politischen Druck der Bundesregierung auf die Staaten der Region, Israel als Staat anzuerkennen.\"*\n\nMy comment was primarily against labeling them as \u201cfar-left.\u201d Many argue that they are essentially a social democratic party without extremist policies, but calling them far-left makes them sound more extreme than they really are. Their positions are quite moderate, so I don\u2019t like using the term \u201cfar-left\u201d because it tends to scare off the \u201cregular\u201d people that the leftist movement truly needs. They won\u2019t bring about a revolution, but from a sociological perspective, having a party like theirs more represented in the Bundestag could shift the political discourse and introduce more left-leaning talking points to the public (especially concerning domestic policies), which we desperately need alongside discussions on foreign policy.",

You can dislike Germans and especially the anti-deutsch German left for that, but disliking the left party's strategy around Palestine purely some moralistic reason doesn't help anyone",

It would be better if we could argue about strategy. My end-goal would be a global anarchist/communist society without any states. For the short term I would also want to reduce suffering and raise class consciousness of all working people (German, Palestinian, Israeli, whatever). So what are the best strategies of achieving these goals?\n\nWell, stopping to sell weapons to Israel and increasing diplomatic pressure to make them keep actual peace and support rebuilding efforts in Gaza, as well as to stop the continuing attacks and settlements in the West Bank would sound good. Pressuring companies, banks and states to stop any sales with Israel throygh boycotts, protests, occupations, etc. would be another useful strategy, in my opinion.\n\nDo you have any opinions on strategy too or do you just want to feel morally superior to people that don't sound as anti-imperialist as you? Because these strategies and according actions are what actually help Palestinians, just yelling \"Free Palestine\" online doesn't help anyone.\n\nThe left party in Germany mostly keeps its official discourse on Palestine/Israel focused on such strategies as well. You can disagree with them, but please argue about strategies or concrete goals that you disagree with rather than vague moralistic arguments.",

Ensure sufficient humanitarian supplies for the civilian population in Gaza and rebuild civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals, schools, universities, and religious sites.\n\nEnd Illegal Warfare and Arms Support\nThe illegal warfare in Gaza and Lebanon must cease immediately. Germany and NATO must not support this through arms deliveries.\n\nRecognition of Palestine and Two-State Solution\nThe German government should recognize Palestine as an independent state within the 1967 borders to strengthen the prospects of a two-state solution and promote a lasting peace process in Israel/Palestine.\nGermany and the EU must also increase pressure on regional states to recognize Israel as a state and oppose calls for the destruction of Israel\u2019s existence.\n\nEnd Occupation and Settlement Expansion\nEnd occupation, displacement, and settlement construction! The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its advisory opinion of July 19, 2024, ruled that Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem violates international law and that Israel is obligated to end the occupation \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Full equality between Israelis and Palestinians is a prerequisite for sustainable peace. All UN member states\u2014including Germany\u2014must refrain from any actions that support the occupation. The Left Party will pursue parliamentary initiatives in the Bundestag to enforce the ICJ\u2019s demands.\n\nWithdrawal of Hezbollah and Protection of Civilians\nHezbollah must withdraw from the border area with Israel in accordance with UN resolutions.\nAttacks on Israeli civilians, raids, and assaults on Israeli territory must end!\n\nTwo-State Solution and Mutual Security\nIn a future two-state solution, both states must be willing and able to ensure peace and security for the people of the other state.\n\nProtection for Refugees\nProtect refugees! We demand that refugees from Gaza and the West Bank immediately receive refugee status in Germany and be protected from deportation. An admission program with additional places must be established to provide affected individuals with a secure status and a safe future in Germany. We call on the German government to end the current practice of the BAMF (Federal Office for Migration and Refugees), which refuses to process applications on the grounds that the situation in Gaza is too unclear.\u201d\n\n\nResolution of the Federal Party Congress October 18, 2024",

Ramsis Kilani was expelled from the Berlin party because he put Hamas into the context of anti-colonial resistance. Meanwhile, you have party members who more or less openly advocate for genocide, and they are perfectly fine.\n\nThere is a political discrepancy here, mainly caused by the lack of enforcement mechanisms within the party. And that has always been a huge issue for them.\n\nDon't think it is functional for the electoral campaign? Fine. That's a strategic choice, although a poor one in my opinion, since right now one of the most popular direct candidates Ferat Kocak has been very clear on the issue of Palestine.\n\nBut once the campaign is over? The party should expel openly zionist elements while changing the German discourse from within the institutions. That is the whole point of a left-wing opposition. Political propaganda.\n\nBut, of course, they won't, because in the end the party isn't willing or able to enforce a clear line, and they are too afraid of a line struggle in the first place. Instead, they might see the 'success' of this moderate course they are running right now as an encouragement to give up every last inch of socialist principles over the next four years.\n\nI hope I'm wrong.
