Their goal was to extract as much wealth as possible without causing a crisis and revolution.\n\nHowever, today it is more blurred.. left vs right, coloured people vs white people, DEI vs normal people and so forth. I\u2019ve had the discussion within my circle of friends and family and most of the people are kinda oblivious about this. If I tell this to someone from the right they will say the country is doing poorly because of the libs and vice versa.\n\nWhat has done it for you? What can I tell/show them in order for them to believe this.\n\n",

            "body": "I just had a conversation like this yesterday. The problem most leftists have with talking to people is that they don't know how to talk to people about class issues without using the jargon they've picked up. You need to explain this to people in a way they can understand it without having done the reading. When you're talking to working people who are \"on the right\" remember that they already hate the elites. You don't need to convince them the elites are against them.\n\nWhen people start complaining about culture war shit like Dr. Seuss books and talk about \"woke ideology\" and shit like that, you just point out that's culture war shit and you don't do that stuff. Point out how the culture war is used to separate us from each other and keep us at each other's throats. Point out how MSNBC/Fox News/CNN only promotes the culture war because talking about anything else would upset their advertisers like pharmaceutical companies, weapons manufacturers, the medical insurance industry, etc. They have a financial interest in inflaming this shit.\n\nMost people see \"the other side's\" news network as propaganda but don't see their own preferred news network that way. Show them how the stories they air promote an agenda. Usually, it's \"Can you believe the left/right in this country?\"\n\nAcknowledge that a lot of their concerns are valid. There are problems with DEI. Like, DEI has not ended nepotism and it was never designed to do that. It was designed to diversify boardrooms, not to change how they operate. You can give an example like the people of colour who are fighting to maintain legacy admissions. The issues there are class based, not race/ethnicity based. Because admitting people to the boardrooms is not a threat to capitalism, but eliminating the social hierarchies and nepotism is. Ask them if they think it would be fair for their son or daughter to be denied admission to Harvard - even if they had the grades and application to get in - just because of some legacy admissions. 99% of people will say it is not alright. But - and this is important - you should also point out that structural racism exists and acknowledge that DEI was created to address it - even if the way it was carried out wasn't great. Most people have a person of colour in their life they know has experienced racism and discrimination. Or else you can point out things that we all know as a society, like health outcomes, over incarceration, under funded neighbourhoods and services.\n\nTalk about how, as a society, we need to take care of each other, but that the elite - both Dems and Republicans - keep us at each other's throats so we won't work together. Like, these people all go to the same schools  and hang out in the same clubs. They are all friends. *We* aren't. Point out how the same tech oligarchs at Trump's inauguration also gave to Dems. Trump himself used to be a Dem. And they've used social media and 24 hour news to promote an agenda that keeps us divided and at each other's throats while they steal everybody's money and pass their legislation.\n\nPoint out that we have been living through the largest transfer of wealth to the top 1% since Covid and that the world's elite have used the anti-vax and anti-mask people as a smoke screen to push through more of their legislation and to steal more of our money. Money that should be going to fixing our infrastructure and paying for our kids' schools and our hospitals. Not lining the pockets of the ultra rich.\n\nAnd if they say that Joe Rogan shit about the elite already having enough, you point out that no rich person has ever had enough. You can invoke their own boss. But you can also say that the rich don't get rich by only taking what they need. They are greedy and avaricious.\n\nBecause of the media landscape, people are going to see you as being either MAGA or a Dem. You need to establish that you're neither and that you see through both of them. They've been raised in a politics that insists on pigeonholing people into one or the other of these categories. If you point out that Biden broke up the rail strikes and supported genocide, you'll be accused of being MAGA. If you accuse Trump of being an elite who is destroying the country, you'll be accused of being a Dem. I'm sure you've been accused of being both at different times in your arguments with people.",

            "body": "You can always pivot the conversation to be within the context of class politics. Most conservatives hold contradictory beliefs and believe a lot of the same things socialists do, but just use different language (i.e. bourgeoisie = \"the elites\"). But they also do not recognize it as socialism so be careful not to use terms which might turn on their McCarthyism radar.\n\nSome examples: \n\nConversation about immigration. Why do you think people want to come to America? Talk about poor conditions in other countries. Why do those conditions exist. Imperialism. Congrats now the conversation is about class.\n\nConversation about some politician or partisan politics. You can immediately just open with \"eh they are all bought out by the big companies.\" Conservatives tend to hate big tech and Hollywood more than big pharma or the military industrial complex, so bonus points if you specifically name drop the institutions they already hate. Double bonus points if you just say \"the coastal elites\"\n\nConversation about guns. \"Yeah man I really like the way the black panther party exercised their 2nd amendment to protect their communities\" that should end the conversation pretty quick.\n\nEtc.\n\nClass is embedded in like basically all issues so it's easy to make any issue a class issue.",

Anything else is a sideshow or deliberate obfuscation.    \nPeople have been brutalised and swindled by ongoing theft and exploitation for profit.  \nFor this reason they cast around for something to blame, but through conditioning and through naivety (and occasionally through fear, ignorance or confusion) consistently blame the wrong thing, people or phenomenon.  If you break it down into who has benefitted and who hasn't, who is creating the victimised groups, who is enacting the violence, who consistently stands to benefit, the lines are incredibly clear and always have been.  You can leave all the vernacular about libs, dems, socialists, woke and all these other terms to the side and just focus on material conditions and who is winning and who is losing.    \nI find that conservatives love the past, but the past they idealise - where it even came close to existing - existed because capital was trammelled, regulated and taxed.  Where inequalities were seen as a huge problem rather than a footnote, where there was a moral and ethical duty and responsibility to others as much as oneself.  \n  \nAt the apex of social cohesion capital was treated cynically and with suspicion, not seen as a form of celebrity saviour that will magically enrich everyone if we just give it what it wants.  \n  \nIt's not immigrants, trans people, black or minority ethnic people who are mining the fault lines in capitalism for their own gain and sowing discord whilst stealing from us, and it never has been.",

            "body": "Oppression divides our class and makes it harder to organize. Neoliberalism was already race to the bottom, this new era of climate crisis and global proxy war is tilting that much steeper without any prospect of lasting economic stability to tilt it it 'back.' The owner class focuses on scapegoating immigrants and trans people first so they can test out - how much degradation of pay, living and working conditions will we allow? A security state?  No more teachers unions? How about a heaping dose of white nationalism?\n\nI'd talk to your family about billionaires and their interests - its not simply get rich - it's gripping the world economy through imperialism to keep their layer on top. The conflict over Ukraine's resources (with new trenches and minefields) and the demolition of Gaza are a consequence of this, and a precursor or more to come. The right wing focus on DEI and appeal to 'traditional family' gives a pretext for division and exploitation.   \n  \n(corporate DEI programs are not even really something that's made a huge difference for most workers - it was militant unions that helped create a generation of greater stability for black workers in the 50s and 60s. We should not rally around the bosses vision of diversity)\n\nMusk and Trump may look inept for playing their cards so openly, but the reality is that workers in the US are at a very low point of organization. We are struggling to stay afloat, and most unions are aligned within the gravity well of the billionaire warmonger Democratic party. Which despite sometimes talking about opposing racism and misogyny, fundamentally agrees with preparing for WWIII by through forcibly extracting resources, and intensifying austerity.\n\nUnions get in the way of this, because they are fundamentally built to protect workers. If we can remind our membership of this, and lead solidarity actions in defiance of ICE and the transphobia, we can make unions into an important rally point with the potential to push back on billionaire attacks and right wing ideology. The decisive factor will be whether independent working class politics develops as its own thing - like a movement based workers party rooted in labor - versus continued obedience to the \"good billionaires\" / the Democratic Party.",
