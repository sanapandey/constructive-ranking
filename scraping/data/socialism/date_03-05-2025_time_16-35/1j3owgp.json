Made a deal with the pro US government they helped set up to withdraw after the war (they sort of have finally withdrawn slowly in the last 2-3 decades)\n\n1945-48. Korea. Didnt organize with the anti Japanese occupation resistance committees that set up the PRK, in fact betrayed the people of Korea by bringing power back to many collaborators.\n\n1961.  Rafael Trujilo. A Dominican Republic leader practically groomed into power by the US military who was then killed using CIA supplied weapons.\n\n1964. Brazil.\n\n1965. Dominican Republic, again, this time another leader they threw out, i think they even help him come back later after regretting it.\n\n1975. Australia. The CIA helped topple the democratically elected, left-leaning government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in Australia.\n\n1989. Panama. To overthrow a dictator of their own making...\n\nIraq (listen to blowback)\n\n  \nTbh i am missing some, here is a [long list of coups and foreign interference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xEgppuvjbpG3CYb9KhdPi4PQZpIeM4bYS3jRBji8_zE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.7taxuy68ra5q), feel free to dig in to sort which ones are betrayals and which ones are just taking down enemies/doing imperialism",
