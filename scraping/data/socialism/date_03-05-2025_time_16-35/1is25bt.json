    "selftext": "\"There ain't no real beef in the hood!! Just a lot of empty stomachs and misunderstandings.\" I quickly jumped in with \"the real beef is kept invisible so the city don't realize we all got the same opposition.. the racist white rich dudes who bleed pockets and pit us against one another in these hood hunger games as they sit in Connecticut mansions\". \n\nThis is such a quick sentence, but when I heard it I couldn't help but think this young man is a revolutuonary lumpen in the making! This says so much in such a simple way. It speaks of how the ultra poor, the lowest of Americas proletariat are kept at one anothers throats, in violent individualistic cycles of survival. Anyone who has been very very low will know, there's a point where your stomach and pockets are so empty, that you begin to feel bad for the person in your neighborhood who even so much as slights you, because you are a powder keg. It also makes you become seedy in certain ways. I'd be lying if I said i never stepped on somebody to survive. I maintained a relationship with this kid for years just from hearing the conversation and jumping in. We related off the bat because at the time I used to be fresh out of the same shady lumpenproletariat lifestyle, and let me say I can now call him comrade. Bro is full on into revolutionary politics at this point. \n\n\n\nWhat are some quotes, or discussions you guys have jumped into and thought \"I like what these people are saying\"? Did any friendships come of it? ",
