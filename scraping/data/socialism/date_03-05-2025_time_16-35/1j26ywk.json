    "selftext": "I'm working my way through\u00a0Classical Political Economics and Modern Capitalism\u00a0by Tsoulfidis and Tsaliki. However, I ran into a bit of a snag and am having some trouble understanding something. I wasn't sure where to ask for help, but given that this is about Marx's theory of simple reproduction, this seems a good place to ask.\n\nAlright so here goes.\n\nI did not fully understand why the purchases of MOP on the part of Department II was split into multiple steps.\n\nSo below is the diagram provided in the book:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tPXjWPV](https://imgur.com/a/tPXjWPV)\n\nThe circuit emanating from Department I makes sense, but I don't understand why Department II didn't just purchase 2 MOP from Department I right from the get go. Instead, it is split into two different steps,\u00a0\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/2d2UvI4](https://imgur.com/a/2d2UvI4)\n\nThe diagram above shows the next step as outline in the book. Here you can see that an additional 500 euro was used to purchase 1 more MOP. Why weren't these steps consolidated? I understand that the extra 500 euro came out of the dividends of Department I, but I don't understand why it HAD to come out of those dividends and why it couldn't simply come out of the production of Department II as had the initial 500 euros. Why couldn't Department II just outright purchase 1000 euros worth of MOP, instead it had to rely on the dividends from Department I circulating back into it? I don't fully understand why that's the case.\n\nI assume that the 2000 euros used for LP came out of the value produced by Department I, and the same is true for the 1000 and 500 euros from Department II. So why then did the 500 euros have to circulate and come from the dividends of Department I.\n\nFundamentally, where does the money come from here and why?\n\nEdit:\n\nAdditional context, this is using the numerical example in Capital II page 398.\n\nSo:\n\nDepartment I : 4000C\\_1 + 1000V\\_1 + 1000 S\\_1 = 6000 X\\_1\n\nDepartment II : 2000C\\_2 + 500 V\\_2 + 500S\\_2 = 3000X\\_2\n\nFurthermore:\n\nMore specifically, Department I produce means of production (MOP) or investment goods, whereby a unit of MOP (e.g. a machine) is worth 500 \u20ac. Department II produce means of consumption (MOC), where a unit of MOC (e.g. food) is worth 500 \u20ac, while a unit of labour power (LP) employed in both departments is also worth 500 \u20ac; finally, for convenience purposes 1 labour hour is valued at 1\u20ac",
