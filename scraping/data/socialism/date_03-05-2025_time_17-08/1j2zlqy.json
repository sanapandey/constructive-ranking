Without enough young people to support the old population, it will cost the rich \"too much\" to support the old guard.  So in the meantime, work those that still can be worked (to death), and for their demographic overall -  starve them to death with hard to afford foods and nutrition,  take away their healthcare and houses, etc. . .  until the older population has a massive die-off.   Not only remove any support systems and healthcare, but actively enact policy to rob them of their resources (incomes, vested payouts from social security,  and their homes ultimately). \n\n. . . \n\nRegarding the social security is doomed arguments:\n\n  \nGreat increases in productivity and GDP growth have been hoarded at the top %, it was stolen from wages. Because of that, it was also stolen from local and federal taxes that would have been collected from those workers' higher earnings, and there would have been higher spending/consumption which could be good for , especially local, business (and local sales tax etc. if any, which would help municipalities with struggling budgets).\n\nIf the wealth explosion at the top since the late 80s had instead gone more into wages across the board, social security would have been funded more all of those years. Instead, the wealth being siphoned from greater productivity to the top was outside of the 150k - 180k earning social security taxation cap.",
