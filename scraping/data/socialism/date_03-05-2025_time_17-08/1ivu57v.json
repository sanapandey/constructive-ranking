    "selftext": "Recent actions by current US government to defund social security along with the neo-liberal project of destroying pensions in favor of  self-funded, self-managed pension (401k, IRA) has me investigating recent successful attempts to claw back aspects of social welfare.\n\nI\u2019m aware of French protest against pension reduction (2023), Belgian protests (February), and recent actions in Morocco, as well as RF pension protests.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if people have any reading suggestions in terms of organizing over the last 10 years, particularly in support of providing those 60 or over with adequate resources to sustain an existence post ft work.\n\nBeyond pensions, is anyone aware of recent efforts to form communes or cooperatives for\nmutual support of those in \u201cretirement age\u201d or who are unable to work?\n",
