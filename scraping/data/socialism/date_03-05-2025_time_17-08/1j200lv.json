            "body": "Revolution would imply a change in social interactions,  and property relations occuring behind a direct challenge to state control. This would occur out of what is more accurately described as an \"insurrection\". Insurrection is more so a sustained conflict, or even sustained demonstrations and strikes. The USA is vast and culturally and politically broken up by region. The decentralized nature of many of the movements make it hard for us to predict exactly when, how and where resistance will occur. For instance the armed community response against neo nazis in Ohio recently. \n\n\nThere are trends we can study based on the regions though. What cities will be very hard for the \"brown shirts\" to freely exert authority in? Seattle, Portland, Philly, the far north east will likely be the MAJOR cities that offer the most danger for reactionary groups. These areas not only have thousands of anti capitalists but they have even more people who sympathize with them. I left many regions out, because the cities I listed don't have a disarmed left like NYC does. Same reason I left cali out. For as far left as NYC Is, I'd say the far right would be in more danger in a city like Philly.  Boston is a bit more white, but the left in the far northeast is more tied in with rural survival which is what would give them an edge.\n\nI could see a city like Portland and Philadelphia becoming a sort of open air prison like Gaza more so than I see \"camps\" like Germany. This better serves the modern model of fascist control in which resistance continues to grow, so simple imprisonment of participants isn't enough. They look to subject an entire region based on their tendencies of rebellion. This is what gaza is an experiment for. For anyone who thinks this is a stretch remember the usa bombed Philly in the 80s.",

The beginnings of anti colonial and anti racist uprisings began to unfurl after occuring for years, so white reaction got sent into motion.

The foot soldiers of the white reactionary movements are the militant wing of this movement, which usually attempts to invade known leftist or black, migrant, queer cities/spaces in order to attack the base of anti colonial rebellion. This leads to a situation where street battles, and skirmishes or standoffs break out in major leftist cities. Multiple people have already been killed on both sides. If this continues, which is likely, the violence is going to be more organized and sophisticated this time around. By sophisticated, i mean it will simply take an evolved form rather than appearing the exact same as last time.

Some Red State yahoo with a pickup truck who\u2019s eating fast food, smoking weed and playing video games isn\u2019t going to form a militant organization because his diabetes medication isn\u2019t covered.\n\nThat's a stereotype and is mostly inaccurate. Many people struggle in the red states, and many of them are fed up with administrations that don't care for them. That's why many of those folks latched on to Donald Trump. Sure, he may be a billionaire bastard, but at least he could provide something new to the same old bastards that came before, right? Well, with the shit he's doing now, it's going to make many turns against him. Believe it or not, not everybody who voted Trump is a rabid reactionary fundamentalist Christian. Many of them are just people who want genuine change.",

I believe the revolution will begin in the upper Midwest, specifically somewhere around the Great Lakes states (Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio). Why? The Great Lakes states are states that have faced historical amounts of societal brain drain, regional poverty, water crises, economic ruin, and loss of manufacturing jobs. Yet, the people in those same states keep holding on to what theyve got, say fuck you to anybody that tries to take their home away from them, and keep trying to fight for a better future and build their communities up. Nothing, not even the weather, breaks the resolve of the people up here. People are proud of the places they come from up here, and the area is a beautiful region with historic progressivism that inspires the people here. This area is labor Union heavy, more economically populist than other areas of the US, has cities which are progressive political power centers (Chicago, Milwaukee, MSP, Madison, Detroit, Cleveland, Lansing), and has people who want to build a better society. Living in WI for the last 2.5 years has inspired me to keep fighting for the society you want, no matter the cost. Madison truly embodies that, and other cities in the region feel the exact same way.",
