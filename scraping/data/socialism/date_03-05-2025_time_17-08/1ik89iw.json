    "selftext": "Hello! Baby socialist here, I currently have an Apple phone that hesitantly bought 4 years ago after my old one couldn\u2019t turn on anymore. I am very anti consumerism but I have concerns about my phone and data mining. I do not wanna buy a new phone to contribute to the cycle, however, what can I do with my current phone to protect my privacy and my general data? Any apps suggestions either to delete or not use anymore is appreciated. Thank you!",

            "body": "You might have better luck asking this on a cybersecurity forum. Some suggestions would be using open source security browsers (like Waterfox, Librewolf, or the likes), always denying cookies on sites etc. I know there are some browsers like Brave that have cookie filters which automatically decline the cookies pop-up on most websites (though I do not necessarily advocate to use Brave, because it's not the most privacy-focused one out there).   \n  \nI am an Android user, so I cannot really provide any Apple-specific suggestions. Maybe finding open-source alternatives to apps built in by Apple? It's hard. These corporations are fighting and trying their best to extort every single bit of data they could out of you and sell it, so using any of their products with the expectation of not contributing to their bottom line with your data is a really tough ask. Even if you are able to do it, your experience of using the device will be severely downgraded. Unfortunately it's just the nature of the very lob-sided power balance scale between You and The Corporation.  \n  \nBaby socialists (me included) often go through a very confusing and troubling phase, where they come to realize the errors of the system and wish not to participate in it anymore, but, unfortunately, the system has you by the balls in this regard, and giving up on it means giving up on your quality of life. Being conscious about your consumption choices is extremely important as a socialist, but realizing that organizing and actively fighting against these measures alongside other people is a much more effective strategy against corporations than taking individual anti-consumerist actions.   \n  \nUnfortunately, unlike what liberals usually preach, voting with your wallet isn't really that effective of a strategy, especially not on an individual level. Always keep trying to be conscious of your consumption habits, but don't let yourself be tortured by the reality of the system you're living under. Liberals will often call you a \"hypocrite\" for still participating in capitalism and consumption, though you are a socialist, and unfortunately that is just a reality most of us have to cope with. Letting yourself get depressed and discouraged by this only works in the favor of the system, as it will stop you from having the motivation to even do anything about it. So accept the \"hypocrisy\" and fight for a more just world. \n\nYou've asked for some technology tips, but I hope my reflections on feelings as a baby socialist will help you. Good luck on securing your information, and don't let yourself get crushed by the immensity of capitalism!",
