    "selftext": "I have noticed a lot of influencers, namely BadEmpaneda and Darknovia, calling for the Left to shun Liberals in the same way that we shun Fascists. That they are inherently part of the same issue. While I definitely see their point, I fear that this tendency may prove to be self-destructive.\n\nLiberalism, at its core, **is** a system that upholds and maintains capitalism, imperialism, and class oppression. Historically, liberals have been more than happy to betray socialists and revolutionaries\u2014whether it was the German Social Democrats crushing the Spartacists, Roosevelt cozying up to corporate America after flirting with the New Deal, or the way Western liberals today enable war crimes in Palestine, Yemen, and beyond.\n\nBut outright **shunning** liberals, in the same way that we reject fascists, might be shortsighted. Unlike the far-right, many liberals are **not** fully conscious defenders of the ruling class. Instead, they\u2019re victims of ideological conditioning. They **believe** in \"democracy,\" \"human rights,\" and \"progress,\" but they fail to see how those ideals are weaponized to serve imperialism. That means some liberals **can** be radicalized.\n\nSo instead of treating them as sworn enemies, it might be better to:\n\n1. **Expose their contradictions** \u2013 Push them to see how their values clash with their policies (e.g., \"You support human rights? Then why do you back Biden when he arms genocidal regimes?\")\n2. **Provide a real alternative** \u2013 Show them that socialism isn\u2019t just about \"being angry\" but actually building a world that **genuinely** upholds equality, justice, and peace.\n3. **Distinguish between naive liberals and ruling-class liberals** \u2013 The **working-class** liberal can be reasoned with. The corporate, NGO-backed, or political elite liberals **are** enemies.\n\nThe far-right **wants** us to shun liberals completely because it helps drive them into reaction. If we refuse to engage with them, they\u2019ll either stay in their bubble or drift toward the right. But if we meet them where they are and push them leftward, we weaken liberalism **and** build socialist consciousness at the same time.",

            "body": "This entire discourse is a result of how atomized the so-called left is in much of the Western world in the first place.\n\nThe way you personally interact with liberals is basically irrelevant. You won't convince anyone outside of your personal circle unless you have a massive platform that functions as mass media. I assume you don't have that, nor 99% of the people on here. \n\nThe way to capture liberals is by organizing working-class people, and it really doesn't matter what the specific flavor of bourgeois politics they prefer is, because you should organize them around their concrete material interests (for example in a union, in limited strike action, in political action with a tie to their concrete interests). \n\nOf course, you won't do that on your own. Nobody does that. That is what the vanguard party is for and its long-term transition toward a mass party.\n\nPeople need to stop conceiving of politics as a battle of ideas. We are Marxists, and as Marxists, we know that the base supercedes the superstructure. Progressive politics often associated with liberalism aren't born of superior ideas people have somehow acquired, they are a result of their relation to their social environment. To assume (mostly condescending) conversations will make a meaningful difference in that conception, especially for organizing political movements in the real world, is absurd. In fact, that is the sort of idealism liberals are driven by.\n\nLearn what people in your community want, analyze why they can't get it and how it relates to their position in the relations of production, and then organize a party around the struggle for those goals, as part of a larger struggle to organize them into the mass party.",

There is a destructive tendency in the Western left in particular to frame personal empathy as some political praxis when in reality it's just... being social.\n\nYou do not organize your community by being extra nice to them. You organize the working-class in your community around the struggle for their concrete interests, which you learn by engaging with them in the first place. Maoists can call that the mass line if they want to, but it is the core principle of any revolutionary communist organisation.",

In occupy oakland, marxists and anarchists organized outside of the general assembly to push the general assembly in a radical direction. They did so in the shadows away from the eyes of liberals. They pushed to vote to ban police, and pro police groups from the movement, campaigned underneath the liberals noses and got more votes than them. This left radlibs in a position where the anarchists and marxists held more power than their ngos in the movement. Not going to lie, it transfered into physical clashes.. the liberals didn't simply fall in line they tried to expel anarchists from the movement, unsuccessfully. \n\nThe anarchists and marxists getting the assembly to vote yes on diversity of tactics, and renaming occupy oakland to oakland commune was the final blow that sent liberalism to the backseat. When this occured the local mainstream media began releasing articles such as \"are anarchists hijacking occupy?\" (Despite the fact that the og movement in nyc was organized by anarchists and marxists in a popular front looking to have mass appeal).

I used to watch H3H3 when he was making fun of Youtube Pranksters like \"Ethan Bradbury\" but I stopped watching him pretty quick because he's fairly misogynistic. I have more recently been watching Hasan stuff.\n\nThese 2 have \"beef\" Hasan is a leftist that opposes Israels horrid actions in Gaza, but he's being attacked by H3H3 over stuff this guy only just recently learned about. Hasan had spoken to H3H3 not long ago at a time when H3H3 basically had no knowledge of politics, especially on the scale of global conflicts. Yet here he is, this uninformed baby, got a taste of the situation and now has his opinions all fully formed about how Hasan is an anti-Semite and supports terrorism because of his stance on the war in Gaza.\n\nThe issue here, is that H3H3's arguments against Hasan, are really just poisoning his (presumably liberal) viewers views about left wing politics. If he's allowed to keep going as he is, a lot of his remaining fanbase, as well as possibly himself, might end up going down a right wing rabbit-hole that tricks them into a set of beliefs they probably wouldn't have otherwise had.\n\nIt's harder to remain a centrist, than it is to be far left or far right. Most liberals probably become leftists long term, but with people like H3H3 doing what they are doing, trying to de-platform a leftist content creator, they are being pushed right wing, and they're not immune to this brainwashing.\n\nSo should we shun H3H3? I kind of think so. It's a terrible idea to fight amongst ourselves, but also gotta be willing to cut off infected parts before they infect more parts of the whole.\n\nIdeally we educate H3H3 and we're all good again. However if we can't do that we have to do what is best for our goals and some think that is cutting off infected bits.\n\nI use this isolated situation, but I think it's a good example of how we might be approaching the topic as a whole. \n\nThings also get muddied further if you're Canadian, we have this idea that a liberal is a left of center centrist. However the Canadian Liberal Party is a right of center centrist party, that has \"left wing social values\". They are still for the billionaires/corporations though. They muddy our political system, and divide the vote, taking people who should be voting NDP, and instead redirecting those votes into a second  right wing party. Yet they still get labeled as \"The left coalition\" by the uninformed.",

It was about a judge taking away votes at the behest of the Republicans and while you should always oppose right-wing authoritarian shenanigans the liberals there (ACLU and others) \\*STILL\\* blathered on about compromise. Hell they even brought a former member of ICE on the stage to talk about her vote being taken away. Once they said \"we should find common ground\" with the GOP I just left the protest (if you could call it that). I get that the Democrats are a bourgeois party who ultimately serve the ruling class but holy hell are you even going to \\*attempt\\* to oppose the actual far-right dictator and his movement? Rank and file liberals I could \\*maybe\\* work with them if they're willing to listen, but convincing those like the Democratic Party leadership? At this point they're not much better than MAGA and are blind bad-faith institutionalists ignoring the working class & the disenfranchised as a whole and are actively feeding reactionary narratives.",

There is a difference between \"private property\" (e.g. the land/capital you \"own\") and \"personal property\" (e.g. your house, clothes, tv, computer), and this difference is very much considered within both theory and actually existing socialism. Some quick points to fire off in the service of education:\n\n1. Walmart practices a planned economy internally. Planned economies exist the world over right now in the form of many private enterprises, but the capital owners resist them being adopted by governments because of the obvious consequences it will have for them having exclusive access to what they consider \"their\" capital. The reasoning for this resistance is simple: a state planned economy democratises the economy, as a modern state (yes, even a non democratic one) has to be more accountable to its people than a private company. The fight is about control of resources and capital, and the capital owners stand on the side of their own dictatorial control over the economy. Read \"The People's Republic of Walmart\", it is a great read that discusses this point in detail.\n2. The best antidote to the propaganda of \"the state controls your life\" is to look at the rates of home ownership in post USSR countries (e.g. countries in which the majority of homes were built under a planned economy), and compare them to the rates of home ownership in the USA. I'll leave that one to you to look up, but it's an enlightening point about the so called \"lack of choice\" and \"lack of personal control\" argument. Similarly: in China in 2022 the home ownership rate was 96%, vs. the USA's 66% in 2024. Feel free to look it up.\n3. Similarly, no actually existing socialist state has ever \"ordered\" anyone who was not already a convicted criminal in the eyes of the law to go to work at some particular place of work. Rather, much like in modern capitalist economies, the overwhelming majority all applied for workplaces as you'd expect. When the state planned to expand some type of industry, it incentivised people to switch professions through retraining opportunities, better wages, and other such perks. The difference was that the state was ideologically committed to full employment, so if a certain industry was not expanding \"fast enough\" it just meant the perks needed to be improved.\n\nThe difference between socialism and capitalism is not \"in socialism the state tells you what to do\", but rather \"in socialism you are a co-owner of your workplace\". A good way to describe it for newbies: if a planned economy is the whole government organising itself like Walmart already does, then socialism is reorganising that economy into a democratically controlled cooperative. A planned economy can be planned dictatorially, but socialists insist on it being planned democratically, and this last point is what is most often missing from bad faith arguments against economic planning.",
