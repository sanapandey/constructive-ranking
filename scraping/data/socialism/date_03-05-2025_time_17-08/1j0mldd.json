Kinda a classic wartime playbook for the US. \n\nZelensky knows that he is being played by the US, but betting that the US wants to extort him more than they want to gain Putin as a friend. Of course, Trump wants to make it crystal clear to everyone that Zelensky is on all fours, and that Vance collects a paycheck on his knees.\n\nFrom a geopolitical standpoint, I don\u2019t think Russia has anything to offer. Their energy sector is probably what keeps them afloat, and, no pun intended, it\u2019s running on the fumes and infrastructure of the Soviet Union. The US, on the other hand, has such a nuts energy sector that they just burn off the natural gas they produce (byproduct) rather than build the infrastructure to use it.",

Russia has built tens of thousands of miles of pipelines and drastically increased its gas and oil production since the Soviet days. Transneft alone operates over 40k miles of gas pipelines, most of which were built after 1990.\n\nAnd Russia actually flares (burns off) more natural gas than the United States. They have an absolutely ins*ne amount of gas and are geographically situated in a much more convenient area than the US to sell it. \n\nSaying \"aside from energy sales, they don't have much to offer geopolitically\" is like saying \"aside from taking me around on roads, my car doesn't have much to offer me\". Brother, that's pretty much all that big players in the world *do*.",

I guess my point is that their #1 resource (energy) also happens to be one the US is in no short supply of, and the US hasn\u2019t even tried to fully capitalized on domestic production.\n\nSo what could they really offer the US that the US can\u2019t extort from the Ukrainians?",

The US has already been exporting LNG through tankers over the Atlantic to Europe after the invasion and it's wildly more costly and inefficient than simply running a pipeline directly from the gas fields. That access to cheap energy transported via pipeline is basically the entire foundation of Europe's neoliberal order, once it got partially cut off inflation spiked majorly and the AfD nearly took power in Germany's last election as a direct result (among other things, but without energy costs spiking inflation you would have never had the catalyst necessary for a right wing revival). If you are also a neoliberal US head of state, keeping the structures of power of the EU in place and maintaining a monopoly of military power through NATO is basically essential to the post-war project of Pax Americana, peace through American hegemony. Cheap energy prices in the EU are essential to that project, and Russia is the only conveniently geographically situated source of it. Without that, the EU member states can't maintain the welfare state that prevent EU citizens from becoming antagonistic to the United States dictating their security and by extension their foreign policy. \n\nAmerican gas is simply too expensive once you factor in transport costs, nuclear is dead for everyone but France, coal doesn't exist in the quantities to support 21st century 1st world living, and renewables require far too much of a capital investment to fill in the gaps at a time when everyone's moving towards austerity. The foundations of the post-cold war order are built on the EU's addiction to cheap Russian gas, and a world without it would look radically different.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that nat gas is flared off when you're drilling for oil, because you don't have the capacity or desire to capture it when it's oil you're after. Russia also has tons of oil and that's why they flare so much gas off.",

God bless you.\u201d\n\n**Trump:**\u00a0\u201cDon't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel\u2026 because you're in no position to dictate that. Remember this, you're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel good. We're gonna feel very good and very strong.\u201d\n\n**Zelensky:**\u00a0\u201cYou will feel the influence. I\u2019m telling you now you will feel the influence.\u201d\n\n**Trump:**\u00a0\u201cYou're right now, not in a very good position. You're not in a good position.

I am a wartime president.\u201d\n\n**Trump:**\u00a0\\[shouting\\] \u201cYou're gambling with the lives of millions of people.

Even today.\u201d \n\nAnd so it deteriorated from there with Zelensky actually quite calm amidst the dressing down. Zelensky drew out the truth about Russian influence and they didn't like that.",

That means a NATO country attacked Russia. If those attacks got any worse, Russia could have hit Kiev with a low-grade nuke to scare off NATO (because the West doesn't actually care about Ukraine). Or it could escalate to an attack on a NATO military base. I don't know what you are doing on a socialist subreddit if you entrust the security of Ukraine and the rest of the world to genocidal American Neocons.\n\n\nTrump didn't give Netanyahu the green light to do ANYTHING he wants because he isn't bombing Gaza and the shaky ceasefire us at least enough for Hamas to exchange hostages. Unfortunately, Trump\u00a0wants to focus on China as a threat.\n\n\nIsrael exists for western imperialism. The United States controls Israel. Not the other way around. The United States is the biggest threat to world peace, not Israel or Russia.",

You shouldn't assume what other people know or don't know. \n\nI majored in American history in college. Minored in political science and economics (with a concentration in economic history).  History is my passion in life and I read an enormous amount about it.  At least one book a week sometimes many more. \n\nI stand by my statement that I think we've largely been a force for good with all things considered, especially since World War II.  Yes, we did some terrible things like the Iranian coup d'etat in 1953.  Supporting right wing dictators over democratically elected socialists in South America.  But we also established a rule-based international order where Nations began freely trading with one another.  We also avoided being a traditional empire based on colonization and extraction.  Unfortunately, if power gets concentrated somewhere, there are going to be horrible abuses. I've always thought that EU should stop up and increase their military presence to give more balance to Western political leadership in the world.   Because no matter how bad you think America is, I think most people would prefer American hegemony to Chinese or Russian.  \n\nAnyway, because of the free trade, wars between nation states declined significantly.  Battlefield deaths in the second half of the 20th century were the lowest in recorded history (especially as a percentage of population, used to be way more common to die during war because there were a lot more of them.)  Famine, starvation, death from serious illness, infant mortality rates, vaccination rates.... All these things improved immensely under American leadership and because of actions we took to make them improve. There has never been a better time to be alive on Earth, although watching evening news might have you feel differently.  Sensationalisms sells.  These charts are pretty cool... 32 ways which team world has improved in the past century or so.  \n\nhttps://www.gapminder.org/factfulness-book/32-improvements/\n\nOne thing the United States provides to the world is that we use the enormous power of our Navy to stop piracy.  Piracy on the seas and for shipping lanes used to be a fact of life.  Shipping was a very dangerous game, and it made trade between nations extremely risky.   But under American global leadership, trade flourishes,  and so too do positive relationships between nation states.  \n\nAgain, I'm not some flag waving nationalist, like I think you assumed I was when you told me to read about Latin American history, thinking that somebody with my opinion could not possibly have known about those things. I just don't think things are as black and white where it's either \"Americagood\"   or \"Americabad!\"   \n\nThere's a complex grey area that needs to be analyzed.  People often look at Nations like they're individuals, but they are in fact made up of many many individuals, organizations, customs, cultures, that all have grown and changed in a very fluid way over the duration of their existence.  \n\nSo yes, people in our society and leaders our government have definitely done some horrible things and also made some huge mistakes.  But, ultimately with the way history played out, the United States is the reason the ideals of the enlightenment ever got put into practice at all.  And that's an incredible achievement. Our founding fathers were **wildly progressive** at the time and should not be judged against the standards of today.    \n\nHave you read Alexis de tocqueville's Democracy in America?   It paints a picture of just how radical the American experiment was during the 1800s. One of the finest books written on democracy and one of the finest books ever  written on America.  A definitive work for anybody trying to understand this country's history.  \n\nLike sure, it started with democracy just for land owning white men, and the Constitution we devised was nothing more than a pragmatic compromise made around the interests of slave owning plantation barons (which is why it badly needs to be updated in significant ways.)  But it had to start somewhere.  To think we could just undo every single norm in Western / British Society in the 1700s, automatically have gender equality, racial equality, and end slavery right off the bat.. that was never going to happen and it's not because America sucks.  Human progress happens slowly unfortunately. \n\nSlavery was absolutely terrible.  There is no sugar coating it.  The more I read about it the more I realize it is even worse and more disgusting then I could even imagine. But, the United States being founded was the beginning of the end for slavery.  By creating a government around those ideals of all men being treated equal... That is what made many people realize just how fucked up it was to own other human beings.  People realized the hypocrisy and contradiction of our nation bill on equality but with slavery right off the bat.   \n\nBut of course, it was a very powerful and very evil force and could not be rid of overnight.  It was deeply embedded in the social fabric of this society.  \n\n But slowly, many individuals and even state governments started to outlaw it. Jefferson stopped the transatlantic slave trade under his presidency, the first year the Constitution permitted.  Progress is never a straight even line but often one step forward two steps back.  \n\n Establishment of the United States was still progressing upon what European societies had beforehand.  We didn't reach our ideal state for the goals outlined to the declaration of Independence from the get-go. And We still aren't even halfway there.  Fuck, right now we're walking backwards.  But the declaration of Independence has been an inspiration for the progressive values of freedom and equality ever since it was written, and has inspired people to strive for those ideals all over the world.  \n\nAnd the people of this country keep those goals in mind.  They know them in their heart.      They are something many of us hold to be dearly valuable and strive for.  I'm proud of that, as an American, although maybe right now isn't the best time to say that in light of what current leadership is doing.  \n\nSorry, I'm trying to keep this brief, so I'll shut up now.  I understand if you disagree with my conclusion, but I just wanted to demonstrate to you that I'm not making my statement lately or without much historical knowledge regarding my country's history.",

I can't believe the military industrial complex is going to stop making record profits. Trump's foreign policies always seem incoherent so it is hard to tell but I can't imagine that when Israel finally pushes Iran to far that they will drag us into it. They've been talking about striking Iran's nuclear facilities a lot this week, which would absolutely mean war for obvious reasons. Are we seeing them ramp up consent for a war with Iran? IDK \n\nObviously averting ww3 and seeing a end to the conflict in Ukraine would be a plus & I never thought they should be allowed to join NATO.

I'm not a big fan of Zelensky from the start. The war shouldn't have started in the first place. For Ukraine to be a part of NATO means a threat to Russia's security. This whole thing is a waste of resources and sadly, human lives are involved. I'm sad for the Ukrainians but trump is right, Zelensky doesn't have the cards except for their minerals. Sadly, that's how the world works. People are only interested in what's beneficial for them. If it wasn't beneficial for the Americans, of course things will get nasty in the oval office because lots of American taxpayer money has gone to funding the war. Also, i think it is just plain foolish for Zelensky to think that the funds are \"gifts\". They are not \"gifts\". These are all the hard work of American taxpayers' money and it doesn't make any sense for a president to gift billions of dollars away just like that. What I see in the oval office is that Zelensky is an entitled president, he feels entitled that USA must help him which is not in the case. Two scenarios that I can think of is one, Ukrainians need a new president that is on good terms with President Putin and can achieve security through diplomacy. Second, is to negotiate with China to assist with mediation. Ukraine can do this but they're just too proud and egoistic at the expense of their citizens' lives.",
