He obviously didn't win, but he recruited a lot of people to organize with the campaign which was the intent. With the people he organized he went on to open a printing press related to anti capitalism and they distributed 10k papers a week at times.",

Last year Philadelphia officially ousted Republicans from the city Council entirely and put 2 Working Families Party people in the council at large seats. While not outwardly socialist, it's still great to see even a crumb of working class politics.     \n\nKeep in mind, these people may not be able to do M4A or socialized medicine, or stop the imperialist exploitation of third world countries, but they can do a lot to improve you and your neighbors' lives: Localized public services, like internet, water, power, and transit; housing improvements like housing first and rent control, urbanization or better city planning; and rather critically, policing and police reform. All of these are things the city has *direct* control over, and even in cases where they are restrained by state law, they can apply significant pressure towards state legislatures to allow reform, especially if many cities or a large city is clamoring for it.",
