Those chapters must be absorbed, to understand the rest. \n\nDai\u2019s recommendations (in this thread) are good places to start. Be sure to read the Manifesto. Also, tackle Value, Price, and Profit (Marx). That gives a shorter look into the value model and the labour theory of value which is key to understanding Marxism. \n\nThe other recommendations are excellent,too. \n\nOne thing about Marxism is that it is a method of analysis based in dialectical materialism. That is the underlying epistemology of Marxism. That is, dialectical materialism is the way Marxists know what they know. It is the philosophy that guides how inquiry decision- making, and actions. \n\nLenin wrote that theory is everything. To me the very first place to begin is with theory. That sets a person up to better understand the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, et al. I want to know _how_ they use Marxist theory in their analyses. \n\nI recommend reading\u2019The History of Philosophy: a Marxist Perspective\u2019 by Alan Woods. Sold through Marxist.com.",

It's intimidating and difficult, but it's not impossible. Just try to gradually build up your reading stamina over time until you feel comfortable to start reading volume 1. Marx has many shorter texts on value theory which can prepare you, as others have mentioned.",

Capital was still very hard, and amazing, but hard.\n\nThe challenge is that Marxist philosophy is as complex as any other philosophy. \n\nThis type of learning does not come easily, and Marx makes this clear in some of his writing. He also says that the world of matter in which we live, is a complex organic whole. Deep understanding of such domains requires a great deal of effort. He says the mental effort will be like climbing a high mountain. \n\nHe and Engels did not talk down to the working class of Europe when they wrote the Manifesto; they believe that progressive and advanced layers of the working class are capable of getting it so long as they are willing to put in the effort, over time. Do not be hard on yourself. What you propose to embark upon is a rich and deep field. (It is also crucial because society is headed toward revolution and professional Marxist revolutionaries will be needed to guide the process.) Go for it comrade. Start wherever, but do not allow the complexity discourage you from the effort.",

Many people read Capital or any other book because of threads, ideology, or just to claim they read it, but without real interest on the content of the book itself. As such they get distracted very easily and then become not able to follow the reasoning, then claiming it is difficult.\n\nBut Marx has other easier and shorter books that are very important to read before going beyond, such as \"Critic or Gotha Program\".\n\nDavid Harvey has a book called \"A companion to Capital\" which helps you to understand Capital as you read it.",

The result is that many Leninists end up saying things about Soviet Union that Marx himself had already said the opposite. Things like claiming that Soviet Union was socialist which not only the writings of Marx will tell you it wasn't but Lenin himself discussed in a party congress that his government was not socialist yet, but \"State Capitalist\" (his words).\n\nBut being honest about this things makes many Leninists assume you are just talking against Leninism when it is not true. It is literally quoting Lenin himself.\n\nMake sure you actually understand what Marx wrote about what makes capitalism and what makes socialism, before reading anything beyond Marx.\n\nBooks from Lening are not introduction to Marxism but to Marxism-Leninism. And both are not quite the same.",
