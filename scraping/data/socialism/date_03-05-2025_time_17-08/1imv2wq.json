    "selftext": "It's good they've got their act together for a big protest. But they've got the privilege of land ownership to help that. \n\nIs that mainly what they are protecting? And right wingers have a kind of virtue signalling stand up to the government thing to appeal to a group that does an important but dirty job\n\nI personally don't like it. For personal reasons investigating the harmful damage of pesticides and farmers free spraying them, or due to animal ethical reaso s. But I think we have \"farming capitalism\" which is to say farming in socialism is different. How? More people growing food in their house and selling it locally. ",

I presume you are referring to the UK protests. \n\nFor a while wealthy people have bought up land as a tax free way to pass on wealth to their children. This increased land value. \n\nThey still get a 50% discount compared to anyone else. There are somewhat easy and legal processes to pass on land and assets tax free anyway. This policy does affect only private investors not actual farmers. This will dissuade rich people buying farmland for tax purposes so should bring land values down or at least at a slower rate. \n\nThe right like with most political points have jumped on it as it\u2019s a vested interest. Farage has \u00a33m in land iirc.\n\nEDIT: just re read what you posted, on your final point 100% agree. As an aside a lot of these \u201cfarmers\u201d blame government but dont dare go against the supermarkets who have underhanded practices to make sure they arent paid well.",

The end goal for farmers from the left is better farming tools so they don't need pesticide.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nUnder socialism they would be pushed into much more profitable coops and the larger businesses broken up into coops. The farmers are not going to be replaced by people growing tomatoes in a pot. It's ineffective and inefficient to modern agriculture. The reason you offer that solution is because you haven't examined other options.\u00a0\n\n\nThere will always be farmers and farmland under any system. The farm land being controlled by the working class means government control. Freeing them from the burden of debt to the finance class who privately owns the land would improve their life through ownership of labor value. Coops allow for larger scale operations without diluting their contributions and meeting the needs of the people.",
