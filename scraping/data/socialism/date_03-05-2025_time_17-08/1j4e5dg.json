I was also just watching an Italian video about miniskirts where this pic is featured in also says something that the skirt was worn in kabul and Tehran before the taliban so iran and Afghanistan.\n\n[https://youtu.be/oMDgVHIXqtY?si=bJD86DThnqdAvlHY](https://youtu.be/oMDgVHIXqtY?si=bJD86DThnqdAvlHY) (at 1:05)\n\nThis is by now way confirming the origin of the image I just feel like media messed up a lot on this particular picture. If you anyone finds it feel free to correct me.\n\nThe meme is shit but how should we respond to them? What sources do you recommend?",
