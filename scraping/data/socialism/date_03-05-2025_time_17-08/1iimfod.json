    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m working on a Riot Grrrl-inspired zine series for my senior thesis that explores what it means to survive under economic oppression\u2014especially for those in low-income households, women, LGBTQ+ folks, BIPOC, and other marginalized communities. As someone who experiences economic oppression, and in light of the current state of the world,I want to document real stories about struggling with wages, housing, healthcare, food insecurity, workplace exploitation, and the impossible choices we have to make just to get by. \n\nI would love to hear personal stories and experiences and include them in my series (anonymously or not). I thought this would be better than finding random things on the internet. If you\u2019d like to share, here\u2019s an example of what you could discuss: How have recent policies made things harder? What does survival look like for you? What do you wish people understood about your experience? \n\nYou can comment here or DM me if you prefer anonymity. I\u2019m posting this on a few pages in an \nattempt to reach a lot of people. \n\nNo pressure, no judgment\u2014just a space to share and be heard.\n\nMuch love & solidarity <3\n",
