    "selftext": "I enjoy doing outreach to people of all political beliefs: it helps me refine my own beliefs by holding them up to scrutiny while having the benefit of sharing what I\u2019ve learned with others.  I wish all debate worked that way instead of just being about winning but I digress. Also: keep in mind I\u2019m keeping jargon to a minimum because I don\u2019t want to get bogged down in explaining every term and debunking misconceptions: you gotta speak their language.  \n\nBasically: I asked them what does efficiency actually mean in the context of capitalism.  It means \u201cbuying goods for as cheaply as possible, paying your workers as little as possible, while selling goods at as high of a price your customers will pay.\u201d \n\nWho does that efficiency benefit?  It doesn\u2019t benefit the worker or the customer: it only benefits the people at the top, the actual capitalists.  \n\nSocialism proposes the people/workers should control the means of production in order to solve these problems.  People are naturally incentivized to be efficient: no one wants to work harder than they have to or pay more than something is worth.  \n\nWhen the people/workers own the means of production they\u2019re incentivized to do what is best for the worker AND the customer.  If you\u2019re part owner of the company you work for you obviously care about how employees are treated out of self interest, you\u2019re incentivized to care about the customers because you care about the long term well-being of the company you work for.  It doesn\u2019t make sense to screw customers over and hop to another company like capitalists do.  Heck: it even helps create a more environmentally conscious company because most people care about the place we live and the planet we live on.  \n\nCapitalism incentivizes none of those things, it only incentivizes greed.  \n\nIt went on, but I wanted to hear what y\u2019all think.  \n\n\n",

Continuous growth shouldn't be a goal of an economic system (that is devoid of other ethics such as human decency). It never ends well. Oligarchs just want to privatize every sector of the economy, and when they have monopolies, they treat their employees and customers with complete disdain because, well, they have all the power and control in the situation. They want us to be completely dependent upon them which is why Trump is currently dismantling the federal government. \n\nIt's like living in one of those old company towns where you also pay the business owner you work for your rent, groceries, etc. Never good for the worker. Too easy to be exploited. \n\nI'd also mention that no system which serves the greater good is *always* going to be efficient. That is not the point of a system which would provide housing, healthcare, food, education, etc.  People will be more efficient in their work, however, when they feel valued, respected, and given a fair wage. Capitalists would never!",

But we\u2019ve seen how good regulating capitalism has worked (not very well.) They will always try to get the government to reduce or not enforce antitrust laws and they generally succeed due to how powerful they are (bribery loopholes, threatening to hurt a rep\u2019s constituents by closing their businesses there, offering to open a business to help a rep\u2019s constituents etc etc.)\n\nBasically: the mechanism that is supposed to keep capitalism restrained is vulnerable to capitalism itself.",

I'd argue, a smart enterpreneur would, just as the workers in this example, care about a sustainable businsess model. This is only achieved when they don't have to fear their workforce leaving / striking and by establishing a loyal customer base. It's a tug and pull and some sort of Nash-equilibrium is reached. \nNow Monopoloies are a whole another beast, which can easily take on the toxic traits you ascribed to capitalism as a whole. But saying that all capitalistic business ventures will inadvertently be run by vultures doesn't seem realistic to me.",

Why don't you want to give in a little, pay your workers more than just a livable wage, maybe even let them participate in company decisions? And why set the value of your goods so high? Sure, you're gonna make profits, but undoubtedly your customers are going to have a bad experience with the price.\n\n\"Who does that efficiency benefit? It doesn\u2019t benefit the worker or the customer: it only benefits the people at the top, the actual capitalists.\"\n\nCorrect. Capitalism is designed to maximize profits while maintaining as low as possible of a price for expenses, exploiting both the worker for their labor and the customer for their money. Anyone who says \"capitalism doesn't exploit workers\" is flat out lying to your face. Sure, you're gonna get paid, but only a fraction of what you make. Let's say you make $500 worth of sales, you may only get paid $60 that day. And it'll add up. You don't, in fact, get paid fairly. A huge portion of profits will inevitably end up in the hands of major capitalists.\n\n\"Socialism proposes the people/workers should control the means of production in order to solve these problems. People are naturally incentivized to be efficient: no one wants to work harder than they have to or pay more than something is worth.\"\n\nWorkers should absolutely own the means of productions. We, the proletariat, do the heavy lifting for the big multi-billionaires who sit on their bum in luxury. We should make our own profits for us, not for them. We choose our own schedule, for when socialism is established labor-time needn't be extended farther than we want it to be.\n\n\"Capitalism incentivizes none of those things, it only incentivizes greed.\"\n\nYes. We are not judged, professionally, by who we are as a person, but as how much of a worth is placed on us for the generation of profit. Greed has been placed down deep into us, so instead of holding the value of a community, where everyone helps all together, we instead see others as competition for the position we want to hold.\n\nIf you think I made a mistake, let me know. :)",
