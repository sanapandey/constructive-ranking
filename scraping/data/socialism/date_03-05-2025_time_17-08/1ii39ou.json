If you have the means think of ways you can offer your support, even get together with people in your organizations or friend groups and think of ways to help. Then reach out to him. Do not let this comrades life changing sacrifice be forgotten. He gave up 10 years of his life for the struggle. If you have any available means, think of how to use them to ease their transition to life on the outside. It's the least people can do.",
