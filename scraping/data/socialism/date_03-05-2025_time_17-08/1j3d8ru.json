            "body": "> why one would care to start their own business under socialism?\n\nSame reason you do under capitalism. You want to solve a problem or provide a good or service to a community that is lacking. Very few successful businesses were started because the owner wanted to make money. No. They were passionate about resolving a problem and had the knowledge and capital to make it happen.\n\n> Is there still an incentive to create, how would it work? \n\nYes. Well if some creation / invention solves the problem better than the status quo then then you are incentivized to use that creation. Take for example a dishwasher in a house. When buying a house or renting an apartment, is that a feature you look for? Would you be willing to pay more (even if it's just $1) for a place with a dishwasher? If so, why? You're not generating any profit with that dishwasher. It will generate actually 0 revenue for you. So why do you value it? It's because it makes solving a problem (dirty dishes) easier. You're willing to put in additional effort (in the form of money) for this thing.\n\n> Would the workers collective start an organization and that\u2019s the business or does the founder get a larger cut?\n\nDepends on the flavor of socialism. If the entire economy is still capitalist but the business operates under socialist tendencies you might want to check out syndicalism and see how cooperatives function to answer your question. There are many ways people approach this question.",

I used to do it professionally but stopped because neither the pay nor the hours were conducive to a family life. Under socialism I could afford to be a cook again. I could open a small place to feed people in my community good meals that I'm excited to prepare for them AND have dependable housing for myself simultaneously. It's what I would probably be doing now if money wasn't a concern",

                    "body": "Exactly. Most people who start their own little buisness do it because they are disillusioned with tolling away for someone elses project and passions. I work in a factory setting, the pay is pretty good, I like the people there, the work is ok. But I have no ownership over it. I know it's not MY project. I have no say in the economic direction, I get none of the profit, the product is not my concept or style and I don't have control over that.\n\nThe lack of ownership I feel over the work I spend 7-8 hours a day doing is called \"alienation\", and most workers feel this and it's a MASSIVE cause of depression, burnout, exhaustion, bad social relations at work and people quitting. You spend the most energetic hours of your day intensely working at something that doesn't feel like its yours, and then when you get home you are too tired to do any of your own passion projects, at least not for more than an hour or two. For creative people, that is suffocation and death. \n\nI would like to paint and write more, but 90% of my physical and mental energy goes towards working for someone elses passion project. \n\nSo, as a response to this, many people freely choose to liberate themselves from this alienating \"working at someone elses thing\" to actually work on THEIR thing that they can have full ownership over. Under a market system they need to compete and sell this thing, though, which can again make people feel un-free and exhausted again, but not always. \n\nIn socialism, workers actually DO have ownership over their work. Either by having meetings where they vote over decisions, or are a team that communicates well about where they want to take things. That means you actually DO feel that some of your values, your style, your \"soul\" is in the stuff you produce or provide, and that lessens the feelings of alienation, and makes the work meaningful and yourself invested in it. That could mean that someone starts a coffee roastery alone, or with a friend, and own it together. They control when, how much, for whom, with what machine, in what package it is made. If they want to expand later on, they can find another partner that also shares an interest in coffee roasting, and that new person then also becomes part-owner in the buisness, for example after a trial-period where they see if the relationship works. If conflict arises, they need to solve it collectively, maybe a breakup happens, like in capitalism, but with entitlements to your own provided value in the buisness. \n\nIf a market doesn't exist, they people will make things because they, and others, value it. The same reason you do housework. We make our homes beuatiful, healthy, efficient, entertaining, practical and relaxing - even washing shit off the toilet and doing dishes - for free. If we live with someone, we do it for ourselves and each other through communication. Some gravitate towards cooking, some to decorating, some to fixing the broken door. And the person who cleans the shit because they don't mind it, won't have to do all the other stuff all the time, so prefers that. We do all this for free, because we like it, want it and need it to live good lives.",

At least for some who looked at businesses that began in that way, many of those individuals developed no class consciousness about why it was that they fled in the first place and then they themselves made businesses that exploited.\n\nI'm largely curious, because, yes, I just started a business. Why did I start the business? For the very reason that you've outlined, I want my projects to be my own. But, that said, I've actually become a better socialist in the process. I have long considered myself a socialist, but I'd call it \"wikipedia article deep\" meaning, I skimmed the cliff notes, said, that's neat and never went further. Starting a business has on the other hand engaged me much deeper, I'm reading tons of socialist literature. And much of this desire to deepen my knowledge is based in this desire to make sure that my business is run as ethically as possible under capitalism and to ensure that it operates as a co-op with equal say and equal pay for everyone involved. Also, it's my desire to get rid of workplace hierarchy.\n\nThat said, there is in me, this deep fear of not doing it right. And so, there's a part of me that goes, \"well, fuck, I'm the petite bourgeoisie and no matter what I do it'll be unethical\"\n\nCurrently I'm just me, artisan level, so whatever, but my goal is to create a sustainable business model that can grow and hopefully benefit those who choose to work at said business. I just worry to some degree that my very existence puts me at odds with everyone else.",

So if you start your own business by yourself the surplus of that business is yours under socialism. If you need others to help you then you will need to cut them in as a partner in a cooperative structure. No exploitative relationships like employer and employee. So under socialism you can come up with an interesting business idea that excites you and then you and your friends or whoever you find that has the skills you need to make it real can all profit together. So instead of working for an established cooperative you could be creative and come up a new idea or better service. It becomes capitalism only when you are the owner of other peoples labor production without cooperative/democratic ownership. So if you and your friends made the best coffee shop in town and the coffee shop grosses 500k a year and you and your 5 fellow owners run that shop you will be democratically deciding how to spend that money. One example might be that 3 of you work full time and have personal money invested in it. While the other 2 have no investment and only work part time. The percentage split you voted on would result in the 3 of you make 120k a year and the other 2 make 70k. Also you would work out a split of the ownership of the property the business owns. So workers not only get dignity to be a partner and pay as a co owner but they also have a stake in the property accumulated by the business. This is why it\u2019s not perfectly equal but creates wealth distribution across society. \n\nIf it was a capitalist business\u2026  you are the sole owner of that 500k and you hire 4 workers at 38k a year (because that\u2019s the going market rate for rental humans this year) you take the $300k that they helped you make and call it yours and talk about what a smart business person you are. You can brag about all the risk you took investing in the place when in the end you also own the equipment and real estate for the coffee shop. The humans rented by the hour as wage slaves do not own anything and have no say in the business. \n\nSo now you can see why people who currently own all the businesses and property are afraid of socialism? Business and innovation are possible under socialism. But there will be no capitalist kings and robber barons who can milk the life force out of workers to funnel it upwards without working.",

(I can\u2019t remember if it was technically a socialist or communist article, so I may be off base)\n\nFor example, you could open a corner store and work in it with your spouse and nothing would really be different than the current system. If the store does so well that you need to hire 1-2 workers, it would still operate essentially the same as capitalism, except your employees would receive a higher salary and benefits. When your store is so successful you expand further and hire more and more workers, it begins to operate more like a co-op, your workers will get a % profit share of the business and major decisions will be voted on by all who contribute. If your business goes on to become the biggest grocer with multiple locations, where it provides an essential service to the people and how the business operates affects the communities as a whole is when it would be \u201csocialized\u201d and no longer belong to you.\n\nAs I understand it, with the exception of essential services and corporations, businesses are not so different except they remove exploitation from the picture and everyone gets a share of what their labor produces. I know this is a \u201cperfect\u201d scenario, but it\u2019s how I\u2019ve always pictured it.

The only lack of imagination is taking for granted that petty production will always exist. As a Marxist, this idea is transhistorical nonsense.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to set aside the question of liberation struggles of oppressed nations in the US, which is essential in any settler colonialist society. But petty production engenders capitalism and can only reproduce these existing social relations - to the contrary, the only way to eliminate social contradictions is to put politics in command, which means eliminating private property. \n\n\u201cSocial good\u201d, \u201chealth of society\u201d etc, are not meaningful terms, because they erase the class contradictions and obscure reality. \n\nThe person I replied to is a committed reactionary and is not proletariat. The \u201cHolodomor\u201d is a fascist concept and is fundamentally anticommunist. The idea that we have to appease the ego of those whose class interests are opposed to the vast masses of humanity is little more than the liberal \u201cmarketplace of ideas\u201d. It has no bearing on how social change is actually made.\n\nEdit: you believe in \u201cparanormal encounters\u201d. I hate tot tell you this but your Marxism is seriously flawed and you should go back and study dialectical materialism through Marx, Lenin and Mao.",
