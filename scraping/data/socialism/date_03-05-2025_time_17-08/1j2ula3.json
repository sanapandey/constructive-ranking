European leaders have failed to address this reality, which, according to Member of European Parliament Marc Botenga from the Workers\u2019 Party of Belgium (PTB-PVDA), reflects a fundamental lack of vision for a self-reliant Europe. \u201cThe US should not be our model for the kind of society we want,\u201d Botenga argues. \u201cThousands of people are sleeping on the streets in the US, while it continues to dominate the world as an imperialist force. We need a Europe that takes a fundamentally different path.\u201d",

But Europeans never felt band together. Also Europeans do not speak the same language which is a big problem in communication. However most Europeans do speak a second or third language, but Europeans still communicate in English as widely spoken language.  European parliament do not care about the people, they are making those plans for Europeans without Europeans have anything to say in their plans.  EU is going for war because they want to invest their military complex after Trump gets elected and EU is panicking at this moment.",
