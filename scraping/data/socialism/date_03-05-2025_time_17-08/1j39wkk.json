    "selftext": "Everything is getting worse relatively quickly, a lot of that is just shock doctrine that will probably not make it through courts, but I am nevertheless overwhelmed. Red scare is back in full swing, Gaza is kind of pardon my French fucked, people like me are getting their rights stripped even faster than before. And the only \u201copposition\u201dparty in the country is sprinting as fast as they can to the right. \n\nThings suck, so bad.\n\nThis is not a post to just moat about it. It\u2019s more about how I cope with it.\n\nAnger\n\nJust a lot of anger, like a copious amount of it.\nLook fellas for me it\u2019s between this and despair and I realllyyyyy don\u2019t wanna go there. Be angry, be FURIOUS even. Remind yourself of the capitalists that get to dictate our lives and even our deaths while smiling and laughing from their skyscrapers. You can only do that for so long until you cannot but HELP but get off your asses to do something about it: whether it be organizing your community or workplace, doing mutual aid, hosting workshops, whatever it is.\n\nOf course no one will talk to you if you\u2019re just 24/7 angry, for the most part, keep to yourself or others you confide with. Be optimistic, try to inspire others and find out their issues, and whenever a strike comes you get to use up all that pent up anger and SCREAM UNTIL YOUR LUNGS GIVE OUT\n\nThat\u2019s my two piece, I guess. There\u2019s other ways to cope and other mentalities are probably healthier. But I\u2019ve never been the type to celebrate until we actually win so for now anger will have to do.",
