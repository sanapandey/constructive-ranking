    "selftext": "I don't know if we can post his name freely anymore but one very fortunate consequence of the offing of the health care parasite was that my company is now offering us some nice health options and gave out a good bonus end of last year.\n\nLooks like the company could momentarily shift its focus on maximizing profits and use some of the surplus value that we produced to immediately improve our lives if it wanted to after all. They simply chose to pocket all this value and send us to the meat grinders of capitalism.\n\nimmediately after the news events aired, my material conditions as a worker improved a bit. Got a fat bonus end of last year and my insurance got a slight bump that will help me keep up with rising cost of living. So Thanks for the sacrifice comrade L. You have at least made a few workers lives slightly more enjoyable.",
