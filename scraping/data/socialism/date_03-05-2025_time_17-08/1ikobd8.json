We need to protect ourselves and our neighbors. \n\nI think despite the fact that we\u2019re socialists / communists too many of us went along with Biden and the CDC\u2019s vax and relax mishap in 2021 and it ultimately has become a mass disabling event / an additional war on the working people and the people who were high risk/disabled/immunocompromised prior to Covid-19. If we\u2019re truly for community and protecting vulnerable people, we should be wearing masks in shared spaces (a surgical mask is better than nothing but ideally a properly fitted KN95 or higher.) \n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to mask in bars, parties, concerts, or other social gatherings, please at least consider doing so on public transit, at grocery stores, the doctors office, really any public shared space that other vulnerable people inhabit or where you could potentially spread disease / viruses to immunocompromised and disabled folks. If you need mask info or recommendations, r/masks4all is a fantastic resource. You can also check for mask blocs in your locality which usually provide access to free masks, etc.\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019re going to downvote me for this comment, I would encourage you to really evaluate and consider whether you are truly in alignment with antifascism / consider your ethical and moral values vs your actions and ask yourself if they are something you can live with.\n\nThe bottom line is that those of us who did vax and relax, realistically, in retrospect should have never listened to the CDC and Biden when they told us we could stop masking. The data shows that they were sorely, sorely mistaken and they only did so in the name of capitalism.",

But no, it has nothing to do with the modern socialist movement, which is concerned with the ways capitalism constrains the lives of the vast majority of humanity and prevents them from acting according to values they otherwise would.\n\nThere was a movement called \"utopian socialism\" or \"utopianism\" about a hundred years ago, but it failed to change the world in any way because humanity's problems aren't because of a lack of better examples, but a tiny class of amoral people who ruthlessly prevent the world from changing so that they can keep living off of everyone else's work.\n\nJust as a concrete example, what you eat. You as an individual can spend more money on food, or more free time on gardening. But in addressing the problems of the majority of humanity, spending more money or more free time or labor is not a serious option. If there were money or labor time left on the table the capitalists surely would've gotten to it before you.\n\nA better argument than I can make here, by someone who lived through the death of this trend and its replacement by political socialism, is Friedrich Engels's \"Socialism: Utopian and Scientific\":\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm",

Be active and be social.  Take care of yourself physically and mentally.  And be happy in as ethical a way that you can.  Find ways to take little bit of power for yourself (purposefully vague).  Encourage people away from victimhood and towards motivating them to resist.  Towards power.\n\nBut don't view this as a value system if you can.

            "body": "Yes. On top of the really great advice given so far, you may consider game nights with friends and communities that support marginalized peoples. Certain game shops are really friendly and welcoming to trans people. Being in these supportive spaces can make a difference. Bring cooperative games around children in your life. It may seem silly but teaching communal values is great. There are certain tv shows and other properties that push these values a little more (and if you're sharing your life with a young person, help them see when it doesn't). I struggle with my nephew who takes after his dead (ex-bro-in-law) who is really hyper competitive and has a sore loser/winner streak in him. His favorite game was monopoly. He was mean. Over about four years that we've spent a lot of time together, he's softened and become a bit better of a team player and cares a bit more about those around him. I haven't gotten him there yet but I see some change.\n\nShare labor wherever you are. If you're in a union, a political group, or some other body that meets regularly, volunteer to do traditionally feminized labor if you're a man. If there's note taking to do, do it so it doesn't get thrust on a feminine person in that space.\n\nIf you're in the US and you can, tip well at restaurants. If you have wealth of any sort, give to charities that are spaces in your community that are truly helping those in need. Some soup kitchens are better than others.\n\nIf you can join a school board or other local body, do it. You don't have to scream Socialism! wherever you go but being on a board that over sees employee contracts or other spaces... you can have a big impact on a few individuals around you.\n\nBut, socialism isn't these things. In a way it is. A lot of the things socialists really care about boils down to a lot of these silly few things. But in bigger ways, this won't affect a socialist change. But your post isn't about that.\n\nWe're currently trapped in a capitalist system and need to fight against that. But we need to sleep at night. Do the kind things that help you sleep at night so you can help others understand why they should change, too.",
