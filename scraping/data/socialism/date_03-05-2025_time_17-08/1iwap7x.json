Socialism does not aim to outperform capitalism on capitalisms own terms. Socialism is anticapitalist. It aims to build an economy that meets human needs, provides meaningful work, and solves urgent social problems. On those metrics, socialist countries often [outperform](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/siso.2013.77.1.10) capitalist ones.",

Replacing capital and currency is a struggle when it\u2019s necessary to even cooperate or compete with other nations. \n\nIt\u2019s a dichotomy between communist internationalism vs neoliberal globalization",

Really, anybody is welcome, anarchist or other. he is an ancap, but still cool and pretty rational in his ideology and respectful of other ideologies. But I remember him telling about how he was joking with the Cuban government people about western anti Cuban propaganda / media and how nice Cuba is compared to how its portrayed. bascally complete opposite of how it's portrayed in real life.. if I remember correctly, it was LA times and some other media outlets that were putting out the rat eating story, and those or somewhat left leaning outlets from my understanding. It's quite interesting that they would do Cuba like that and put out blatant lies. Cuba has obviously had an uphill battle with the sanctions and all the unfair things been done to them, but gotta give credit where it's do... its damn near like a paradise there all things considered.",

I point out that despite its flaws Cuba has similar life expectancy and higher literacy rates than the US and many of the reasons that socialist/communist countries don\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d is because of the political choice to not trade with them. No capitalist country would \u201cwork\u201d either if it wasn\u2019t able to trade resources on a global level. It\u2019s not that socialism failed these countries, they just haven\u2019t been endowed with some natural resources present in other places, and the capitalist world refuses to work with them. It\u2019s not an inherent fault with socialism. \n\nAlso, any time someone cites how many have people died under \u201csocialist\u201d/\u201ccommunist\u201d countries (e.g famines in the USSR) I always point out that every single person who has died from a preventable cause e.g. hunger, curable sickness, homelessness, work place accident due to corporate negligence, etc. in the west has died because of capitalism. Our economic system chose to let those people die. Is that a system that is \u201cworking\u201d?",

I\u2019m not saying the big ones did not commit mistakes, they did, but look at Cuba for example: Cuba was genuinely an incredible success for all intents and purposes. The country completely extinguished illiteracy in just a few years and grew to be a medical powerhouse. The government was very popular with the population and the revolution was success. The issue came when the US fully isolated the country with sanctions: Cuba is smaller than several US states. It\u2019s a tiny island that could not be self sufficient and fully reliant on trade. Cutting it off with the world is killing it. Nowadays Cubans are lacking access to vaccines, to food and other basic necessities, but the fault doesn\u2019t lie in socialism: it lies in US imperialism trying to suffocate it.\n\nI always say it\u2019s like there\u2019s two runners, one better than the other, but the bad runner goes and pulls out a gun and shots the good runner in the feet. The bad runner will run the race, but is that indicative of their actual abilities as a runner?\n\nAgain, there\u2019s many criticisms to be made about the big socialist states, there\u2019s things to be learned from. But ultimately, socialism is objectively better than capitalism and the failure of its global growth is more due to United States\u2019s Cold War efforts than anything else.",

                    "body": ">Contrary to Adam Smith's, and many liberals', world of self-interested individuals, naturally  predisposed to do a deal, Marx posited a relational and process-oriented view of human beings. On this view, humans are what they are not because it is hard-wired into them to be self-interested individuals, but by virtue of the relations through which they live their lives. In particular, he suggested that humans live their lives at the intersection of a three-sided relation encompassing the natural world, social relations and institutions, and human persons. These relations are understood as organic: each element of the relation is what it is by virtue of its place in the relation, and none can be understood in abstraction from that context. [...] If contemporary humans appear to act as self-interested individuals, then, it is a result not of our essential nature but of the particular ways we have produced our social lives and ourselves. On this view, humans may be collectively capable of recreating their world, their work, and themselves in new and better ways, but only if we think critically about, and act practically to change, those historically peculiar social  relations which encourage us to think and act as socially disempowered, narrowly self-interested individuals.\n\nMark Rupert.

They just technically became part of the extreme poverty since their Income became very low compared to the GDP per capita of China. The current poverty alleviation efforts are basically attempts at eliminating extreme poverty in rural areas.

Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I do this first to explain that modern economies and nations are very unstable and that \"both sides\" recognize state intervention as necessary. People get uncomfortable fast when you show them pictures of a frozen Texas that had the feared bread lines!\n\nThe next thing I do is explain that taxes are a collection of the surplus of labor and we make decisions as to where that goes and how it's used, including shoring up failing businesses. Part of this is to establish that the big scary things of socialism are regularly in use and employed by the Right and Capitalists. It then shifts the argument about who gets government support to be a moral question - it keeps going to businesses in the western/capitalist system but rarely are we supporting workers the same way.\n\nThe final thing is to dig into various socialist countries and look at how western intervention caused instability and collapse. Here it's about historical conditions to understand why a country \"fails\" or not. I think this context is necessary in understanding why socialists countries have failed and why other countries have \"succeeded.\" Breaking down what that success means is important.",

World poverty is going down, but if you remove China world poverty is going up. A lot of people will say it\u2019s not socialist because the country implemented capitalism. Which is a fair argument, but they\u2019d still have to concede a half communist half capitalist country works very well. They might say it\u2019s failed because of the moral issues or the authoritarianism. Which I\u2019d agree with, but the beginning of America wasn\u2019t so moral either. \n\nAnother example would be Vietnam, it isn\u2019t wealthy, but the citizens pay less in taxes and have less people living in poverty compared to Ireland. But their healthcare is worse.\n\nI also like to compare Haiti and Cuba. A lot of people say it\u2019s failed because of how poor it is, but they have a better quality of life, lifespan, income and access to housing than Haiti; and Haiti isn\u2019t being bombarded with an embargo like Cuba is.\n\nThere\u2019s been successful past countries that have ended. Upper Volta in Africa was extremely poor and when it went socialist and became Burkina Faso the country became food self sufficient within 4 years (declared by the UN). When the leader was assassinated the country fell back into poverty.\n\nHeres a good video on the subject https://youtu.be/DIV3HH878Lc?si=IkDVJzqdTPi3UlP4",

Under this metric, socialist countries outperform capitalist ones very handedly.\n\nCompare Cuba to the Dominican Republic, Cuba is far more stable and prosperous DESPITE US sanctions and embargo. China lifted 800 million people out of extreme poverty since 1970s, meanwhile the US has been in slow economic collapse for a while now.",

Does not refer to the social democratic tradition (e.g. Rosa Luxemburg) that was represented by the 2nd International, prior to its break with socialism in favor of the European idea of the welfare state (capitalism). Modern Scandinavia is an example of social democracy.\n\nFeel free to send us a modmail with a link to your removed submission if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\n\n\n- r/socialism's mod team.",
