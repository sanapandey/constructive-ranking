This is an unjustifiable war of aggression to expand russian territory and strenghten its position in eastern Europe.\n\nUS bad does not imply Russia good.\n\nThe russian goverment is as corrupt and as subservient to the interest of the owner class as any \"western\" government.",

And even if, Ukraine at the start of the war would have been a third party.\n\n>Is Russia supposed to sit back and just let Ukraine join NATO?

It is no different from the coups organizied and supported by the CIA in latin america during the last century.\n\nWE ARE BETTER THAT THAT!",

They've taken hostile action towards other countries, sure, and there's a million legitimate complaints to make about NATO, but \"bullying Russia\" is not one.\n\n2. The invasion started in 2014, not 2022. Ukraine started receiving weapons because Russia showed that it was very much willing to engage in direct military attacks on Ukraine.\n\n3. Russia wasn't let into NATO because the one time they asked, they also wanted a shitload of special privileges that would have basically re-vassalized eastern Europe.\n\n4. Russia, in this invasion, has been murdering, raping, and deporting Ukrainians, oppressing their culture and language, and then pushing in Russian settlers. Then they they and brag about it on their state media to their people, and even advertise it as something to help accomplish. I would *really* like to hear how NATO provoked them into doing the exact same shit to Ukraine that Israel is doing to Palestine.",
