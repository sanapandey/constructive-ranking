    "selftext": "I feel like before stating the question, I should explain a few things (feel free to skip to third paragraph). I come from a post-soviet country, were any form of leftism is treated at best like a joke, at worst like a high treason. Socialism is equated with laziness and thievery. Gay and trans people are just joke material. School teaches us that Ronald Reagan was based, while any non-white rebel was a dirty savage.\n\nDespite that, I've come to call myself a socialist, or at least a non-specified leftist. Part of the reason is that i just fall in the target demographic: I'm queer, from a poor family, part Roma, atheist, basically no other ideology would accept me with such ease. I've also have studied a fair (but not impressive) amount of marxist theory, and i also attend American Studies faculty, so i learned a fair bit about disastrous effects of the neo-liberal policies and their imperialism.\n\nDespite all that, i have to admit - I don't feel like a real socialist. There's some concepts i just can't figure out how are supposed to be superior - like abolishment of currency, doing away with borders, Police dissolution. I'm yet to understand why I'm supposed to be respectful of USSR and communist China, rather than seeing them as evil empires. I've also have some trouble connecting with certain social justice causes. This may be a cancelable offense, but i sometimes think about a high percentage of crimes committed by minorities (including my fellow Roma) and think, poverty doesn't justify all of it, if they could control themselves better they situation might get better. I'm also, despite being gay, sometimes embarrassed when i see public displays of queerness to the point of being annoying to other people. I fail to see how Kink community can help me get gay marriage in my country. I don't know why so many LGBT+ insist on normalizing sex to an unthinkable (for me) degree, like public nudity and swingers clubs.\n\nI say all of this not to hear scolding or consolations (though I don't mind either), im asking where can I identify this problem. Do i just need to watch more leftist video essays until it gets stuck in my brain? Would reading more marxist theory help? Or is it a deeper problem, am i simply apathethic and hateful, brainwashed by my conservative country, unable to shed instilled bigotry.\n\nI don't want to be like this, i don't enjoy being a leftist who doesn't really get wealth distribution, a Roma who thinks other Roma are criminals. But i just don't know where to start. Would you mind helping me?",
