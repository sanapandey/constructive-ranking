Which it\u2019s like a deterrent in and of itself, which is already terrifying enough. \n\nIt feels like we are locked into just peaceful protesting until something happens? \n\nWhich then the government (by government i mostly mean SCOTUS, Donald trump and his goons) proceeds to ignore all of that and keeps doing the horrible shit anyway.\n\nIs there anything that we can do? It just feels like a constant roll down a hill and we can sometimes get up and slide down on our feet, but then we trip and it\u2019s right back down to tumbling like a log. ",

The last land-based conflict in the territory was the Civil War, the last mass enlisting of troops was 2003, that became very unpopular, so now they use drones and private contractors.\n\nIt seems like it would take something truly awful to prompt the type of crisis that revolutions spring from.\n\nEdit: sorry if that comes across as despairing, it's meant in the genuinely inquisitive, open exploratory sense.

It has people of all kinds of backgrounds, and because socialist governments have been so thoroughly unexplored past the Soviets and whatever offspring here and there that survived American capitalist intervention that aren\u2019t even communist in the traditional sense anymore, we have no unified vision of the future to get behind. When fascists do fascist things, they can all get behind the idea of hating trans people and undocumented immigrants, and it\u2019s in the name of capitalism, which we\u2019ve been familiar with since the invention of this country. Meanwhile, on the left, we have any variety of leftist ideologies that we ideally would want, but they can be very different if you have people ranging from DemSoc to a generic socialist, Marxist-Leninist, anarchists (of which you have different kinds of anarchism), etc. \n\nOutside of a lack of a unified vision, we do not know each other even in this Reddit community beyond the walls of this screen with text posted by anonymous users. Social media has thoroughly decimated the idea of ever needing to meet face to face anymore, and we have substituted physical third spaces with Facebook and Twitter. We can\u2019t congregate in a church or something like black people did, for example. Hell, we can\u2019t even hang out with each other after we get off of work.\n\nFinally, this is something I feel that hasn\u2019t been pointed out here yet, but I believe that the lack of a communist antagonistic superpower like the Soviet Union was for the states is severely handicapping any form of progress made. When the Soviet Union, which had an ideological predisposition for a globalized socialist society, collapsed, the US no longer had any adversaries to keep its worst tendencies in check. For example, part of the reason why black people managed to succeed in gaining more equality was because the Soviet Union was smart enough to point at and propagandize the plight of black people in America and go \u201cHow the hell can you people call yourself the land of freedom and opportunity if you were founded on the bondage of people of color and the continual discrimination and subjugation of them today?\u201d, which forced the United States to go \u201cFuck, they\u2019re ruining our image on the global stage. Nobody will buy into capitalism if they think about what we keep doing to black people\u201d and play ball by signing the Civil Rights Act.\n\nI\u2019m afraid we no longer have an adversary like this who could bring out our better qualities. I wish China were this, but I don\u2019t get the impression they care all that much whether anyone else is a communist or not, and their version of it is already poisoned enough that they can barely even call themselves socialist anymore. Unless China were to step up with some grander design to uplift the working class, which I don\u2019t believe is happening anytime soon, then we have no peer in this world. We have absolute authority to act without impunity to the point where the CIA doesn\u2019t even bother assassinating random leaders and figures anymore since there is no point.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot going against us, and we\u2019re fucked. At the very least, I wish we could rally behind one idea and push for it. Personally, I\u2019m not a communist, but if the majority of the proletariat agreed \u201cWe need communism\u201d and we had the guy for it, I\u2019d gladly throw support behind them for the sake of moving past whatever the fuck this technocratic fascist bullshit we have now. I\u2019m also not a DemSoc, but fuck it, I\u2019d be for them too. I\u2019d gladly take what I\u2019d consider \u201cmere averageness\u201d over this any day. I literally do not care how we get there, but I desperately want out of the current situation.  I don\u2019t think the rest of the leftist community shares this same sentiment though.",

They jump from the Civil Rights movement to the late 60\u2019s and leave out the global context which makes it seem like they were simply responding to American problems. They leave out the part where hundreds of US activists were illegally traveling to Cuba to meet with Castro and to Hanoi to meet Ho Chi Minh\u2019 and that the discipline that the Panthers, Weathermen, and others were attempting to emulate in their collectives were inspired by. By eliminating that part of the stories and scrubbing and sanitizing our history they have robbed us of our ability to organize and feel solidarity with other oppressed people and movements.\n\nAmericans have always largely stood by when other Americans are being attacked by Americans. We\u2019ve always been divisible by nonsense like racism and religion, and we\u2019ve never gotten over having had a king after the Revolutionary War and have harbored this weird obsession with the \u201clifestyles of the rich and famous\u201d ever since. Disney has built its empire on \u201cprincess envy.\u201d We\u2019ll pick the factory owners over the workers and unions, the cops over the oppressed, and turn our backs on whoever the immigrants du jour happen to be, even if they\u2019re Native Americans. We\u2019ve been collectively numbed by being buried under mountains of meaningless and worthless consumer BS that we\u2019ve bought on credit and have settled for \u201cfeeling rich\u201d instead of demanding what we\u2019re worth and standing up for our collective wellbeing.\n\nUnfortunately, I think people in America are going to have to be really hurting before they take to the streets, organize, and even revolt, and risk being hurt, but by then we\u2019ll probably have already been divided to the point of futility. The scrubbing of our recent history of the global revolutionary movements as the FBI, CIA and others were destroying the Panthers and democratically elected governments throughout Central and South America has deprived us of a sense of unity with other oppressed people around the world and destroyed our ability to effectively organize\u2026 because we don't know how, or when we do, they usually stop us by pumping cash, cocaine, and sex into any burgeoning movement and commodifying its message, personalities, art, etc. Third parties get funded and conned into running presidential candidates rather than building movements.\n\nI believe that we can still effectively boycott, organize, and build an effective movement against these fascists because they're greedy and incompetent, but Americans have been under the spell of the greatest propaganda coup in history where we believe that we\u2019re the center of the universe, the defenders of democracy and whatever, while most of the rest of the world knows us as a sponsor of global right wing terrorism, fueled by elaborate weapons for drugs schemes. It\u2019s going to take a lot of shock and shaking to wake people up I\u2019m afraid, especially when so many of us have been conned by the Democrats for so long into just voting for them because they\u2019re not Republicans, and otherwise associating movements with personalities.",
