    "selftext": "Remember that the pendulum of political fortune swings one way only.  It will always swing back again until the economic system changes to the next one.\n\nAnd remember that we must have the majority of humanity behind us, supporting us.   This current swing to the far right is essential to the preparation for the fulfillment of that requirement.  It is going to have to get ugly, and this will result in wholesale abandonment of far right politics and setting the groundwork for a socialist revolution, world wide.  **It cannot fail.**\n\nIt cannot fail.   If the world becomes a far right world,  the world's people **will** respond to take it back and establish world-wide socialism.   There is no case of fascism being a centuries-long political condition.  So cheer up and keep working for awareness of the connections between the end-stage collapse of capitalism and the oppressive politics of far right authoritarianism.\n\nGood days are ahead.  There is no alternative future!",

            "body": "This is a fair point, and a welcome bit of optimism. My only point of contention is this: With the advent of the industrial revolution, nation states both found themselves in need of resources on a global scale and in possession of the weapons to help them in the acquisition of those resources. Mass produced, automatic firearms acted as a labor power multiplier for these colonial states, the means of production in the industry of colonialism, producing enslaved populations in colonized regions using the labor of the colonizing populations. It was the mechanization of violence that enabled the economic system of colonial capitalism. My worry in our modern age, is that we could see a historic parallel to that technologically enabled stratification of power in the development of autonomous weapons systems, and the various mechanisms of social control offered to the bourgeoisie by the digital media ecosystem that is evolving alongside information and communications technology. As this technology matures, I fear it will threaten the very ability of the working class to organize and indeed to offer any effective material resistance. I don't think this is inevitable by any means. Currently i don't believe that level of tech exists at the necessary scale. But, it's important to recognize that such a future, a sustainable, global fascist regime, if you will, can not be ruled out entirely.",

I appreciate well thought-out replies like yours.\n\nI have also alternated between thoughts about those same issues and worry about those same issues.  My optimism about the future has its basis in the realization that the people are always the final and ultimate political power.   Faced with such opposition as you describe, people tend to be creative.   For example, there is always guerrilla warfare, which can include such mundane strategies as theft, arson, abduction, nation-wide strikes, and a host of other strategies. \n\nCertainly technology in the hands of oppressors can be devastating but I cannot imagine such tactics holding the population in obedient control forever.",

The genocide in Gaza, Trump's electoral victory and dismantling of the US government, the election in Germany where the AfD is gaining power...I'm really not trying to be a doomer, just realistic. But it's hard to have hope when it feels like the monsters are winning, and we know they want us all dead.",

What OP is trying to emphasize is that socialism isn\u2019t just an idealistic goal for us but an inevitability. Fascism is what happens when capitalism is in crisis. As workers start to gain a semblance of class consciousness due to weakening material conditons, the ruling class has to gain control of the workers again by redirecting anger towards vulnerable minorities and suppress left wing movements. But this can only work for so long. As material conditions tumble under fascist regimes, workers will gain class consciousness at a break neck speed.\n\nThe struggles you pointed out-genocide, dismantling of government, and far right electoral wins-are symptoms of capitalism being unable to prop itself up any longer.\n\nSocialism will never come out of a time of peace. Class consciousness comes only during grim times.\n\nIt is these dark moments that gives us the ability to create a better world.",

On the other hand, having the purpose of trying to build the groundwork of this actually had made me more happy than I was last year leading up to the election. It's kind of like I've hit the point of feeling like I have nothing to lose. \n\nAlso, we have global warming on top of this and mother nature will kill humans if she needs to. Maybe we'll be long gone before the pendulum swings back our way. Kind of disappointing, but also weirdly gives me peace",

Each time the pendulum of political justice swung back to the left, it went farther than it did the previous time.  That's how we got civil rights after FDR.
