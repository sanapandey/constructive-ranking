                    "body": "What's wild about this era, is the reason \"anarchist\" gets associated with these images of the tnt in here is due to their response to massacres. After the [Ludlow massacre ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre) multiple anarcho communist groups made attempts on Rockefellers life. Packages meant for him that detonated before going there, constant threats. He began to lobby the DoJ to go after, detain and deport anyone who vocally supported these groups. Emma Goldman was probably one of the most famous names that got the boot in that deportation operation. Rockefeller had a disdain for all socialist and labor movements but felt particularly appalled and threatened by anarchists (looking to kill him) and marxist communists who vocally supported these groups and strikes. Racism against Italian, Slavic and Yiddish immigrants played a role in this propaganda too.",

                    "body": "Fun fact. Until the 90s anarchists couldn't immigrate into the USA. They didn't change this law until the 90s, when they declared \"the threat to no longer be significant\". There were actually professors who couldn't get work visas because of this. Now there's professors, usually from Europe or Latin America who hold classes on campuses such as \"marxist\" and \"anarchist\" studies. These professors, also do hold race theory and historic discussions.\n\nI figured I'd mention this for people who thinks trump is the reason behind this. This is America baby. Socialism, Marxism, anarchism are all theories and movements with more mass appeal than the early 90s. Congress didn't lift the visa/immigration ban on anarchists because \"it violated freedom of thought\" it was because \"the threat was no longer significant\". It only took about 25 years for them to begin showing alarm over foreigners who hold the same opinions. Now they want these people out of the American education system, because theyve discovered that's a marxist/leftist strategy. Higher education theory and organizing. Students are going to face deportation for politics, then the web of anti racist and leftist education will be broken up.",
