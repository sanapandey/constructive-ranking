    "selftext": "I know this is reddit but put aside your own personal attachment to being above everything you see on the internet for like 45 seconds just in service of a discussion. \n\nWe need a leader, in America at least. I hate the myth that all leftists ever do is complain on the internet, because there are people organizing but it is extremely grass roots. We need to get behind someone, obviously a guy like Bernie Sanders would be an ideal candidate, but I know people on this sub would have issues with him. Part of the reason the left has a \"Joe Rogan\" problem is because we are slightly more principled. We do not rally around Hasan or Vaush (...) because we see the clear issues they have and we call them out on it. But we need someone who can direct what we have and I think we need to start thinking about putting our eggs into one basket. \n\nTake what is happening with Elon Musk, whatever your opinion in on an actual Nazi takeover of the US you cannot deny that he is currently running a playbook not dissimilar to you know who. We need to weaponize ourselves as fast and effective as we can because the goalposts are changing. I can find examples if you need but people are already shifting from claiming they want to deport undocumented people only, to \"anyone who flies a foreign flag.\" If we continue to allow Elon to run unchecked now, there will be nothing we can do to stop a full on genocide. \n\nWho can we look to? We always like to laugh at the \"good germans\" but at least they resisted in the streets. ",

As Chris Hedges says, the left has been totally decimated, it almost does not exist in the US.   \nHe also says the only way we can push back is too increase union membership to get some power leverage. And as we all know , union membership is the lowest in 100 years. And why, because all companies and the elite know that is the only way people can get leverage and they want unions out.   \nSo where does that leave socialism ?",

Does not refer to the social democratic tradition (e.g. Rosa Luxemburg) that was represented by the 2nd International, prior to its break with socialism in favor of the European idea of the welfare state (capitalism). Modern Scandinavia is an example of social democracy.\n\nFeel free to send us a modmail with a link to your removed submission if you have any further questions or concerns.",

This is also why many ex panthers formed the black autonomist federation, which has gotten things done you won't hear much of all about; why? Because it's a need to know community level basis. Anarchists vote on every single group decision after discussion like a congress, or they come to a consesus with a mediator. They are directly democratic organizations. They have leaders in experience and theory but not in name. This makes it extremely hard for an infiltration to impact decision making. I'm not discussing this from an ideological standpoint, I'm simply stating a material fact. Marxist organizations holding rank and file top down leadership often sap morale of participants, lead to constant splits, and if one or two leaders are compromised the entire national group can be.\n\n\nI've gotten hate for saying it as a marxist but it's a material fact I've observed. Anarchist networks allow for more direct participation of individuals, it allows individuals to be involved in decision making which builds organizing skills thus creating more leaders than followers in the ranks within the group.  When you have more leaders, less followers, a few cointelpro plants are useless. They'd have to literally convince the group to vote on their agenda without being called out or shut down. They couldn't simply compromise a centralized leadership and thwart the organization.",

Actual anarchists of the time were in italy, hanging out with red brigades being hunted by the cia during the years of lead. The fbi was referring to a bunch of lifestylist hippie drop outs, not the black autonomist networks that formed after the collapse of the panthers. If you study the modern history of the movement you'd realize that the elements the fbi refers to in this document are the exact elements anarchists like Lorenzo Kom\u2019boa Ervin went to war with. He claimed they weren't actually revolutionary anarchists but countercultural individualists. \n\n\nThe police have openly admitted decentralized networks are hard to infiltrate and police. We're not in the 70s, so I would assume this is common knowledge. The state openly admits it. A common problem of modern policing is dealing with organizations that hold more abstract or fluid organizational forms. If you read the books on policing and counter terror from the sources themselves, you'll see them talk about this.\n\n\nNone of those zines look like anything you'd see an anarchist in modern days put out. The fbi was putting out articles in queer journals denouncing stonewall too, so I'm not sure your point there. They thought they could use anarchist elements, and it didn't work on its own. They had to bastardize the name of anarchism because it was a threat if allowed to exist and thrive in its actual form.  Why do you think they hijacked the term libertarian and coined terms like anarcho capitalism? This was apart of the efforts you mentioned. Propagandists were trying to use anarchism to attack the broader left, and they got largely decried by every anarchist who had a materialist understanding. It simply didn't work in doing much but helping anarchists purge all of their reactionary elements when the cia created \"anarcho capitalism\" for them to flock towards. The desired result was \"anarcho capitalism\" became the \"new anarchism\" of the west, which failed miserably.",

They do not hold the belief that their projects should be limited within the framework of idealogy as stated, \"These groups should not be composed of anarchists alone, anyone who intends to struggle to reach given objectives, even circumscribed ones, could participate so long as they take a number of essential conditions into account. First of all permanent conflict, that is groups with the characteristic of attacking the reality in which they find themselves without waiting for orders from anywhere else. Then the characteristic of being \u2018autonomous\u2019, that is of not depending on or having any relations at all with political parties or trade union organisations.\" \n\n\n\nI only bring this up because Marxism can use democratic organizing structures.

Different phases in revolutuon call for different approaches.\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is denounce the idea that the ezln not being an explicitly anarchist project means they don't take lessons from or offer anarchist struggles solidarity. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/aaV5oE2F6zQ?si=bti1RQ8ppOq-bIRg",

I think that maybe not necessarely a leader, but at least a group, an emobodiment of the ideals and the revolution is needed. This can have its critique, but it is something that is engrained in the political culture of basically all countries right now and we are not going to get people mobilicized if we dont take a part in it. Because in the end, people might not understand fully exactly all the theory of how this is in their best interest, but if they have a clear image of the movement, and they believe they are going to see their lives improved, they may not have read marx or lenin, but they are going to suport it. And this in the end is represented by a symbol (or direct action with this people, but this is more difficult). I would not say that all the russian revolutionaries were very well read. Same with cuban revolutionaries. They see how their life might be improved, all through the embodiment of the ideals in not necessarely a leader, but a spoke person. Fidel castro and Lenin are symbols for a reason. Same with Sankara., Ho chi minh etc etc. Even in more \"descentralized\" movements we see people like Fred Hampton. Obviously other measures need to be taken, but i think cult of personality has its place, obviously with careful considerations of how to make it happen. Is better a spokeperson that a leader that can be murdered and with him the organization. Obviouly this differs depending of the type of organization. In the end, the repressive aparatus of the state tries to take down leaders for a reason. discourages people. The only problem is that a good spokeperson has to be found, or maybe not even that, has to appear. Feel free to correct anything i say.",
