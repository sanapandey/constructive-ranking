In a lot of ways it was its last semi-benevolent arm that provided billions of dollars in literal life saving nutrition and health to refugees around the world, which is why the current admin is dismantling it. It has also facilitated CIA operations and used as a carrot approach to forcing countries to adopt financial reforms and other capitalist reforms.\n\nDon't fall into the same lack of critical thinking that is driving USAID's systematic destruction. It is first and foremost being dismantled due to white supremacy.",
