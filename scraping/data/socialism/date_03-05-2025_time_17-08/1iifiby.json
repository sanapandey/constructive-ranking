    "selftext": "Hi ya'll. So I'm kind of in a pit of despair that I've fallen into before that I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get out of this time.\n\n***A little background on me (\\*\\*skip to the end if you don't care bc I got a lot to say \ud83d\ude2d):***\n\nI have had a horrible past few years. and I mean HORRIBLE. I don't really have any real friends. I have 3 friends I talk to on a consistent (not in person because I live 3+ hours away from all of them) but I don't really have much in common with them anymore (they're all liberal/centrist, PRO-capitalists, not actual capitalists bc they have no capital) and are too busy talking about themselves/finding a way to revert the convo back to themselves. The only person I truly have who is there for me is my mom but like all mothers she is not perfect and does/says things that really hurts me (which I have let her know). But i also have no money/job and am at the start of my career and am having a difficult time finding a job whether its in my field or not so moving away is not an option.\n\nI decided last year to start organizing and started a local chapter of a revolutionary org (i won't say which). When I tell ya'll I was SO EXCITED to start this org and find like-minded people and create a space/home for others who feel the same way. And I was even more excited when our regional coordinator told me that other people in the area reached out about starting a chapter. I thought \"this is it. it's all going to change\". Boy was I wrong. Long story short I lasted  about 6 months with our self-appointed, micromanaging, honestly borderline liberal \"leader\" after humiliating me in a zoom meeting in front of all the other members over a mistake I had made, before finally calling it.\n\nI think there is truly a fundamental problem with telling people to simply \"get out there and start organizing!\" I've come to realize that the types of people who tend to dominate orgs/social movements are much like the people who dominate churches if that makes sense. Lots of abusers. Lots of narcissistic behavior. And before people get in the comments saying \"join another org\" these people also participate in all the other local orgs too \ud83d\ude2d DSA, PSL, you name it.\n\nAlso, before anyone in the comments says, \"Girl, go to therapy,\" just know I've TRIED, and for several more VERY LONG reasons, that's not an option. However, if you're in therapy and it has been successful I genuinely love that for you \ud83e\ude77\n\nSorry for all the whining! Now onto the part that really matters:\n\n***CONCLUSION***\n\nI guess I just want to know how others who have maybe gone through similar things got through it. I would also love to hear any quotes/get reading suggestions on the topic if anyone has any!\n\nIs it possible to be a \"good\" socialist/communist/leftist if you in a way pull back from society? and I don't mean total off the grid living or a hyperindividualistic way. More like in a \"I'm not sure there ever will be a revolution, especially not in America, and while I yearn for the liberation of the oppressed, I don't know if the oppressed will ever be willing/able to conquer all they have internalized\" kinda way.",

If your only concern was the problems at your local orgs, I would have different suggestions that involve the work you need to do to try and fix them. But right now it sounds like you are having personal difficulties which would prevent doing that effectively, which is very normal and human, especially these days. My advice would be to just go out and try to find people you enjoy spending time with. Find an art class or book club, or some volunteer work, or something that appeals to you. Try to make connections based on things other than politics. Lots of decent people are fairly apolitical, in fact most decent people hate talking about politics. Once you have that social base, hopefully things will improve for you. It's not easy, and there will be a ton of disappointments. But even just one good friend can make a world of difference and get you to a place where you can go back to organizing. THEN you can worry about being a \"good socialist\"",

We won\u2019t see any kind of huge revolution or something in our lifetimes. I\u2019m not saying we all should just give up, but that I\u2019m probably going to. I\u2019ve already been trying to pull myself back from society like you\u2019ve said.",

            "body": "I'm an Israeli communist, and I think I might have some insights on optimism gained from living in a fascist country.\u00a0\n\n\nFirst, march of history and all that. Economically, capitalism is bound to end with communism in the same way capitalism overtook feudalism. Capitalism is a failing already, and whether it be the clinate crisis, cost of living something not yet clear, this'll all crumble and history will march on.\n\n\nSecond, politics is change. We do not have all the material information to predict what will happen politicaly. People can be fickle amd change often. Do not say you shan't see a revolt, you may not, but it bubbles under the skin of every member of the working class.\n\n\nThird, people, in their base nature, are good. Due to living where I do, I am surrounded by people who support ethnic cleaning at best and genocide and ethnonationalism more commonly.\u00a0 War criminals walk the streets. But when you have a heart to heart with most of them, what motivates them is fear, lies they have been told since birth, and a burning love of their people. A blinding love. They can have their minds changed. They can see the humanity in a strangers eyes. If we help them.\n\n\nWe can, and will win this. Your orgs are flawed. They can still win. Seeing the panic of US leftists after Trumps win is, while understandable, infuriating. You lost a fight. It'll hurt. A lot. But you still have a very flawed liberal democracy. You can and will take back what you lost. The few thousand communists in Israel keep fighting, even when it seems hopeless, because we know people are worth it. You have a light at the end of your tunnel, so fight doubly as hard.",
