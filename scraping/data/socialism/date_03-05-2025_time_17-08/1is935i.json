    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nLately, I've been reflecting on the nature of online activism. It often feels like we\u2019re caught in an endless loop of tweeting and sharing, which makes me question the actual impact of these actions. I\u2019m concerned that much of what we do might be performative rather than genuinely impactful.\n\nI\u2019m reaching out to this community because I want to learn more about the actions we can take that genuinely drive change. Are there specific activities you\u2019ve engaged in that felt truly meaningful?\n\nAdditionally, I'm on the lookout for online platforms that not only allow us to engage with issues but also facilitate real, tangible actions. If you know any platforms where engagement translates into collective action and real-world impact, could you share them?\n\nThanks for any insights or experiences you can share!",

Talking and posting online is fine, but it more often leads into self-isolation and the perpetuation of the alienation from our communities at large, which only helps the enemy keep us oppressed. I didn't participate in any local activism or organizing for a long while, and it kind of solidified this mindset that I was like, the only communist alive in my city, when in actuality, there's TONS of groups active near me who share my beliefs and are working locally to build strong communities of people who will resist and fight together when the time comes. I've joined a party and am attending weekly meetings where we discuss theory, our lives and current events, and put our heads together to try and make plans which will best show the people of our city that we are a force for good and we are allies of the working class and the downtrodden. Aside from being more helpful than reposting tweets and memes and griping about it all day, it has genuinely improved my mental health tenfold knowing that I'm not alone here, I've got a cadre of comrades who care and several activist groups whom I can lend a hand to when I've got time. \n\nIt sounds like small potatoes, but revolution starts from the bottom up with people organizing within their local communities and helping to educate their friends and neighbors that there IS an alternative and a better world IS possible.",

I have to imagine if there were structured actions that we took, that more knowledgeable ones of us created, we could have a significant impact",

It doesn't mean anything if we don't back it up with IRL organizing and collective actions. \n\nFind, join your local organizations, participate in mutual aid projects, etc. Start a local group if you need to with a few like-minded folks.",

We did that as we\u2019re in a smaller place and not everyone has to have the exact same ideals. We decided that we have a similar goal and sometimes people just need a nudge or to know people to start moving further left.",
