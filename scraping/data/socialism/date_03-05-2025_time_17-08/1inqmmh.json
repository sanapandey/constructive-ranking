The Holocaust then served as an additional pretext for genocidal colonial conquest. Is the history of anti-semitic oppression one aspect of why some people become Zionists? Sure. But even if we take that rationalization out, Europeans genociding Indigenous people and stealing their land is nothing new and not unique to Jews at all.",

Sure.\n\nWere some of the Boers who instituted apartheid in South Africa \"hurt people\" due to their persecution under the British? Sure.\n\nAre those experiences the driving factor behind colonialism and apartheid? No. \n\nI'm sure the trauma of the holocaust runs very deep in Jewish communities, both in Israel and elsewhere. But is that the main reason people adopt what is essentially an ethno-supremacist colonialist worldview in order to oppress others and steal their land? No, it isn't. \n\nWe need to view Zionism within the context of the much wider history of European colonialism. Yes, many Zionists have developed a somewhat understandable persecution complex based on the very real and ugly history of antisemitism, but that does not explain the strong links between Zionism and European colonialist thought or the replication of colonial practices that we've seen over and over again all around the world. Zionism is not a totally unique Jewish worldview; we've seen colonial land theft many times before.",
