    "selftext": "I'm looking into a career change. I'm currently a journalist and while writing every day is definitely challenging with ADHD, it is also fun to look into new topics everyday.\n\nBut the thing I cannot stand is the fact that I cannot use my voice or work towards political causes. A weather woman in our local market just got fired for speaking out against the Elon Nazi salute on her private social media for crying out loud. Also I definitely have to write things that uphold capitalism. I do get to inject a little progressive thought in there but not too much.\n\nI've been looking into trades. Great pay, unionized and I get to work with my hands, which I think will be a bit of a mental relief that I need. But trades careers do seem like a huge time commitment with lots of overtime which is used to compensate for the fact that many jobs do not have PTO. Also a huge project in my area is a Microsoft facility (ew) and other builds appear to be slew of crappy unneeded mixed use apartment buildings when we have plenty of old unused housing.\n\nI know there's no conscientious consumption under capitalism, and therefore I believe that extends to no conscientious jobs under capitalism. But the thought of working on buildings that I hate doesn't excite me. Ideally I'd work my way up to being able to be more choosy with jobs, but given I do like a decent work life balance and might not accept overtime as much as others might hurt my chances. Also I'm a woman so I'm guessing I'll have to work twice as hard to get what I want.\n\nAre there other jobs out there that I'm not thinking of? Am I just being a big baby and need to bite the bullet, work my ass off to ruin parts of my city for the next decade, and then maybe I can have some freedom to do things I'm actually passionate about?",

Everything sucks right now and the mentality we have been given is that we can somehow change jobs or cities to get away from the overarching problems in our lives. I have basically never seen that work out for anyone that didn't have a strong drive for that specific thing. Journalism also gives you a position to subtly subvert the messaging you are \"supposed\" to be sending out and keep your writing chops up which is a skill that will be very useful if class conflict erupts into the inferno it looks like it will. We really need journalists who don't buy the propaganda to be working in mainstream sources, doing what they can.\n\nAs someone with ADHD who has done a bunch of different jobs, most of the pull to get a new job comes from a craving for novelty which realistically will never be satisfied fully, especially from work. Learning something new can be exciting but god does it take so much extra work. Believe me I have questioned my life choices many times but for me what made me feel like I was on the right path is finding how to use my skills to help organize and inspire people. I try to make my life choices in such a way that I will be ready to participate in the revolution when the time comes.\n\nIf you were struggling to pay the bills with what you currently make then maybe a career change would be necessary but to my mind it just sounds like you are suffering from living under late stage capitalism which changing jobs doesn't really fix.",

I probably hate my job 20% of the time, can put up with it 60% of the time, like it 15% of the time and love it 5%. Pros: I do have a union and I work with interesting, supportive people within the newsroom so I am a little afraid to leave (though I absolutely hate our corporate owners). But I'm afraid to stay at my pay level as well. I am very much living pay check to pay check with no savings and emergencies go on the credit card. \n\nIf things go well with my partner and I, we would like to have a kid, but I do not see myself financially getting there with the job I currently have. I don't even see myself catching up on some of the credit card debt I've accrued from said emergencies.",

I am in my early 30's and still live with roommates (good communists fortunately) just to make my career work. I have personally come to the conclusion that kids are not in the cards for me unless we have a revolution sometime soon. Keeping people worried about their kids is one of the main ways the capitalists keep us in line. Without kids to take care of, it is much easier for me to take to the streets and not worry as much about the consequences of being arrested or even attacked. That doesn't mean you shouldn't have any obviously, it just means that the current circumstances are very difficult and that many of us must necessarily make the rational decision to not have kids purely because of circumstances and not because of personal desires. \n\nA supportive work environment and a union is nothing to be taken for granted. I chose to become active in my union and develop the skills to really fight for our collective economic future directly. The problems with lack of raises and pay being capped by your union is a solvable problem long term. I know other people have different perspectives but mine is to fight the good fight where you are, because that is where you have the most knowledge and experience to be effective.\n\nThat being said, if things are unsustainable financially, you gotta do what you gotta do. I have taken many side jobs just to pay the bills over the years and I am sure I will in the future. That is also unsustainable a lot of the time but for different reasons. It can make a good start to a transition as you can dip your toes into another field without throwing away your career provided you can deal with working more hours. \n\nOver the last few years I had a similar questioning of my career. Personally I have worked on accepting I don't have as much control over my environment as I would like but in doing so I was able to zero in on where I do have agency and could make a difference.  I left a dysfunctional relationship, got elected to office in my union local, my creative projects started actually coming together finally, I got more involved in grassroots organizing and my quality of work improved noticeably. Before all these things happened, I was deeply dissatisfied with my life and stressed about money/my career choices. I had spent a lot of time blaming myself for things that weren't really my fault and it was affecting my life drastically across the board. I am sure I have more existential crises in my future but I am sure I will get through those just fine.\n\nI relate a lot to the struggle you shared and hope you are able to find a way to get some more stability in life without sacrificing your sanity. Other people have given lots of good ideas if you do decide on a career change, Also a good piece of advice I have gotten is that sometimes there isn't really a right or wrong choice, its just a choice. You will live with the consequences of that choice but it doesn't mean that overall things would have been better if you had taken another path, just different in ways that might even be impossible to quantify.",

They are always looking for people with different skillsets and most would have an open vacancy. Also, network with these organisations cause there is a lot of independent media organisations for those with more socialist leanings which would not be common knowledge for the general public. \n\nAnd broaden your scope to the EU..

There's people who served time for both j6 and militant leftist demonstrations in my union. They were publicized, yet they still have work. Knowing this, along with the long standing ties to certain italians and Irish families, id be willing to bet my union has informants in it \ud83e\udd23. White collar work isn't a place you can speak your mind, or engage in lumpenproletariat like behavior. This doesn't mean you'll agree with everybody on blue collar jobs. A comparison would be the heavily moderated reddit vs the wild west of the internet back in the day type of deal. This is the difference in enviroments between white collar and blue collar work places. \n\n\nThat's not always the case though, just generally. It'll be way harder on your body for sure. Way more dangerous. More ability to use harsh langauge or voice opinions that may be offputting to some. We don't put up corporate images, langauge, and passive aggressiveness in blue collar fields. It's more harsh, crude and to the bone with the energy. A lot of the left come from professional and corporate fields, which I believe has had organizing implications that I've noticed. Thankfully there's plenty of us from more blue collar backgrounds who can counter this. We need more. If you can hang with physical demand, learn to weld, contact union iron workers. Electrician would be another good field. IBEW members get paid. If you want to be more artistic or still media involved while being in blue collar labor.. Google IATSE careers.\n\n\nI bring this up because one would expect the media to censor personalities and voices that go off script. This isnt just that. This is the normal corporate culture in white collar fields. Personality is suppressed, and fake, neat, clean social interaction is manufactured like plastic. Its almost like WASP civility culture reframed with a diverse neo liberal angle. It's not a part of how blue-collar workers interact. Blue collar workers almost resent that culture.",

Some cities will have almost no work compared to others. It can be very sporadic at first too. It's not always a 9-5. This is the case with a lot of these unions due to seniority and union politics, as well as overtime budgets. When I was an ironworker we'd sometimes sit for 9 hours before we started working for 12. The checks would be like 1k a day, then the next month I'd only work once or twice. These jobs were in the NYC area. When I was in the same field down south, I got no union work and had to do under the table welding work for 100 a day. Huge difference.",
