    "selftext": "I\u2019ve seen an uptick in leftists defending/supporting current day Russia, mostly under the context of Russia/Ukraine and a certain connection between Ukrainian military and a storied far-right group (don\u2019t wanna use the word in case that would flag this post). Obviously USSR is a different case entirely than modern day Russia but I was curious how others felt about the country and their politics today. Personally, I think that ever since Gorbachev the country has moved farther and farther into the same realm as capitalism, even so far as setting the groundwork for oligarchy so I\u2019m a little confused as to why I\u2019ve seen so many self-proclaimed socialists talking in support of Russia and was hoping for some clarity.\n\nSide note: my views on China are very different than my views on Russia.",

The West spent the years between 2014 and 2022 arming and training Ukraine's rabid fascists for a war against a Russia they had always hated.\n\nAs leftists, I think we should see this conflict as the last gasp of the Western capitalist order - their last, futile attempt to assert their waning strength over a world that has grown tired of their tyranny. Russia is not some beacon of socialism, but it is willing to fight against the Western juggernaut once again when no other country would step up to the plate, and I respect them for that.\n\nSocialists should celebrate the upcoming multipolar world and welcome the path towards prosperity that has been laid out so skillfully and effectively by China and the Communist Party of China (CPC) specifically. What they've done in such a short period of time without the genocides and wars of centuries of Western aggression is truly remarkable and should be emulated.\n\nThe West's strategy of keeping fascism and Nazism alive to be used against Russia again has collapsed, and the West really has nothing to fall back on.",

The ban on rallies and meetings has not been lifted since the coronavirus. Right-wing groups are once again actively supported by the authorities. Right-wingers, police, Cossacks and others are acting together to round up immigrants. They are also acting separately. All this is happening against the backdrop of a huge demographic crisis. Ethnic Russians don't want to reproduce. Interest on loans and mortgages is 30+%. Despite this, 70-80% of the population has loans. Many have several loans. For many, contract service in the armed forces is almost the only way to earn good money. Education requirements have been lowered. The market needs laborers. Nine grades are now enough to get a high school education. Clericalism and anti-communism are planted in schools. In kindergarten - clericalism. There is a huge problem with corruption. Recently the number of convictions for corruption has increased. But their number is not decreasing. It is more like a change of elites. Church and political figures often allow themselves misanthropic and sometimes outright fascist slogans. They are not held accountable for this. Political cases have become more frequent. One can get a real sentence for speaking out against the current government. With the beginning of the SWO the sentences have increased and become huge. Very strongly conservatism is starting to go even more to the right-wing ideology.\n\nThe CPRF takes an opportunist position. Instead of denouncing capitalism and power, it has been engaged in solidarism throughout the SWO. It tells us that big business and ordinary people have a common task.\n\nThis is a summary of the information.",

There is even a fair number of leftists in Ukraine who want the Russians out.\n\nAll that being said, I think the way the west in general (and the US in particular) has treated Ukraine and this war has been reprehensible. In my read, negotiations for peace should have begun in the first few months of the war, after the initial invasion of Kiev was turned back and Ukraine had given Russia an unexpected and humiliating bloody nose. Instead, the west talked about \"victory for Ukraine,\" as if the goal was Ukrainian soldiers marchine through Red Square. This only became more absurd when the west got what it had always wanted, but never been able to achieve: Finland and Sweden joining NATO, effectively turning the Baltic into NATO Lake.\n\nThe truth is, negotiation was the only realistic way the war would ever end and Ukraine would ever be safe; they're not a major political power, and they don't have a big enough diaspora in the US to risk a world war over, so they would always have to give something up. Maybe a deal in which Ukraine loses those eastern provinces (which honestly seem to be more trouble than they're really worth at this point), but gets expedited EU membership and a mutual-defense pact with other non-Russia-aligned Eastern European states (instead of joining NATO) could have worked. I don't know.\n\nWhat I do know is that the US treated Ukraine the same way we treated Cambodia and Afghanistan during the Cold War; as a convenient source of bodies to throw at Russians, with no attention paid to who, precisely, our weapons were being given out to.\n\nI expect there will be blowback from our tacit support of non- and paramilitary actors with fascist ideas, just like it did in those other nations.",

The Russian Federation is using military force to destroy Ukrainian independence and self-determination, to bring all of the country's wealth of resources under the exclusive control of their imperial sphere. Ukraine's economy will be stripped for parts and turned into a resource extraction operation to fuel the Russian Empire, its people forced to assimilate into Russian culture and forget their own.\n\nThe US's plan is no different, though their methods are more cloak and dagger and backroom deal. The weapons and personnel they've provided have a price tag that Ukraine will have to pay if they somehow don't get integrated into the Russian empire. They will be forced to take out loans from IMF or other organizations of that type to pay for the war, then sell off their economy and impose austerity measures on their population, thus ensuring their country will never have the freedom of self-determination, as generations of Ukrainians will pay for a war that achieved nothing beneficial to them. \n\nSocialists need to identify that there is no lesser evil, not defend one imperial power over another just because their tools of imperial conquest may seem more benign than the other.",

The oligarchs do whatever the state dictates, while having a right to provide feedback and object. (like in China, but more lenient) In the domestic front, the policy seems to be a relaxed social democratic state that imitates the generic European social democratic format. The security state seems to model itself from the old USSR and China and it keeps the security tight. Generationally, still the cadres who were educated in the last decades of the USSR seem to be running the show. Soviet secularism still exists strongly despite all the political rhetoric about conservative values and Christianity, so the current Russian state and society are as diverse as the old USSR with many non-Russian ethnicities occupying high state posts based on merit. So today's Russia seems to fall somewhere closer to the old USSR than Yeltsin's Russia or any state in the Western hemisphere, with a slightly conservative storefront. Then again the USSR was also quite conservative.",
