    "selftext": "Europe is uniting against US new president policy and Russia. Russia is selling their resources to US and China. China is trying to be friendly with both of them, knowing perfectly that both US and Russia feel threatened by its powerful economy.\nIt sounds that anti-globalization is moving directly towards these 4 blocks with centers in: US, Europe, Russia, China. Europe seems the weakest of all 4 forces.\n\nIs it too early to make predictions on how it may go?",

            "body": "Yeah it's too early - depends on how the Russia war turns out, how much influence Russia asserts over the US in the near future, Taiwan's affinity for the US vs China (which may be shifting due to incoming tariffs). There's some chance the US invades one of the many places it's threatened. Also a chance leaders get deposed. I think the outcome of any of those things would set the stage a little more meaningfully\n\nWe went the entire cold war without WWIII happening; it's still evitable, just maybe less so with the rise of nationalism. Speaking of, maybe India would also play a pivotal role but idk alot about them",

                    "body": "You're correct about India. Its role in a supposed post-capitalist society (technofeudalism) is immense. Nowhere in the world can the bourgeoisie find such skilled workers with very low wages. Global economy relies on services rather than transformation industries everyday more and more, and India is the key factor for this. China's wages are increasing a lot, and can't really play this role. Even though I'm a historian,  can't say I'm qualified to make predictions, but I still think it's safe to say analysts are underestimating India's role A LOT, even in today's economy",

If workers are only communicating online or work too much, if their values are predominantly \u201ci am going to become a new millionaire if I work hard enough, others are losers\u201d (they want to become labor aristocracy), it\u2019s unlikely they will organize revolution",
