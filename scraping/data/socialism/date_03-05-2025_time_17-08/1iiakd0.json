Those can be about socialism as a political movement, about shared struggles, or about anything else.\n\nHave you recently finished a book about queerness that you would like to recommend others to watch? Are you looking to gift someone an introductory book on eco-socialism but don\u2019t know which one to choose? Want to take a break and read an engaging novel but don\u2019t quite know where to start?\n\nPlease share it with us!\n\nYours in solidarity, >!until the robots rebel!<.\n\n\\- Automod",

It\u2019s a solid deep dive into incel culture online and how that has led to real world violence. I think it also has a lot of important things to say about how young boys behave online and what they are exposed to. As someone who fell into the alt-right YouTube pipeline as a teen and then had to climb my way out as an adult, it is eye opening and hits close to home.\n\nFor fiction I would recommend the book \u201cSlewfoot\u201d by Brom. It\u2019s a nice New England witch horror story with some killer artwork. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re into classics then I would read \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d by Dostoyevsky. You would think it\u2019s boring the way people talk about it, but it slaps.",
