    "selftext": "So I recently got into a disagreement with someone about tipping hotel room cleaners. I figured, obviously tip them, they need the money because they aren't paid enough. The person I was talking to was all, \"ahh everybody expects tips nowadays, there's no way I'm tipping them.\" \n\nLiterally so insensitive.. like corporations intentionally don't pay service jobs enough and lots of service workers as a result are reliant on tips for their income. \n\nHowever, by tipping service workers, am I just continuing to enable their employers to pay them less? I figure I should keep tipping, and obviously in the long run we fix service industry wages, but that doesn't mean we should quit tipping, right? ",

Every single employee made $78/hr that day. \n\nhttps://people.com/human-interest/ohio-pizzeria-owner-gives-full-days-profits-to-employees-to-show-appreciation/\n\nAnyone who tells you tipping is necessary for restaurants to operate is lying to you.\n\n Now, of course, some restaurants make a lot more profit than others. It may be true that some restaurants rely on exceptionally cheap tipped labor to stay afloat but if your business relies on heavily underpaying your employees that probably means it shouldn't exist.\n\nAll that said, I do still tip because that is the state of the world and refusing to tip only hurts the employee. \n\n*Maybe* something would change if there was a concerted movement for everyone to stop tipping but still that would only immediately pressure the employees, not the owners.",

            "body": "Until the problem that causes tipping to be a necessity (wage theft) is solved, I think you should tip folks. Participation in a system isn't an endorsement of it. But, do make sure you tip the workers directly. A lotta places have automated the \"tipping\" process, and all that does is give the money directly to the company, which then uses those funds to subsidize the workers' wages instead of actually giving them the tip. Specifically at places like Chipotle your \"tips\" are pooled, divided, and given back to the workers as a \"bonus\" in the place of giving the workers a living wage. \n\nI believe the concept of \"oh well, let's all stop giving tips to service industry workers to stick it to the corporation for being cheapskates\" is a woefully misguided protest against the practice. Instead of not tipping anybody  with the hopes to... I guess force service workers to fight these exploitative practices and the powerful groups behind them (?), we need to show solidarity with these workers by organizing together against those groups. An act of wage theft against one group of workers is an assault on us all, and fighting that by deliberately worsening the material conditions of your fellow man is ridiculous.",

There is no organizing or momentum to support people who rely on tips in the absence of tips, so it would not be beneficial to deny them their income.",

We don't tip at auntie Anne's pretzels or the like, typically the workers press the NO button before we even confirm the payment.\n\nWe don't tip when we get coffee or donuts in person.

If we get multiple drinks or special drinks them we will typically add a dollar or 15-20%.\n\nBut it's ultimately on these businesses to pay their workers and I as a low wage worker can only offer so much myself to others.",

It\u2019s gross. I hate tipping anywhere, but I understand I have to do it because it keeps food on their table. I hate receiving tips too. My boss starts people at my job at like a third under minimum wage  in my state with the expectation that a shitty commission structure that is hard to make kick in and tipping will compensate for everything. It sucks because people don\u2019t come in expecting to tip me in my line of work, but I need it to survive, and it hurts when they leave without giving me anything. \n\nI consider tipping to be the equivalent of panhandling for people with employment.
