    "selftext": "The IMF gives out predatory loans to countries that need money to build infrastructure. When these countries fail to repay these loans the IMF forces the governments of these countries to perform austerity measures that do massive cuts on critical government programs that help the poor and working classes. These austerity measures are nothing but a way to extract maximum wealth from poor and underdeveloped countries that desperately need money for infrastructure.\n\nNow my fellow American citizens are feeling how fucked up these slashes are. Unfortunately unless some miracle happens, it gets much much worse from here because now government will be redesigned to provide 0 support and just extract wealth via taxes we give to the federal government. The federal government is the biggest employer in the US. These austerity slashes will kill so many jobs which has the ripple effect of the entire economy going downhill (yes much worse than now, I'm talking trucks no longer delivering food and medicine.)\n\nWhatever happened to Greece, Argentina, Pakistan, Kenya will happen right here in the US and it's not gonna be pretty is all I'm going to say. Luckily class conscious is sort of growing so we may get a massive left movement if we organize ourselves properly. I'm happy the mask is off for the billionaires. They are flexing their power on us basically.",

That's why they still talk about \"the next four years\" instead of assuming there *won't* be another fair election in this country. \n\nI think that cognitive dissonance will either manifest as an uprising unlike anything this country has seen before or it will cause people to dig themselves into their beliefs harder. They will refuse to accept that America is failing and they will stop behaving rationally. (Much moreso than that has already happened)",

Eventually they will run out of things to blame. \n\nEventually this regime will either crumble or their ambitions will extend to world domination and then the entire world will descend upon the US in a world war.",
