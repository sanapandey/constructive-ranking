Once i arrived home i mentioned how elon has access over our social security thru doge, which in turn gets him pretty heated because i've shown distaste in billionaires before. ",

They reported me as a \"antifa\" and trespassed me from their job site before firing me. A coworker said feds went in and interviewed the boss. I was trying to organize and salt the place yes. We live in 1984, just assume there's always some type of snitch in America. As long as they can't find out any illegality, it doesn't matter much. It's apart of the life. To be a true leftist you have to be as comfortable/ok with dealing with the same level of police attention a member of the Gambino crime family would. You have to have the mentality \"I know they watch I know their friends keep eyes for them, but they can't find shit but deeznuts\". There's always eyes, always the concerned citizen who holds fear that will report you, or speak of you. Let them. Have no fear. Just don't say anything illegal around people you don't trust, with phones, or in places that could likely be bugged (homes,leftist spaces)\n\n\nEdit: that being said get out of there as soon as possible. You can't organize or do much for long while living under the direct roof of an informer. That makes their job so much easier. The idea is to surround yourself around people hostile to them, making their job harder. A fictional and fun example, Tony sopranos family did not trust or like cops. He felt safe in his own home, knew he wouldn't be questioned or forced to say things that could be on wire. Walter White on the otherhand was surrounded by cops and agents in his own family. He had to put up lies and lead a double life within his family. He did not have the safe space Tony soprano had, because his peers were potential informants that didn't even have to be flipped.",
