    "selftext": " I understand how someone might want their kids to inherit their personal property, but many private property, such as land to live in, is just hoarded and inherited by a few wealthy. Its just greed to own so much while others have to slave away just to survive. No wonder they hate socialism so much.. because many want to keep the current system in place where they're in control while everyone else suffers. ",
