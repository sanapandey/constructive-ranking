    "selftext": "\"As a Canadian, I thought I understood what \u201cthe propaganda of the deed\u201d meant when I read about the idea in high school, but I didn\u2019t truly understand this idea until the murder of Brian Thompson. This is because there is a certain type of violence that has long been endemic to Europe and Asia while remaining relatively absent from Canada and the United States; cold-blooded, calculating violence that is very much a part of the mainstream political economy.\n\nIn the aftermath of Brian Thompson\u2019s death, there has been\u00a0[some discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hboeoc/has_there_ever_been_a_ceo_assassinated_like_this/)\u00a0of the fact that politically motivated assassinations of CEOs have been attempted and carried out in Europe up until the 90s, but it\u2019s hard to remember a single instance of this in the USA since the early 20th Century.\n\nAlthough the killer has not been convicted yet, the balance of probabilities would seem to suggest it is Luigi Mangione. Regardless, the act of killing Brian Thompson forces us to think about many things. In this regard\u00a0*propaganda dei fatti*\u00a0is not merely an appeal to pathos, it is very much an appeal to the logos. Not just an appeal, but an act that\u00a0*forces*\u00a0the logos into motion.\"\n\nYou can read more here if you wish: [https://williamtomosedwards.substack.com/p/finally-understanding-what-propaganda](https://williamtomosedwards.substack.com/p/finally-understanding-what-propaganda)",

            "body": "Fundamentally, the violence inflicted by the capitalist system is something that gets ignored all too often because it has been so normalized. That includes, but is not limited to, the US health system. After all, the US health system forcibly restricts who can perform medical services, ensuring that certain groups of professionals largely monopolize those services (licensed doctors, hospitals, clinics, etc.). This is largely justified to protect people from snake-oil salesmen. However, unjustifiably, it then restricts access to those health services, or makes the services so prohibitively expensive as to discourage access, forcing many working-class people to choose between care and bankruptcy. All of this is backed up by the violence of gun-wielding police if anyone tries to create alternatives or refuses to play along. Health care should be available to all without fear that one's home and other assets will be forcibly taken away as a result of getting sick.\n\nThis is not unlike other forms of property and control. People in impoverished regions in the Global South do not simply starve because of an absence of food or a lack of altruism; they are violently prevented from accessing food, from farming land that has been forcibly seized by private interests, and from developing alternative methods of providing sustenance for themselves. There is always the brutality of the police officer or soldier lurking behind any form of private property or any system of legal control. A highly privatized system is particularly egregious because it creates totalitarian corporate institutions that are supported by the violence of the state but are largely free from democratic, public decision-making, mostly dominated by plutocratic interests.\n\n\"If we are in Case 3, I am comfortable with the statement that UHC and Brian Thompson didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but there is something wrong with the system.\" I am not too sure about this argument; it seems perilously close to the \"just following orders\" defence of an Eichmann. Thompson, even if he was simply a cog in the machine who was \"just following orders,\" was still a significant and willing part of that machine. The slave catcher who returned slaves to their \"owners\" may have been following the letter of the law but was still clearly wrong. If the privatized system of healthcare is wrong, then those who support it and lead it are wrong, too, regardless of whether the capitalist state attests to its legality. One's belief that they are in \"a legitimate profession\" or \"following the rules\" does not absolve them of moral responsibility when their profession and the rules are fundamentally harmful.\n\n\"A completely legitimate mainstream occupation (CEO of a health insurance company)\"... I think this is where we disagree. I don't see privatized health insurance as legitimate. The private health system was established through force and infringes on human rights by limiting access to vital care and stealing the resources and labour of working people without providing them with adequate returns. Those who hold leadership positions in an illegitimate institution shouldn't be able to claim legitimacy, either. To me, the degree to which something is \"mainstream\" doesn't have anything to do with its moral legitimacy. However, I agree with your point that this is largely systemic, and eliminating Thompson doesn't fundamentally change those underlying issues.\n\n\"We cannot allow North America to become like Europe and Asia where there is a symbiosis between polite society and brutal violence; Turtle Island is better than that.\" I'm sorry to say that brutal violence is already the foundation upon which most of North American society has been built. As noted, private property, private health care, and other private systems that are an undemocratic dictatorship of the bourgeoisie are supported every day by violence or the threat of violence. That gives the working class population little recourse but to accept a violent status quo or to rise up against it, peacefully or through force of their own.",

            "body": "Luigis alleged Manifesto was mid compared to the ones the propaganda of the deed anarchists would leave. Here's ones statement to the French courts when captured in the late 1800s, he had good reason to believe he was heading to the guillotine to be executed after making this statement. \n\n\n\u00a0\u201c\u00a0While I do not recognize your right to pose to me the questions that you have, I have responded to you as the accused.\nNow, you are the ones that I am accusing. I do not pretend to defend myself. To what end would this serve me, in front of those as well armed as you, having soldiers, cannons, police, and finally an army of mercenaries as your henchmen?\nLet's be logical, you are in power, taking advantage of it, and if you still need the head of yet another anarchist, take it, and when our day comes we will take this into account, and I have the firm hope that on that day the anarchists will rise to the occasion. They will be without pity, because never will they reach the number of your victims.\nIt is not only you who I am addressing, but to all of this selfish, cruel, corrupt society, where on one side we see an orgy and on the other misery!\n\nNo more exploitation of man by man, no more of these managers of sweat, no more salesmen with a mercantile spirit, rapacious, selfish, poisoning, falsifying their products and their commodities, thereby bringing the degradation of mankind. these factories, where they play with the workers lives with an unparalleled shamelessness, like in the factories of white lead where in only a few months the workers find themselves paralyzed and soon dead, or in the tinsmiths who in little time become bald, crippled, weakened in the bones and die in agony!\n\n\nAnd the exploitation of man by man is nothing compared to that experienced by women. Nature is already thankless in this regard, to make them sick 15 days of the month, but we hardly take this into account: flesh of profit, flesh for fun, this is the fate of women. How many young girls arrive from the countryside, full of strength and health, only to be enclosed in the workshops, in rooms where there is room for four and they are fifteen, twenty, without air, breathing nothing but pollution: hardships they are forced to self-impose. By six months they are anemic. From there the sickness, weakness, and dislike of work that is not even sufficient to meet their needs drives these unfortunates to prostitution.\n\nWhat does society do for these victims? It rejects them from her breast, like the leper, puts them on the map, enrolls them with the police and makes informers of their lovers.\n\nDo you think the workers, with noble and generous sentiments, can see this picture of the human life unfurling constantly before their eyes without being revolted? He who feels all these effects, who is constantly a victim of them, morally, physically, and materially: he who is taken at twenty years old to pay his taxes in blood, cannon fodder to defend the property and privileges of his masters: and if he returns from this butchery, he returns maimed or with a sickness that renders him half crippled, making him go from hospital to hospital serving therefore as experimental flesh for these messieurs of science. I know what I speak of, I who have returned from the carnage with two wounds and rheumatism, a sickness that has given me four years in the hospital and which prevents me from working.\n\nThese crimes are committed in broad daylight, after being plotted in the corridors of the government, under the influence of a clique, or the caprice of a woman, while shouting over the rooftops: The people are sovereign, The Nation is sovereign, and under the buzz words of patronage - Glory, Honor, Homeland, as if there were several homelands between all beings living on the same planet.\n\nIt is also, in the name of civilization that exists these distant expeditions where thousands of men are killed with a savage ferocity. It is in the name of civilization that we plunder, that we burn, that we massacre an entire people who demand nothing [more] than to live peacefully in their homes. And these crimes are committed with impunity because the law doesn't cover this type of theft and armed robbery, au contraire: We award medals to those who have led all this carnage, medals to the mercenaries who have taken part, in memory of their good deeds, and these unconscious ones are proud to wear this insignia which is nothing but a diploma of assassination.\n\nBut on the other hand, the law severely punishes the worker to whom society refuses the right to exist and who has the courage to take what is necessary which he lacks, where there is superfluous amounts. Oh! And then this one is treated like a thief, brought before the court and finally returns to end his days in prison.\nVoila! The logic of our current society.\n\nAh well, this is the crime that I am here for: for not recognizing the right of these people to die of plenty while the producers, the creators of all social wealth, starve. This is why I am telling you: you are not condemning me as a thief, but as a conscious worker, who does not consider oneself to be a beast of burden, taxable and thanklessly exploited, and who recognizes the undeniable right that nature gives to all human beings: the right to existence. And if society refuses us this right, we must take it with unshaking hands\n\n\nNo, I am not a thief but a sincere revolutionary, who has the courage of his convictions and who is devoted to his cause. Within current society, [where] money is the nerve of war, I would do all that is within my power to procure it to serve this noble and just cause which would purge humanity of all of the tyrannies, the persecutions that it has suffered so cruelly.\nAh! I have only one regret, which is to have fallen too early into your hands, this preventing me from satisfying an implacable hatred, a thirst for vengeance that I have vowed upon so infamous a society.\nBut what consoles me is that there are combatants that remain, because despite all the persecution, the anarchist idea has germinated and the theoretical revolution is ending, being quickly replaced by the practice of action. Oh, then, that day - rotten society, governments, magistrates, exploiters of all kinds, you have lived! LONG LIVE COMMUNISM\"",
