    "selftext": "I'm doubling down and making a thread. He has said a lot of downright contradictory and confusing statements. It first began in the occupy movement, when he called people's response to weeks of police violence and repression \"a cancer\".\n\nHe literally said, \"I would classify violence as the destruction of property and vandalism, the shouting of insulting messages to the police, physical confrontations with the police. Those are very clear cut acts of violence.\" Shouting at police? . An Anarchist responded to this with, \"Chris Hedges, as much as I admire his critiques and commitment to liberation work, he has this tendency of reactionary rhetoric.\" \n\n\nHe also was wrong to continuously refer to anarchists as \"the black bloc\" movement. It's not a movement it's a tactic and it was created by German marxists. It's a broad tactic. What's even more confusing is hedges appears to have supported such tactics when they happen outside of America. Chris hedges wrote this about Greek anarchists, \n\n\"They know what to do when they are told their pensions, benefits and jobs have to be cut to pay corporate banks, which screwed them in the first place. Call a general strike. Riot. Shut down the city centers. Toss the bastards out. Do not be afraid of the language of class warfare\u2014the rich versus the poor, the oligarchs versus the citizens, the capitalists versus the proletariat. The Greeks, unlike most of us, get it.\"\n\nhttps://libcom.org/article/be-fair-he-journalist-short-response-chris-hedges-black-bloc\n\n\nYet, when people do way lighter more defensive versions of that in America, he calls it a cancer? I don't get the open inconsistency. Is it perhaps his position and career as a journalist puts him in a position where it must be denounced in north America? I'm not sure I fully understand. ",

His vision of revolution is martyrdom, a lot of people sacrificing themselves to change people's views.  \n\n  He's very anti-Leninist.  In a panel about Lenin,  Hedges, Wolf and some other people were the speakers.  Everyone had a positive view of Lenin, but Hedges used the typical bourgeois liberal talking points to attack Lenin and the USSR.\n\nHe's very similar to Chomsky, good on exposing the crimes of US Empire, but totally useless on actual ways to change change the world.  Unlike Chomsky, I don't think Hedges tells people to vote Democrat every 4 yrs lol",

Cornel West and a group of reverends were asked to denounce anarchist groups in light of trump blaming \"both sides\" and he did the exact opposite and praised them, as did the group of reverends. Why? Because they understand in movements, popular fronts, solidarity is key and the only violence people should be addressing with vigor is the violence of the system. It's more of Chris hedges history of journalism with the mainstream, ties to policing, and whiteness speaking than his religion.\n\n\nChomsky has said some of the same things, but he's never flat out used the langauge of policing and repression on people. Chomsky never called leftists facing violence \"a cancer\" even if he has had some takes I fully disagree with.",
