The FBI are likely going to be helping ice get information on activists they can deport too.\n\nThere's a wide spread sentiment that \"the left\" has \"sapped the morale of police\". They're about to legit begin waging an occupation like style of repression upon urban city centers in reaction to that sentiment. They are already talking about beginning sanctions against these cities. They need to be filmed and outted. People should know the faces of local agents. This war includes a war of intel and info. Unfortunately my friend couldn't get a good picture",

Otherwise it\u2019s entertaining and educational, so it\u2019s great to share with the laymen that may not share your ideology.\n\nEdit: To be clear, this vid only explores one aspect of the war on drugs in about 5 minutes; it\u2019s not exactly comprehensive. After all the war on drugs has been a campaign of terror, stretching back decades. To peak at another side, a music video from one of my favorite rappers, an artist with a message (Grammy winner), Killer Mike. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6lIqNjC1RKU?si=p5u4TGPqc3gT9Cfc",

                    "body": "Free speech is an illusion. The left is speaking sure, but the leftist stance is one of subversion. This is something the state everywhere will fight, but you're right America is a prime example. Movements on the left get even a glimpse of influence and power, and there will be swift counteraction,rumors and propaganda. \n\nThe way theyve been approaching anarchists since the war on t3rror you would almost think theyd be a little more powerful than they are. A good recent example would be, anarchists in the pacific northwest. I'm not sure if anyone remembers, but it seemed to be a hot spot for trump to call them by name. He'd say \"the anarchists there's too many of them in seattle and portland\". Even the liberal media in portland would say things like \"many residents, concerned the city has been held hostage by anarchists have considered moving\". One could say this reaction was because their tactics were very militant; for instance the police reported over 10 AR rifles looted from their cars, there was 100 sustained days of rowdy protest and on top of it this occurred to the undertone of an anarchist writing a Manifesto \"declaring\" himself to be an anarchist communist before he entered an ICE facility and got into a shootout, dying. His comrades celebrated him in the streets. Not only this, but only a year later another self described anarchist fatally shot a proud boy in the chest. I'd disagree and say their militancy actually grew out of long campaigns of repression. \n\n\nHow did it get to such a level there though? It wasn't simply trump causing a mass reaction on both ends. The anarchist movement has a long recent history of dealing with repression and nazi groups in the northwest. In the 90s a self described anarchist opened fire with his SKS; he was being stalked by a car full of nazis who identified him. He went to his car to grab his rifle an opened fire. One shot entered through the passenger window and killed a fascist gangmember. This was not the norm in portland, nor was this a generalized occurence like it was recently. I just say this to explain the history's long standing history with such movements on both ends. You've had very militant nazis and anarchists in the northwest for quite some time, who fought one another regardless of not having broader movements. This put anarchists in th northwest in a position that saw them adventured beyond the standard for American leftists in portland time. IE; they had guns and did survival things people most associate with the \"right\". \n\n\nNot only this, but they've been the target of the state under obama, long before trump. Multiple sources have shown that policing agencies and the military viewed these \"anarchists\" as a future problem and divised operations against them. At this point in time, even despite the history between them and local nazi gangs, they didn't hold some massively militant approach that you saw under trumps last campaign. They mostly organized, and campaigned, tried to sway the \"democratic socialist\" and liberal aspects of movements towards a revolutionary form. During this period of organization within the occupy movement, it began to have somewhat of an impact. A sea of red and black flags approached Seattle's court house on May 1st during this time and began attacking it, a state of emergency was declared. A week later the fbi in tactical gear raided (around 40) multiple squats, homes, and apartments in portland. They began using the grand jury to request individuals \"explain how anarchist organizing works\". The individuals refused and were imprisoned. \n\n\nNow to my point. The repression had nothing to do with spectacular images of militancy causing fear. Why do we know this? Well the freedom of information act request by some of the lawyers defending these groups determined that the fbi had been following and placing them under survelliance for a very very long time before a crime occurred. Not only this but a member of the DSA noticed some strange occurrences, and was able to eventually find out the pentagon sent spies to the northwest during the IraqWar. Their goal? \"Developing and understanding of anarchist groups\". Not only this but the fbi has visited multiple people in these regions they suspected of fighting as militants in the YPG (an automomist anarchist/marxist militant kurd group declared to be a terror org). Homeland security released an article on their own web page speaking of \"the concern towards the normalization of anarchists in the west joining far left armed struggles abroad, then returning. \". \n\n\nI bring this up because the lessons from this are important; these groups were the first scapegoats in this experiment in new forms of repression. Theyre viewed as more \"atrisk\" then your average democratic socialists. After this we saw grand jury used against all kinds of leftists. Using the grand jury can get the feds past the 5th ammendment (right to remain silent). Refusing to give knowledge to the grand jury can itself land you in jail. Many of the anarchists refused to talk and served times. Others talked and got abandoned by the movement. It's important to understand why trump and the proud boys seemed to have such beef with an area that is predominantly white. This is a long standing beef that the neoliberal agencies have been long involved in, long before trump. Trumps agenda and the agenda of fascist Jackboots can be seen materially aligning with the neo liberal mechanisms of repression.\n\n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/a-note-on-recent-fbi-visits-in-seattle/\n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/fbi-intimidation-continues-olympia-wa/\n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/community-notice-regarding-fbi-harassment-and-indictment/\n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/statement-wil-floyd-recently-arrested-seattle-area/\n\n\"On April 20th of this year, Wil Floyd was stopped in the Denver airport and questioned about his involvement in the Seattle anti-capitalist march on May 1st 2016.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.portlandmercury.com/crime/2012/07/27/6584611/breaking-interview-and-documents-from-fbi-raid-show-feds-are-targeting-anarchists\n\n\n\"Dennison Williams was in bed at his house on NE 8th Avenue on Wednesday morning when he heard a bang and someone shout, \"FBI!\" Then came a loud crash, which turned out to be agents breaking down his front door, and Williams heard a bang and a saw a flash of light\u2014the agents throwing flash grenades.\"",
