But in reality, the party has stated that we are against the bill due to our disagreement with the concept of marriage, seeing that it perpetuates patriarchal values and is a way to have governmental involvement in interpersonal relationships. It has proposed alternatives that are much more functional than traditional marriage, such as a series of legal documents to settle inheritance, wills etc. Not to mention that the party has supported equality for LGBTQ people in the workplace, and is the first to condemn homophobic attacks and support their victims. The Communist Youth of Greece has many LGBTQ members, including myself, and they never face any discrimination.",

The fundamental distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and a dictatorship of the other classes \u2014 landlord dictatorship in the Middle Ages and bourgeois dictatorship in all civilized capitalist countries \u2014 consists in the fact that the dictatorship of landowners and bourgeoisie was a forcible suppression of the resistance offered by the vast majority of the population, namely, the working people. In contrast, proletarian dictatorship is a forcible suppression of the resistance of the exploiters, i.e., of an insignificant minority the population, the landlords and capitalists. \n\n> It follows that proletarian dictatorship must inevitably entail not only a change in the democratic forms and institutions, generally speaking, but precisely such change as provides an unparalleled extension of the actual enjoyment of democracy by those oppressed by capitalism\u2014the toiling classes. \n\n> [...] All this implies and presents to the toiling classes, i.e., the vast majority of the population, greater practical opportunities for enjoying democratic rights and liberties than ever existed before, even approximately, in the best and the most democratic bourgeois republics. \n    \nVladimir I.
