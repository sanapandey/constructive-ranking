These don\u2019t go much into Cuban post revolution, but they are very exciting reads.\n\nThen I would focus more on understanding the fundamentals of Marxism than the specifics of Cuba. You need the analytical toolkit to evaluate the Cuban, russian, or any other revolutionary experience.\n\nWidely regarded as the two best places to start are of course the Manifesto, and Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. Also an easy enough introduction is Lenin\u2019s \u201cThree Sources and Three component parts of Marxism.\u201d",

He also calls for us to stand firm and continue fighting and defending the ideal since a just cause is being defended and socialism, sooner rather than later, will be the future of humanity)",

Not everyone wants to be an intellectual, so try to meet the less-willing on their terms.\n\nThe Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson also has a ton of leftist theory actually being implemented on a global scale.  I get why the books are criticized as \"boring,\" but people deride Lord of the Rings for the same things-- slower pace, fascination with nature (which is kinda the whole point), and a narrative that meanders away from the plot a little too often, but the journey is the reward rather than the destination.",

Something that always resonated with me is the man\u2019s willingness to go to poverty-stricken countries that have been destabilized by coups or US backed dictatorships, and fight alongside revolutionaries to thwart imperialism, even if it meant fertilizing the soil of a foreign country with his own blood.",

I have read a few of them and he was a great speaker and pretty entertaining. \n\nIf you want to learn about socialism then as many others have recommended you should read Blackshirts and Reds.

Shut up, durruti is relevant to anyone who wants to learn about anti fascism. If you think he's not one of the most important figures to study in the Spanish Civil War, then you don't know anything about the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe book was written by participants in the Spanish Civil War. You discouraging people to read it. Are you interested in sharing multiple perspectives and people to study in history with OP, or are you concerned with shoving someone in your exact idealogical direction?\n\n\nI'm linking another one too. \n\nhttps://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/durruti-people-armed/author/paz-abel/\n\n\n\nI hope OP reads them. Stop discouraging people from knowledge because you fear it. This is the exact problem with certain leftists, they go as far to ban material from their organizations (in many parties even posting neo marxist or anarchist material can get you a warning). You're discouraging people from learning about the history and life of an anti fascist in fears that they'll develop the same mistakes as him? Nonsense. Know about durruti. Read about him. Imitate what's useful, shed what's problematic. This is from the participants in the Spanish Civil War. Why would you be threatened by them sharing their history? Was it that the largest current of socialists in Spain at the time didn't fit within leninism? Please give me a break with the idealism, and save the suppression of knowledge for fascists. \n\nThis isn't books on a social theory, it's books documenting history and action.

I gave books on the lives of 2 revolutionaries in history who are lesser known, started off by Michael parenti giving a historical context of fascism vs. leftist praxis and theory. Doesn't seem like as bad of a reading sequence for OP as you made it out to be. Yeah simmer down, again you are discouraging people from reading a book you've never read. Make it make sense. Durrutis name just got you in your feelings or something. One should never try to completely lionize, and idolize any historic figures. Durruti is not the end all be all, nor is Che. Both are important figures to study. When I share information on any of these figures, it doesn't mean we should be expected to follow them word for word, thought for thought and action for action.\n\nThe situation in Spain seems like it has some lessons relevant for the situation europe and America faces today. So I linked one. Though I know OP needed some direction so the first book was by parenti, black shirts and reds. Durruti, while controversial even among anarchists themselves, found himself to be a pivotal leader in the fight against fascism, and the seizing of bourgeois property in Spanish cities. His shortcomings, his mistakes, his bravery, his success, strengths and flaws are lessons for today. What better way to learn these lessons than read in depth journals and historic details from participants?",
