            "body": "The occupation of Western Sahara has caused hundreds of thousands of Saharawi to become refugees in Algeria and Mauritania. Saharawis are disenfranchised, stripped of their right to self determination and maraganilised by settlers from Morocco, and their movements are strictly controlled by occupation authorities; there is no pan-Arab integration but the subjugation of a nation. It's not a dissimilar situation to Palestine",

Further Morocco has long been an ally of US imperialism and currently is one of the only Arab countries that recognizes Israel (in exchange for Israel\u2019s support for their claim of Western Sahara). \n\nSocialists generally champion self determination, internationalism and anti colonialism. Which is why most socialists support not just Western Sahara, Irish republicanism, Indigenous movements in North and South America, Palestinian resistance/anti Zionism etc.\n\nSince you are Moroccan have you heard of Mehdi Ben Barka? Hes probably the most famous Moroccan socialist internationally. He was a great example of a principled socialist and internationalist, and he got in trouble with the government for refusing to side with his government when they went to war with Algeria in the 60s.",
