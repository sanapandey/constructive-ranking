If you were biking on the north side of Chicago and lost your phone on February 22nd, dm me and I\u2019ll help you track it down! \n\nI apologize if this doesn\u2019t fit the normal content of this community, but it was the only way I could think to reach out. \n\nUPDATE:\n\nThe owner of the phone found this post and reached out, and he\u2019s been reunited with his phone! The power of socialism reigns!",
