    "selftext": "Every single Reddit/Twitter/Bluesky post I read about the recent developments between Zelensky and Trump are saying that Trump is behaving this way ONLY because of Russian interference. They are shifting the blame fully on Russia, as if the US government is incapable of acting irrationally. I am not trying to minimise Russian aggression or its imperialistic motives and the plight on the Ukrainian working class. What I am saying is that I feel like libs are incapable of accepting accountability for their country and essentially blame Russia alone. Maybe, just maybe, the US and its govt have never been the good guys? ",

We may make mistakes, but that doesn't define who we are as a people or a nation. What defines us is our commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Trump is committed to Russian supremacy and is a meanie, but once he is out of office and Mayor Pete or Gavin Newsom takes over, we will begin to heal and achieve unity by embracing our sacred principles once more. Simply put, you're being silly...keep calm and carry on in trusting Team Blue no matter what /s",

But also that would mean Russia would have been justified in invading Turkey or Norway this whole time, as they both have been part of NATO since early on and border russia, on sea in the case of Turkey. No Soviet or Russian head of state has invaded them in all that time despite being far more egrigious then Ukraine (Turkey even held US nukes during the Cold War). Unfortuntely, since the Russian invasion, Finland and Sweden now have joined NATO, meaning Putin only helped NATO imperialists w/ his imperialist war. What's being lost is a bloc that is for peace, diplomacy, non-alignment, global collaberation etc. All the things needed to survive this century\n\nIt's true that Ukraine wants to join NATO, but they have not been accepted into it. Also even there the Russian government is partialy to blame for moving public opinion towards NATO. In Ukraine there was strong opposition to joining NATO befor the war, 35% of Ukrainians opposed joining NATO in August 2021. 2 years later and that number goes down to 5%. So if anti-NATO was Putin's goal (when I watched his interview with Tucker Carlson it seemed less about NATO and more crude right wing nationalism but for the sake of argument I'll take your word for it), he has enormously failed at achieving that goal.\n\nSecond, if Mexico formed a military alliance with Russia, and Russia built military bases in Mexico, would the US then be justified in invading Mexico? I would consider it a blatent act of imperial agression, just like the Bay of Pigs & US occupaiton of Guatanimo Bay or the brief US invasion of Mexico during the Mexican Revolution were. If we accept your logic, then these are all just the US excercizing its defensive rights in its sphere of influence.\n\nThird, even if it was defensive, that still means that we should oppose the war. I'm Canadian, if the US tomorrow invaded Canada, Canada would still be an imperialist country and Trudeau would still be a the head of a capitalist state. We should look up to and show solidarity with people like Russian Marxist Boris Kagarlitsky who is currently serving 5 years in prison for opposing the war. As well as people like Ukranian Socialist Volodymyr Ishchenko who has spoken out against both the war/invasion, and against Ukranian nationalism, and exposed both Russian and Ukranoian nationalism and the ruling classes that benefit from it.",

I don't mean to argue that Russia's completely justified but more that after several rounds of expansion East by NATO there would be an accumulative effect and it would be more understandable that Putin/Russia would respond regardless of whether it is politically advantageous.\n\nSimilarly - I'm not saying the US would be justified in invading Mexico in my theoretical example but we do have an historic example and when Russia put missiles in Cuba the US response was very nearly apocalyptic. \n\nI understand that trying to provide context for Russia's invasion does nothing for the socialist movement - it's just that Western destabilization of foreign regions in the name of capital is so destructive and subsequently under reported - it's hard not to.",

Interesting part there too is kennedy and Khrushchev totally went over Cuba's head in their negotiations about the missiles afterwards, which really pissed off Fidel. \n\n  \nI do think we should be skeptical about mainstream media's coverage of all this, we should all be hoping for peace, and ofc many governments/people are using all this as pretext to expand the military industrial complex.

Maybe It's the US lib copium space that doesn't run across my feed, though I have seen nods to the theory that Trump is a Russian plant, but haven't seen anyone who actually believes it enough to dump the responsibility on Russia for what is currently taking place(Do they have a thumb in the pie? Absolutely. Did they orchestrate this whole thing? I don't think so). Basically everyone aside from blind conservatives and spineless centrists have admitted that Trump is a monkey with a shotgun and they are not shifting blame. And in the climate that is currently in the eastern bloc and EU in general, we have little energy to be dismayed over what is taking place overseas aside from the peace talks with Ukraine, which have recently took a turn for the worse. But I have still kept an eye on what Trump and his admin are doing in the US and screaming into my pillow most of the time.\n\nThe general situation is that the EU(in light of US VP's remarks and Trump greedily trying to get Ukraines natural resources without guaranteeing any defense support) in my opinion, is having a massive existential crisis on the subject of military defense policy. If Ukraine should fall, then nothing would stop Russia from invading the Baltics, specifically Estonia, where I live. Our foreign and defense ministers are deeply concerned over Trumps antics and are basically telling us to be prepared for the worst, though they are not creating any mass panic and the situation is currently eerily quiet while everyone is biting their nails to see what all this new power dynamics will bring. And the rise of right-wing politics in germany and other proximal countries is not making this any better. \n\nIf there are libs that still can't see that Trump is a manifestetion of how rotten the US government is and not the result of some 4D chess from Russia, then I have little hope that anything will wake them up to the cold and disgusting reality that lies in the black heart of US imperialism.\n\nI personally hope that there is enough leaders with enough common sense in europe that are willing to fight straight out fascism and show some spine, though I'm not holding my breath on that subject either. We are living in a limbo and in terrifingly uncertain times and the next year is crucial to try and avoid disaster. The working class has suffered enough under neo-liberalism and I hope we are able to diplomatically resolve this situation somehow, even though, in my eyes, a cold war at the very least, is inevitable.\n\nThank you for listening to my rant",

NATO and the West's continued expansion into Russia's sphere of influence is not only reckless, but it also plays a dangerous game with global stability. At best, it\u2019s an expansionist, colonialist maneuver. Meanwhile, the Democrats are content to funnel billions into prolonging conflicts in Ukraine and Israel while barely addressing domestic issues like healthcare, homelessness, and education.\n\nThe \"threat\" posed by Putin is far more exaggerated than it's often portrayed. Amplifying this fear only serves to line the pockets of weapons manufacturers and neo-colonial powers, not the American people or the citizens of Europe, Ukraine, or Russia\u2014let\u2019s not forget, they are human too.\n\nSo, here\u2019s some constructive criticism for the Democrats: Stop funding endless wars. Stop letting Republicans exploit your mistakes. Engage in dialogue with world leaders, even those you disagree with, for the sake of peace. And most importantly, break the military-industrial complex's stranglehold on your policymaking. Perhaps then you'll start winning elections.",
