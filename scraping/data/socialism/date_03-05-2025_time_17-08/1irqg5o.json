    "selftext": "As a Socialist, I'm deeply concerned about the rapid rise of the Far Right in mainstream politics. I'm torn between joining the Labour Party, where I might have a better chance of influencing policy from within a party that is in power/could actually gain power, or joining a smaller socialist party that fully aligns with my beliefs but has less electoral influence. What are your thoughts on the best approach for meaningful political change?",
