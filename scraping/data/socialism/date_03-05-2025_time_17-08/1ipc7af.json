    "selftext": "(I know this is a socialist sub but this post has been banned for some reason in other leftist subreddits)\n\nThis post is just me ranting I suppose, so feel free to chime in as you please. \n\nIt\u2019s been said before, but having right wing Christian parents and being any vein of leftist, fucking sucks. It\u2019s terrible because you know you love these people. They raised you, they fed you, they clothed you, they helped you with homework, and even taught you how to drive, but then you grow up and then you realize how just fucking silly these people are. As an anarchist, I can never argue with my dad about politics. He\u2019s a boss of a small construction company, and has supported Trump the past 3 elections. I love my father, I really do, but it hurts that he willingly or unknowingly voted for a man who is going to actively make everything worse for him and everyone else around him. \n\nAnyone else feeling like this? Just needed to vent this somewhere. ",

            "body": "Yeah, class interests are hard to get around. You could try, if you have the skills and knowledge, to point out how petty bourgeoisie exist to be crushed under the big boys, how the incentive to competition means someone bigger will always be willing to eat or destroy competition and that's baked into the markets.... but I'm not gonna say that's likely to be super effective. People who've made it to that point have a vested interest in the system, and it'll be real hard to convince them the system will eat them too when they've worked to gain their status and based their worth as a person on having achieved it.\n\nYou have basically 3 options:\n1) find a way to convince them your way will benefit them more while cutting through all the indoctrination, pride, and self-interest (for most people, not gonna happen, and most people who try will just end up pissing off the person they want to convince)\n2) accept that they're not gonna change their mind, prioritize your personal relationship. Be diplomatic and don't bring it up, don't fuss over it. Refuse to engage for your own sanity.\n3) disengage completely if you don't think you'll be safe or happy being around them. If you can't get along because of political differences, probably better to just let go.",

The origins of Marxist communism were many, but one of them was the communal table and proto-communist christian socialism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian\\_socialism#Early\\_modern\\_period). In that wikipedia link, you'll see that one of the founders of England's Labour party said that he found his \"Socialism in the New Testament.\" All that to say that there may be avenues to making inroads to your parents that are about sidestepping triggers and tripwires over Trump, but that are about focusing on shared values, principles of fairness, and couching your politics in talking to them on how the values they raised you with served as a strong foundation to your politics today. Good luck.",

He\u2019s gotten pretty far, the business is one of the most successful in our small community now that time has passed. he\u2019s about as blue collar as you can get, and was born and raised in Mexico and born into a constant work environment. \n\nHe eventually became radicalized by the bombardment of right wing extremism on the internet and in our community in recent years. He would spread lies of how vaccines would make people autistic, the government was in some sort of pedo ring, truly bad things. He was a die hard Trump supporter but now I believe he\u2019s slowly losing his trust in Trump with the recent news and events surrounding the presidency and all of the different things he was doing.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice, Just let things play out. with the incoming tariffs, tax breaks for the rich, etc, it will become even more difficult to run a local business. \n\nAnd I can relate, the reason my dad was inclined to like and believe Trump in the first place was because of how successful the ride had been pre-COVID. Things will get so much more difficult before they get good. Once things go in the opposite direction he was hoping for when he originally voted for Trump, he could eventually realize his mistake of supporting him. And if he doesn\u2019t? remind him and inform him why it was a mistake, I believe a good majority of MAGA people who aren\u2019t to benefit are just misinformed and hurt. If that doesn\u2019t work, It would be best to just ignore the politics side of things with him and just find ways to bond with him outside of that and find some kind of middle ground.",
