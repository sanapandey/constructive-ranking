    "selftext": "Ten days after members of the neo-fascist Proud Boys were pardoned for their seditious conspiracy conviction stemming from their actions on Jan. 6th, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.,  an appellate court in New York declined to overturn the conviction of Alex Stokes Contompasis. Contompasis is serving 20 years after stabbing two Proud Boys who were reportedly attacking those countering a so-called \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally at the Statehouse, also on January 6th, 2021.\n\nThe 5-0 ruling Thursday, noted that Contompasis, who often goes by his first two names, had failed to prove his use of a knife to stab one person and attempt to stab another was justified self-defense. Proud Boy Dominic Wierzbicki started a fight that resulted in his brother James P. Warner and local Proud Boy chapter leader Douglas Michael Ruso being stabbed. Wierzbicki turned himself into police in March 2021 and was charged with third-degree assault and possession of a weapon in the fourth-degree. These charges ultimately resulted only in Wierzbicki being fined.\n\nThe ruling claimed that video contradicted Contompasis\u2019 contention that he had rushed to the aid of a friend who was being roughed up and was nearly knocked out by the first stabbing victim, causing Contompasis to swing his knife wildly in an effort to protect himself.\n\nWhile the ruling also noted the panel took letters of support from community and the one misdemeanor on Stokes\u2019 criminal record into consideration when making their decision, it largely depended on Contompasis\u2019 social media posts which they claimed lacked remorse.\n\nThe family said they are planning to appeal to the New York State Court Appeals.\n\n\u201cHeartbroken doesn\u2019t begin to cover how we feel,\u201d a post on Instagram reads. \u201cI want to thank everyone for your support. It\u2019s not easy to speak truth to power but this community has given me the strength and courage to keep going. I meant it when I said this account was created as an act of love. As long as Alex is away, and even when he gets back, I\u2019ll be doing my part to help people trapped in this abusive and draconian carceral system.\u201d\n\n\nWRITE TO YOUR COMRADE \n\n\nAlexander Contompasis 22B5028\nUpstate Correctional Facility\nPO Box 2001\nMalone, NY 12953\n\n\n",
