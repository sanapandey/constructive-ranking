    "selftext": "Any down and dirty quick comparison charts on questions in Marxist Theory? For example, charts that explain what major Marxist leaders believed about major questions relating to Marxism (ex: the national question, permanent revolution, socialism in one country, etc.) Yes, of course read the primary source too. But, I'm curious about options, like comparison charts, that help show the 20,000 foot view first that then let people dive in. ",

If you actually read and understood the primary sources and their historical development and struggles then you wouldn't need a chart because you would have a deeper internal understanding of the processes at work and don't need a reference guide to refer to to help you (because it doesn't actually help you). \n\n>But, I'm curious about options, like comparison charts, that help show the 20,000 foot view first that then let people dive in.\n\nWhat you are asking for is for someone to provide you a menu so that you can shop at the supermarket of ideology, and instead of treating Marxism as scientific socialism, it becomes picking and choosing categories that appeal to you and offer you gratification and comfort.  This is really just a gross expression of liberalism and its logic, and the problem is that it isn't \"the 20,000 foot view\" -- it's only ever going to be something exceedingly narrow and vulgar (if not outright dishonest) and shaped and warped by the class perspectives of the people offering it to you, containing their hidden biases and ideological bent, and you will be powerless to identify the basis of the information presented to you.",

Only Maoism is Marxism.\n\n>or example following a maoist strategy in a largely urban environment wont do you much good even tho maoism is a good practice and theory. stuff like that.\n\nThis is wrong and rather racist, and shows that you havent understood anything about People's War or Maoism or the people who wrote about it or what was being said. It shows that you learned about it from a chart, instead of accumulating knowledge, and because of this your understanding is wrong and ignorant, and you need to start over.",
