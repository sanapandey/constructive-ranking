            "body": "Simply put, capital is made up of all the tools, machines, factories, materials, etc, and other means of production needed to create new wealth, as well as the large sums of money used to invest in those things. All of those things were obviously originally produced by past labor \u2014 a factory building represents the labor of the construction workers, the machines inside the building represent the labor of machinists and manufacturers, the raw material being processed was mined or extracted by workers, etc. So capital is therefore stored up past labor. \n\nAnd the money-capital used by capitalists to invest in new factories, machines, etc. is also derived from past labor exploited by the capitalist, so this money-capital is also stored up past labor.",
