    "selftext": "I apologize if this is off-topic but I am a Marxist and I do find this to be an ethical/moral dilemma.\n\nIm a paramedic and one the agencies I work for frequently does law enforcement standbys for SWAT raids. I have issues with having to go on those but we frequently don\u2019t get info on what the raid is for.\n\nThere have been talks of coming ICE raids on undocumented peoples in my area soon and its possibly they would used my agency for EMS standby. I have reasoned that I will not do such a thing and will refuse to go. This wouldn\u2019t stop the raid of course or even my agency from being able to fill the standby but I just don\u2019t wanna feel complicit but maybe I already am?\n\nDoes anyone have thoughts on this?\n\n",

It is really hard to purchase entirely ethical, or union, or away from some big billionaire that makes a profit from us. Each and every day *most if not all* of us contribute in ways big and small. The goal here shouldn't be a depressive state that results from our complicity but rather, how much of our agency can we direct at reducing harm, resisting fascism, and pushing society past capitalism's evils. (In my own opinion, in that order). \n\nAs an EMS, your care in such a situation could be lifesaving, OP. It could be the caring touch that will save a life that otherwise wouldn't happen. I would argue that you have a huge power here to make a difference in that small moment.\n\nBut the ability to interrupt the ICE raid? Huge. Is it possible for you to tip off the target community? You shouldn't do this directly or through electronic means. Do you have connections and friends that you trust that you could speak verbally to that could alert targets? This could also be life saving. I would suggest being *very* careful about that process.",
