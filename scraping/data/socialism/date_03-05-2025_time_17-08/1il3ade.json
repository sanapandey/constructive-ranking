I\u2019m not talking about articles, I\u2019m talking about books or some sort of written timeline. There are books that discuss American colonialism in the 20th and 21st century but as far as 2023-2025 I can\u2019t say. I\u2019m worried that in the future everywhere we look will only be biased and won\u2019t hold *both* Republicans and Democrats accountable. \n\nI\u2019m afraid that what happened and what *is* happening will be forgotten and that no one in the future will learn the actual truth. I\u2019ve seen a fair few anti-Zionist authors admit to writing and publishing books\u2014Sim Kern\u2019s \u2018Genocide Bad\u2019 for example\u2014 about Palestine and israel but just how much will the United States be discussed in those books? How much will we speak of the Democrats\u2019 involvements in foreign affairs and affairs in America?",

No socialist will forget any of this.\n\n\nFor some recent good books I recommend *Red deal* by Red Nation, *What is antiracism and why it means anticapitalism* by Arun Kundnani, and *Washington bullets* by Vijay Prashad.\u00a0",

I would say \u2018no proper socialist will forget any of this\u2019. There are people unironically running around telling people to strategically vote for the Democrats. There are socialists (maybe I should put it in quotes) who actually believe in lesser evil politics.",

Liberals and chauvinist \"socialists\" are just broader circles of fascism when you get down to their structural principles.\u00a0I take that as given - just like how I don't feel the need to qualify that Nazis aren't socialists despite the name they gave themselves - but it's certainly fair to point such things out explicitly.\n\nI just tend to let my book suggestions do all that talking for me.",
