    "selftext": "Many critics contend that combining neoliberal principles with feminist aims creates a contradiction. They argue that when feminist goals are reframed in terms of individual empowerment\u2014often measured by market success or personal achievement\u2014it can dilute the movement\u2019s focus on systemic change. In this view, \"neoliberal feminism\" ends up emphasizing personal ambition over the broader social reforms needed to dismantle deeply embedded gender inequalities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? ",
