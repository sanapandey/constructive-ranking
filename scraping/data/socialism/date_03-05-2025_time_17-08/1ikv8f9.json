Maybe if someone starts gaining traction in a movement and actually makes head winds, presenting a viable unified left, but my vibe is that the anti-Socialism propaganda in the US has been so effective, there really isn't a need to go after the left wantonly/publicly. It is so disparate and rejected by the majority that it doesn't pose a significant enough threat to the system for them to potentially rile up the liberals/moderates more by arresting Americans for simply believing in Socialism. That would give people more reason to just get mad at Trump/Elon, so I don't see an upside to it for the administration at the moment. They'll just be arresting protestors as per usual.",

BLM was not socialist in political belief publicly (I know little of the internal politics), but they had enormous prescence and public support at their height, so they were targeted more so due to that potential. Could have morphed into something, so they got targeted.\n\nJust like I said in my comment, if someone(s) manages to get something off the ground again with large public support, they'll be targeted and if it's a public movement towards anti-capitalism that gains public sympathy, then certainly I can see a crackdown on socialists. However, I just don't see the current admin going around preemptively arresting/persecuting open socialists who lack much support. I feel like that would just fan the flames against the state. This is just my personal assessment as of now, and I could be wrong. As the conditions change, so too will my analysis. \n\nEdit: Made my comment before I saw your edit of\n\n>Idk why those BLM activists were considered such a threat, but it probably has something to do with being part of a larger national org that hypothetically has resources to make moves (it hasn\u2019t used them to pursue socialism at all, but the potential was there at least in the 2010s).\n\nAnd I completely agree.

It's just it gets ignored because in recent history it usually happens to anarchists, and the rest of the broader left doesn't seem to care or know. This is why they are going AFTER anarchists first. They feel as if they're the most subversive of the left. I'd say they're the easiest to scapegoat, which may be true due to the fact that even many leftists themselves hold the same exact views liberals do and think \"it's unorganized, chaotic types\". The reality would be quite the opposite, they were attacked not for being \"chaotic\" but for being vigilant organizers. \n\nOne example of this would be. Remember trump calling out \"anarchists\" in the northwest by name? Well that's a broader part of repression, beyond trump. For years the fbi kicked down multiple doors, subpoenas on anarchists with grand juries, forcing them to reveal their \"organizing structures\" or go to prison. In the northwest, under obama over 20 squats, apartments and homes were raided by fbi swat, flash bangs and all. Under trump the FBI would constantly visit anarchists, or park outside of their homes in a show of force on days like may day. \n\n\n\n\"This morning, Friday April 27th, FBI agents visited at least three houses in Seattle and left business cards with the names of individuals they wanted to talk to written on the back. At one house the agents picked packages up on the porch and pretended to be delivery people in order to confirm the identities of those living there. When it became clear they were not delivery people the door was quickly slammed in their faces.\n\nThese visits have become a yearly ritual. In the week before May Day, the feds do the rounds to make sure that everyone knows they are watching. We should see this for what it is \u2013 an intimidation tactic and part of a strategy of repression designed to scare people out of organizing. It is important to take visits like this seriously, but their predictability also makes it fairly clear that they are mostly intended to make people feel afraid.\"\n\n\nhttps://itsgoingdown.org/a-note-on-recent-fbi-visits-in-seattle/\n\n\n\n\nI hate how the aclu, and national lawyers guild knows of this history occuring RECENTLY but the left outside of \"anarchists\" or \"autonomist marxists\"  almost glimpses over it. I know they aren't aware because I always see people talking \"what if they start coming for marxists again like the 60s\" um hello anarchists (who are more influenced by marx than ppl admit) have been getting harassed and repressed heavily under the war on terror. The projects against them are essentially projects against all communist activity, so the left should act like that's the case.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: many groups have spoken out again this. Including marxist leninists and democratic socialists. When it was happening. I just feel like too often older history of repression is discussed and analyzed heavily, but the more recent history gets brushed over. This leaves a lot of the newer leftists less focused on the history relevant to today's understandings.",

If you look under the section about CPC and the trade war, it\u2019s all there.\n\nAfter reading through it all, I would be super cautious and looking into alternatives if you are on a study visa from China. Please be safe.\n\nIf this ends up happening, they will be monitoring and racial targeting will happen to an even greater extent than it already is during this administration (I.e. ICE raids, assuming all Latinx/Latino/Latina individuals are all grouped as \u201cdeportable looking\u201d {I do not condone or agree with this language})\n\nOverall, they will be monitoring as I predict Marx/other \u201cwoke\u201d literature will be banned from edu./work places.\n\n*EDIT: changed CCP to CPC, apologies!*",

From [Terms of Admission into Communist International](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/jul/x01.htm), as adopted by the First Congress of the Communist International:\n\n>18 - In view of the foregoing, parties wishing to join the Communist International must change their name. Any party seeking affiliation must call itself the Communist Party of the country in question (Section of the Third, Communist International). The question of a party\u2019s name is not merely a formality, but a matter of major political importance. The Communist International has declared a resolute war on the bourgeois world and all yellow Social-Democratic parties. The difference between the Communist parties and the old and official \u201cSocial-Democratic\u201d, or \u201csocialist\u201d, parties, which have betrayed the banner of the working class, must be made absolutely clear to every rank-and-file worker. \n\nSimilarly, the adoption of a wrong name to refer to the CPC consists of a double edged sword: on the one hand, it seeks to reduce the ideological basis behind the party's name to a more ethno-centric view of said organization and, on the other hand, it seeks to assert authority over it by attempting to externally draw the conditions and parameters on which it provides the CPC recognition.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
