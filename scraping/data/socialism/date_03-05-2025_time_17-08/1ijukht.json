I cannot find recent information regarding the criminalization of homosexuality in Burkina Faso. Do you guys know how this situation is? Because if Traor\u00e9 signed, he from this moment lost my respect, because he is betraying the legacy of Sankara, whose same was one of the most progressive leaders of him time and today would certainly disapprove of such a project.",

It is the same everywhere, less education=more hatred towards homosexuality.\n\nWestern NGOs keep pushing this narrative that socialist states go on hunting homosexuals which is false but there is usually a negative sentiment towards LGBT because most countries that experienced socialism were not developed and their peoples didn't receive proper education before Socialist regimes took over. The most developed areas that experienced Socialism were east europe and some parts of central europe (I mean before Socialist regimes took over) and even them weren't on par with west europe. \n\n.",

I have a few explanations for why a revolutionary like Traore could be supporting this position restricting the rights of gay people.\n\nRestricting homosexuality is a populist position in Africa, let's face it. It is a legacy of colonialism. Nevertheless it is a reality. Politicians get more popular the tougher they get against LGBTQ rights, regardless of where they are on the left-right spectrum. That can motivate a leftist leader of a country like Burkina Faso to take the populist position.\n\nChina, Russia, and Iran are often seen as the anti-American alternative. They have high support among these West African countries. And they are all anti-LGBTQ to an extent.\n\nThere is a populist anti-West message against LGBTQ rights which views queer rights as \"Western Influence\" and tries to restrict it in defense of \"African Culture.\" That's another contributor that makes a lot of leftist Africans still anti-LGBTQ.\n\nThere is an influence of the Patriarchy. Among left-leaning and leftist African women, LGBTQ rights are a key priority. However a lot of leftist African men are socially conservative.",

That interview happened in a different Uganda than today's Uganda where identifying as gay is a crime punishable by prison",

Thus, they separate it from colonialism in their critique of the latter. Firstly, Christianity seems like an institution of \"good morality\" and opposing it might make one look evil.\n\nThere's also those who believe that Christianity in Africa preceded colonialism, which is only true for Ethiopia and other small parts around Africa.\n\nChristianity does create a sense of community too among many people fighting for justice. This makes it hard for them to alienate it.\n\nAnd finally and most importantly, poverty, especially in its extremes powers Christianity. Much of why Christianity prevails in Africa is not culture or conservativism. It is usually that people believe that if they pray and trust God enough, they will gain his favor and consequently, upward social mobility. \n\nWith all of those factors, many African leftist movements are surprisingly Christian too.",

You can still be religious, but you are less prone to the more cultic aspects. Like poor or working class Christians are more likely than their Middle Class counterparts to believe in televangelists and the \"sow-a-seed\" narrative, more likely to be hostile to the LGBTQ community, more likely to believe in \"miracles\" and more. \n\nThere is an education aspect. But there also is the aspect of material destitution. When you're poor, you're worried about your next meal. When you're working class you are always tired. It is people in the Middle Class who get time to philosophize, think about human rights or the constitution, and usually the ones with access to information that helps form this thought.",

But that doesn't mean I agree with everything the FLN believed or that I embrace everything that they've done since independence. We can provide critical support for parties, leaders, and movements that embraces their positive qualities even while disagreeing strongly with certain aspects of their ideology. Support does not have to be an \"all or nothing\" approach of total glorification or complete rejection. We have to view the actions of various groups in context and provide honest and useful evaluations of their choices within that context.\n\nAs always, we can express support for the policies and decisions that we agree with and provide criticisms of the decisions we disagree with.",

The only way to make LGBT people safe and free population-wide is to liberate their whole countries from neo-imperialist rule so they can be educated... and in many cases, that liberation is going to make the country democratic enough to legislate its popular anti-LGBT sentiments before a homegrown queer liberation movement can make progress.",
