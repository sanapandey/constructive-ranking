They are shooting themselves. Everything will get more expensive in the US and the country will be isolated. He\u2019s doing an American Empire fall speedrun. This will hurt other countries, especially Canada and Mexico, but in the long run, the Canadian and Mexican governments have not just pissed off literally everyone, so they will probably be fine. Tarrifs will hurt Americans most. The only \u201ecountry\u201d which is not completely pissed with the US is \u201eIsrael\u201d. I guess fascists stick together.",

Sure Mexico and Canada and even Europe to an extent will be hit hard by these economic actions, but I only see them seeking China as a more reasonable and trustworthy trade partner long-term with these tariffs. Trump is impulsive, and demonstrates that the U.S cannot be trusted long-term for mutual economic growth. Not to mention the U.S won\u2019t come away from these tariffs untouched. The majority of the population is living paycheck to paycheck and one of the biggest reasons for why people voted for Trump in the first place was because he\u2019d lower prices for the average consumer. I don\u2019t think raising consumer goods\u2019 prices via tariffs will help out very much for the average working class person in this respect.",
