            "body": "Incredibly funny to see how much damage Trump is doing to the basic pillars of US imperialism. Gutting USAID, talking about slashing the Pentagon budget, discussing shutting down AFRICOM, destroying US-Canada relations, possibly backing out of Ukraine. Of course remains to be seen what fresh forms of imperialism he'll pursue, like escalating regime change efforts in Latin America and possible war with Iran and a renewed genocide against Gaza - but honestly there is a chance that he ends up being net-\"progressive\" on matters of imperialism",
