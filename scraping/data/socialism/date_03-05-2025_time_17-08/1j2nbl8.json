            "body": "Squatting exists heavily in America, but it's more individualistic and/or secretive in most cases. It needs to openly exist as a movement hostile to neo liberalism. There's been instances of encampments and occupation used as a means of struggle, but squatting needs to be supported and workers need to take part in it in more dynamic generalized ways. It needs to be a unified act as a movement where peoples individual actions and squats contribute to a large struggle for land and property. It's literally the lowest risk form of expropriation to high reward potential. When done in unison, and coordinated throughout urban centers it's a powerful force of the workers class war. The more succesful squatting becomes, the higher the risk of course (state violence). I mean less risk as in you won't get a felony in most places because you can take advantage of squatters rights laws.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_nLVBHprp_4\n\n(Local businesses campaigned to evict squatters this video is the result)\n\n\nSquatting as a movement could directly abolish the power of landlords and realtor tycoons and leftists need to focus on it more. Stop performative protest and begin occupying space, then defend that space. It doesn't have to be exactly like Chaz. It can occur within networks of liberated buildings or properties throughout cities and regions. Multiple squats still provide as community spaces throughout many urban areas of America, if more leftists contribute as an organized force.. these efforts will have more results. Mutual aid and survival programs need to be built with the opportunity occupying space provides. They can also be used to reconnect workers, lumpens.. to their freedom to express and create art (graffiti,hip hop,punk music,whatever) counter to the commercial 'expression'. They can be used as centers of education and organizing.",
