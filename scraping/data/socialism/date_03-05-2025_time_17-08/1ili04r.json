Ideology doesnt come from no where nor does it come from feelings, it comes from material needs and interests. To assert that yes, some billionaires are actually good relative to others, completely misses the point on so many levels. Not only does it miss the point in this ideological level but it also is an example of individualism, it separates the individual from the system they are in and uphold. Someone like Mark Cuban ultimately upholds the exact same system as Musk, their only differences are in the specific execution of it. \n\nEven so, what actual action does this propose? The NEP was different in that it was a material action based on material purposes, but this is just an idea, theres no real action you can take based off of it and only really exists in opposition to other ideas. Unless there is a point which I missed then its kinda useless of a conclusion",

You're not challenging anyone's beliefs or getting people to become class conscious, you're just affirming their pre existing beliefs and are trying to merely reframe Musk and Co to be opposed to what they already believe in. Sure the result may have been getting some to come around and go to protests, but are protests actually the thing we need right now? The ruling class doesn't care about protests, protests don't threaten them. What you need to be doing is spreading class conscious with the goal of revolutionary activity. Protests are a means to an end, they should be used to platform your organization and to reach out to workers. You need to be having these discussions about class, not just getting people to support another rich asshole. Stop lying to people because you think it's easier in the immediate moment. Not a single time ever in human history has a strategy close to this ever worked. The only ones who have actually posed a threat to fascism were revolutionary leftists. \n\nEven so why are you using this rhetoric in places like this? If this really is just rhetoric you use to get people to go to protests then why are you so convicted to it and argue it in socialist spaces? \n\nAnd lastly stop using buzzwords in lieu of discussion. You can shout 'accelerationism' and 'purity testing' as many times as you want but those things aren't relevant in any way, not to this discussion or wider politics. Insisting on these things just sounds like an effort to justify your beliefs after you've already formed them which themselves were formed out of convenience.",

But some of them are legitimate necessities in *certain specific situations that come up sometimes.* \n\nI think just *personally* (*I am not giving my decisions here moral or political weight for all people*), boycotting Big tech is just one of those things that will cause me tons of avoidable hardship that will have no *practical* benefit to anyone, really. \n\nAnother relatively minor thing is that every once in a while, a legitimate small business comes across my FB feed I want to support. As far as I've seen, small companies that have relatively reliable ethical and environmental ratings and multiple \"This is a good place to work for, kind bosses, fair pay for labor, good benefits\" reviews from real employees, advertise on Facebook moreso than any alternative I might use. Again, this is minor and barely factors in, but it is something to note.",

You would be better off supporting the artists that they harvested from, if they even credit them in the first place\u2026 Which is of course another part of the issue :/\n\nIt\u2019s cool that the artists get 100% profit but you do not need to sell stuff on the blockchain to get that\u2026 And harvesting other people\u2019s art for your own profit is just extremely immoral, and the product is frankly creative slop and consuming and financing such products is part of why Creative Media in general is becoming such\u2026 consumerist slop in the first place. That and shit like the state of large scale video games and hollywood bullshit that\u2019s devoid of any creative depth or substance, all just formulative dopamine slop produced to make money.\n\nVery strong opinion of mine, yes. But I think you get the concept, it\u2019s kind of everything I\u2019m against when it comes to the Arts. \n\nI would like to make a living off my art, mostly because I am disabled and do not have much else.

This is where relevant conversations around the death of third spaces comes in. The working class, being cut off from their communities, segregate themselves in their homes and increasingly immerse themselves into the digital world.\n\nThis removes us from the world in which we are naturally meant to exist, removes us from our communities that we need as social creatures, and this brings us to the CHT and the manufactured content pushed onto us, which many find themselves trapped in.\n\nAs a person who recognizes my deep connection to the outdoors, enjoys hunting and fishing (not as much but I like that it gets me outside into pretty places) I just cannot recommend it enough to others and stress how imperative it is that people log off and spend more time outside, both for their own health and for the purpose of exploring your communities and building the critical relationships with others necessary to grow a socialist movement. \n\nTLDR;\n\nPeople desperately need to get off the internet and maximize time outdoors, in any capacity. Research contact hypothesis theory and Marx's theory of alienation and see how they compliment each other to help better paint the picture of why social media is deeply harmful to us.",

If you want to reach people and have a platform, you either continue to use X or just silence yourself to hundreds of millions. And for what? So you can support a different rich person? I mean it depends on your priorities ofc, if you only use social media for social purposes then this probably isnt relevant, but if you use it for political purposes the trade off just isnt worth it. Many organizations use platforms like X, Instagram, and Facebook to reach people, raise awareness, and generally organize people. Most average people are on these sites, I mean if every Bluesky user was American and each account was truly one real person then thats still less than 10% of the population of the US at most is on that site. \n\nIf your idea of fighting Nazis is changing your social media platform at the expense of accessibility of actual anti fascism, then surely youre just doing the Nazis a favor?",

Xwitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit have monopolized the social media/public communication realm. You can see how they've saturated the market over the last ten years. That's not to say new competitors can't break through, but like all monopolized industries, it becomes increasingly more difficult.\n\nCapitalism in its infancy is great at adapting, finding new markets, and filling the void with competitive products, but once the market matures and monopolizes, and those societal pathways have mostly solidified, they become integrated into society. That's when capitalism outlives its usefulness, and the means of production must be seized to become a public utility.\n\nI commend principled people for boycotting and protesting corporations for their malicious activity, and I think it provides necessary educational moments to build class consciousness. But relying solely on individual boycotts is a mistake. \"If everyone just stopped doing XYZ...\" is an individualist and idealist proposition, no? There's not enough time or energy in a day to apply that strategy to every industry. Because it's a systemic issue, not an individualist one.\n\nIt's similar to the protests against Reddit's API changes. Reddit's infrastructure and reach are pretty solidified, so to expect the general population to simply hop to another platform without any material effect on them was a strategy doomed to fail. \n\nAnother example are the price hikes on streaming services (which does have a material effect on the general population). The general public sits back and takes it because there's no alternative in their minds, except for canceling all together. (And it would be wishful thinking to say, \"why doesn't everyone just pirate!\" Because to expect every single person to have the time and capability to do that is a fantasy.) The streaming market has matured, and they're squeezing out every last dime from us. The means of production for streaming have been developed, which means it's time for siezing. \n\nThat's the systemic solution to the systemic problem.",
