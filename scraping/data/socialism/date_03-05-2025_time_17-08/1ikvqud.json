The fbi had already engaged in a coordinated attack on the movement with help of local police forces. Calling people willing to counter police activity \"a cancer\" when the state is waging an operation against them has no place in struggle. This is a reactionary position. This position is the true \"cancer\". He began utilizing langauge that was divisive, langauge like this furthered the ability for repression to expand on the movement. He has absolutely no point, this is liberal sentiment. Arguing from this false perspective would have people saying things like \"now look the black man with a gun is off putting and will justify repression\" to the southern students who armed and had open carry demonstrations. \n\nAny revolutionary movements should not operate within the logic of liberalism; they should accept the state will fight against them. Chris hedges argument that if \"black bloc\" didn't exist, repression could not occur or be justified is false. The repressive forces operate in a response to any and all forms of resistance. Appealing to the media and reactionary politics is a horrible argument that crumbles apart when one develops a material analysist of said movements. \n\n\nWhat was the first bloc in the occupy movement? It occurred in NYC after police attacked and brutalized people engaging in civil disobedience for weeks. The blocs did not engage in any damage, they helped the protestors understand tactics to keep themselves safe. The furthest they went was dearrests. They dressed in black, utilized shields to safe guard activists, handed out gear to protect from pepper spray, taught marchers to stay tight and move together, but also helped people maneuver the streets, snake and split marches in ways that made police violence harder. The movements numbers swelled after this and unions helped shut down the bridge after thousands were outside of nypd hq.\n\n\nIn oakland the eviction attempts were very violent. These blocs occurred as a result of police violence, so I don't see how the argument that \"they will cause\" police repression makes sense. It was preexisting repression that led to these tactics. Any local occupy movement that saw these tactics occur was levels above any of the others, so I'm not sure where I see them destroying the movement in history. Repression, divisive perspectives, and liberal confusion is what kills movements.\n\nIt's always the people who aren't on the ground facing police violence who love to push opinions like this from their academic towers. \"Seek\" confrontations with \"police\"? If you partake in any anti capitalist struggle you're inherently in confrontation with \"police\".\n\nCountering police survelliance by utilizing mass anonymity is a gift to the \"survelliance state\". What's next using a VPN on a Public network is \"a gift to people looking to steal info\".\n\nThey weren't shut down because they were \"non violent\" they were shut down because they engaged in disobedience. Furthermore the \"anarchists\" did not get free reign. Fbi swat was kicking their organizers doors in throwing flash bangs down, and people like Chris hedges denounce them? Nah fuck that guy. That's not solidarity, it's not proper critique it's divisive fed bs. Anarchists were doing shit like holding popular fronts of anti capitalists within the movement, trying to push it into an explicitly leftist struggle. You could see people in black in seattle holding red flags as well. Bro was flat out denouncing leftists as a \"cancer\" to a liberal movement.",

If you want to actually know why movements lose energy you need to study liberal NGOs, infiltration, and how counter insurgency is utilized. The analysis [here](https://www.academia.edu/5486857/Counterinsurgency_and_the_Occupy_Movement) is 100 times more useful than hedges. Furthermore none of these movements fully die, they're simply experiments in resistance and developments in social struggles that appear in waves during the early stages. The areas that had the most sustained \"protest\" under trumps last reign were areas where the elements Chris calls cancers were the dominant organizing force. Elsewhere, liberal cooption was the norm. All the cities where hedges called out \"occupy\" as a \"cancerous form\" have seen sustained movements against capitalism and fascism compared to places that chased these elements from occupy. His argument is not only dangerous and cop like, but easily identified as wrong and useless.",
