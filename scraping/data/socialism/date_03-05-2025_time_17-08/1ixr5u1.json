            "body": "That figure will mostly be the (contested) death count for the famine that occurred from 1959 - 1961. The controversy here, aside from the death toll (probably impossible to tell with any real accuracy) will be the degree to which responsibility for the famine can be attributed to Mao himself which, naturally, is also a point of contention among historians. Do some reading and see what you think.",

They might be right wing, in which case they won't even pretend to entertain your objections.\n\nThe only time I ever had a positive experience challenging anti communist narratives in class, the teacher was a well meaning liberal who off-handedly claimed communism doesn't work because of how poor all communist countries are. I pointed out they were poor before they were communist and left it at that. She didn't really engage and the lesson moved on.\n\nIf you want to speak up, your audience is your fellow classmates. You aren't going to convince the teacher, but you might say something that makes your peers think about the world a little differently. Something short and simple is better than getting into a nuanced argument because even if you get every single fact right, you'll look like a conspiracy loon and to be dismissed. \n\nThe question \"how common were famines then?\" is much more powerful than \"famines were common back then, look at this country and this country and this country, blaming communism is disingenuous American propaganda.\"\n\nSee what I'm saying?",

            "body": "Unfortunately, one of the major reasons why Americans are so anti-communist is because the propaganda machine is engraved into their education system- it is what children grow up learning. \n\nMy social studies teacher in middle school in the US was among the friendliest and sweetest teachers I can remember. One day, he introduced communism to us by saying: \u201cImagine [name] gets a 73 on the next test. In communism, everyone is equal and will share that grade. So would you even study if you knew you were gonna get a 73?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s disheartening. It\u2019s the same for high school teachers too of course, as I recall my AP US History and AP European History teachers introduced and painted Lenin, Stalin, and communism in a very bad light. Fortunately, the AP content itself (for the exam) doesn\u2019t require you to talk about how many kilograms of grain Stalin ate from Ukraine with his comically large spoon or how many \u201cvictims of communism\u201d perished in China. They (mostly) only focus on facts. \n\nImo, you can try to convince your teacher if you think they\u2019re very open minded and friendly, but otherwise, there\u2019s no point. You\u2019re taking AP classes- you likely plan to attend universities and institutions beyond high school. You can make much larger contribution to our global struggle in that near future compared with trying to convince a  stubborn high school teacher.",
