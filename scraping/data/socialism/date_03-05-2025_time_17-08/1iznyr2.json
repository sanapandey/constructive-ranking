    "selftext": "Americans aren't socialist because they have been thoroughly brainwashed by decades of capitalist propaganda that feeds into the myth of the \"American Dream\" \u2014 a lie designed to keep the working class complacent and distracted. From an early age, the media, schools, and even government institutions hammer into people the false belief that individual success is solely based on hard work and that the free market is the best way to distribute resources, ignoring the inherent inequality it perpetuates. Capitalism creates a narrative where socialism is demonized as \"un-American\" or even \"totalitarian,\" despite the fact that socialist policies such as universal healthcare, free education, and strong workers\u2019 rights have proven to lead to more equitable societies. The capitalist elite works relentlessly to maintain this false consciousness because socialism threatens their wealth and power. It\u2019s not a matter of Americans not wanting socialism; they simply haven\u2019t been taught the truth about how it could build a better, more just society.",
