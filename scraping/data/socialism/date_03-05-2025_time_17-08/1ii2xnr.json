    "selftext": "Julio \u201cComrade Z\u201d Zuniga, an anarchist and organizer with the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) and whose work is published at Mongoose Distro. A profile in the Texas Observer wrote of Zuniga:\n\nHe prefers to be called Alex, but many of his contacts inside and outside of prison know him as \u201cComrade Z.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s the man people who have been at the Memorial Unit (formerly called Darrington), a 1,610-bed state prison in southeast Texas, point to when asked about organizing on the inside. Like everyone else locked up in Texas who is physically and mentally able, Zuniga, a 44-year-old from San Antonio, was required to work without pay while housed at Memorial, near the unincorporated town of Rosharon, from 2018 to 2023. He tended livestock and labored in the agricultural fields, where he\u2019d cut weeds and harvest carrots, cabbages, and onions. Before these fields were owned by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), they were plantation land worked by slaves.\n\nWhile he grew up on the South Side of San Antonio, Zuniga spent some of his youth in the rural outskirts of Laredo. This was the extent of his previous exposure to agriculture, but he took to farmwork somewhat easily. \u201cI love animals, and I love playing with dirt,\u201d he told the Texas Observer in a March interview.\n\nBut, as he began reading about the history of the land he was working and its roots in slavery\u2014and as he learned more about labor movements\u2014he started advocating for himself. He would occasionally refuse to work, telling officers he wouldn\u2019t return to the fields until he received requested safety gear like boots and masks. He\u2019d get slapped with a disciplinary case\u2014prison policy says that anyone who refuses to work can lose visitation privileges, be confined to their cell, or receive other punishments that can affect their chances of parole. Zuniga is currently about 11 years into a 15-year sentence.\n\nIn the end, though, Zuniga said that pushing back would usually get him the things he asked for.\n\nIn 2019, he became involved with the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC), a prisoner-led arm of the 119-year-old labor union the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). \u201cSometimes they say it\u2019s illegal [for prisoners to unionize], but it\u2019s not,\u201d Zuniga said. \u201cIt\u2019s just frowned upon. But it works.\u201d\n\n\nYou can write to Z at:\n\nTDCJ\nJulio A. Zuniga #01961551\nPO Box 660400\nDallas, TX 75266-0400\n\nOr contact him via Securus, a digital platform to interact with inmates. \n\nA recent update from him shows the situation is not good. They've faced pyschological attacks and retaliation for their political organizing.\n\n\"How did it get like this? I\u2019ve lost too many friends to suicide on The Memorial Unit because of people like Warden Deward DeMoss who is racking up corpses there now, this is a corpse factory in Ramsey Unit where I came from,it was a slave furniture factory, where I witnessed the treatment of worker slaves treated way differently. I was once again provoked into speaking my mind,and here you have it raw and uncut. I\u2019m advocating for people now,but I need help because I respect confidentiality in prison, these people in administration use it as weapon to shame you to suicide yourself. It is an understatement,when I say this is an emergency.\n\nTexas Observer Magazine and The Final Straw Radio I\u2019d like to recognize as the strongest media supporters of this kind of love for humanity. Birthday wishes noted,TY!!!!!!!!\"\n\n",

            "body": "Also, no comrade z's account of suicide occuring systematically as a result of a tactic of psychological war (torture) on inmates who rebel is not paranoia. It's a reality. This situation is dire. He needs outside support. No matter what leftist perspective you hold, this man is engaged in class struggle directly with a boot on his throat; imagine being told you get confined in a room pyschologically devestated and disconnected from your family for engaging in labor demands... yet still continuing to fight. Write a letter asking how you can support him and other inmates from the outside.\n\nhttps://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2024-06-14/suicides-in-texas-prisons-have-dramatically-increased/\n\n\"Hogrell\u2019s suicide is part of a disturbing trend. Data from the Texas Justice Initiative shows that prison suicides in the state have nearly doubled over the last four years, from an average of 28.6 a year from 2005-2019 to 56 a year from 2020-2023.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.texasobserver.org/prison-heat-air-conditioning-texas-summer/\n\n\"Coffield is one of 14 prisons with no air-conditioning in its housing areas, and 55 units only have partial AC in housing areas, according to data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ). This means only about a third of all Texas prisons are fully equipped with air-conditioning. The majority of non-air-conditioned units are in the southern and eastern parts of the state, areas that have suffered significantly from record-breaking heat.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.texasobserver.org/criminal-justice-prison-sleep-tdcj-sleep-deprivation-lawsuit/\n\n\n\"The unit\u2019s schedule\u2014packed with programming, check-ins, and appointments on a 24-hour basis\u2014leaves only three and a half hours for sleep, only two and a half uninterrupted, according to court documents in a long-running lawsuit against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ).\u00a0\"",
