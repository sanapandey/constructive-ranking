            "body": "Paul Klebnikov was an American-born journalist who wrote about Russian oligarchs. He also had a book-length interview with Chechen mob boss Khoza Noukhayev. He mostly wrote in English but his Chechnya book, \"Conversation with a Barbarian\", has never been translated (to my knowledge).\n\nThe details surrounding Klebnikov's 2004 murder are mysterious, with many culprits and dead ends. I made this video essay to help translate some of his lesser-known material and offer context for 1990s Russia: gang warfare, state-sponsored terrorism, secession movements, unprecedented corruption.\n\nNear the end of his life, Klebnikov was concerned about creeping oligarchy in the US. The fact that his 20 year anniversary passed without comment feels odd, as he is well-known in Russia and still gets his own shows there.\n\nPicked up a couple used hardcovers of his book, \"Godfather of the Kremlin: Boris Berezovsky and the Looting of Russia\". The hardback is out of print but remains a good overview of the 1990s.",
