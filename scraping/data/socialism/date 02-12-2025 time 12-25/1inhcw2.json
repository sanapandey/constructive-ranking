I do not consider them true Jews and I\u2019m sick of being meshed in with them. There are plenty of devout Jews who aren\u2019t zionist pieces of shit. Be careful with your wording.",

We aren't the most observant but grew up in a large community in Pittsburgh. I swear my mom just thinks that she learned way back when in Hebrew school that Israel = good and won't even try to look with her eyes or at anything that negatively portrays Israel.",

So I\u2019m not totally alone and luckily have some really great anti-genocide family too. Thank you! \n\nAnd you know what, they got pissed at me for posting this stuff on social media. If they really cared about me they would have had a conversation with me. But I realize with culty shit like isntreal and Zionism that, again, these people don\u2019t truly think for themselves and have to come to these conclusions on their own if ever. \n\nIt\u2019s shitty and I miss my family, I swear my dad\u2019s side of the family is the most dysfunctional family ever, but  it\u2019s not my fault and I\u2019d rather be on the right side of history / be honest about what my morals and values are. \n\nSorry to you too, I hope you can find a decent way to navigate it.",

It goes against the very spirit of inquiry. It also plays into your confirmation bias that makes one think they know everything. Religious and systems of belief, tradition can have immense meaning to individuals, families, and communities - and dismissing them as fairy tales outright is just your projected inability to connect to stories other than the dominant scientific materialist story that you've grown accustomed to.",

Much of the rest of the text is the attempt to build a homogenous culture from that mixed multitude--creating shared conceptions of morality, origin stories, common enemies etc. Calling it immoral strips us from having a materialist understanding of how judaism came to be and what was happening in the world at the time of its formation. I recommend Norman Gottwald's \"The Hebrew Bible: a Socio-literary Introduction\" for a marxist  analysis of the writing of the torah.\n\nas a side note, whether any religion is immoral or not doesn't actually matter to me--what's more important is recognizing that it plays a HUGE role (particularly christianity) in US ideology/mental terrain. We have to understand how the ruling class wields religion to bolster their own hegemony and we have to learn how to wield religion to organize our class and win. As Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis explains in \"Poverty and the Bible\", we must work to understand how, \u201cthe Bible\u2014a text replete with references to economic justice and the scourge of indifference to the poor\u2014has been politicized to suggest that poverty is a result of the moral failures of the poor sinning against God, that ending poverty is impossible, and that the poor themselves have no role in impacting their poverty.\u201d \n\nthere is a good section of this article about how religion has been and can be wielded: [https://universityofthepoor.org/changing-minds-mental-fortresses-and-the-6-rs-part-4-of-6/](https://universityofthepoor.org/changing-minds-mental-fortresses-and-the-6-rs-part-4-of-6/)",

A jewish zionist won't be swayed by that, they'll probably feel attacked. As american jews, we are so heavily propagandized from an early age to have israel be part of our identity that they might think you're calling them a nazi. \n\nI would also add on that for any organizing conversation (which is essentially what OP is asking for help in doing), you need to listen to the issues of the person you're talking to. If they don't feel heard, they won't listen to you either. So it needs to be an actual conversation, not just sending a message on instagram.

At that point bring it back to a one secular, democratic (or socialist if they're that way inclined) state solution which treats all of it's citizens equally. They might not like the idea but you have to keep referencing to the humanity of the marginalised people. Use the liberation of Apartheid South Africa as an example for this point.\n\nIf they try to argue that Israel is democratic or secular then the counterpoint is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law%3A_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People aka 'Israel's Basic Law 2018' which gives Jewish people rights over all other religious groups (Right to return etc).\n\nIt'll give them something to think about if nothing else.

To be absolutely fair to the Jewish people large parts of the world have actually plotted against them before. In these case I find leaning into it can sometime work as you won't go up against the instant denial which is the most difficult defense. \n\nSo ask them how they feel about the richest man in the world giving a nazi saulte to the most powerful one and nobody really batting an eye? And how come these guys are totally behind zionism? Do you really think they have your best interest at heart? after they are done deporting mexicans so you really not think that Jewish people will be next? Zionism is will be used a trap because now nobody will care about the another genocide after we got everyone to ignore the last one and undermined every international body set up to monitor and prevent it. \n\nThere are verses from the old testament, I can't remember exactly but it was about the punishment of the people at the fall of Nineveh and how nobody pitied them after what their cruelty wrought. This can work on the more religious. \n\nIf they deny the salute then embarrassment in front of family and peers can work. This worked on my father when he began to spout some anti science bullshit, I physically removed all of the technology that he is utterly dependent on even his glasses and refused to give it back until he begged, while I explained the science behind the tech he needed, he was very angry but it did work.
