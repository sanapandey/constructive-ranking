It's honestly not surprising most don't even have the intelligence to think past tv box sayz Israel good Hamas bad \ud83d\ude31 Go America woo \n\nI guess it still is disturbing but at this point it's what I've come to expect out of the most brainwashed country in the world. \n\nYears of propaganda and gutting public education gave the bourgeoisie exactly what they wanted. Illiterate wage slaves who's opinions they can control at a whim. \n\nI'm stuck between a constant battle of somewhat feeling bad for these people because rationally I can understand that they were created to be this way. But also have an unfathomable anger for them as their state funded views opinions and actions are the reason capitalism still exists and atrocities continue to happen and be cheered upon.\n\n It's just a grim reality we live in.. Hard to cope with sometimes",

It's more so America is itself apart of settler colonialism which is a unique form of colonialism, an offset of British colonialism. Long story short this creates a global system where racism is inherent. A system of commodifying colonized bodies, and expanding. A system where the so called 3rd world has wealth extracted and funneled into the settler states. The working class on the west who benefit from this are a sort of \"labor aristocrat\". Racism in the settler colonies plays a role too, as black bodies for example, are a colonized nation living within America. Israel is not only in line with American values as a form of western settler colonialism, but the position of privilege American workers hold over the 3rd world and indigenous nations gives them perspectives that are reactionary.\n\nGo talk like Malcom x to your average white American (not even a maga one) and see how they feel. Then go say free palestine to your average Jewish Israeli. Same exact reaction and mannerisms I bet. Another thing is, the loyalist neighborhoods in belfast fly israel flags. Why? They're pro colonial settler state, which is evident in them believing ireland is apart of the UK. People fully assimilated into whiteness will hold these opinions by nature.",
