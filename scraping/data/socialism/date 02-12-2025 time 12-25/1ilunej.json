It jibes with a book I've read, called \"Against the Grain\", in which the author describes a death spiral of elite profit extraction.\u00a0\n\n\nThe \"shareholder class\" is essentially the nobility, expecting and demanding uninterrupted income streams. As they burn through the low-hanging fruits of profitability, they demand new revenue streams using resourced that are increasingly scarce and so provide at increasingly smaller margins of return.\u00a0\n\n\nAt some point, they start really squeezing the lower classes. The book's author claims that the nobles are so insulated as to be oblivious to peasant suffering. Maybe this is true of some of nobility, but the system selects for sociopaths and narcissists so that I believe they are indifferent or even happy to justify their cruelty\n\n\nIn the case of the shareholder class, they are largely insulated from the workers and the direct effects of their policies. They see layoffs and don't have to deal with the broken families, or else justify it's to themselves (Don't I deserve a return on my investment?)\u00a0",
