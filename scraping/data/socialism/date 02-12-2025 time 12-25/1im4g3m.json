The nations, companies, and workers who prove themselves insufficient are shaken out.\n\n>Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d is thus said to benefit everyone because the most efficient forms of production will always win out. Once the capitalist system as a whole descends into crisis, however, such principles often go out the window\u2014at least for the capitalists who are losing out in the competition.\n\n>In such moments, protectionism rushes to the fore, offering an alternative. The trade wars being launched by Trump and the MAGA faction are an example. The current crisis that Trump\u2019s tariff wars hope to solve has its roots in the failure of neoliberal globalization, which is itself the now outdated solution to a previous capitalist crisis.",
