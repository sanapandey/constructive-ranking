If that's the case, when he transforms back into human, will it turn out to be a baby Dumbledore?\nSorry if there are any grammar mistakes.\n",

Some say the animagus form matches the patronus and so could be a magical creature if the patronus is one; but Tonks\u2019 patronus is known to change over time, and it\u2019s likely that Snape\u2019s did too. Animagus forms are permanent though, so they\u2019re clearly not bound together.",

That would open the door for Voldemort to do stuff like sustain himself by drinking his own unicorn blood, hypothetically speaking. \n\nSeems like often the Patronus involves the person you're in love with. \n\nBtw it mentioned in PoA that they chose those animals so it'd be easier for them to go out on full moons with Remus, so I think there is at least some decision there.",

Agreed though, it would run the risk of a magician being able to transform into something insanely powerful. \n\nI think the person you love, or are obsessed with in Snape\u2019s case perhaps, can have a significant effect but it\u2019s not the only factor I\u2019m sure. Harry\u2019s is still a stag when he falls for Ginny. \n\nThere\u2019s no mention of choice in PoA: Lupin says that as the smallest Pettigrew was able to freeze the tree, and James and Sirius, being \u2018such large animals\u2019 were able to hide his werewolf form.

I think they\u2019re one of the oldest and most powerfully magical creatures, it\u2019s possible they can\u2019t be killed at all except by old age and they may just be continually reborn from the ashes of their past body, over and over again, however they die.",
