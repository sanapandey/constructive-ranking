The only initial issue was a language barrier when the golden trio met him. I've always assumed his character was a bit odd looking and not quite human aside from the height.",

So naturally you can't be too \"age accurate\" there in your casting!\n\nThen, you also need an actor who can legitimately stick around for the better part of a decade on a TV show (and by 'stick around' I don't just mean stay alive...I mean have the willigness to continue to be an active part of a TV show for 7 seasons).\n\nI think realistically it makes the most sense to cast a 60-something as Dumbledore. Anyway, the wig will make him look older. And around the same age range for the other older faculty at Hogwarts.\n\nI personally think casting 40 year olds for the Snape/Lupin/James Potter generation makes sense.",

We don't need to see a rerun of that, do we?\u00a0\n\n\nI've not seen enough body of work for the actors that are playing McGonagall & Hagrid, so I can't really pass judgement. If Brett's good enough though, I can't see why he couldn't play Hagrid, cause the makeup department can surely do the rest. Have you guys seen what they did to Colin Farrell in Penguin?\n\n\nRegarding the actor that's playing Snape, I actually like the fact they're seeking out other people of different ethical backgrounds to play core characters, as the movies made a poor showing for this.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, Paapu Essiedu seems a bit to handsome for the role, especially when the author constantly describes Snape in the books, literally by everyone. I mean at this rate I think most people associate him with his greasy long hair & hooked nose and so I don't think Paapu should play him.\n\n\nAnyway, looking forward to the series as a whole.
