They\u2019re in the trenches working together so much, naturally that close bond develops; they can\u2019t do it without the other person.

And that doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of their relationship, but I struggle to see how people jump to romance unless they can\u2019t see past  a blanket \u201ctwo people are close, they must have some feelings for each other\u2026\u201d without any of the nuance.",

For reasons that have very little to do with literature and far more to do with me clinging to the plot as I first imagined it, Hermione ended up with Ron.\u201d She added,\u00a0\u201cI know, I\u2019m sorry, I can hear the rage and fury it might cause some fans, but if I\u2019m absolutely honest, distance has given me perspective on that. It was a choice I made for very personal reasons, not for reasons of credibility. Am I breaking people\u2019s hearts by saying this? I hope not.\u201d\n\n>In some ways Hermione and Harry are a better fit and I'll tell you something very strange. When I wrote Hallows, I felt this quite strongly when I had Hermione and Harry together in the tent! I hadn't told [Steve] Kloves that and when he wrote the script he felt exactly the same thing at exactly the same point.",

It's just that I think Hermione & Ron and Harry & Ginny were just forced together to retain a \"happy ending\" where they all have an excuse to stay in each other's lives. Some people settle down with their high school sweethearts, but most don't. It just seemed like JK wanted a way to keep the gang together after they graduated from Hogwarts and marriage seemed like the best way to do so. The romantic build up just isn't there for me and they all seem like couples of convenience.",
