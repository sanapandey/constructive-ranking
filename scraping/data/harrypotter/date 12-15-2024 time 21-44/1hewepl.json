I\u2019m sure they likely still pay taxes of their own, especially since we never see any mention of paying for school (JKR herself has said that tuition at Hogwarts is always free, and we see in book 6 that Hogwarts helps financially-burdened students pay for supplies) and no paying for healthcare when Arthur was attacked (though Harry is still pretty young when this happens and I highly doubt Molly and Arthur would be talking about their finances within earshot of him\u2014especially him. The most they do is mention that things are \u201ctight\u201d when they\u2019re taking 5 kids + Harry to Diagon Alley one year)\n\nBut yes, nothing\u2019s free, even in a magical world. I\u2019m sure they have a tax system set up that JKR failed to mention because this was a story about a magical war, but it\u2019s interesting to think about from a realistic point of view\n\nETA: I also just thought about those magical beings who basically live double lives\u2014THOSE witches/wizards likely pay taxes in both worlds, similar to how dual citizens in America/England have to pay taxes in both countries (I know not every dual citizen has to do this, it\u2019s specifically an American thing that I\u2019m aware of), but otherwise I just can\u2019t see forcing magical people who *only* make Galleons vs. pounds to pay double taxes. Anyway, I\u2019m rambling, I just love thinking about realism in this world",

They may also go down the route of requiring all documented contracts to be registered with the Ministry, and collecting a fee on that registration - that would collect them a small but steady income from everything from businesses hiring new staff to someone renting or purchasing a property.\n\nThe reason I say maybe with regards to St Mungos being paid for by taxes is that, way way back in the day Rowling released a job advert for a Hit Wizard at the Department for Magical Law Enforcement on her website (this was pre-Pottermore). It revealed that part of their compensation is a reserved personal bed at St Mungos. Now, I know it was a joke piece that was just playing up how dangerous the job is supposed to be.

            "body": "There's this newly discovered theory that Hogwarts is actually paid for buy the parents, because while it os never mentioned that they have to pay, there are subtle reference to it throughout the books. Uncle Verno says he won't pay for a crackpot to teach him magic tricks (and isn't contradicted), Tom Riddle is told there is a school scholarship programme. Despite Mr. Weasley not having a good job, and the fact that magic and common sense can support a large family a lot without money (things can easily be repaired many times, food can be grown and multiplied by magic, things in general can be multiplied, the family land may have no mortgage/no rent, no 'council costs' etc.) then you would wonder why despite a large family, the Weasley's are so poor? Maybe because they have to pay something for school? Harry's massive bank account could have a direct debit so it's never mentioned, Hermione's parents are dentists so most likely rich and happy to pay fees. You don't hear of other Muggle borns situations, so they could very well be scholarships nobody knows about.\n\nIn terms of a non-fee paying school, there's a lot that could just be covered by magic, like food multiplication, no rent, magic used to fuel lights, multiply wood for fires and such, so the only real costs would be hiring teachers, seeing as everyone has to bring their own books and stationary. So maybe there is a tax so nobody has to pay. But it's also not fully specified. Reading between the lines, there is suggestion that it could be fee paying. There's no requirement to go to Hogwarts as a half blood/pure blood. You would expect it to be obligatory if it was free.\n\nWe shall never know.",
