Dumbledore seems to understand old magic like how Harry's mother given the choice decided to sacrifice herself for Harry. How that magic is what allowed him to be protected. Also how he knew that Snape had to present a challenge for Harry to retrieve the sword of Gryffindor. I think Dumbledore understands this type of magic much better than Voldemort. \n\nVoldemort on the other hand might be better with spells. Using magic to make himself become powerful. I think contrasting to that Dumbledore is probably better with creating devices that are useful. Like the deluninator or the penseive.",

Dumbledore in his earlier days seems to have also wanted to be the most powerful wizard. But he's also like 150 years old by the time he's dying. \n\nI expect there's some patterns you'd recognize about magic after you've been around it for so long. I believe that's why he puts so much stock into old magic. He knows the value in understanding it because he understands that the magical world is more than just about seeking power. \n\nAlso when it comes to his magical devices. I imagine being that old you have so many memories cluttering your mind. So he probably just found it more useful to have a device he could pickup that does something instead of having to perform magic.",

I know he gets good marks, but I expect that from anyone who can use magic and follows instructions from the capable staff.\n\nHermione could be powerful, but I suspect she only excels in your first category with just a little ability in the way of creativity. And I would submit that Tom is a very creative person, which makes him that much more powerful, the way he devises his plans and goals to become immortal. Really, it's almost unfortunate that he was so dark and racist and then hellbent on killing one particular child. As Ollivander said, he did great things, terrible things, but great nonetheless.",

He's a kid/teenager going up against odds that most adults couldn't handle, so obviously he's going to need some luck. And I don't get the second part - OP explicitly mentions Harry's prowess in regards to him being creative and that absolutely coincides with having natural talent, so you're not really disagreeing there.\n\n\n\n>He's good at the DADA stuff\n\nHe's *exceptional* in DADA. Like, legitimately a generational talent. People often fail to realise this because he's not a studious person and is \"only\" pretty good at most other types of magic, but Harry summoned the most powerful Patronus we witness in the series, ouperformed the best of the best Durmstrang and Beauxbatons had to offer despite being 3-4 years younger - and yes, that does count because Harry only had a real advantage in the last task, for the first two Krum and Fleur had just as much and possibly even more assistance than Harry - and taught defensive magic, including spells many adults struggled with, to his peers and senior year students at age 15.  \nNot to mention holding his own against fully trained dark wizards and some of the best Death Eaters in Voldemort's ranks.\n\n>He needs help with everything else or just doesn't seem like he's particularly good.\n\nIt's really not true that he needs help with \"everything else\". This is at best a huge exaggeration and when Harry does get to be a normal student for a short period of time - no visions/nightmares, no defamation or ostracism, no grand extracurricular plots, no life-threatening circumstances etc. - he usually picks up new material pretty fast.\n\n\n\n>  \nI know he gets good marks\n\nHe gets pretty good marks in spite of the abovementioned circumstances. Most people would have been absolutely horrendous students under the same conditions; if they were even still alive to begin with lol.",

They never suffered Grindelwald's terror therefore don't have the contextual terror he caused outside of intellectual idea. Similarly Voldemort concentrated on Britain, so the beyond the intellectual context the wider world have no clue of Voldemort evil.\nSimarly I think Voldemort is more gifted in intellectual capacity for magic, he is a researcher/scientist for the most part, who can fight. While Grindelwald was more martially gifted or more 'physically gifted' wizard who happens to have the capacity for research. And Dumbledore falls in between.\nSo in conclusion, all three are apex of human capabilities. Voldemort strengths are his curiosity, ambition, pride and cunning, he likes to discover and push the boundaries regardless of morals, and ethics, so his is a scientist. Grindelwald strengths are his passion, boldness,flair and charisma, he is a revolutionary, an orator, a soldier and a general.Dumbledore  strengths are his empathy, creativity, and making use of available tools and information. He is a leader of men and a teacher. All three share similarities of course, each of the forementioned qualities each wizard possess if to lesser degree than the other two. All three are frighteningly smart, have disregard for rules and social convention, have certain arrogance that comes with being the best and Brightest in any room they find themselves and authority comes naturally to them.",

Could hide his guilt sufficiently from Dumbledore at Hogwarts, who definitely scans students' mind with his piercing gaze.

And his other Horcrux could hurt Dumbledore enough to curse him, destining him to die in a year.\n\nVoldemort battled McGonagall, Flitwick, Slughorn at once, and they couldn't beat him. All three were experienced, highly talented teachers, with different skillsets. Flitwick was a duelling champion. Voldemort handled them all at once.\n\nDumbledore was definitely more talented than Voldemort, Grindelwald mightve been too. But the differences between them were in small degrees.

He does not actually show particularly exceptional feats, especially in the books (the final fight between him and Dumbledore in TOTP is much more flashy in the movies unlike the book where Voldemort simply spams the killing curse and Dumbledore animates the statues in the ministry to use them as a shield), but at the same time he is shown to be able to fly without any support and was able to curse the Defense Against the Dark Arts chair so deeply that not even Dumbledore was able to undo it, both things considered extraordinary.

He is more cunning/crafty than anyone else is willing to be for personal gain in the immortality department.\n\nFor instance, who knows how many Ravenclaws could figure out horcruxes but are so repelled morally that they'll never make the attempt to be compared. How many Gryffindors could find the chamber by exploration and bravery if it wasn't locked just by being a parseltongue? Which itself is a Slytherin trait. How many Hufflepuffs could be charismatic enough to gather an army of followers if there was a need for it? But Voldemort only did it to overthrow a benevolent (not perfect) system, a violent route that they would never pursue on ethical grounds.\n\nThis shows he's peak slytherin more than peak strong/smart.",
