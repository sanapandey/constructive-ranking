    "selftext": "note: I am not talking about use-value, or exchange value, or price, etc. but specifically about \"Value\" that Marx says, finds its origin in \"socially necessary labor time\"\n\n\n\nI'm reading Capital right now, and I have been thinking about the Labor Theory of Value that Marx uses, specifically, about whether the Value in a commoditiy can change, and whether 2 identical commodities (e.g. 2 chairs) can have drastically different values. \n\nI've come up with the following thought experiment: Marx says that the Value of a commodity depends on the \"socially necessary labor time\" needed to produce it. \n\nLet's say I'm examining the Value of a CPU. Let's presuppose that you need a really advanced and extensive factory to produce that CPU. Let's also say, for simplicities sake, that there's only a single CPU factory on earth, which pumps out thousands of CPUs a day. Now, it still takes a lot of combined labor time to produce a single CPU, but its not \\*that\\* much for each additional CPU, once you've set everything up. \n\nLet's now say I drop a nuclear bomb on that factory. \n\nShortly after dropping the nuclear bomb, I realize that I need a new CPU. So I buy a shit-ton of materials, hire a huge amount of workers, rebuild the factory, and manufacture 1 (one) CPU.\n\nQuestion: The Value of that first CPU I manufacture, does it include not only the \"normal\" socially necessary labor time, e.g. the Value CPUs had before I dropped that nuke on the factory, but also the labor time that was spent in rebuilding the factory? Also, as soon as I drop the nuclear bomb on the factory, does the Value of already existing CPUs go up, since it would at that point take a lot more labor time to produce another one?",

If they were used up at once, like the raw material, their whole value would at once be transferred to the commodities they assist in producing. But as a spindle, for example, is but gradually used up, an average calculation is made, based upon the average time it lasts, and its average waste or wear and tear during a certain period, say a day. In this way we calculate how much of the value of the spindle is transferred to the yarn daily spin, and how much, therefore, of the total amount of labour realized in a pound of yarn, for example, is due to the quantity of labour previously realized in the spindle.\u201d\n\n- Value, Price, and Profit (Marx)",

I was asking about the variable capital (labor), and specifically whether if the means of production to do not exist, i.e. the necessary labor time to produce a specific commodity includes the time needed to first create the tools, that increases the Value of the finished commodity. Can you elaborate on your answer?",

Only labor can do that.\n* yes, the value embodied in the means of production (i.e. the necessary labor time required to produce them) is contained in the final product as it is passed on but *only in part*\n\nsince your machinery is built to produce not just one CPU, but hundreds or thousands, the capital costs of constructing the factory are not contained in or recouped by the sale of the first CPU. those will be recouped overtime through the aliquot part of the machinery's value that gets passed on to each chip your factory produces",

You\u2019re asking if the building/setup costs of building a second factory and the labor they represent will increase the price of the chips from the second factory relative to the chips from the first?\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then I suppose it would increase the average cost of the CPUs since the capitalist would need to recoup on what they lost in the bombing of the first factory. The amount of the increase would depend on the average of the extra materials/tools and added labor costs. The amount of cost the added labor would add to the commodity would depend on the rate of profit, I think. So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be a doubling in price.\n\n\nI could be wrong, someone can feel free to correct me.",

Whats the value of a diamond if youre in a desert and dying of thirst, and whats the value of water in the same situation? would you trade the diamond for water? And is the labor put into those things relevant in this situation?\n\nIf there are suddenly no new CPUs, the price of the existing CPUs would skyrocke. And nobody would create a factory to produce a single CPU. They would create a factory to produce many CPUs..\n\nAt the point when cpus are again industrially produced under market competition the theoy of value would start to determine the value of the commodity.",

What counts as \"socially necessary\" is socially determined: it reflects the average across society at a given time, not any one producer's effort. If a single factory takes longer because it\u2019s inefficient or, in your example, has to be rebuilt, that extra labor doesn\u2019t add to the value of the commodity.\n\nIn your example, the time and effort spent reconstructing the factory wouldn\u2019t raise the value of the CPU; value is still determined by how long it *normally* takes to produce one in an already-functioning factory. At the same time, the destruction of the factory would create scarcity, which would cause the exchange value (price) of existing CPUs to skyrocket. But this isn\u2019t because their intrinsic value has changed\u2014it\u2019s a market-driven reaction to limited supply.\n\nIn short, Marx would say that exceptional labor inefficiencies don\u2019t determine value, while market scarcity reflects itself in exchange value, not the value of the commodity itself. Your scenario underscores a tension in Marx\u2019s theory between the abstract concept of value, which ignores temporary disruptions and inefficiencies, and the practical realities of scarcity and market dynamics, where price can deviate sharply from value.",

I understand that the conditions immediately after the nuclear impact are \"abnomal\" in a colloquial sense, but what if I, for example, wait 20 years before rebuilding the factory?
