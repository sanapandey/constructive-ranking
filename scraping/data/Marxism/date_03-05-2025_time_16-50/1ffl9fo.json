    "selftext": "1. \"Labor is the source of wealth and all culture, and since useful labor is possible only in society and through society, the proceeds of labor belong undiminished with equal right to all members of society.\"\n\n*First part of the paragraph*: \"Labor is the source of all wealth and all culture.\"  \n=\n\n>Labor is\u00a0*not the source*\u00a0of all wealth.\u00a0*Nature*\u00a0is just as much the source of use values (and it is surely of such that material wealth consists!) as labor, which itself is only the manifestation of a force of nature, human labor power. The above phrase is to be found in all children's primers and is correct insofar as it is implied that labor is performed with the appurtenant subjects and instruments. But a socialist program cannot allow such bourgeois phrases to pass over in silence the\u00a0*conditions*\u00a0that lone give them meaning. And insofar as man from the beginning behaves toward nature, the primary source of all instruments and subjects of labor, as an owner, treats her as belonging to him, his labor becomes the source of use values, therefore also of wealth. The bourgeois have very good grounds for falsely ascribing\u00a0*supernatural creative power*\u00a0to labor; since precisely from the fact that labor depends on nature it follows that the man who possesses no other property than his labor power must, in all conditions of society and culture, be the slave of other men who have made themselves the owners of the material conditions of labor. He can only work with their permission, hence live only with their permission.\n\n>Let us now leave the sentence as it stands, or rather limps. What could one have expected in conclusion? Obviously this:\n\n>\"Since labor is the source of all wealth, no one in society can appropriate wealth except as the product of labor. Therefore, if he himself does not work, he lives by the labor of others and also acquires his culture at the expense of the labor of others.\"\n\n>Instead of this, by means of the verbal river \"and since\", a proposition is added in order to draw a conclusion from this and not from the first one.\n\n...MORE  \n[Critique of the Gotha Programme-- I (marxists.org)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm)",

This are two independent variables, but due to people usually do not qualify what they mean under value, there become a confusion.\n\nImagine we live in futuristic society where everything produced by self replicating machines. There is no human labor anywhere. What value of what this machines produce? Cost to society is zero. There no human labor used, Do this machines produce use value? Absolutely.\n\nWe actually have this machine. Nature, a self replicating machine that produce oxygen, air for as. Use value of air is infinite, as we can not live with out longer then a few minutes. Production value? In normal condition is zero. No human labor involve.\n\nNow [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundrisse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grundrisse)\n\n\"production is consumption, consumption is production\" - dialectical nature of production. If there no consumption, there is no production.\n\nThat mean Nature by itself does not produce value. Value is realized in act of consumption. So yes, at the end human labor is source of all value, which is created in act of production and realized in act of consumption. Use value is not connected to production value in any way.",

            "body": "All Marx is saying in that paragraph is that when capitalists say labor is the source of all wealth, what they really mean -- or what's implied -- is: labor power, or the ability to work on nature and make something out of it, is the source of all wealth.  Which means that both nature and our ability to work on it are sources of wealth. Then he says if that's what that phrasing means it's correct, but we can't let what capitalists imply remain unspoken, because there is a danger in doing so: it hides the class struggle. Because when you leave the part about nature unspoken, what Marx claims is that capitalists are obfuscating their power, specifically, the fact that they own nature. And because they own the land and the things we use (ie means of production) to work on nature, they have mastery over our ability to create wealth. So just saying \"labor is the source of all wealth and culture\" is an empty and even dangerous phrase in Marx's eyes because it hides the fight between classes. And then he goes on later in gotha program to list some other dangers with the phrase (because it can be used to justify the status quo rather than change it, and so on). So Marx's main concern here is how a rhetorical construction -- labor is source of all wealth -- is actually an obfuscation of class antagonisms. \n\nHowever, people often take this passage and use it to focus on other things, specifically how Marx says nature can be a source of wealth, etc and it's not just our ability to labor. But that's because people are more concerned with environmental issues and debates around labor theory of value in our age, so they usually interpret it with their concerns in mind.\n\nIn any case, thanks for the post, always a good one.",
