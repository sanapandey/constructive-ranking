Or was the feminist movement mostly about the right to get job.\n\nThere seems to be some people anti feminist movement are they mostly angry that jobs being taken away?\n\nThe US is mostly a bizarre country that for short time females stayed home and did not work but in lot of developing countries lot of females work in factories unlike the US.\n\n When it was the Industrial Revolution it was mostly all females and kids working in those factories. So again the US is mostly a bizarre country that for short time females stayed home.\n\n\n\n",

Equal right to work was/is big part for many feminists. The ability to work was viewed as the way to free women from their husbands or other men in their lives financial control and provide the ability to provide for themselves. Women also fought for the right to receive an education which often leads to specialized work of course. \n\nMarxist feminists or post colonial feminist however would maybe disagree that economic freedom for women was a good thing and I think feel that it\u2019s only contributed to the disaster that is capitalism.\n\nI don\u2019t really understand the bizarre stuff you are talking about. It\u2019s a myth that women have always stayed home and not contributed to society. The contributions women have been making since the beginning of time maybe don\u2019t always have a monetary value but is nonetheless important. You are here writing this post because of something a woman did that only a woman could do.",

            "body": "I would say it was both a struggle for wages and increasing the inroads for women into different types of paid work.\n\nBut I think women staying at home is a class distinction and historical anomaly of the imperialist gains of the US. With Betty Friedman\u2019s work on the Feminine Mystique does describe the idyllic but constrained housewife.\n\nSo women always worked in the US, but many in the west did do u paid domestic labor, and have seen been drawn into paid work which has its negatives but is also a positive development in the position of women in a present reality where human value does follow economic value or to put it, economic value anchors social value on average.\n\nSo I would look into the specifics of who did what work where and when. Because while more women were domestic laborers only, there is also a glossing over the women who did do paid work because they weren\u2019t part of the suburban housewife image and to what extent women supported businesses with unpaid labor because it was part of family business.",

She never considered herself a feminist, as she equated the feminist movement with liberal bourgeoisie interests, correctly I believe. Liberal feminism just transfers the power of exploitation to a privileged class of women, rather than liberating all workers and exploited people. Liberals can point to rich women in positions of power as tokens to feminism, while exploiting the labour of women in the Global South to extract more profits for the imperial core.",

Likewise, you are only showing off your gross ignorance if you think the USA was unique in such a division of labor. Women staying out of factories was common in the industrialized world. This is why it was noteworthy when many women in the UK undertook factory labor during the First World War, for example. Where are you coming up with the utterly ignorant crap you're spewing? What are your references? If it was \"mostly all females and kids working in those factories\" WHERE WERE THE  MEN in the UK and Germany, the two LEADING countries in the Industrial Revolution. The so-called \"developing countries\" DID NOT TAKE PART in the Industrial Revolution. So, do enlighten us, what is the source for your ignorant spew?",
