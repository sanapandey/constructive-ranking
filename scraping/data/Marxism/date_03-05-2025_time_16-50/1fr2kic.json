A law that grants police officers the power for unrestricted search and seizure in situations they seem fit\n\n2. A law that permits doctor assisted euthanasia\u00a0\n\nWhat do you guys think his perspectives on these issues would be? ",

The police are an extension of the state which itself is part of the superstructure of society. We can understand the state as a body created by the ruling class to help bring stability to capitalism and its contradictions. There however exists a contradiction with the police itself, that is on the one hand they are part of the state and are tasked with bringing stability to capitalism, but on the other hand they act in their own self interest, weather that is doing sketchy things to enrich themselves (like overticketing or flat out robbing people) or perpetuating reactionary politics to further propagandize the public into supporting or joining them. In order to analyze a policy that would allow the police to frisk people at will, Marx would likely say we need to understand the material conditions that lead to that. Most likely it would have to do with a straight forward contradiction of capitalism that is leading the masses to resist the ruling class and in an act of fear they want the police to have more freedom push back against the masses. Alternatively, it could have to do with the contradiction that I mentioned before which lead to the police having more power to do what they want. From there we could try to analyze how that decision is further affecting the material conditions of the people and how that would further drive contradictions within society to then predict what would happen next. \n\nMaybe I'll reply to the other point if I have time in a bit",

                    "body": "So with the other one, we have to analyze the role of religion in bourgeoisie society. Marx says religion is the opium of the masses and I know there are many interpretations of this statement, but in the context of your second point, I'd underscore how religion (like the state) is part of the superstructure of society and in many ways it brings stability to capitalism. In the United States we frequently talk about the \"protestant work ethic\" and the charity of some churches can sometimes be used as a release valve on lower class people who could be swayed to participate in more radical politics. That said, there is again a contradiction with the church and the state. Most religious institutions are older than capitalism (at least as the dominant mode of production) itself and they of course have their own interest. The number 1 reason why assisted sucicide is illegal is because of religion. Part of the reason that (at least I think) why the state often doesn't push back against the church's stance of assisted sucicide is because there are a lot of industries that exploit the elderly in their final years and those industries have a good stake in the government also. Additionally, assisted sucicide won't help to increase production... so why would they. If we were to try to assess why assisted sucicide were to become leagal, we would need to again analyze the material conditions that lead to that decision. Rn, a growing number of people are alienated from their communities which tears people from their traditions and ritual. This is weakening religion. Additionally, this alienated population also has a tendency to demand rights for individuals, which would make them more in favor of assisted sucicide. To understand why the government would make this leagal, we would have to again understand the material conditions. More than likely, as the contradictions of capital build, a campaigning liberal may offer this to win over some of the masses. After all, once again there is a contradiction between the carrerist intersts of politicians and the interest of the state.\n\nOne thing I would say here, as marxists, we should keep an eye on assisted sucicide. As long as capitalism exists, contradictions will build and austerity will increase. When this happens, the state may encourage doctors to kill people that could be saved",

He\u2019d oppose anything that would so brazenly enhance the power of the police to act as an instrument of oppression. He himself was subject to state censorship and repression numerous times throughout his life, including when he was forced to leave his native country for being the editor of a radical journal, the *New Rhenish Newspaper* (the last edition of which contains a very famous quote calling the police \u201cRoyal Terrorists, the terrorists by the Grace of God and the Law\u2026\u201d) In the context of the United States\u2014which I assume you come from\u2014he\u2019d also recognize the indelible connection between increasing police power and the terrorizing of people of color.\n\n2. Marxism doesn\u2019t deal in moral absolutes. A young Marx would probably draw a line between the reaction against assisted euthanasia and Protestant culture filtering people\u2019s perception of their real problems. An old Marx would probably have very little to say other than that he supports it.",

            "body": "Marx believed the first task of the proletarian State was to smash the State machinery of the police, standing armies, and bureaucracy. The police apparatus, acting without judicial particularized authority, is therefore anathema to Marx\u2019s views. When we eliminate the maldistribution of natural resources and natural resource rents, as well as eliminate exploitation, that absence of class antagonisms therefore means security concerns largely wither away (along with ending vice laws where all of the viciousness of such vice laws that solely comes from those who make and enforce those laws). The security concerns that then remain become trivial to address and can be accomplished by a universal service Militia and mutual aid, along with enforcement with a strict adherence to only judicial authority (with properly instituted grand juries for warrant searches and seizures and a guarantee to a jury trial). That is how we would amputate the State machinery as Marx demanded.\n\nEuthanasia, as requested by those wanting to end their life, is only a concern for a socialist Commonwealth government in that it must do its part in its domain to avoid conditions where euthanasia or suicide otherwise becomes desirable. Other than that only ensuring the suicide is not coerced or imposed from outside is vital. \n\nWe have a sense that suicide is somehow immoral. And it is. However, all of the immorality surrounding suicide comes from a society and its designated polis powers that together leave so many in despair and destitution, where the only way out is suicide. There is no immorality at all for the one taking one\u2019s own life.",

            "body": "1. Lenin writes in *State and Revolution* about Marx's position on smashing the state and how the Paris Commune informed his experience. Shortly put, Marxists oppose all police use of violence under capitalism and a revolution should destroy the police as an institution and replace it with whatever workers' organs of power (soviets, factory committees, workers' militias) arose during the revolution. In some revolutions the police or military will defect when workers' organs are strong enough (e.g. part of the military in the October Revolution) and sometimes they need to be destroyed through combat (as with the White Army in the period of USSR war communism). As for crackdowns like 'search and seizure', Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Luxemburg and basically all other Marxists lived lots of their life in exile, in prison or doing semi-illegal and illegal work within their country.\n\n2. Marxists are materialists so we judge actions in the context of the society they take place in, rather than by liberalism's conception of \"human rights\" (we might ask: *who* guarantees you those rights? The state can't). Euthanasia in capitalism is heavily linked to eugenics, which was a weapon against indigenous peoples of many countries, colonial citizens and non-Aryans in areas controlled by Nazi Germany. Under socialism - who knows? As we are not utopians, that is for future socialist citizens to democratically decide.",

            "body": "I think in order to have a marxian analysis you would need to look at the overarching context. For example, for 1) under capitalism, who would this law be benefiting? The bourgeois state, who uses the police force as a weapon. In the case of 2), say it legalizes euthanasia for mental illnesses. How does this tie to the fact poor living conditions under capitalism may cause mental health issues, and that they might be treatable with proper investment? And in the case of physical illness, such as degenerative disease, how may a lack of funding and treatment affect the choice to die?\n\nMarx used dialectical and historical materialism as his base for analysis. Unfortunately he's a complicated author to understand, and you may not have time to read him in full if this is for a school project. Later on some authors attempted to synthesize this form of thought. You might enjoy *Dialectical and historical materialism* by Stalin (regardless of your opinion on the man, its a good text). Otherwise the introduction and first chapter of *The german ideology* (by Marx and Engels) might interest you.\n\nSorry I can't give a comprehensive answer. I hope these pointers help you.",
