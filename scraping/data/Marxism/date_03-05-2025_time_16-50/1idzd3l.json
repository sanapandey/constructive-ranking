I have never been a fan of AI because of its environmental consequences and the fact that it\u2019s just another way for capitalists to alienate people from their labor. The fact that deep seek is open source is awesome to me because it means that AI can be collectively owned and used instead of being controlled by tech capitalists. \n\nIm thinking about what this means in the future. I know privately owned AI was big for the US energy sector and right now we are using more energy than ever before with those numbers projected to rise a lot partly due to the use of AI. Idk what the environmental costs are with deep seek but I imagine that China is trying to minimize them and will probably continue to do so? \n\nI am also wondering if this might result in further censorship in the US, like our access to tik tok was just removed last I heard. Do tech companies have the power to lobby the government to remove our access to open source AI too? Even if they did, they would never recoup their original profits as they wouldn\u2019t be controlling AI worldwide. I\u2019m wondering what you all think about it. ",

I think this related mostly to usage of the model (which also allows it to run on toasters). The impact of training the model can be a different playing field (I have no knowledge of specifics), but this only needs to be done periodically for updates.",

If we rely on AI to perform these intellectual tasks for us, it will lead to the end of new output in those fields. Perhaps this will be what leads to the infamous \"end of history.\"\n\nObviously AI in itself is not what gives birth to all of the aforementioned problems, but rather the way our current productive base incorporates it. Contrary to popular interpretations, AI on its own will not be what destroys us, but rather we will destroy ourselves by allowing capitalism to develop to the point where it can render yet more human life unnecessary through technological development.\n\nIf AI were to be used inside of a society where the means of production were controlled by subjects conscious of its potential for liberating us from various kinds of toil, the end result would likely be massively different. Under the current configuration of society, however, it will most likely act as yet another tool for strengthening the power of the few over the masses. The few bourgeoisie will control centralized points for accessing information and determining what information is given to us, and making it do the thinking for us instead of us doing it ourselves, making it even more difficult to develop class consciousness.",

My only thing is I think people give AI too much credit because as you said, it literally just recycles and learns on human inputs. When inputs are saturated already by AI, it implodes on itself and creates increasingly bizarre and detached outputs. For ai to mean the end of human inputs in creative fields it would have to be drastically different. Right now i just see it as a form of theft. What you said about it allowing the bourgeois to control the information we can access is on point because even with AI images, they\u2019ve encouraged people to be skeptical of real images and videos. The effect is to further remove our thought processes from material reality",

One of the biggest problems the USSR had was that it was easily isolated by imperialist powers from the rest of the world, which is capitalist. This restricted its access to technology, resources, and knowledge. There is no way to connect a socialist economy to the capitalist world economy without capitalist mechanisms. \n\nThis is exactly what China did. It became the world\u2019s industrial center through its reform and opening up process. It became \u201cunisolatable\u201d. It developed its productive forces through reverse engineering and foreign capital. It gave the country the wealth to pull 800,000,000 people out of poverty. \n\nLet\u2019s also not ignore the fact that around half of the capital in China is state-owned (i.e. public) if I\u2019m not mistaken. All the land in China belongs to everyone. It also has 2.24 million agricultural coops and 800,000 Town and Village Enterprises which are also collectively owned.\n\n>> \u201cWhat we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it comes.\u201d\n\n>> *- Critique of the Gotha Programme*\n\nEarly socialism, especially in the first couple of countries or attempts, will have many vestiges of capitalism, because it emerged from capitalism, it is still submerged in capitalism. Society, that is, the people of a nation, will still be \u201cstamped  in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually\u201d. The program of the workers\u2019 party presiding over this revolutionary stage must reflect this, otherwise it creates contradictions that lean the balance back to capitalism.\n\nDon\u2019t know if this is too revisionist, but it is my take and it makes material sense to me. We care about the working class, not about ideas. We must be patient, classes will cease to exist at their due time. If this strategy by China brings positive results, in the form of unprecedented reduction in poverty and improvements in the life of working people, then I support it. Don\u2019t feel like I have to say it, but I don\u2019t condone everything the party does, but it seems to be progressing in the right direction for the world.",

Of course, there is another way, which was m anticipated and set out by the founders and foremost proponents of Marxism, which was to spread and extend the proletarian revolution so that the rule of the workers and the transition to socialism embraces ever more of the world.\n\nYou indicate that in certain respects the Chinese communist party learned from the failure of the USSR. But it also bases itself very firmly on certain of the precepts that were set out in the period of the USSR's degeneration. In particular, its rejection of Marx's theory of the revolution in permanence , and its replacement with the idea of pursuing socialist development disconnected from any project of world revolution.\n\nWhat has the Chinese communist party done to promote the class struggle in other countries, and in the key centres of the proletariat around the world? Nothing. What is it done to support ongoing struggles of the workers and oppressed people in other countries? Nothing. What has it done to help undermine and defeat the wars and genocides pursued by the western imperialists and their instruments?  Nothing. What has it done to teach and popularise the ideas of Marxism around the world?. Nothing. \n\nIs it not possible that the Chinese bureaucracy is not engaged in a clever long-term socialist strategy, but has simply made its peace with capitalism?",

This has the benefit for China of encouraging quick progress but also exacerbating rapidly the internal conflicts that capitalism brings about e.g. the Evergrande crisis and ensuing property crash.

While the bourgeois state occasionally sacrifices one of its own, do we TRULY believe that it is representing the working class interests of China? Maybe you are convinced that class will cease to exist peacefully, but that goes against everything Marx wrote about. We must criticise everything for what it is, not what we want or wish it to be.\n\nNobody said capitalism doesn't improve the welbeing of the worker, but they are still alienated from their work. To give up on this is to give up the fundamental idea of marxism. The same applies to state-worker alienation.
