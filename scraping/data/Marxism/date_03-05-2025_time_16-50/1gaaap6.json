    "selftext": "Can someone explain the concept of alienation of labor in Marxism? From what I understand, alienation is the worker's disconnection from the product of their labor and the lack of satisfaction with their work. My question is: how can we overcome this alienation in the 21st century, especially with all the technological advancements and new forms of labor? How could this be practically achieved today?",

            "body": "There is a longer explanation in the 1844 manuscripts but essentially, alienation is the result of workers being disconnected from control over their work, the products they create, and their collective social potential. Labor becomes a burden, something you do to survive, rather than an expression of who you are or what you value. \n\nIn the 21st century, gig work/precarious labor is becoming more and more common. How to combat this? Organize, stronger labor protections, the less they can separate us from our work. We have to reevaluate how our society views work, shorten working ours, shrink the economy, build real community offline.\n\nHere's an interview with Juliet Schor that talks about labor and leisure, and the future of work, mainly in regards to climate change. I also encourage you to check out \"The Precariat\" by Guy Standing, talks about current labor conditions and future conditions.  \n  \n[https://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2014/0914schor.html](https://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2014/0914schor.html)",

Other than that, he is less alienated than, say, someone in a manufacturing line. However, he could be alienating himself by working the long hours, adapting to competitive industry standards, burn out could even be a product of alienation.",

I think so based in my studies and mainly in your answer that yes, if he sees his work as a mean to make more money than other professions, but in this case, is the mindset that separate the alienation from the, how can I say? Fullfillment?",

Labour is humanity\u2019s social being and the class system has turned labour into something entirely deformed (for lack of a better word).",

Cannot fight alienation using alienated means of digital seperation.\n\nto socialize the workplace, would be to get together with co-workers, to get a grant and start a worker co-op. Might have to promise to carry signs, knock doors, and throw candy in a parade for a bureaucrat governor or mayor after they approve the grant, to let people know who gave jobs and entice the bureaucrats.",
