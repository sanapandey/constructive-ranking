    "selftext": "\n\nI translated the quotes to english. I am wondering if these are indeed coincide with his views? \n\n\"Marx was against blind revolutionism. In the International he fought against those who were in favor of revolution as a matter of principle, against those who said that revolution must be carried out because it is necessary. The essence of Marx's thought is this: Revolution, to be successful, must come at the right moment; society cannot be transformed unless its economic development makes it ripe for change.\"\n\n\"Capitalism is ripe for change.\nThe new system cannot be prepared \"on order\". Just as capitalism arose and developed out of feudalism, so the new system must arise and develop out of the old one, capitalism. We must look for the seeds of a new social system in the development of capitalist society itself.\"\n\nExcerpt From\nLeo Huberman, Paul Sweezy\n",

            "body": "This sounds like a complete misunderstanding of Marx on part of Sweezy. Marx was 100% for the revolution. What he was against was Blanquism, and the idea that the revolutionary party can just \"call for\" a revolution and a revolution will magically happen.\n\nThe masses will move when they move, independent of the party. But the party's job is to ensure that when they move, they carry through the revolution to victory.\n\nWhat he was against was those who would say \"Right, revolution, next Monday at 9 A.M. Don't be late!\" because revolutions and history don't work like that.\n\nEdit: I may have been a bit harsh originally. I wouldn't say it's a *complete* misunderstanding, but rather a *slight* misunderstanding, but with potentially very wrong conclusions to be drawn from such a misinterpretation.",

Disavowing revolution was no different than swearing off of free association, free expression, and freedom of thought we still require of teachers, political candidates, and others still today (signing pledges that one is not now and never been a member of the communist party). In such oppressive totalitarian conditions, dissidents learn to code their views to protect themselves.",

How do we know this properly represents what Sweezy wrote? \n\nThe second quote (or is it the second paragraph of one quote, you haven't been clear) should not be controversial. This Marxist position is summed up very memorably in the German Ideology:\n\n> Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established , an ideal to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the real movement which abolishes the present state of things. The conditions of this movement result from the premises now in existence.\n\nThe first quote appears to be a controversial, most would say incorrect, but not too uncommon reading of Marx. But I don't have the original text.",

He though it was a great system for getting societies up and running, so to speak. It just isn't going to get you to the promised land. Once wealth is created you do not allow it to concentrate itself or you are on the way to tyranny. Revolutions often deliver a political void to extremists. That is what came out of Russian revolution.",

What he did think is that it *objectively* played a progressive role in the sense that it developed the means of production to a point further than what feudalism could, and laid the basis for socialism by creating the proletariat and world market.\n\nHowever, he did also say capitalism came into this world \"dripping with blood from every pore\".\n\nIt is completely wrong and misleading to say he was not an opponent of capitalism.\n\nEdit: he also knew socialism and the transition to communism could only come about through class struggle and revolution, not \"slow evolution\". He was a revolutionary, not a reformist.",

People have been so tainted by the garbage that is spouted about Marx that they cannot be nuanced. The only thing that is wrong with capitalism is what will come to evolve from its objective workings. That is the basis for Capital vol. I-III. It was going to go wrong for Capitalism, and there is probably a case to be made for him believing it had already gone too far in England. This was a common belief with philosophers like Emile Durkheim who concluded that all the diseases of despair that were appearing in and around cities were the product of Capitalisms' alienating propensities was mist visible.",
