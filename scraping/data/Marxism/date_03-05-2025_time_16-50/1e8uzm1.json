He comes close to Marx, but even his contenporaries felt he did not go through with his dialectics, as if he was scared of the conclusions it would lead him to. \n\nI am currently in a similar situation. I will now read up on the young hegelians and then focus on the above mentioned books.",

Neither is it the substantial principle of Hegels idea of freedom. His insistence on generality (\"Allgemeinheit\") and his idea of the Geist certainly challenge the idea of free will especially as freedom manifests itself in Hegels philosophy as the acceptance of others as equals, the self-subordination of free individuals under a state for the common good  and self-interest, which safeguards the commonly accepted manifestation of freedom and reason in the form of contracts and property. Freedom manifests in this insight into necessity and is thus a privilege achieved by  few, markedly by philosophers, and the wealthy who can afford to mingle in philosophical discourseIn Hegels philosophy, the Volk is no political actor, as it is a carrier of the common sense, as such unable to attain true reason and thus unable to ever gain something resembling free will. \nBy extension, one can see the line from Hegels idea of history being the evolution of freedom (-> property) as its guiding principle to Marxs state of the development of means of production, like Marcuse does. I am not that deep into Hegels philosophy of history, yet.",

It\u2019s not a natural expectation for others to see Marcuse in a comment on Hegel when his name is not already explicitly there. Either way, Hegel most definitely does say a great deal about free will. In the *Elements of the Philosophy of Right*, the first step of will is freedom. In the *Science of Logic*, the notion of a conditioned free will comes up again, as it does throughout all of his works. The above post asks about freedom, so I assume it is originally relevant to the conversation, yes.\n\nYour interpretation of Hegelian freedom\u2014which I assume is actually Marcuse\u2019s (I\u2019ve only read his *Eros and Civilization*, and found it very poor)\u2014seems to comport far better with late Schelling and his aristocracy of geniuses. \n\nNotwithstanding, the relevant individuals in the shift from Hegelian idealism to Marxist materialism are the young Hegelians, not the positivists whom Marx despised.",

I am a Bakuninst, and I have started reading Hegel to research his method and what he borrows from Hegel. Significant elements of his idea of freedom are hegelian in origin, as is the conclusion of the evolution of freedom = development of the means of production. \n\nI base my understanding of Marx and Hegel heavily in the \"Neue Max Lekt\u00fcre\" of Bockhaus and Reichelt as their interpretation matched the closest to my initial understanding of Marxs Capital. Both somewhat critically draw on Marcuse as they belong to the Frankfurt School. Plus, they acknowledge whose edition of Hegels Science of Logic Marx was reading when writing the Capital.\n\n>Elements of the Philosophy of Right, the first step of will is freedom. In the Science of Logic,\n\nHis science of logic is in many parts to abstract to directly draw conclusions on freedom from reading it once. As I said theere he identifies the insight into necessity as freedom, and I am looking forward to his argument in the philosophy of right. The reflection on it was more frugal, though. Contemplating on Hegels idea of the subject and Marx identification of capital as histories subject was quite interesting, especially with its implications for class distinctions. I don't think orthodox marxism has quite accounted for these implications. \n\nThe philosophy of right is the next book of hegel I am going to read, but I have to push in some diversion, likely stuff on the young hegelians.",

He writes that pantheism is atheism in disguise, i.e. it creates an architecture of the world in which all things are self-articulating, have humanly-recognizable rational attributes, and do not need external impulse to exist, and then crudely tacks God onto the end of it. So Feuerbach, for the most part, took Hegelian philosophy in its entirety, simply removing the religious elements and declaring the nature of things to be based on the unfolding of Matter rather than the Idea. An easy work to follow this line of thought is the *Principles of the Philosophy of the Future*.  Marx was initially pumped up about this. In the *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts*, a young Marx was writing with Feuerbachian prose, trying to discover things about human freedom through the analysis of the species-being, and was still singing Feuerbach\u2019s praises. But by the time of the \u201cTheses on Feuerbach\u201d (a very dense but really important work that could help you out some) and the *German Ideology*, he had almost totally turned against Feuerbach, for he came to the realization that taking idealist philosophy and simply declaring it to be materialist did not substantively advance its human aims one inch\u2014the end should not be to discover the Absolute in all things, but to understand human action, subjectivity, politics, culture, and society. For Hegel, the holy family comes down from the heavens and reshapes itself into the human family; for Feuerbach, the human family comes up from the earth and shapes itself into the holy family; and for Marx, both are historically-situated ideas whose internal contradictions need to be exposed, and for which revolutionary practice presents the path forward.\n\nNow with all of that said, I\u2019m not sure I know what you mean by \u201csome of the qualities of Hegel\u2019s system.\u201d Marx for sure dropped a lot of Hegel, but Spirit doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on the interpretation of history, and over a long career Marx articulated his alternatives.",
