A lot of the arguments boil down to \"well isn't exploitation obvious????\" and \"regulation bro\".\n\n[https://prospect.org/politics/2024-08-05-case-for-pragmatic-socialism/](https://prospect.org/politics/2024-08-05-case-for-pragmatic-socialism/)\n\n  \n>I think this is a fundamentally flawed approach. Marx\u2019s theory is built on Hegelian dialectics, and is incommensurate with arguments in which a moral standard is outlined and then strategies to achieve it worked out.\n\n  \n?????\n\n  \n>The economic institutions of America and the world are so flagrantly unjust that one doesn\u2019t need a metaphysically and logically airtight theory to justify radical reforms.\n\nAgain, ??????\n\n  \n>Economic institutions should be rearranged to produce the most equal practical distribution of resources. That\u2019s enough to get started, without the need to wait for the system to collapse of its own weight.\n\nThere are no quotes from Marx here, no addressing any meaningful specific argument, no detail, and constant appeals to \"well it's *obvious* what the problems are, why would we need Marx to indicate them?\". It's difficult to know even where to begin.",

But I think the article hypocritically undermines their first point about theory being unnecessary for praxis through their horrible policy goals and their attempt to lay out a theory for their supposed egalitarian ends.",

Americans always worship Sweden\u2019s social safety nets. Societies wouldn\u2019t need as many \u201cgovernment safety nets,\u201d (except for those truly incapable of working) if workers had more equitable access to resources, rather than allowing a small portion to hoard resources and the means of production.",
