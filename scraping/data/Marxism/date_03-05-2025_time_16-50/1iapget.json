    "selftext": "*'Anti-Semitism means spreading enmity towards the Jews ... The accursed tsarist monarchy ... tried to incite ... workers and peasants against the Jews. The tsarist police, in alliance with the landowners and the capitalists, organised pogroms against the Jews. The landowners and capitalists tried to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants who were tortured by want against the Jews. In other countries, too, we often see the capitalists fomenting hatred against the Jews in order to blind the workers, to divert their attention from the real enemy of the working people, capital. Hatred towards the Jews persists only in those countries where slavery to the landowners and capitalists has created abysmal ignorance among the workers and peasants. Only the most ignorant and downtrodden people can believe the lies and slander that are spread about the Jews. This is a survival of ancient feudal times, when the priests burned heretics at the stake, when the peasants lived in slavery, and when the people were crushed and inarticulate...*  \n  \n*It is not the Jews who are the enemies of the working people ... They are our brothers, who, like us, are oppressed by capital; they are our comrades in the struggle for socialism ... The capitalists strive to sow and foment hatred between workers of different faiths, different nations and different races ...*  \n  \n*... Shame on those who foment hatred towards the Jews ... ' \u2014* V.I. Lenin, 1919.\n\n\\#HolocaustMemorialDay #FreePalestine ",

Ignorance and prejudice undermine our movements and are used by the capitalists to divide and conquer. We must remember the holocaust and how similar forms of discrimination and hate are feeding mass violence around the world today, with people in Palestine, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and various other places victimized by racist atrocities. Solidarity between workers of all nations is essential to our collective liberation.",

That said, Lenin\u2019s words here are important.\n\nI\u2019m also reminded of Hitler\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ccultural Bolshevism\u201d, which he linked to Jews, and the modern far right\u2019s use of the phrase \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d.",

After all, there are Black billionaires, gay billionaires, Arab billionaires, etc. But blaming these groups as a whole would be wrong, and the wealth of some members of these communities does not change the fact that there is still discrimination against the wider group.\n\n\nIt's a bit like Trump talking about Mexican\u00a0rapists. He can point to Latino immigrants who have committed rape, and those specific cases may very well be true. But generalizing about the group would still be wrong.",
