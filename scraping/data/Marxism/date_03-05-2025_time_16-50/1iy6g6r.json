The only difference that I can see between U.S. and Canadian racism is by analyzing the material conditions that allowed for it to take place, the U.S. had fertile land in warm climates, which allowed slavery to take hold systemically, Canada on the other hand was unable to support slavery as a profitable mode of production, so it was cast off by the rising middle class relatively easily and early on. So my lens of trying to analyze U.S. prisons might be a little off I guess mostly due to the fact that the U.S. and Canada took difference roads with their approach to their forms of racism. I'll definitely read the link you posted, thanks again.",

The points made about race and mental health are valid. \n\nThe last study, which is a bit outdated, reported that 80% of those who are in the criminal legal system are indigent. In my former state, they had to make less than $14k a year (no dependants) to qualify. In my current state, that number is up to $25k a year, though cost of living here is much higher (average rent for the state is $21k a year).\n\n80% of those charged with a crime make less than 25k a year or it's equivalent. How can they afford shelter? How can they afford healthcare?  Food? \n\nWhen you are looking at a system with pulls in a population that is compromised 80% of the very poor, and leaves them saddled with more debt by virtue of being in the system, you don't have a justice system, you have a poorhouse/debtor's prison.",

America's economys historical development towards modern neo liberalism lead to a rapid expanding lumpenproletariat and labor reserve. With A.I. automation and climate disaster, this will continue to be the case. This is why America has such an expansive prison system, the expansion of the lumpenproletariat and labor reserves represents what is called a surplus population. Their way of managing, and profiting off of these surplus populations is a large prison system. Let's also consider the material truth in the claim the panthers made. This claim is that the lumpenproletariat were not only the most disaffected and oppressed of the working class, but interconnected with the ill impacts of racial supremacy and colonialism. The text \"wretched of the earth\" covers this too.",

Marx was actually fairly balanced in his assessment: a few gravitate toward revolutionary movements but their conditions of life lead them into an isolated, individual struggle for existence and thus often into a bitter and extreme individualist perspective (\u201cI have no choice but to look out for myself, so to hell with everyone else\u201d). Most would sell out to make the fast buck they need to survive, particularly if they self-medicate through drugs or alcohol. You would be shocked at just how many who subsist off of government assistance without working voted for Trump. Don\u2019t get me wrong: there are good people out there, but they don\u2019t call them the mean streets for nothing.",

Read wretched of the earth. \n\n\nTo be honest I don't need an explanation of the lumpenproletariat, or the risk of being sold out. I've been in those streets, i still interact with them daily. This is the cycle the poor are kept in. The movie parasite (2019) covers this. Ive experienced people in work places stepping on, or ratting on fellow workers to get a leg up. This is the social interaction of capital on display, not something inherent to the lumpenproletariat. The results of the lumpenproletariat not being organized is deadly for the urban working class communities. \n\n\nMarxs critique of lumpens read like a simple moral panic over the poorest of workers doing more than clocking in, rather than a material one. I also somewhat get the feeling that people who critique the behavior of lumpenproletariat as something strictly associated with lumpens either a. Live in a more god fearing region or b. Are a more formally educated member of the working class.\n\n\nEvery job I've worked was filled with people who commonly hustled like lumpens when they clocked out. Drug use, drug dealers, sex work and general criminality isn't something hard to find in the lowest sectors of labor forces where im from. I've known multiple people who had 1 foot in the 9 to 5 life, the other in the lumpen life. Sometimes my work with my union slows down heavy in the summer months, and I later find a bunch of guys got home from prison and needed work, so we cycled out. Is there anyone that holds the belief that the lowest end of workers are closer to the lumpenproletariat than they are formally educated 1st world workers? I'm wondering because I always see certain behaviors  described as the undesired elements of the lumpenproletariat, when in my experience these are all also behaviors not uncommon among the labor groups I've belonged to. It seems a software engineer would be more uncomfortable around a lumpen than a ironworker or janitor would.\n\nIt's also important to note that my union is almost like a way out for potential lumpenproletariat types. Like if they weren't getting benefits, union OT and nobody wanted to strike a lot of guys would just go rob, not work at Dennys for 10 hrly. Point being, Many lumpenproletariat hold a refusal to work because they are incapable of lowering their heads, pushing their pride back, and getting back to work under conditions that are far from desired. Ive seen better labor conditions my union gave us literally change the energy lumpens have towards labor. If they don't work by choice, it's because they can't make the excuses many workers can \"ahh we could have less\", \"better not say anything, I could lose my job\". A lumpen just can't do it. Noam chomsky talks about this using the education system as an example. He says it's designed to have contradictions and obvious absurdities; obedient people know it's absurd but continue because it's how you advance. Well chomsky says, \"there are people who see the absurdity, and simply will not can not take part. These are the people they call behavioral issues, and they get weeded out of the labor force, end up on the streets, among the lumpenproletariat or wherever. This is how the education system of america creates the most obedient workers, while isolating those who lack obedience from the labor force. The justice system plays a role in this as well\"\n\nLet's also not forget the most large scale occurrences of resistance against capitalism and private property in modern America was driven by elements of the lumpenproletarian not the professional working class.",
