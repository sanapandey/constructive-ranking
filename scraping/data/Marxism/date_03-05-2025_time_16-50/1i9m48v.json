How many exist just to figure out how to say no or implement ridiculous policies?\n\nThere is so much extra productivity.

It may just be due to the environment we are all raised in, but there does seem to be an inherent risk that capital is taking on with any business venture.\n\nSure, you mentioned loans, funds from the state, etc... but fundamentally there is a monetary investment needed to start up a production facility and jobs. Obviously it isn't fair that capital keeps all of the profits. But if there was no reward for capital investment I find it hard to justify the risks that capital takes on. Shouldn't there be some incentive?",

On the first, what proletarians sell is not principally a \"product\" but their labor power. Many 'blue collar' proletarians don't sell a tangible product at all. A ditch digger isn't selling you a ditch. They're selling their labor power to a ditch digging firm, who sells ditch digging to people who need ditches. The enterprise actually sells the product, the laborer just sells their ability to labor.\n\n  \nSecond, many white collar laborers do sell a product. For example, an engineer who is tasked with making blueprints or designs for bridges, engine parts, etc is making a product. Even still, what they're actually selling is their labor power to a firm who then will transform their labor power into a product to sell in one way or another.",

            "body": "The key misunderstanding you express is that performing surplus labor is necessarily exploitation. In the communist enterprise surplus labor is still performed it\u2019s just that the collective of workers performing the surplus labor collectively also direct the appropriation and distribution of that surplus labor collectively. In the capitalist enterprise, a separate oppugnant collective of capitalist exploiters appropriate and distribute the surplus labor as they see fit (even in Germany where they require workers to have some voice on the board of directors along side their tyrannical exploiters). \n\nThe distinction you want to make, I think, is between productive and unproductive workers: not the color of the collar. While there are disputes over the exact boundary for this distinction, the distinction is a materially viable one. Besides distributions of surplus labor within communism to accumulation of means of production, acquisition of natural resource means of production (what we might call rents whether within market circulation or not), insurance risk hedges, there are also distributions of surplus labor to unproductive workers through the democratic mutual determination of the collective of workers themselves.\n\nMarx\u2019s purest example of unproductive labor (so largely undisputed) is the labor of the pure merchant: solely the laboring role in altering ownership of a commodity. This labor is indispensable but nevertheless unproductive of value. For such unproductive labor to occur, surplus labor from productive workers must be distributed to the compensation of the merchant laborer and for the instruments of labor (cash register) and raw materials (paper tape for receipts) the merchant worker must use to fulfill the merchanting task. If in initial phases of communism, commodities still exist then that unproductive labor will still exist. If some other allocation mechanism replaced commodity circulation in higher phases of communism, then those doing the labor that allocates authority over resources (for example, central planners) will be performing unproductive labor in a similar manner to the capitalist or communist merchant.\n\nOther labor that might be categorized as unproductive within capitalism include the marketers, advertisers, accountants, lobbyists, lawyers, military and security personnel, jurists, \u201cthe general costs of administration not belonging to production\u201d, and so forth. These have analogs that might exist within communism but without the tyrannical and brutal aspects of exploiting supervisors, bureaucrats, police or other standing army mercenaries, and the like. \n\nEven without the brutal and tyrannical aspects, we might still categorize that labor as unproductive. Some have posited that a democratic-republic communist enterprise (a.k.a. a worker co\u00f6perative), although it determines policy generally by one-worker-one-vote (productive and unproductive workers combined), the deliberations over distribution of surplus labor should be limited to a subset of only productive workers. Such a policy can certainly be open for workers and political science to dispute, but I include it here to help hone our understanding of the issues you raise.",

            "body": "Production is a collective process, you can\u2019t reasonably estimate value creation by individual worker aside from very small scale and direct manufacturing or services. \n\nFor a deep deep dive into this, the best thing is the book Labor and Monopoly Capital which uses Marxist economic ideas to look at mid 20th century corporatization and Taylorism. White collar work does add value and it is mostly geared toward maximizing productive output. So in many ways rather than white collar workers in socialism being a parasitic layer, they would likely be reduced as a lot of pencil pushing is just trying to secure small market advantages that build up with economy of scale for monopolistic industries.\n\n(There\u2019s a secondary question this raises about Taylorism in early Revolutionary Russia - Lenin thought this would jump-start abundance for workers and make work easier so workers could get on with building the new society instead of working\u2026 but it ended up being used in the same exploitative way as in Ford plants - and the negative role this may have played in creating a substitutionist bureaucracy.)\n\nSo imo a big projected of post-revolution workers would be getting rid of shit-work and increasing socially beneficial work that\u2019s neglected now. A lot of marketing and so on would become redundant outside of market capitalism and so there would be less need for office work but more need for educators, medical people etc.",

            "body": "Marx talks about questions like these in the later volumes of Capital and his notebooks. See especially his commentary on Adam Smith and unproductive labor (in Theories of Surplus Value), the discussion of firm complexity in Vol 2, and managerial labor in Vol. 3.\n\nHe thought the state and other \u201cunproductive\u201d trades exist through revenue that originated in production but is not reinvested in the firm (e.g., taxes to the state, a capitalist hires a servant and a tailor to make him a fur coat).\n\nHe also thought that firms were more complex than a single capitalist and a handful of workers. Internally, they had many functions like bookkeeping, management, etc. These too were funded by revenue (e.g., a shoe company makes enough money that they can hire an accountant, a production manager, etc.).\n\nMarx additionally acknowledged that unproductive fields could be run more like private for profit firms and things like the labor pool were mixed (e.g., a janitor doesn\u2019t get paid 300% more because they work for the state rather than a private firm). That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t lean too much on the blue/white distinction, but more look at the infrastructure, dynamics, and class configurations of capitalism as Marx did.\n\nEssentially, Marx sets us up to see that capitalism is a highly complex social formation, with all sorts of productive functions and modes of production operating simultaneously, and all of it forming a very intricate map. There are sectors of capital that produce fundamental goods, sectors that produce materials for them to produce, all kinds of auxiliary industries like entertainment and information and government that exist to keep society functioning.\n\nMarx had a production-first mindset that saw working class labor as holding this all together. Marx thought this had to do with value, but also think about it on an infrastructural level: the state and the movie industry would be pointless if we can\u2019t all eat. Just like it wouldn\u2019t make sense to have a shoe company that is only the marketing department, managers, accountants, etc. and no people who make shoes.",

            "body": "I\u2019m new to all this but I think I might be understanding what the comments are saying? I have these same questions as you. I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot with unionizing. For example, ideally everyone in a bakery would unionize together. But we may not have the numbers (for example, everyone who works in the kitchen and also the drivers who deliver our catering are likely to vote no) and so we have to think strategically on how we can get our yes votes. I think either way it could work. If the sellers (front of house) all go on strike, the owners may be able to pull some kitchen workers to the front (but this is harder for them to do if they own multiple locations) to sell the product. If the kitchen workers go on strike, there\u2019s no goods to deliver, to sell to wholesale, or to the customers walking into the store. This is the larger threat imo. Owners will have to work overtime to hire scabs. Without us kitchen workers and sellers collaborating, it\u2019s easier for the boss to continue the exploitation (although more challenging). But if we collaborate, it\u2019s devastating to the ownership.\n\nSo I guess if we\u2019re purely talking strategy, it would be wiser to collab with the white collar workers who have a more tangible output to the ownership\u2019s profits. Collab with the marketers, bookkeepers, graphic designers etc. anyone who has a bullshit busy job (someone whose title wouldn\u2019t matter to the profits if the title was removed) is likely to be replaced by AI anyway (and yes you could argue almost all white collar jobs could be taken by AI and some blue collar work but tbh I don\u2019t have the energy for that convo right now haha).",
