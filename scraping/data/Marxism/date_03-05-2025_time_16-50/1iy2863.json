So I want to understand how a business would run and innovate and maybe compete(?) in a socialist regime.\n\nI think socialist democracy fits my views the best because I don't think absolute economic and political power centered on 1 person, party or an institution can last very long.",

            "body": "Just to start off I'd definitely prefer to work at Mondragon over a normal capitalist enterprise 10 times out of 10. But that being said, there are a few problems with the company from a Marxist perspective. One problem is that Mondragon actually does have employees that are paid wages / salaries and do not have a share of ownership in the company. From what I understand, over the years the ratio of co-op owners and waged employees has skewed towards employees and it becomes harder and harder to become a part owner of the company as time goes on. But this could just reflect the growing austerity in Europe in general.\n\nAnother problem is the difficulty in starting up a business like Mondragon in the first place. While I don't think we should allow it legally, capital in the market is going to want a share of ownership of the company in return for access to start up funding. Co ops will have to offer venture capitalists some other form of incentive to give them money, or there would need to be a state apparatus in place that was able to give funding to startup co-ops that didn't take away some of their ownership in the company. Alternatively, once some of this wealth started getting transferred from the ultra-rich to poorer and middle class people, they could band together and form a company themselves. But in the current environment it is difficult to create and outcompete capitalists with a model like this without resorting to the same tactics as capitalist firms.",

There are three main ways to obtain that initial investment:\n\n1. Personal contribution out of your own pocket\n\n2. Attracting investors who will want a share of the company in exchange for money\n\n3. Loan from a bank\n\nOptions 1 and 2 are not available for worker coops. No one will want to contribute their personal money into a business where they have to share the profits equally with people who did not contribute or who contributed less.\n\nOption 2 is also out of the window because if investors have a share in the company then it's no longer a co-op.\n\nOption 3 remains the only viable way to start a coop. But you will have to pay interest on that loan and will have to compete with capitalist businesses who extracted funding from options 1 and 2 and do not need to pay interest.\n\nThis is why the so-called freedom of starting a co-op in capitalism is an illusory freedom, since coops do not have access to funding, that capital being concentrated in the hands of the few who have all the economic power.\n\nThe solution would be something like Proudhon's \"people's bank\" which offers loans at a very low interest rate only to co-ops. We would also need tax breaks and subsidies to coops to make sure that they can actually compete with capitalist businesses. This is, of course, only a transitory stage between capitalism and market socialism, because the end goal would be to have virtually all companies in an economy be coops and democratically managed.",

So saying that there is 1 Bible is a fetishism of what it actually is.\n\nAlso the documents and events that formed the Bibles are a product of the Feudal and Slave Modes of Production not the Capitalist mode of production. While, Communism is a product of Capitalism because of the Proletariats practice and the laws of Capitalism. How can these documents have Communist principles when they were produced from individuals who had no practice with Capitalism? The only answer is to take up science and understand that the Bibles are in no way Communist. Or you can defend religion/idealism and say that Bibles are Communist which you will inevitably be combatted by the Proletariat and the Communist Movement in the Abolishion of Religion and Idealism with the Abolishion of Class Society generally.\n\n> \"to each according to their work\" is slavery with fewer steps\n\nHow does one build a new society without inevitably dealing with defects from the Old Society? Do you think it's simple to Abolish Bourgeois Right and proclaim Communism established when the Proletariat isn't accustomed to it and still plagued from the defects of capitalism? Is it so easy to Abolish the distinction between intellectual and manual labor?\n\n> > What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.\n\n> > Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.\n\n> > Hence, equal right here is still in principle \u2013 bourgeois right, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.\n\n> ...\n\n> > But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. **Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.**\n\n> > In a higher phase of communist society, *after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly* \u2013 **only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!**\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm\n\n> to each according to their needs\" is what David Graeber describes as \"the indivisible unit of communism\".\n\nDavid Graeber is a hack who Deny's labor and the laws of history. The \"Dawn of everything\" proclaims a \"new\" science of history based on the principles of indeterminism, there are no laws to history, and just rejects Marxism without actually responding to Marxism. His whole \"bullshit Jobs\" was created because he didn't want to do manual labor and he annoyed a carpenter who didn't want to deal with Graeber's shtick. And that's not to mention how MMT is totally incorrect about money and Political-Economy.\n\n> So when you said\n\nI may have confused you but I am a different user than u/MauriceBishopsGhost but I do agree with them.\n\n> Either way I'm not sure I agree.

At Edesa the workers have occupied the factory.\n\n>Fagor produces brands including Brandt and De Dietrich. It has filed for bankruptcy, threatening the jobs of 5,600 workers.\n\n>The end of Fagor, a subsidiary of the Mondrag\u00f3n corporation, regarded as the jewel in the cooperative movement crown, shows that such organisations are not an alternative to capitalism, as their promoters proclaim.

In his 1864 Inaugural Address to the Working Men\u2019s International Association, Marx insisted, *\u201cThe experience of the period from 1848 to 1864 has proved beyond doubt that, however excellent in principle and however useful in practice, cooperative labour, if kept within the narrow circle of the casual efforts of private workmen, will never be able to arrest the growth in geometrical progression of monopoly, to free the masses, nor even to perceptibly lighten the burden of their miseries\u2026 To save the industrious masses, cooperative labour ought to be developed to national dimensions, and, consequently, to be fostered by national means\u2026 To conquer political power has, therefore, become the great duty of the working classes.\u201d*\n\n>Fagor was created precisely to prevent the conquest of political power by the working class. It was founded in 1956 during the Franco dictatorship by a young Catholic priest, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arizmendiarrieta, a delegate of the fascist Falange Youth Front. He was acutely aware of the social polarisation in Spain and saw in the cooperative movement an opportunity to put into practice the principles of Franco\u2019s corporate state and deflect revolutionary sentiment in the working class.",
