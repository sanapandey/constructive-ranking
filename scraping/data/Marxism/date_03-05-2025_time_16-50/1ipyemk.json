    "selftext": "\"He understands nothing about the nature of surplus value\" - https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81_06_20.htm\n\nI can understand Marx's point that this philosophy emerged from 18th century industrialists who looked down on their landowning counterparts.\n\nThe other stuff in that letter seems like weaksauce though. \n\nAmerica had no shortage of land and yet capitalism developed and thrived there. Doesnt Marx himself predict that to get to socialism capitalism must come first? I dont get it.\n\nAnd he said, America had anti-renters...so what?\n\nThen he says that Georgism (e.g. single tax with a citizens dividend) would embed capitalism more deeply. Why? Unclear. Personally, I think it would do the exact opposite. Unfortunately he doesnt go any deeper here.\n\nEven with the point about the industrialists I'd argue that Marx misses two really fundamental points here about the structural movements in play:\n\n1) The exploited labour which these industrialists relied upon were driven from their homes by the enclosure movement - depriving peasants of their land was in essence \"reverse georgism\".\n\n2) Those industrialists eventually \"grow up\" to become those landowners which they supposedly despised as a reaction of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. I see this on a smaller scale all around me - when capitalists come into some money in modern day Britain one of the first things they do is buy property to let out to provide a consistent and steady revenue stream.\n\nThe fact that some of these industrialists warmed a bit to georgism, IMHO, does not mean that it was not hostile to their class interests. It could just mean that many of them did not perceive its hostility to their interests because it was indirectly rather than directly hostile.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards the idea that Marx might have misconceptualized surplus value. His assertion that the gigantic increase in wealth and population from the 19th century onwards was mainly due to the competitive striving to obtain\u00a0maximum surplus-value from the employment of labor was half right.\n\nThose factories needed coal, land and the right to pollute as well - natural capital from which surplus value was extracted. It wasnt all labor.\n\nMoreover, the surplus value extracted from labor relied upon depriving them of their rightful natural wealth (via the enclosure movement, which drove them into the factories in search of work they would never have done otherwise). The capitalist machine Marx identified which vaccuumed up surplus labor value thus had reverse georgism as a lynchpin.",

It is George who misunderstands the two\u2019s interdependence, not at all Marx.    \n\nMaking land state-owned is one of the many Utopian panaceas Marx was confronting, his general point against all of them being that the problem is capitalism, not any of its superficial features.

Marx thinks the appropriate method is to deal with surplus-value first, in the abstract, because it reveals the fact of the estrangement of the products of labor from the worker which is capitalism\u2019s essence much more clearly. George merely follows a line of classical thought that Smith, Ricardo, Malthus, and others more or less propagated\u2014specifically, the idea that rent was an almost extra-economic interstice, an absurdity, which ought to be distrusted.  \n\nAs a whole though, I don\u2019t think this is a very strong method to learn about Marx\u2019s political-economy, not if you\u2019re interested in it for its own sake, anyway. His logic is typically quick and his ideas are in partial form in letters\u2014as ours are in Reddit comments today.

There is a glaring inconsistency there.\n\n\n>Making land state-owned is one of the many Utopian panaceas\u00a0\n\n\nUm, attacking an analysis of capital as a utopian panacea is how capitalists take a dump on Marxism in order to cement the status quo.\n\n\nIt would be nice if you didnt repurpose their tactics against other analyses of structural inequality and oppression.\n\n\n>It\u2019s the same logic as modern socialists saying UBI could be implemented effectively, but that it could not eliminate the root problems of capitalist society\n\n\nIt's not a panacea and it's not a designed-to-be-unrealized fantasy sold enthusiastically by the Sam Altmans of the world.\n\n\nInequitable distribution of natural wealth DOES underpin capitalism though. The enclosure movement was part of that and it wasnt the only part.\n\n\n>Georgists love capitalists.\n\n\nI would encourage you to reread my analysis above again and reconsider whether I \"love\" those 19th century industrialists I was talking about.\n\n\nI think the two analyses of capital - Marxism and Georgism - ought to be integrated. I dont think the personal hostility demonstrated by Marx towards George was warranted and I think rather than looking deeper here you are simply reflecting the biases of the man writing that letter.\n\n\n>Perhaps they\u2019d successfully eliminate all the evils of rent\u2014Marx\u2019s reply is, so what?\n\n\nMarx's reply ought to be \"that's a good thing\" even if it WASNT a form of structural oppression (which it is) and I'd hope any marxist would be the same.\n\n\nEven if it does mean other evils remain - labor exploitation, imperialism -it is still *a* source of evil and it is one which *lynchpins* capitalism. Without the enclosure movement, probably there's no industrial capitalism.\n\n\n>It\u2019s like lowering the tithe on the serf: it doesn\u2019t begin to address the whole complex of economic, sociological, and historical problems at hand.\n\n\nThis is a bit like arguing in favor of anti imperialist analyses because \"killing it off would only end *some* of the evils of capitalism.\"\n\n\nMoreover, land expropriation and appropriation of natural wealth WAS fundamental to the capitalist system and still is. Disguising mineral wealth as labor value does not help the worker, if anything it plays into the hands of the capitalist.\n\n\n>The reason Marx says George doesn\u2019t understand surplus-value is very simple, and it\u2019s an accusation he makes against all economists of his time.

Landlords predominantly extract wealth from land for profit. Exxon mostly rapes the planet for wealth. McDonalds mostly exploits their workers.\n\n\nThis is a distinction you think should *not* be drawn? That it's incidental?\n\n\n>As a whole though, I don\u2019t think this is a very strong method to learn about Marx\u2019s political-economy,\n\n\nAs a whole, I think your argument above would have worked better if you assumed Id already read Das Kapital.\n\n\nMoreover, the reason I point to the letter is that I dont think there is a huge inconsistency between the two analyses of capital (George and Marx) and they could be well integrated but the overt hostility of Marx the person (for reasons that arent clear to me) implies he thinks that there isnt.",

The Marxists from Marx right through to all the factions of Russian social democracy called for the nationalisation of the land. The important distinction, however, is that they insisted that the nationalisation of the land was nevertheless a bourgeois demand i.e. a demand entirely consistent with and necessary for the fullest development of capitalism. It was then for Lenjn later to observe how finance capital and landlordism merged in the ownership and management of the greatest estates, initially through the operation of the credit system and later through cartelisation.\n\nThis is important because there were all manner of utopians and cranks who were advocating various panaceas that they thought would alleviate or end the exploitation of labour. Marx is acutely conscious that the nationalisation of the land will certainly not do that.",

It\u2019s certainly not a \u201cglaring inconsistency\u201d unless you make the relationship between land and capitalism a mechanical, static function.\n\nI wasn\u2019t attacking the analysis at all. \u201cUtopian\u201d is the word Marx uses in this context, and as a Marxist term of art, I think it\u2019s totally appropriate. He made the connection in his mind between George\u2019s scheme to remove the evils of capitalism and Proudhon\u2019s paper money to remove the evils of capitalism, etc. You\u2019re unnecessarily attributing negative connotative meanings to my words, I think.\n\nIf your only point is that land should be state-owned, then, okay, sure\u2014Marx basically agrees. If your point is that Marx is wrong where George is right, I again would suggest that you more thoroughly study Marxian political-economy before you make that claim. Marx does distinguish between rent and profit. He discusses them as different historically (mainly in volume one) and in economic theory (mainly in volume three). If you are anti-capitalist Georgist\u2014something George was not\u2014then I do not see what you are getting from him that you are not getting from Marx: Marx recognized the historical and economic interdependence between rent and profit; Marx argued that the state should nationalize land; Marx *also* argued that the state should \u201cexpropriate the expropriators\u201d (a very explicit reference to the enclosure movement vis-\u00e1-vis industrial capitalists), which George did not.

He thought he was a poor scientist, just like I believe your thinking is wrong here\u2014that is not personal hostility.\n\n> Without the enclosure movement, probably there is no industrial capitalism.\n\nThis is Marx\u2019s discovery, again, not George\u2019s.

But surplus value isn\u2019t strictly about the abundance of use-values, and in fact industries that more efficiently produce use-values tend to lower the cost of individual commodities and thus the same amount of value may be shared across a greater amount of commodities.\nSurplus value is the social relation between worker and capitalist in production and while it has a material basis, it isn\u2019t synonymous with the material basis of production.\n\nComing first in time doesn\u2019t mean landlordism is more essential in explaining social formations under capitalism. The lord who the serf directly worked lands for some of the day is different from the landlord under capitalism though similar.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/articles/universal.htm\n\u201cThe real case-history of economic (market) relations testifies, however, in favor of Marx who shows that the \u201cform of value in general\u201d has not at all times been the universal form of the organization of production. Historically, and for a rather long time, it remained a particular relation of people and things in production although occurring haphazardly. It was not until capitalism and the \u201cfree enterprise society\u201d came into being that value (i.e., the market form of the product) became the general form of inter-relationships among the component parts of production.\nSimilar transitions, of the \u201cindividual and accidental\u201d into the universal is not a rarity, but rather a rule in history. In history \u2013 yet not exclusively the history of humanity with its culture \u2013 it always so happens that a phenomenon which later becomes universal, is at first emergent precisely as a solitary exception \u201cfrom the rule,\u201d as an anomaly, as something particular and partial. Otherwise, hardly anything could ever be expected to turn up. History would have a rather mystical appearance, if all that is new in it emerged at once, as something \u201ccommon\u201d to all without exception, as an abruptly embodied \u201cidea.\u201d\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/Ilyenkov-History.pdf\n\u201cWhen Michel Foucault regarded the current state of affairs from his own point of view, he saw modern society as an elaborate system of social control. Consequently he found its origins in the development of mass armies and the modern prison system in the early 19th century. This is an example of what Ilyenkov meant when he referred to  \u201csubjectivism and arbitrariness\u201d in identifying the starting point. \n\u2026\nThe essential task then in the study of history is to determine the germ cell of the present day, most advanced formation. It was in Evald Ilyenkov\u2019s chapter on abstract and concrete in the same work I have referred to that we find an exposition of how once the germ cell is isolated, its further concretisation can be traced as it colonises, so to speak, all the other elements of the social formation, and in the process of merging with other relations the cell is itself modified, ultimately able to reproduce itself out of conditions which are its own creation.\u201c\n\nThen elaborate on how you think the single tax displacing landlordism actually displaces surplus value being produced during the work day. I can tentatively imagine it improving workers collective negotiating power for wages by not being so threatened in time by losing their home. But this is a conception of losing landlordism but not necessarily one where people have land for their own means of subsistence or consideration of how such an alternative also just helps provide alternatives to survive in struggle but doesn\u2019t displace capitalist production.\n\nI know when colonialists took land in Australia and there wasn\u2019t property relations to force laborers to work for a wage and not just for themselves capitalism had to be creates through artificial property relations foreclosing this dynamic.\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch33.htm\n\nAnd it\u2019s not that I pose capitalists will be in a stronger position, just emphasizing it is a partial remedy, a progressive one perhaps, but it isn\u2019t displacing commodity production as the dominant mode of production. I don\u2019t see it essentially challenging production only changing the bargaining power of workers.\n\nBut when you say stamping out primitive accumulation, this then suggests not just a single tax system but actual take over of capitalist property and seems more than Georgism. Is Georgism requiring more than making landlordism untenable through taxation? Or is it taking land away from capitalists for their mode of production? Even if one had coops, this itself while progressive doesn\u2019t displace value as driving production.\n\nI guess the make contention is following Marx\u2019s characterization that George\u2019s \u201cfundamental dogma is that everything would be all right if ground rent were paid to the state.\u201d Is to be argued.

There is an inseparability of labor from such a process and where material forces of production like machines come in, Marx doesn\u2019t pose them as a source of surplus value but only a means to operate below the social average for super profits for the first to adopt the method before the method average and the social average drops.l and thus value due to the change in organic composition of capital.\nMinerals and raw resources are pivotal for the reproduction of the capitalist system, but i\u2019m not seeing the analysis of such material forms creating surplus value which isn\u2019t in large part to do with labor and labour power across the working day.\n\nYes, primitive accumulation is essential in creating the working class as is maintaining property relations that excludes a means of subsistence on ones own property. But again, allowing people housing by taxing landlords out of existence doesn\u2019t mean workers have a means of subsistence, that all pf land is opened up to workers unless you can describe that transition more.\n\nYes, but a feudal lords relation to their serf is qualitatively different than to a landlord and worker. \n\n\nAnd could the capitalist class not lower wages if the reproduction of the workers subsistence vis the wage doesn\u2019t entail paying for housing? Of course the counter is class struggle for higher wages enhanced by the stronger position of the working class to hold out.\n\nBasically, we would need to analyze a case where profits do become untenable and why higher wages are inevitable. And yes the relative share theorists predict economic crisis if workers raise wages too high that it becomes unprofitable for a capitalist due to no surplus value from such labor. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/subject/marxmyths/harry-cleaver/article.htm\n\u201cSecond, by confining the analysis of crisis to the struggle over the division of output, the relative shares theorists formulate the problematic of crisis in a way very similar to mainstream economic discussions of income distribution. This is a very old reformist terrain of discourse in which one debates the division of output but eschews discussion of overthrowing the wage system itself. Within this discourse conservative, pro-capitalist economists and commentators (such as those associated with the Reagan administration) respond to the decline in capitalist shares by calling for a redressing of shares \u2014an attack on wages and social services. Liberal, pro-capitalist economists (such as neoliberals like Thurow) call for an incomes policy to stabilize shares in a proportion favorable to capital, yet not totally destructive of working-class standards of living. The radical critics are willing to grant the necessity of a social surplus for investment and growth but want a larger role for workers in determining the course of such investment. They want greater \u201ceconomic democracy\u201d\u2014a slogan and a policy which has become the clarion cry of today\u2019s social democrats.\nThus, this relative shares version of Marxian crisis theory also falls within the scope of mainstream debates, albeit at the socialist fringe.\u201d\n\nAnd so I think I still see two things in my mind. One is a tax that makes housing affordable. The other is the reappropiation of land for the people which, I perhaps don\u2019t understand He ry George well enough, doesn\u2019t seem self evident to me from the tax. But the point then is about taking land from capitalists and how to organize it, which then makes me wonder why talk of a tax as implementing such an inroad on capitalist property? It then points out the necessity of political struggle against the capitalist class and private property which is agreeable, but why the means through a tax?\n\nI don\u2019t know I see how the land value tax undoes primitive accumulation and is why I think Marx criticizes a sense that its a one sided attack on landlords and rent but not private property and capitalist production.\nIf you forcibly take capitalist property then awesome, that does create a precondition that undermines those capitalists and perhaps capitalism locally. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t seem the necessary conclusion and perhaps that unfamiliarity with the argument of how once such a tax is achieved it results in land being redistributed on the whole. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t see the point of Marx seeing it strengthen capitalists except like my earlier proposal that it isn\u2019t the appropriation of land including the means of production but housing and the collection of ground rent to the state for social use instead of individual gain. That the worst effects of capitalism upon the reproduction of the working class as the working class is undermined and a healthier workforce available.\n\nFor more on ground rent in Marx perspective I recommend this: https://critiqueofcrisistheory.com/the-marxist-theory-of-ground-rent-pt-1/the-marxist-theory-of-ground-rent-pt-2/",

You need a period where commodity production still makes up a large part of the economy, but not where it drives the direction of the whole economy.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd this would still be irrelevant to the problem in America, where the leadership was never interested in building socialism to begin with.

Why?\n\n\nThe partial solving of the contradictions of capitalism, while still maintaining bourgeois rule serves to moderate class conflict and make it harder for revolutions to occur. You have to wait for capitalism to revert to its more exploitative form before class conflict flares up again. Of course, capitalists *will* dismantle georgism when profit rates become too low.\u00a0\n\n\nWe even have a direct analogy for this. The social democracy period from the 1940s to 1970s was basically this, except exploitation was reduced by increasing wages instead of eliminating rent. Look what happened to (and still happening) to social democracy. The neoliberal period of dismantling social democracy is already longer than the period of social democracy.\u00a0\n\n\n>Those factories needed coal, land and the right to pollute as well - natural capital from which surplus value was extracted. It wasnt all labor.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is a misunderstanding of the conceptual tool that is surplus value. *Value* is meant to quantify the limit that labor resources place on capitalist production, growth and the size of the bourgeois classes themselves.\u00a0\n\n\nIn some cases, natural resources can become a more interestinf constraint than labor, but since labor is used to make *everything*, labor constraints are the ones that have the most impact on driving the evolution of capitalism. The universality of labor as a constraint is also what gives class societies their particular social characteristics.",

Instead of recognizing that this role involves exploitation as well as co-ordination, they tend to see it only in terms of co-ordination. \n\u2026\nWhat happens when these two aspects of the capitalists\u2019 role are confused is that one tends to forget that capitalists as such have anything to do with production. Thus it turns out that when Robinson and Eatwell refer to capitalists, they actually have in mind only the people outside of the production process whom they classify as \u201crentiers.\u201d\n\u2026\nThus, the division of the community into idle consumers and active producers becomes a division between rentiers of all kinds (including landowners), on the one hand, and managers and workers on the other. 147\n\u2026\nThe question that must be asked, however, is how much of the present system would Robinson\u2019s proposal really change? If capitalism is the kind of system in which most people have to perform alienated labor under the direction of an autocratic elite, would it not still be capitalism even if the surplus-value produced were to be appropriated by the state rather than by a group of wealthy families? If our economic system were to continue to be based on wage-labor, would it not still be capitalism? And, if the state were to assume the functions that had previously been performed by private capitalists, would it not be fair to call the resulting system \u201cstate capitalism\u201d?\n\nMichael Lebowitz has argued that the Cantabrigian approach to economics should be understood as an expression of the interests of the functioning capitalist in opposition to those of the money capitalist. 156 This interpretation explains, among other things, why Robinson and Eatwell seem to be in such sympathy with their &dquo;entrepreneurs&dquo; and &dquo;managers&dquo; - picturing them as hard-working, talented, but not exploitative people. 157 It also explains why the Cantabrigians criticize only the ownership of the means of production by capitalists and the distribution of income to rentiers while neglecting the actual relations which characterize the capitalist process of production. For it makes little difference to the functioning capitalist whether the means of production are owned by private individuals or whether they are owned by the state. What counts is control, and this, as Robinson tells us, the Cantabrigians fully expect to be retained by the managers\u201d\n\nAnd the Cambridge economists problem is they split social relations apart from production itself and thus engage in commodity fetishism.\nIt also confuses what socialism might look like because they do not identify capitalists correctly and thus propose a reform but not an overcoming of capitalist production and its alienation of labor with a directly social mode of production.",
