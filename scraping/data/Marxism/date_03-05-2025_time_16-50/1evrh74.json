The media just channels their frustration, but even if workers from, for example germany vote for afd, they are not fascist, the problem with immigration is real because it's hard to integrate immigrants in society. Also they serve bourgeois as a reserve army of labour which Marx described in \u201eThe Capital \u201c, they overload the labor market, and serve as a competition to native workers because they accept lower payment and accept to work more intensely, because of low payment in their own country. So it is not in the interest of the European working class to accept immigration, and it's not in the interest of the working class that immigrated in europe for their own country to be exploited. Instead of immigration left in imperialist countries should direct workers to help them to create better working conditions in their own countries.\n\nAlso it doesn't matter if some worker says he is anti- immigration or that he supports right wing, it also doesn't necessarily makes him reactionary. It's idealistic to think that the majority of workers would have progressive ideas, they have those ideas, but even if it does matter, you can't just tell them you are fascist, I don't want to organize with you because you are anti- immigration, you push the workers from left and radicalize their populist position. The ideas are changing with the parxis, not with propaganda. For example, you have multi-ethnic workplace, if someone says I will not work with with people with that nationality, it would be stupid to call him a fascist, you have to point out that it's in his interest to work with them because their employer is their common enemy and by time, his position would change.\n\nSo the \u201eleft\u201c as much as right is pushing this cultural conflict and maintain burgeoise power. Instead of dealing with these stupid you have to have right opinion politics, we should work on changing the realtions of production that make people to be angry about those ideas. So if you want to change something don't spread anti-fascist ideas, help workers to organize and point their anger to employer instead of other minority groups or identities.",

When you separate those two concepts and begin using topics such as immigration and minority groups as a scapegoat for capitalist policies that ensure the oppression of working peoples, your talking points become indistinguishable from the far-right.\n\nImmigrants are workers too, who have rights that should be protected. To not recognise this fact is the definition of hypocrisy, and the foundations of ethno-nationalism.\n\nOne might be working class, but when they begin voting for \"actual fascists\" and begin parroting those same talking points, they become indistinguishable from these \"actual fascists\". Of course efforts should be made to educate and inform these people, however it's also incredibly disingenuous to not call a spade a spade and even more disingenuous to separate the responsibility and free will of a person making those choices from the choices themselves.\n\nAt that point at best you can consider those people \"useful idiots\" for those causes. At worst, they become actively dangerous which is how you end up with situations like the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nI noticed on your profile that you're apparently Serbian, and assuming you're arguing in good faith, I'm shocked that you don't see the connections to the ethnic violence and civil war that occurred in your region not 30 years ago.",

If you have a lot of immigrant workers who work for lower salaries then native workers, it means that the value of work is declining. Employers always want to lower their cost of production, so if they can pay less for the same amount of work or less for a bigger amount of work, they will do it. So because of that some european worker doesn't want to work for a smaller wage, european employers will employ immigrant workers, so the ethnic-conflict exist mainly because of competition on labor market between native and immigrant workers.\n\nThe leftists that are pro-immigration, are also pro exploitation of the value of third world countries, because the working force  also has value, and that immigrants are forced to escape from their countries. They don't like that they have to do it, but it is imposed by economic conditions, which are that way because of Western imperialism. It's also rational for immigrants to be frustrated and to hate native people from those countries because they equilize all native people from Europe. Instead of being pro-immigration it's better to support non-exploitation of western companies in foreign countries. Supporting immigration means supporting the reserve army of labour for western burgeoise that depends on them.",

Because of that, normal people that you are calling fascist hate left, and yeah, the truth is that,  the  average worker, usually don't care about Mussolini, Hitler or Marx main question for them is material interest that they will gain from some ideology, so if they see that some ideology doesn't fullfils their needs, they will switch that ideology for another or if they feel like they can't change the system they will rationalize their position thru accepting some ideology, but they will not actually believe in it. The system directs workers to hate immigrants not true ideology, it pushes them because they are competing with each other. You can get to that conclusion by basic understanding of marxist theory. I am not saying that immigrant workers shouldn't be unionized, but it's very hard to unionize them and that's okay in my opinion, I understand them and why they came to Europe, but there are, for sure, some difficulties in their integration in western societies, and  because of that I understand the reaction of native workers.\nWould you be happy, if you got a smaller salary because other group of workers, accepted to work in much worse working conditions?",

In the beginning, I felt the ideal system would have the absolute least amount of control or coercion of others possible \u2014 but every time I thought about what would *actually happen* under such conditions, I repeatedly came to the obvious conclusion that society would simply end up being controlled by the most ruthless capitalists and landlords. And not only did the idea of that outcome clearly suck but also I couldn\u2019t help noticing an eerie similarity between that outcome and the world I live in on a day-to-day basis. \n\nWhy, despite the intention to create freedom, did my system seem to essentially lead directly to slavery? I was beginning to suspect that our ideas about property had something to do with the outcome. And I began to reflect on the fact that our ideas about property had changed over time \u2014 for example, not too long ago in my own country, we considered people to be property and then, after some violence to settle the matter, we collectively decided that people were no longer property. From there, naturally the question arose of whether we could change that idea again \u2014 why should land, for example, be private property? None of us could say we made the land, after all. I started to see that things like factory and workplaces were only effectively private property because armed cops took the side of the owners. I started to see that a majority of the violence and coercion in society were due to maintaining property rights and not necessarily because of \u201cthe state.\u201d \n\nThis is when I discovered Marx and read Capital. A lot of pieces clicked into place then. \n\nFinally, I deconstructed my ideas about \u201cliberty.\u201d I think it was Stalin who said something like \u201cI fail to see what kind of freedom could be enjoyed by a poor, unemployed person.\u201d That made a lot of sense.\n\nAnyway, those were the main turning points for me.",

Seeing the state violence in response to the Ferguson protests made clear to me that capitalism requires the use of force to protect private property to maintain itself. More radical libertarians would respond that private property can be protected by private security forces and private courts. This leaves protestors subject to victimization at the hands of private security -- under what pressure does a private security force distinguish between a rioter and a protestor? What consequences do they face when if they beat a protestor to death for being in the same area as a rioter? And more importantly, why would a protestor adhere to the legitimacy of a private court funded by the bourgeoisie, where there is an obvious power imbalance inherent in the structure of that court? If liberal democracy, where the people have some (albeit extremely limitted) say over policing forces and a court system that protects capital, and shit like the state violence in Ferguson resulted, in what conceivable way would it be better if policing and the courts were even exclusively and explicitly under the thumb of capital, the only group that could actually pay for that protection?\n\nThen of course, the historical lens taught me that when these private security forces were given the social responsibilities that police have today, they were used against workers fighting for better working conditions, many of which we enjoy today. So it's not just that the libertarian's violent defence of private property creates an illegitimate system of abuse towards the public, but it has historically been used to maintain a poorer quality of life for workers. This is contrary to the outcomes libertarians suppose will happen under their system. It is theoretically and historically contradictory, and not just in the semantic marxist sense (which is more difficult to understand for non-marxists), but in the purely logical sense, which appealed to my sensibilities which were not quite marxist yet.",

I believe they all lead to a \u201crequirement\u201d for any of those political philosophies to work at the end of the day is responsibility. They simply are different on the means to get there. Example: Locke talks about fruits of one\u2019s own labor on his own land/property is his own\u2026BUT, he goes on to discuss (and this is conveniently left out by modern Libertarians identifying with the Libertarian Party) that one should take only what one needs, make sure to leave enough for the next guy, and the one after that\u2026to be responsible to the community too. That takes responsibility or being responsible towards one\u2019s community as well. Perhaps I\u2019m off base in that interpretation, but I believe all the non-monarch or non-dictator structures are essentially saying that is what is needed from everyone to make any of the systems truly work. We can call it Marxism, or socialism, or communism, or democracy, or libertarianism, or republicanism, and so on - but will only work if everyone understands what responsibility actually means. But, and not trying to be a \u201cDebbie Downer\u201d, but none of them appear to have a mechanism or ability to limit, control, or curb the inevitability of power being consolidated ot pursued by a select few. Just my knee-jerk reaction to your question.",

I heard about it on this podcast and there's a link to the essay in the show notes, but it requires a subscription.\n\nhttps://www.econtalk.org/michael-munger-on-obedience-to-the-unenforceable/#delve-deeper\n\nThe main concept is that we as a society should have manners and try to respect others and treat them well. By turning these into laws, you can end up discouraging people from acting right on their own, because sometimes the best way to get someone not to do something is to tell them to do it.\n\nIf you're interested enough to listen to/ read it, I'd be curious to know what you think.",

The essay was truly fantastic as well IMO; or as Russ and Munger referred to it as \u201cmagnificent\u201d. The phrase \u201cobedience to the unenforceable\u201d and Moulton\u2019s description along with Russ and Munger\u2019s breakdown appears to truly encapsulate the notion of responsibility (and in the sense of adhering to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d) I was attempting to convey in a much better fashion than I conducted in the previous post. But I will take it one step further that may better explain what I was also attempting to describe in that all forms of political (or even economic) paradigms and structures outside of monarchies, etc. requires an inherent \u2018obedience to the unenforceable\u2019 to work. We could have a republic form of government, but there is an absence of \u2018obedience to the unenforceable\u2019 in a general sense - the populace successfully changes to a Socialist form of government (as one example); but if the absence of \u2018obedience to the unenforceable\u2019 was already prevalent, that new form of government will probably \u201cfail\u201d as well. Any form of government cannot essentially instill the importance (even through laws) as that negates the very essence of the nature of \u2018obedience to the unenforceable\u2019. OR, perhaps a change comes amongst those that recognize the importance of \u2018obedience to the unenforceable\u2019; but its observation or importance only occurred in a fleeting moment - and it is the nature of society to diverge from understanding its importance. Perhaps the founding fathers of the United States fit that description despite several questionable moral choices, and subsequent generations diverged from observing \u2018obedience to the unenforceable\u2019. OR, and maybe more probable, perhaps most people actually understand its importance and desire to adhere to it, but influences of power, greed, a few rotten apples, and so on steer everyone down the wrong rabbit holes. I believe Russ and Munger touched on this aspect in the podcast. I firmly believe that actions when no one is looking is as important (if not more) to actions in the presence of others.",

I think the rise of the internet has made people less kind in that it dehumanizes people. I think we've also had optimization take over more of modern society and that has had hidden costs. I think generally we are becoming more estranged from things that affect us, whether it's global trade, centralization of government, or less time with others. I think marketing and Hollywood have encouraged more selfishness as well. I also wonder if there's more defensiveness today too.\n\nI don't think it's immediately obvious the best way to act and studying subjects like literature and philosophy can help. Socializing with other kind people goes a long way as well. Many don't have the time, energy, or interest to do either and in some cases, it's just hard to do so. I'm not sure what the right solutions are, but I think it's worth trying to just be kind and seeing if that spreads at all.",

Your comment on optimization is a good observation; with my company I always find myself reminding others there is probably a reason the word \u201cefficientest\u201d does not exist in the English language (because an elevated pursuit of it or supposed achievement of it could be described as counterproductive or ineffectual at the end of the day). But we find ourselves consistently \u201coptimizing\u201d. \n\nYou are correct in that there is no single factor that can be focused on to find resolution; but it appears it is human nature at times to assume there is only a single factor, and that if addressed, will lead to world peace so to speak. So don\u2019t take my original statements as the \u2018be all, end all\u2019 that is needed; but just one of many factors as you eloquently pointed out. I would also add history to your reference of literature and philosophy. I am young but old enough to understand that the words \u201cthose who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it\u201d is more accurately \u201cthose who fail to learn history are doomed to repeat it and those with personal interests who understand history will undoubtably exploit it\u201d.",

Look at what we've been doing in Africa and the Middle East from W. Bush to Hillary Clinton!
