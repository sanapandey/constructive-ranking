    "selftext": "Recently in the UK a group of climate protesters from Just Stop Oil (which has sister groups in other countries iirc, is also linked to Extinction Rebellion) were sentenced to 5 years in jail apiece. THis was in response to their plans to block the m25 (the major motorway that surrounds London). Blocking roads has been one of their major tactics, ostensibly to push the government to act on fossil fuels.\n\nPublic support according to at least some polls is not in their favour, especially blocking motorways. They also block roads more generally, regarldess of who needs to get by or what other road users are doing. I say this because there is evidence of them blocking a young woman trying, she claims, to take her kid to hospital (presumably non emergency). There are good reasons why blocking roads is a bad idea, so the issue is whether the climate crisis is a stuiable justification.\n\nMore broadly their actions are extremely divisive and do not, as I say, appear to be winning people over. I think that is a huge problem for them because if the public are against them then the state has absolutely no reason to concede. People will be more likely to vote for a government that wants to punish them as a result. Their actions alone, IMHO, will not achieve their goals, and certainly do not address the fact that one country alone cannot solve climate change.\n\nSo how do marxists analyse this situation? It seems to me that the working class needs to be united on this and that climate change needs to be part of the broader class based resistance to capitalism, as that is the main driver of pollution. Tactics that divide our class will be counter productive. A new mass workers party could achieve this I believe. Thanks",

So the only solution is to fold the climate struggle into a broader political class based movement with a wider program of demands, including better wages etc.",

The silence and apathy toward climate change will lead not only to ecocide, but also a form of genocide as entire cultures and nations are wiped out by the environmental crisis. People in \"wealthier\" countries are less effected, so they can afford to ignore it longer, despite the fact that their countries are more complicit.\n\nProtest is disruptive by nature (at least if you're doing it right). We're on a Marxist subreddit, and Marxist revolution would be way more disruptive than simply blocking a street. We have to accept the implications of fighting back against the system: if we're overly worried about inconveniencing people and just allowing things to function as they normally do, we will never overthrow capitalism.\n\nThat said, are these the most effective actions? I don't know enough about their decision-making process to really judge. I would like them to build more solidarity with unions, socialist groups, etc. If they can do that, they can expand and create more momentum for greater change.",

What is actually going to help us build power and bring about actual change?\n\nI'm not too familiar with your trans friends' situation or Labour policies on that issue (apart from off hand Keir Starmer remarks) so I can't say. But probably yeah I think they should have campaigned for Labour or other non-Tory parties. But they should also protest the Labour government. We can do both. It depends on what the situation demands. \n\nIn this case, Jamaal Bowman, who has been an outspoken supporter of Palestine and critic of Israel, was up against a conservative politician funded openly by the Israeli lobby to weaken the Palestinian voices in Congress. Instead of mobilizing their support behind Bowman and trying to help him win the election, they spent months criticizing him and protesting him for either not saying the correct enough thing or endorsing Joe Biden (who we need to win if Bowman and other Palestinian allies have any influence in the government). So they actively working with the right wing and against the Palestinian cause!\n\nNot only that, Bowman is a Black, progressive working class guy who was a teacher and has stood up for working class issues. All the progressives and working class folks, especially brown and Black folks, supported him and needed him to win because he advances their cause. Gathering people to protest this guy is sending the message that we don't care about anyone else's problems, only this issue. We don't care if people lose healthcare or education or can't afford housing we are going to burn it all down unless you agree with us on Palestine. That is petit bourgeoise radicalism. It's standing apart from the working class and shouting slogans at them.\n\nThe fact is, Palestine is not a priority for most Americans. The government reflects that. Continuing to protest the leaders without actually doing the work of mass organizing to shift public opinion and bring people into the movement (and bring this issue into the larger movement) does absolutely nothing. \n\nI think these protestors should have been campaigning for Bowman for months to ensure he had a good chance in this race. The election would have also served as a good platform to have one-on-one conversations with people about Palestine and tie it in with other progressive working class issues. \n\nWhen the election is done, Bowman is in power, then yeah, go occupy his office and confront him on these shortcomings. He might actually listen vs the guy who is specifically installed to shut the door on you. \n\n[Crisis of Petty-Bourgeois Radicalism, by Gus Hall (marxists.org)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/hall/1970/crisis-petty-bourgeois-radicalism.htm)",

But I'm not entierly perusaded it's an effective comparison. We live in a vastly different world and this cause is similarly different. Nowadays there is a proliferation of social media tech so people can post clips of JSO blocking a young mum taking her kid (as I outlined) to hospital. Is that fair? Is it bad faith? Is it even accurate. I don't know. From what i've heard JSO say it did happen. Their response was to say that the severity of climate change is even greater. I think that's a dangerous argument to put to people; you're effectively telling them their problems don't matter. That isn't going to win people over. JSO has to win people over. \n\nRoger Hallam is informed by his reading of theory on matters of protest. I can't speak to that theory, i've never read it. But I don't think it's working. As I said, putting the lives of minority BAME and migrant background activists at risk is a dangerous thing to do that I don't think he considered.

However, if you follow the recent history of Just Stop Oil and XR (similar organisations with the same people behind them) you will see that the overall strategy is extremely effective.\n\nIn its first week, the Labour government announced no new Oil and Gas licenses in the North Sea, which was one of JSO's demands. Prior to organisations like these it was unheard of that an environmental organisation actually affected policy at this scale.\n\nDon't cry over the jail sentences, Hallam in particular has been vocal about the need to attract lengthy jail sentences in a kind of martyrdom doctrine, so its not exactly foisted upon them.\n\nIn my experience of these groups they have little in common with prior radical left organisations or working class socialism. They seek rapid policy change within the bourgeois system, and are up front about that. They are also explicitly non revolutionary in their goals. They are more in the vein of former reform movements like suffragettes and the civil rights, important within the framework of the current system, rather than a radical challenge to it.\n\nWorking class environmentalism exists in spades throughout the world, as well as the more reformist green trade unionism. Before anyone condemns JSO, let's remember that strikes are also disruptive, and many of the same arguments deployed against these tactics are also deployed against striking workers.",

If you're a working class family who can afford barely a holiday a year are you going to look at their actions and be sympathetic? No, you are going to think these protesters are privileged and disruptive and you will, understanadbly, feel aggrieved.\n\n  \nThat doesn't imply that air travel is good for the environment.

It was entirely spurious, there was a definite mechanism for making sure that only those who were prepared to get arrested would be. We should be very suspicious when nominally progressive ideas are deployed in ways that suppress organisational capacity or stir up a sense of false grievance between members of a political group. Certainly any revolutionary movement that still takes the utterances of the bourgeois press at face value is doomed to fail.  \n\nIn former times ages when a campaign group had an aim, and after a series of disruptive actions the government policy changes, we attribute the policy change to the campaign. So if you'd like to apply the same burden of proof to the relation between the suffragettes and the women's vote, as just one example, then be my guest. I myself am happy to state I think that the campaign led directly to change of government policy, that would not have happened without it. It's just a common sense interpretation of events, I don't feel the need to provide proof. \n\nSo, on whether their actions should win people over, I think your confusing this for revolutionary action, which does need the support of the people. XR/JSO, like civil rights movements is more a way to change policy even when there is a majority against you. They needed to persuade government rather than the average worker. \n\nShould they be popular revolutionary? Well, that's another question. The point is they're not, and have never claimed to be. \n\nDespite a few unpopular actions from environmentalists, support for renewables and other measures is at record high levels. So, I think they were strategically correct in thinking that they needed attention more than sympathy. \n\nSo just to underline my point here, they pushed forward their aims despite losing popularity. Socialist organisation and popular revolution is based on entirely different principles.",
