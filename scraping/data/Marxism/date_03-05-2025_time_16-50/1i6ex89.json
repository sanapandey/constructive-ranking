Madison in his writings, noted that in a true democracy the general population could use their democratic power to remove the wealth and privilages of the elites and use them for the benefit of the majority of the society. He and others  thought that this wouldn't be proper and so the model that was constructed was a model where the elites run the country and not the general population.\n\nTherefore it is an oligarchy. You can see it. The richest man in the world gets an office in goverment. Meanwhile poor people can't get proper Healthcare and have no means of shaping policy because both parties are corporate parties and serve corporate interests.\n\nThe same is true for all industrial democracies more or less. Here in Europe  the system functions among the same lines. An energetic oligarchy at the top and a passive and dominated population at the bottom.\n\nCould it be made even worse under the new Trump administration? Possibly.\n\nEdit: Just saw the first executive orders. It became worse.",

The right has already gutted the voting rights act leading to much worse voter suppression and lower voter turnout. They want to gut the NLRB. They want to get rid of universal suffrage, kill labor unions entirely, and make socialist parties illegal.\n\nAlso liberal democracy is not just oligarchy. That is a very simplistic and non-Marxist view. Liberal democracy is worth protecting from the forces of reaction. Remember that socialism comes from capitalism. It creates its own gravediggers. Lenin argued the working class must lead the fight for a complete liberal revolution. Our political freedoms and freedoms even as individuals are key to organizing for socialism.",

The structure of the senate and presidential electors was always intended as a check against the people's power, and those were put in place when only landowning white men could vote.  I think that is illustrative, since the elites of the 1780's were even afraid of their fellow lower-class elites.\\]\n\nWe have expanded the franchise though.  The slaves were eventually freed and given the right to vote.  Women were included in the voting pool.  Labor got a seat at the table in the 1930's.\n\nAt the same time, the wealthy and powerful have engaged in the struggle and found new ways to restrict access to power.  After slaves were freed and enfranchised, they added poll taxes and tests.  When those were taken away, they started purging voter rolls, gerrymandering with data, and closing polling stations.  In order to dilute the working class vote they started pushing cultural issues like abortion.\n\nNo gains have been made without the loss of life.  Literally.  People have had to die to either just maintain the status quo, or to make very minor gains.  It really sucks that people have to sacrifice just to stop the rich from taking more than they already have... and no actual gains are made for the working class.",

So, it doesn't matter if you have a multi party, single party or dual party system, or presidential or parliamentary system, they will eventually be corrupted by the economic agents.\n\nThe only way to have proper democracy is to break the control of the elites. By expropriation of capital, really democratizing communications (corporate media owned by economic elites is not allowed), and democratizing finance.\n\nEven a bureaucratic state can also try to override public will, so they need to go as well. The state can only wither away when it is progressively decentralized. This is something that all socialist experiments failed to do, and that became one of the main contradictions of 20th century socialism. Too bad that instead of solving the issue, most states regressed to the western oligarchic model.",

Therefore, there is a tendency by both opportunists and ultra leftists to cast any serious reaction offensive as being fascism, because this fits our inherited model of popular revolution being anti-fascist.\n\nNone of this is to say that the political agenda of the ruling class is not changing. This takes place not smoothly but in a political struggle between different political forces. We are seeing a form of globalisation in which the major states move from an attempt at a consensus and a rigged rules based international order towards a more transactional and belligerent state egotism including protectionism, trade war and territorial claims. This presages a period of descent into war. But it does not have to involve fascism, unless the bourgeoisie find themselves obliged to mobilise forces beyond the state to crush the working class or democratic rights.\n\nIn this context we have to defend every democratic right that the bourgeoise tries to take away and to extend capitalist democracy beyond the point that the bourgeoisie is willing to allow. At the same time it should be abundantly clear from the Marxist theory of the state that no bourgeois democratic exercise is capable of overthrowing the ruling class, which will be a matter of revolutionary force, the dismantling of the bourgeoisie's monopoly of armed force, and the establishment of a revolutionary dictatorship governed by democratic organisations of the workers.",

The US has always \\*absolutely\\* been a republic.  Good or bad is irrelevant.  The only thing that makes a country a \"republic\" is that it isn't a monarchy.  The US has never been a monarchy, so therefore, it has always been a republic.\n\nI'm not sure why so many people want \"republic\" to mean something very different from its true definition.\n\nLots of countries are republics: the US, Germany, China, Russia, and many more.

There is nothing very liberal about treating dollar bills like constituents of the population. Neoliberalism isn't Liberalism. Freeing capital isn't what is intended by Liberalism. It was freeing the individual from being owned by a class of owners who rented you out an existence that drove people to the land where that seemed to be the driving rationale.

People are saying there is no democracy, this is not true.\n\nAnd not just universal suffrage, but also the right to organize labor. The new deal itself was a democratic victory as it used the state to actually address working class poverty.\n\nThis right was won through a lot of struggle. These people did not fight and die for nothing. We have to recognize these working class victories within capitalism as they pave the way for a more complete democracy in the future. \n\nThe US started with very limited suffrage. The Presidency and senate were unelected positions. \nWe fought the civil war and then various other struggles to win universal suffrage and the civil rights act and the voting rights act (which is now gutted). \n\nLeftists like to present this crude Marxist version of capitalism which is just oligarchy. It\u2019s not. A lot of so-called Marxists forget the progressive role of capitalism and how it did make possible individual freedom and political organization. Remember that socialism comes out of capitalism. Capitalism creates its own gravediggers as Marx and Engels said.\n\nIt was liberal ideas of equality and freedom that influenced the abolitionists. The North was more industrialized, more free and egalitarian. The South was more aristocratic. It was in the North that the idea of freeing slaves could become popular and a real force. And this is called by Marxist historian Gerald Horne the real American revolution which finally established capitalism in the US.\n\nIn Two Tactics, Lenin talks about how the bourgeoisie does not want a complete capitalist/liberal revolution. They like the progressive ideas applied to them but not to the working class. They would rather hold onto the old aristocratic rule to the extent that it helps them. And he talks about allying with the elements of the bourgeoisie who do support democracy and do it on our terms.\n\nHe argued that it was up to the working class to win that complete bourgeois revolution which gives us political freedoms and which would create the conditions for a socialist movement. The bourgeoisie will never fight for what they claim to fight for. It\u2019s up to us. And this bourgeois democracy, for all its limitations, is worth winning and defending. It was the 1905 revolution and the establishment of the duma (though it was a sham) and the Soviets that led to the revolution of 1917.\n\nIn the US, it has been the working class that has fought for the more complete American revolution. To actually implement the bill of rights. And often the fight is led by communists and socialists who identify that the racism and exploitation is rooted within capitalism. It doesn\u2019t stop them from fighting for more.\n\nTrump wants to undo the gains made by the working class. Not Trump himself but the long standing right wing neoliberal movement he represents. He is the executor of the Koch agenda which wants to eliminate labor unions, kill universal suffrage, and dismantle all regulatory and redistributive elements of the state. And after some electoral failures what this movement has learned is that these things are only possible through fascism. So these oligarchs have allied themselves with the most reactionary parts of the bourgeoisie (which includes Trump and Musk) and their petit bourgeois gun-toting fascist militias. \n\nIt was disappointing from a Marxist standpoint how leftists stood on the sidelines during this election. But even now, I think our priority has to be to not dismiss the democracy we have but rather fight to protect what we can. We have to now ally ourselves with the bourgeois elements who do oppose mass deportations and support lgbtq rights and want to protect labor organizing. This is not the time to grandstand about how socialism is the only solution and withdraw ourselves from people\u2019s real daily struggles.",
