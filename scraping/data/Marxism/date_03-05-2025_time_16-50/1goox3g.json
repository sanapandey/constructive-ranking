    "selftext": "I mentioned in a different post that I'm prepping to start a reading group/education org when I go home next month, where there's no revolutionary left to speak of. At first it was gonna just start with me and a bunch of sympathetic friends I've been talking politics with for years but, with the outcome of the election, I have people I haven't spoken to in years reaching out and looking for answers, many of whom want to invite their friends who are also suddenly worried about politics. My friends would at least listen to me talk about class interests and alot of more basic stuff but it seems like there will be alot of people starting from absolute square one. Of course there's nothing wrong with that, but it does complicate things for me a little bit.\n\nSo I'm looking for works to start with. Ideally essays and shorter stuff because I think discipline will take time to build, and accessibly covers the very basics. I'm not quite an academic but I got here through a passion for philosophy and could jump right into some of the more difficult stuff, so that's a major blind spot of mine. Any recommendations?",

It will be very basic to most Marxists, but I think it would work great as a starting point for questioning (even progressive) liberal frameworks (it has the added benefit of introducing feminism, which many on the left still overlook too much). From there, it may be a lot easier to introduce texts that start from a point that is far more detached from liberalism. I found Engels' *Principles of Communism* to be a good text to start with.",

We've found the sweet spot is ~80 pages, or ~200 split into two meetings, and things fall off massively if there are three or more more meetings, so I'm really torn on this one. Have you found differently?",

What is materialism, what is dialectics, what Hegel said, then how Marx took that and ran with it... How it evolved to historical materialism and class consciousness became a thing. I think libs are scared of the words \"Marxist\" and \"communist\" and \"bourgeoisie\", so starting from the philosophical basis might... butter them up a little better. \n\nTwo caveats tho - don't bore them, philosophy can be dreary, so keep it to the point. Also, try to relate it back to TODAY, these people care about their immediate conditions, so make sure to let them know that the foundation is important to understand the rest - the economics and politics of it all. \n\nMarxism is about material analysis, so, imo, this is where to start. After that, though... there are several opinions on reading lists out there about to go for first.",

He does a great job laying all the terminology out in a concise and easy to understand way. Perhaps you could try and summarize the content yourself, or even use the transcripts. \n\nIf you listen to the rest of the series, you'll also learn that going to the peasants with this information was... Not successful. The Bolsheviks gained power by promising \"bread, peace, and land\" to the workers/soviets.",

Is this unusual? What happened in times of strife like this? Have leftists failed to take hold before? What did they do and how did they do it?\u00a0\n\n\nIt leads to speaking of Lenin and Trotsky and how community power was built. I'd even speak about non Marxists revolutionaries in the US. The colonies built their own second sphere of power making them the true alternative to a King who was so far away that he couldn't actually provide for needs of the people.\n\n\nThe Spaniards arriving and overthrowing the Aztecs was done through a mix of working within the system until they had gained power and made alliances to be able to overthrow the ruling government.\u00a0\n\n\nThe English revolutions of the 1600's had been caused by material conditions and resulted in no change because it was accidental. It shows what happens when the working class are not involved in revolution.",
