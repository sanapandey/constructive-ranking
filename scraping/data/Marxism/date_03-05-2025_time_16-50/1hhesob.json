I think it\u2019s metaphysical to blame a mind altering substance and the way it\u2019s used under a profit based system and to completely disregard it\u2019s use ever in socialist society. I think it\u2019s really harmful to disabled people and only able bodied socialists I seen have advocated for it. I also think labor aristocratic socialists majorly enforce drug war propaganda very often and ignoring the main contradiction of profit motive. You can disagree if you want but just curious if any Marxists have or have had any thoughts. Many who hear me talk about drugs the way I do assume I\u2019m a anarchist or something like that and a lot of it seems to be out of which I\u2019m not but because of the way I often argue about these things to be anti lumpen prejudice.

Everything else is a bandaid or grift. So no it would not be a requirement to have strong drug policy. Not to mention most drug policy itself is a means of suppressing labor and greater collective action.\n\nOpioids are medically necessary. Perhaps some day we will have even better and safer forms.\n\nItd be more efficient to give the people more fulfilling lives",

The risk of execution deters the vast majority of people who would try to make a profit in this way. The supply dwindles to a trickle, the price in turn goes high enough to be unaffordable to most people (particularly the most vulnerable sectors), and a drug culture has difficulty establishing itself, meaning there is little social tolerance of drug trafficking and abuse in general. This should be done in tandem with improvements to material conditions, especially in very rural and dense urban areas, so that people are not ending up homeless or alienated to the point of seeking chemical escapism. As the material incentive to sell drugs is severely diminished, medical researchers and manufacturers can be directed to focus on non-opioid analgesics, which already exist but are not commonly used due to little market incentive.\n\nOf course, none of this is going to happen as long as profit-driven pharmaceutical racketeers are permitted to retain influence over government policy, dispensing protocols, and absolute control of scientific R&D.",

The traffickers are usually smaller fish who are considered disposable labor, due to the high risk of incarceration. What should be addressed is the exploitative hierarchy of profiteers, who enforce their dominance via excessively violent tactics taught in CIA-funded educational facilities aimed at suppressing popular uprisings (School of the Americas/Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation).\n\nTo address the epidemic, we need to deal with the underlying factors conditioned on the many forms of capitalist alienation and mental health issues.\n\nAs for the death penalty, Indonesia serves as an example to demonstrate why it does little to stop organized crime. Also, this kind of \"squash the symptom, ignore the cause\"-solution is nothing if not reactionary.",

In western countries there are complex modern economies which depend heavily on foreign trade, making it relatively easily to engage in smuggling activities without getting caught. Additionally opioid addiction is treatable, there's meds like suboxone and methadone, counselling, therapy, even mushroom therapy these days. Its a lot more feasible to actually treat opioid addiction like the public health issue it is rather than a matter of criminality, provided the healthcare system is actually provided the resources it requires to tackle the crisis.\n\nMore importantly socialism should actually really impact the prevelance of mental health issues which make people want to use opiates in the first place. Even if you banned them effectively and thereby curtailed mass opioid abuse, those who aren't ready to get clean will just gravitate towards other drugs as a substitute - benzos, alcohol, amphetamines, etc. For some its just a matter of getting lifted to escape their pain its not about the substance as such.\n\nAlso opiates have legit medical applications, denying people access to such pain relief when they genuinely need it would be needlessly cruel.\n\nI'm also a recovering opioid addict and I definitely believe such a crisis could be taken in hand under the right conditions.",

The dispensaries would ensure minors have no access other than with reasonable guardian authorization. Dispensing independently such more intense intoxicants (perhaps therefore beer, wine, cannabis, and psychedelics excepted) will then be illegal, but that criminalization will no longer involve criminalizing something highly lucrative (and thus a highly difficult gray market to suppress). The independent illegal dispensers would be hard-pressed to compete with the economies of scale of the network of socialist Commonwealth dispensaries.  \n\nThe quality and purity of the intoxicants would be safely maintained by the Commonwealth. Safe administering facilities could likewise be provided for those who have no safe place to administer the intoxicants (though homelessness would also be eliminated with socialism). \n\nPublic intoxication, when unruly, would also be a fineable offense. Healthcare would be universally provided, as a right, so treatment for addiction would be available to all who want it. Belonging and fulfillment would be inherent in the communities fostered by communism and so the destitution \u201cstick\u201d driving some toward addiction would be eliminated and the fulfillment lure away from addiction would pervade.\n\nUnruly public intoxication and merchanting of contaminated intoxicants are the actual inherent harms and injuries for Commonwealth stewardship to address. The other harms are created by a corrupt and even outright treasonous capitalist State maliciously and viciously criminalizing inherently private affairs, in a totalitarian manner. As Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein says: drugs are not _criminalized_ because they are _dangerous_; rather drugs are _dangerous_ because they are _criminalized_.",
