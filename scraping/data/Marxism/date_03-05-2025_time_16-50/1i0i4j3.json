    "selftext": "For my Master's thesis I am looking into ways of combining Social Network Analysis (SNA) with a Marxist approach. The study will look into strategic relationships within the pro-Palestinian student movement. At present, I want to use SNA to map structural ties and link them to class relations and positions.   \nDo you now of Marxists who have done similar studies or combined Marxist theory with SNA?",

            "body": "What a fascinating project you are suggesting! I have no reference but please let me give you some advice: \n\nThe Marxist method (as I understand it) usually starts out at a phenomenon (the entity), then situates it in the wider social context (the totality) to enquire about the role it plays in them, to ultimately return to the entity - which one then can see in a new light and with a deepened understanding. So the logic inquires about relationality _without_. \n\nI am by no means an expert about SNA but I assume you would use it to inquire about the relationality _within_ the movements you are looking at. In a dialectical sense, the two would be compatible and it would be fascinating to compare the contradictions within the movement with the contradictions without, i.e. those in the social context the movement is embedded in. \n\nHowever, as someone who works in academia, I have to tell you, this project would be overly ambitious for a Master thesis - but it could make a great (but still demanding) dissertation! Maybe you could consider to make this master Thesis a pilot project for another more extensive work thereafter? What I see as more feasible would be to either do an exploratory SNA where you just map the connections with some preliminary reflections on how they might matter for Marxist theory (but then you should be open to the possibility that they might not seem to matter at first glance!) - or you could use the master thesis to come up with a design how to integrate SNA in Marxist theory - but this would have little to do with the emperical case you want to look at and would demand a quite deep understanding of both SNA methodology and Marxist theory (which takes time and a lot of reading to develop). \n\nDoing the exploratory case with some reflection of the results seems to be strategically better than coming up with a complicated design that might never come to life. \n\nGood luck for your graduation!",

I hope to find some existing examples, as I also see that the design as I have it now is maybe a bit ambitious if I have to invent the theory myself and then apply it. \n\nThe two alternative suggestions are great, and I will certainly give them a thought!",

            "body": "All I know about social network theory is the very brief overviews of it online which suggest that it studies the inter relationships between people and groups of people through mapping nodes and connections, and posits that those relationships are governed by social norms.\n\nMarxism, by contrast, studies relations between people as being fundamentally production relations, because until people have learned to provide themselves with the means to eat, find shelter and reproduce, then more sophisticated needs and cultural norms will not develop.\n\nClass analysis is entirely concerned with the struggle between groups of people with different relations to the means of production over who commands and controls the surplus product. \n\nIf one were to adopt the discourse associated with social network theory and to analyse, for example, an early primitive communist community which has not yet developed the techniques of production sufficiently to produce a surplus, then one would discover that as technique improves and a surplus is generated, the cultural norms governing the Community would dramatically change. \n\nControl of the surplus would now enable some individuals to enslave others, as the cost of the reproduction of the ability of one individual to work would now be lower than the value of their individual share of the social product. Then you would show the distribution of the notes and the pattern of lines are changed dramatically. \n\nIn the process, you would be utilising the diagrammatic conventions of social network theory to demonstrate its inadequacy.",
