    "selftext": "I was very interested in Marxism and Neo-marxism in college, especially discussions of labor. As a recent grad (23\u2019) starting to work in a more professional setting I have come across/been asked to read some professional development books and materials. Currently reading Kim Scott\u2019s Radical Candor which stresses the importance of caring enough about your workers to tell them what they\u2019re doing wrong and how to improve. I can\u2019t help but wonder what a Marxist or neo-marxist take on this type of thing becoming more and more widespread. Is it positive to move towards a more positive work culture? Is it a tactic to satiate the workers?would love to hear others thoughts ",

Sorry I dont really have the energy to go to deep into it myself right now but those two women are great.",

It's just that it's tangled up with production at the site of production.\n\nThere are a multitude of \"care\" services that employers provide along these lines such as \"workplace resiliency training\", \"soft skills training\", \"sexual harassment training\", free counselling services, annual leave, etc. \n\nWhile these services tend to manifest as perks or facets of a genuine care on the part of employers, each also signposts that the workplace is a venue for psychological strain and damage, interpersonal conflict and oppression, exhaustion, etc\u2014meaning they have a secondary, sinister feeling about them, derived from their undergirding purpose being simply and solely to ensure workers continue to work.\n\nThis narrow purpose becomes more clear at the moment a worker is no longer expected to return to productive work, at which time these services tend to ruthlessly detach from their object.",

If there's a lot of coworkers talking about how someone is doing bad at their job I think it's good to try and help them find better ways to do some of their tasks if I know some better ways before management gets involved and they feel like they're in trouble.",
