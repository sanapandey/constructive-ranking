The reactionary elements in Kautsky and in the old labour movement were objectively conditioned, and only by a long period of exposure to an inimical reality was developed that subjective readiness to turn defenders of the capitalist society. In Capital Marx pointed out that \u201ca rise in the price of labour, as a consequence of accumulation of capital, only means, in fact, that the length and weight of the golden chain the wage-worker has already forged for himself, allow of a relaxation of the tension of it.\u201d^(\\[4\\])\u00a0The possibility, under conditions of a progressive capital formation, of improving labour conditions and of raising the price of labour transformed the workers\u2019 struggle into a force for capitalist expansion. Like capitalist competition, the workers\u2019 struggle served as an incentive for further capital accumulation; it accentuated capitalist \u2018progress\u2019. All gains of the workers were compensated for by an increasing exploitation, which in turn permitted a still more rapid capital expansion.\n\nEven the class struggle of the workers could serve the needs not of the individual capitalists but of capital. The victories of the workers turned always against the victors. The more the workers gained, the richer capital became. The gap between wages and profits became wider with each increase of the \u2018workers\u2019 share\u2019. The apparently increasing strength of labour was in reality the continuous weakening of its position in relation to that of capital. The \u2018successes\u2019 of the workers, hailed by Eduard Bernstein as a new era of capitalism, could, in this sphere of social action, end only in the eventual defeat of the working class, as soon as capital changed from expansion to stagnation. In the destruction of the old labour movement, the sight of which Kautsky was not spared, became manifest the thousands of defeats suffered during the upswing period of capitalism, and though these defeats were celebrated as victories of gradualism, they were in reality only the gradualism of the workers\u2019 defeat in a field of action where the advantage is always with the bourgeoisie. Nevertheless, Bernstein\u2019s revisionism, based on the acceptance of appearance for reality and suggested by bourgeois empiricism, though at first denounced by Kautsky, provided the basis for the latter\u2019s own success. For without the non-revolutionary practice of the old labour movement, whose theories were formed by Bernstein, Kautsky would not have found a movement and a material basis on which to rise as an important Marxian theoretician.\n\nThis objective situation, which, as we have seen, transformed the successes of the labour movement into just so many steps toward its destruction, created a non-revolutionary ideology which was more in harmony with the apparent reality, and which was later denounced as social-reformism, opportunism, social-chauvinism, and outright betrayal. However, this \u2018betrayal\u2019 did not very much bother those who were betrayed. Instead, the majority of the organised workers approved of the change of attitude in the socialist movement, since it conformed to their own aspirations developed in an ascending capitalism. The masses were as little revolutionary as their leaders, and both were satisfied with their\u00a0*participation*\u00a0in capitalist progress. Not only were they organising for a greater share of the social product, but also for a greater voice in the political sphere. They learned to think in terms of bourgeois democracy; they began to speak of themselves as consumers; they wanted to take part in all that was good of culture and civilisation. Franz Mehring\u2019s\u00a0History of the German Social Democracy\u00a0typically ends in a chapter on \u2018Art and the Proletariat\u2019. Science for the workers, literature for the workers, schools for the workers, participation in all the institutions of capitalist society \u2014 this and nothing more was the real desire of the movement. Instead of demanding the end of capitalistic science, it asked for labour scientists; instead of abolishing capitalistic law, it trained labour lawyers; in the increasing number of labour historians, poets, economists, journalists, doctors and dentists, as well as parliamentarians and trade-union bureaucrats, it saw the socialisation of society, which therewith became increasingly its own society. That which one can increasingly share in one will soon find defendable. Consciously and unconsciously the old labour movement saw in the capitalist expansion process its own road to greater welfare and recognition. The more capital flourished, the better were the working conditions. Satisfied with action within the framework of capitalism, the workers\u2019 organisations became concerned with capitalism\u2019s profitability. The competitive national capitalistic rivalries were only verbally opposed. Although the movement was at first striving only for a \u2018better fatherland\u2019, and was later willing to defend what had already been gained, it soon reached the point where it was ready to defend the fatherland \u2018as it is\u2019.\n\nThe tolerance that Marx\u2019s \u2018followers\u2019 displayed towards the bourgeois society was not one-sided. The bourgeoisie itself had in its very struggle against the working class learned to \u2018understand the social question\u2019. Its interpretation of social phenomena became increasingly more materialistic; and soon there was an overlapping of ideologies in both fields of thought, a condition increasing still further the \u2018harmony\u2019 based on the actual disharmony of class frictions within a rising capitalism. However, the \u2018Marxists\u2019 were more eager than the bourgeoisie to \u2018learn from the enemy\u2019. The revisionist tendencies had developed long before the death of Engels. The latter, and Marx himself, had wavered and displayed moments in which they were carried away by the apparent success of their movement. But what with them was only a temporary modification of their essentially consistent thinking became \u2018belief\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019 for that movement which learned to see progress in larger trade-union treasures and greater election votes.\n\nAfter 1910 the German social democracy found itself divided into three essential groups. There were the reformists, openly favouring German imperialism; there was the \u2018left\u2019, distinguished by such names as Luxemburg, Liebknecht, Mehring and Pannekoek; and there was the \u2018centre\u2019, trying to follow traditional paths, that is, only in theory, as in practice the whole of the German social democracy could do only what was possible, i.e. what Bernstein wanted them to do. To oppose Bernstein could mean only to oppose the whole of the social democratic practice. The \u2018left\u2019 began to function as such only at the moment it began to attack social democracy as a part of capitalist society. The differences between the two opposing factions could not be solved ideationally; they were solved when the Noske terror murdered the Spartacus group in 1919.\n\nWith the outbreak of the war, the \u2018left\u2019 found itself in the capitalist prisons, and the \u2018right\u2019 on the General Staff of the Kaiser. The \u2018centre\u2019, led by Kautsky, simply dispensed with all problems of the socialist movement by declaring that neither the social democracy nor its International could function during periods of war, as both were essentially instruments of peace. \u201cThis position,\u201d Rosa Luxemburg wrote, \u201cis the position of an eunuch. After Kautsky has supplemented the\u00a0Communist Manifesto\u00a0it now reads: Proletarians of all countries unite during peace times, during times of war, cut your throats.\u201d^(\\[5\\])\n\nThe war and its aftermath destroyed the legend of Kautsky\u2019s Marxist \u2018orthodoxy\u2019. Even his most enthusiastic pupil, Lenin, had to turn away from the master. In October 1914 he had to admit that as far as Kautsky was concerned, Rosa Luxemburg had been right. In a letter to Shlyapnikow^(\\[6\\]), he wrote, \u201cShe saw long ago that Kautsky, the servile theoretician, was cringing to the majority of the Party, to Opportunism. There is nothing in the world at present more harmful and dangerous for the ideological independence of the proletariat than this filthy, smug and disgusting hypocrisy of Kautsky. He wants to hush everything up and smear everything over and by sophistry and pseudo-learned rhetoric lull the awakened consciences of the workers.\u201d\n\n...\n\nThe theoretical unclarity and inconsistency that Kautsky^(\\[15\\])\u00a0displayed on economic questions, were only climaxed by his acceptance of the once denounced views of Tugan-Baranowsky. They were only a reflection of his changing general attitude towards bourgeois thought and capitalist society. In his book \u201cThe Materialistic Conception of History,\u201d which he himself declares to be the best and final product of his whole life\u2019s work, dealing as it does in nearly 2000 pages with the development of nature, society and the state, he demonstrates not only his pedantic method of exposition and his far-reaching knowledge of theories and facts, but also his many misconceptions as regards Marxism and his final break with Marxian science. Here he openly declares \u201cthat at times revisions of Marxism are unavoidable.\u201d^(\\[16\\])\u00a0Here he now accepts all that during his whole life he had apparently struggled against. He is no longer solely interested in the interpretation of Marxism, but is ready to accept responsibility for his own thoughts, presenting his main work as his own conception of history, not totally removed but independent from Marx and Engels. His masters, he now contends, have restricted the materialistic conception of history by neglecting too much the natural factors in history. He, however, starting not from Hegel but from Darwin, \u201cwill now extend the scope of historical materialism till it merges with biology.\u201d^(\\[17\\])\u00a0But his furthering of historical materialism turns out to be no more than a reversion to the crude naturalistic materialism of Marx\u2019s forerunners, a return to the position of the revolutionary bourgeoisie, which Marx had overcome with his rejection of Feuerbach. On the basis of this naturalistic materialism, Kautsky, like the bourgeois philosophers before him, cannot help adopting an idealistic concept of social development, which, then, when it deals with the state, turns openly and completely into the old bourgeois conceptions of the history of mankind as the history of states. Ending in the bourgeois democratic state, Kautsky holds that \u201cthere is no room any longer for violent class conflict. Peacefully, by way of propaganda and the voting system can conflicts be ended, decisions be made.\u201d^(\\[18\\])\n\nThough we cannot possibly review in detail at this place this tremendous book of Kautsky,^(\\[19\\])\u00a0we must say that it demonstrates throughout the doubtful character of Kautsky\u2019s \u2018Marxism\u2019. His connection with the labour movement, seen retrospectively, was never more than his participation in some form of bourgeois social work. There can be no doubt that he never understood the real position of Marx and Engels, or at least never dreamed that theories could have an immediate connection with reality. This apparently serious Marxist student had actually never taken Marx seriously. Like many pious priests engaging in a practice contrary to their teaching, he might not even have been aware of the duality of his own thought and action. Undoubtedly he would have sincerely liked being in reality the bourgeois of whom Marx once said, he is \u201ca capitalist solely in the interest of the proletariat.\u201d But even such a change of affairs he would reject, unless it were attainable in the \u2018peaceful\u2019 bourgeois, democratic manner. Kautsky, \u201crepudiates the Bolshevik melody that is unpleasant to his ear,\u201d wrote Trotsky, \u201cbut does not seek another. The solution is simple: the old musician refuses altogether to play on the instrument of the revolution.\u201d^(\\[20\\])\n\nRecognising at the close of his life that the reforms of capitalism that he wished to achieve could not be realised by democratic, peaceful means, Kautsky turned against his own practical policy, and just as he was in former times the proponent of a Marxian ideology which, altogether divorced from reality, could serve only its opponents, he now became the proponent of bourgeois\u00a0*laissez faire*\u00a0ideology, just as much removed from the actual conditions of the developing fascistic capitalist society, and just as much serving this society as his Marxian ideology had served the democratic stage of capitalism. \u201cPeople love today to speak disdainfully about the liberalistic economy,\u201d he wrote in his last work; \u201chowever, the theories founded by Quesnay, Adam Smith and Ricardo are not at all obsolete. In their essentials Marx had accepted their theories and developed them further, and he has never denied that the liberal freedom of commodity production constituted the best basis for its development. Marx distinguishes himself from the Classicists therein, that when the latter saw in commodity production of private producers the only possible form of production, Marx saw the highest form of commodity production leading through its own development to conditions allowing for a still better form of production, social production, where society, identical with the whole of the working population, controls the means of production, producing no longer for profit but to satisfy needs. The socialist mode of production has its own rules, in many respects different from the laws of commodity production. However, as long as commodity production prevails, it will best function if those laws of motion discovered in the era of liberalism are respected.\u201d^(\\[21\\])\n\nThese ideas are quite surprising in a man who had edited Marx\u2019s \u201cTheories of Surplus Value\u201d, a work which proved exhaustively \u201cthat Marx at no time in his life countenanced the opinion that the new contents of his socialist and communist theory could be derived, as a mere logical consequence, from the utterly bourgeois theories of Quesnay, Smith and Ricardo.^(\\[22\\])\u00a0However, this position of Kautsky\u2019s gives the necessary qualifications to our previous statement that he was an excellent pupil of Marx and Engels. He was such only to the extent that Marxism could be fitted into his own limited concepts of social development and of capitalist society. For Kautsky, the \u2018socialist society\u2019, or the logical consequence of capitalist development of commodity production, is in truth only a state-capitalist system. When once he mistook Marx\u2019s value concept as a law of socialist economics if only applied consciously instead of being left to the \u2018blind\u2019 operations of the market, Engels pointed out to him^(\\[23\\])\u00a0that for Marx, value is a strictly historical category; that neither before nor after capitalism did there exist or could there exist a value production which differed only in form from that of capitalism. And Kautsky accepted Engels\u2019 statement, as is manifested in his work \u201cThe Economic Doctrines of Karl Marx\u201d (1887), where he also saw value as a historical category. Later, however, in reaction to bourgeois criticism of socialist economic theory, he re-introduced in his book \u201cThe Proletarian Revolution and its Programme\u201d (1922) the value concept, the market and money economy, commodity production, into his scheme of a socialist society. What was once historical became eternal; Engels had talked in vain. Kautsky had returned from where he had sprung, from the\u00a0*petite-bourgeoisie*, who hate with equal force both monopoly control and socialism, and hope for a purely quantitative change of society, an enlarged reproduction of the\u00a0*status quo*, a better and bigger capitalism, a better and more comprehensive democracy \u2014 as against a capitalism climaxing in fascism or changing into communism.\n\nThe maintenance of liberal commodity production and its political expression were preferred by Kautsky to the \u2018economics\u2019 of fascism because the former system determined his long grandeur and his short misery. Just as he had shielded bourgeois democracy with Marxian phraseology, so he now obscured the fascist reality with democratic phraseology. For now, by turning their thoughts backward instead of forward, he made his followers mentally incapacitated for revolutionary action. The man who shortly before his death was driven from Berlin to Vienna by marching fascism, and from Vienna to Prague, and from Prague to Amsterdam, published in 1937 a book^(\\[24\\])\u00a0which shows explicitly that once a \u2018Marxist\u2019 makes the step from a materialistic to an idealistic concept of social development, he is sure to arrive sooner or later at that borderline of thought where idealism turns into insanity. There is a report current in Germany that when Hindenburg was watching a Nazi demonstration of storm troops he turned to a General standing beside him saying, \u201cI did not know we had taken so many Russian prisoners.\u201d Kautsky, too, in this his last book, is mentally still at \u2018Tannenberg\u2019. His work is a faithful description of the different attitudes taken by socialists and their forerunners to the question of war since the beginning of the fifteenth century up to the present time. It shows, although not to Kautsky, how ridiculous Marxism can become when it associates the proletarian with the bourgeois needs and necessities.\n\nKautsky wrote his last book, as he said, \u201cto determine which position should be taken by socialists and democrats in case a new war breaks out despite all our opposition to it.\u201d^(\\[25\\])\u00a0However, he continued, \u201cThere is no direct answer to this question before the war is actually here and we are all able to see who caused the war and for what purpose it is fought.\u201d He advocates that \u201cif war breaks out, socialists should try to maintain their unity, to bring their organisation safely through the war, so that they may reap the fruit wherever unpopular political regimes collapse. In 1914 this unity was lost and we still suffer from this calamity. But today things are much clearer than they were then; the opposition between democratic and anti-democratic states is much sharper; and it can be expected that if it comes to the new world war, all socialists will stand on the side of democracy.\u201d After the experiences of the last war and the history since then, there is no need to search for the black sheep that causes wars, nor is it a secret any longer why wars are fought. However, to pose such questions is not stupidity as one may believe. Behind this apparent na\u00efvet\u00e9 lies the determination to serve capitalism in one form by fighting capitalism in another. It serves to prepare the workers for the coming war, in exchange for the right to organise in labour organisations, vote in elections, and assemble in formations which serve both capital and capitalistic labour organisations. It is the old policy of Kautsky, which demands concessions from the bourgeoisie in exchange for millions of dead workers in the coming capitalistic battles. In reality, just as the wars of capitalism, regardless of the political differences of the participating states and the various slogans used, can only be wars for capitalist profits and wars against the working class, so, too, the war excludes the possibility of choosing between conditional or unconditional participation in the war by the workers. Rather, the war, and even the period preceding the war, will be marked by a general and complete military dictatorship in fascist and anti-fascist countries alike. The war will wipe out the last distinction between the democratic and the anti-democratic nations. And workers will serve Hitler as they served the Kaiser; they will serve Roosevelt as they served Wilson; they will die for Stalin as they died for the Tsar.\n\nKautsky was not disturbed by the reality of fascism, since for him, democracy was the natural form of capitalism. The new situation was only a sickness, a temporary insanity, a thing actually foreign to capitalism. He really believed in a war for democracy, to allow capitalism to proceed in its logical course towards a real commonwealth. And his 1937 predictions incorporated sentences like the following: \u201cThe time has arrived where it is finally possible to do away with wars as a means of solving political conflicts between the states.\u201d^(\\[26\\])\u00a0Or, \u201cThe policy of conquest of the Japanese in China, the Italians in Ethiopia, is a last echo of a passing time, the period of imperialism. More wars of such a character can hardly be expected.\u201d^(\\[27\\])\u00a0There are hundreds of similar sentences in Kautsky\u2019s book, and it seems at times that his whole world must have consisted of no more than the four walls of his library, to which he neglected to add the newest volumes on recent history. Kautsky is convinced that even without a war fascism will be defeated, the rise of democracy recur, and the period return for a peaceful development towards socialism, like the period in the days before fascism. The essential weakness of fascism he illustrated with the remark that \u201cthe personal character of the dictatorships indicates already that it limits its own existence to the length of a human life.\u201d^(\\[28\\])\u00a0He believed that after fascism there would be the return to the \u2018normal\u2019 life on an increasingly socialistic abstract democracy to continue the reforms begun in the glorious time of the social democratic coalition policy. However, it is obvious now that the only capitalistic reform objectively possible today is the fascistic reform. And as a matter of fact, the larger part of the \u2018socialisation programme\u2019 of the social democracy, which it never dared to put into practice, has meanwhile been realised by fascism. Just as the demands of the German bourgeoisie were met not in 1848 but in the ensuing period of the counter-revolution, so, too, the reform programme of the social democracy, which it could not inaugurate during the time of its own reign, was put into practice by Hitler. Thus, to mention just a few facts, not the social democracy but Hitler fulfilled the long desire of the socialists, the Anschluss of Austria; not social democracy but fascism established the wished \u2014 for state control of industry and banking; not social democracy but Hitler declared the first of May a legal holiday. A careful analysis of what the socialists actually wanted to do and never did, compared with actual policies since 1933, will reveal to any objective observer that Hitler realised no more than the programme of social democracy, but without the socialists. Like Hitler, the social democracy and Kautsky were opposed to both bolshevism and communism. Even a complete state-capitalist system as the Russian was rejected by both in favour of mere state control. And what is necessary in order to realise such a programme was not dared by the socialists but undertaken by the fascists. The anti-fascism of Kautsky illustrated no more than the fact that just as he once could not imagine that Marxist theory could be supplemented by a Marxist practice, he later could not see that a capitalist reform policy demanded a capitalist reform practice, which turned out to be the fascist practice. The life of Kautsky can teach the workers that in the struggle against fascistic capitalism is necessarily incorporated the struggle against bourgeois democracy, the struggle against Kautskyism. The life of Kautsky can, in all truth and without malicious intent, be summed up in the words: From Marx to Hitler.",

It's interesting enough and helps me to give more thought to the economic and social conditions that were going on during that important time.

Two factions of the US ruling class are at war with each other. That presents both a danger and an opportunity for our class.
