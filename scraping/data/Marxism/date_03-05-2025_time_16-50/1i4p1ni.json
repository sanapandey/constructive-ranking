Im not the brightest bulb in the box, or the sharpest knife in the drawer. \n\nI got the basic argument of capital vol 1, but there were things that go over my head greatly, but browsing this sub ive seen people recommend certain books, trying to ask these people about these books.... well they never replied lol \n\nheres one I found, Marx's Capital Illustrated: An Illustrated Introduction, is what its called, its by david smith. \n\nWhat do you guys think of this book? Id love to go back and read something like this to get refreshed with the wisdom of Karl Marx. \n\n# ",

They're basically the main points of Marxist economics in condensed form, and were indeed intended as agitational material for ordinary workers to read in reading groups.\n\nIf you want to get your teeth into historical materialism, for me, reading Engels' *Socialiasm: Utopian and Scientific* was a real eye-opener. I couldn't really fully understand the Manifesto until I'd read Socialism. Engels has a brilliant way of explaining why socialism is historically necessary, not simply explaining why it'd be \"nice\".\n\nI mean, socialism would be nice. But for Marxists that's not why we fight for socialism. We view society scientifically, not morally.",
