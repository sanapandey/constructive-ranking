    "selftext": "Marx says under capitalism entitys and subjects that belong together are separated by alienation and in a communist society these things would come back together. This is a very key concept in Marxism and it doesn't seem to me to make any sense. Why are there things that naturally should be together that aren't because of capitalis, how is that possible, I mean is it saying those things always will have needed to belong or always should have belonged and it isn't until we reach the communist stage of human history that it's realised. And as well it's supposed to be a gradual shift from capitalism to socialism to communism so no one whose living under capitalism now unless there's a world communist revolution tomorrow will ever get to not feel alienated? I feel like the big appeal of marxism is that by getting rid off capitalism this make us whole as people, that are main problems are by the explorative nature of are society but is that really just a fantasy, is being able to do what we want  to do without worrying about money is that the communist goal and nothing more than that, there's no greater guarantee other then just the freedom from exploitation?

On one hand, alienation is literally the separation of labor and product of labor, meaning the worker who creates something has that something taken from them. They have the product of their labor expropriated from them, and they are alienated from owning what they have made. Second, alienation can be read to be a feeling as well. Because laborers do not direct the use of their productive power, and often need to work and create goods that have no meaning to them, they are separated from the labor process itself. The worker is spending the majority of their time doing something they do not care about, and so they are unfulfilled. This kind of labor alienates one from their own human needs and passions.",

            "body": "So, alienation here basically refers to \"estranged labour\" which happens after our labour power is commodified and essentially  *detached* from us in a sense that is definitely ours but ultimately belongs to the Capitalist because they give us wages in return of our ability to perform labour. This in turn actually turns the worker into a commodity itself, because the labour power although belonging to the worker is ultimately evaluated based on the profits it can provide to the Capitalist. Then it is about how that estranged labour also alienates the worker from the product of his labour, the commodity. Any commodity is created after a several processes and in each process it's the workers adding value to it, even though they think they're just doing some mundane task. All that also combined with the fact that the worker creates value but doesn't gain a share in profits that the Capitalist makes. \n\n\"...This fact expresses merely that the object which labor produces \u2013 labor\u2019s product \u2013 confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labor is labor which has been embodied in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labor. Labor\u2019s realization is its objectification.....All these consequences are implied in the statement that the worker is related to the product of labor as to an alien object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful becomes the alien world of objects which he creates over and against himself, the poorer he himself \u2013 his inner world \u2013 becomes, the less belongs to him as his own....The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the more the worker lacks objects. Whatever the product of his labor is, he is not. Therefore, the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power on its own confronting him. It means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.\" \n\n\nThis alienation isn't just about worker's relationship to the product of their labour, but the process of labour itself. This is because if product of labour is alien to the worker, that alienation should be inherent to the process of labour itself. This also has to do with a worker not owning their means of production, which are the tools and resources that make it possible for products and services to be created in addition to other things, of course.\n\nMarx explains it, \n\n\"First, the fact that labor is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his intrinsic nature; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He feels at home when he is not working, and when he is working he does not feel at home. His labor is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labor. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labor is shunned like the plague. External labor, labor in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else\u2019s, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates on the individual independently of him \u2013 that is, operates as an alien, divine or diabolical activity \u2013 so is the worker\u2019s activity not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.\"\n\nThat is to say, providing your labour is also a means of sustenance for most people, we have to *earn* things that are our basic rights (such as, food and housing), which means an average worker is doing their work only because they need to. The alienation is hidden in the fact that we ought to do it and it's also relevant to us because we know many people kill their creativity, just so they can earn a skill that then allows them to earn a living wage. So, this need to earn a skill to perform some labour in order to earn a living wage seems \"divine\" in a way because it's a norm that's forced on us externally. Consider here, that's how education sector essentially works, we're spending all our childhood and youth so we can become an employable worker who can live a life where we have to earn our basic rights. We essentially work our whole lives, because we *have to*. Also, the work that we do is around 8 hours of a day and that's just ideal, sometimes people work for less and sometimes for more. The point is, these many hours a day we're performing a predominantly reluctant task and we're only humans when we come back home and do *animalistic* activities (obviously common to humans) such as eating, procreating, etc.\n\nMarx and Engels and the following Marxist philosophers have established distinctions between humans and animals, the distinctions follow our ability to labour and our ability to thought & speech. Following that and taking the ability to labour and the ability to creativity for example, we understood so far that labour is estranged from the worker both in terms of product and process, but at the same time our creativity is also deliberately crushed in order for us to be raised as workers. Generally, that means the ability for a human to be human is taken from them because of the way system works. Now, in Philosophy it is considered controversial to establish what it means to be human in rigid sense, so we're just gonna follow the simple premise that we're not meant to spend our lives making profit for a handful of people but that's what we ought to do and that's a violation of our humanity. Gy\u00f6rgy Lukacs has extended this idea of estranged labour in his theory of Reification which, very briefly, means that humans have become and also accepted their place as mere parts of machine in any given labour process and that's brought us insane amount of alienation.",

It takes into consideration that there are certain rights that people have which they shouldn't have to earn which is again, food and housing. It's pretty crucial to ease that *need* for earning our basic human rights. Secondly, Socialism is a crucial step towards changing the production relations from privatised to social. For now I believe this small paragraph does answer some questions, \n\n\"In socialist society the means of production have ceased to be capital, that is, to be a means of exploitation. In socialist society there are no longer classes with a monopoly of property in the means of production arid classes deprived of property in the means of production. In the conditions of socialism the means of production are social property. The main elements in the production process-labour-power and the means of production--are here united on a new basis, that of large-scale socialist production in both town and country. Since the means of production have ceased to be capital, there is no longer a division of accumulated labour into constant and variable capital under socialism. The whole mass of accumulated labour in society, that is, the whole mass of the means of production and the means of consumption, at the disposal of society for further production, serves the interests of the people and cannot provide a basis for exploitation.\"\n\nThis highlights the fundamental difference between the operation of a Socialist system and a Capitalist system. There is definitely more nuance to it and you can read into it. Of course, only under Communism we'll be able to actually abolish market and actually head towards the society which is kind of self governing in this context. This also included automation and many other things that I believe are kind of beyond the scope of this single comment. I'm also including a reading list that you can utilise to understand these concepts more in depth and to also back up what I said lol. Here:\n\n- Wage, Labour and Capital by Karl Marx \n- The Theory of Knowledge by Maurice Corthforth\n- The Part Played by Labour in Transitioning from Humans to Apes by Friedrich Engels \n- The Socialist Mode of Production, Textbook of Political Economy by Economics Institute of Academic Science of USSR \n- Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat, History and Class Consciousness by Gy\u00f6rgy Lukacs \n\nI hope this helps \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

            "body": "I won't adress the forms of alienation since other commenters have done that quite well. I will address some\u00a0other points you made.\n\nOn your point of alienation and communism, I'm not sure that Marx states that alienation will end if communism is attained. Alienation is a symptom that Marx describes from the conditions of capitalism, since it is capitalism he criticizes. This means that alienation can exist in other forms of production, but perhaps in different forms. The essence of alienation, in my opinion, is that we as humans belong to each other, we are social beings, therefore a system like capitalism, which rejects this and nurtures competition and strife, causes a friction between humans and that is what drives alienation. We feel anger, resentment, hatred for other people, rather than the system that breeds this hatred. This can, for example, be seen in pretty any society that isn't necessarily capitalist: In ancient Rome, there were Romans and barbarians, senators and plebians and other forms of nobility; in feudal society, there were different noble families and religious wars, royal houses and kingdoms. These all breed forms of alienation by separating humans and manufacturing strife and struggle. It could be possible that a slave in Rome felt hatred toward the barbarians in Gaul, even though he's directly exploited by his owner, and not some warrior in old Germania, but that hatred is irrational regardless.\n\nAnd your point on the appeal of Marxism is reductionist. The appeal of Marxism is very different for very different people. I would recommend that you read, not only Marx himself to see what he says, but also some anarchists like Errico Malatesta. Why anarchists? Because they address your problem directly, namely the idea that the establishment of communism will automatically make us as a people \"whole\". Malatesta understood that this was very utopian and not possible. And in your post there is a direct opposition to Marx.",

            "body": "I think the most important aspect of the idea that Marx was trying to convey was the loss of control over our lives that the structure of capitalism imposes on society.\n\nMost people have no influence over the rules of society since the wealth and power that the structure of capitalism gives to the capitalist class allows them to have the most influence by far on this. Thus, anything like meaningful democracy is impossible under capitalism.\n\nAnother important thing is how the system forces people to prioritize competition over cooperation with others. This makes satisfying personal relationships with others difficult. If encourages individualism, mistrust of others and focus on the self over community.\n\nSomething I think is at the root of a lot of mental illness since we probably evolved to be inclined to focus on community over self given our physical limitations compared to other animals in gathering resources needed for survival. Early humans had to work together to survive thus our evolved human nature reflects that.\n\nCapitalist society hostility to community is the primary cause of the mental disorders of depression and anxiety that are so common today for one but I am sure many other stress related human health problems as well.\n\nCommunism is basically about returning us to the social conditions we evolved in but with all the benefits of modern technology with humanity's advancement and learning gained under the centuries of class society.",
