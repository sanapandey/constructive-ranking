    "selftext": "H\u00f6lderlin, although deeply influenced by Romanticism and idealism, expressed in his work a concern for the alienation of modern humanity and admiration for the French Revolution. I wonder if, from a Marxist perspective, we could find common ground with his ideas or if it is possible to interpret H\u00f6lderlin through a Marxist lens.\n",
