    "selftext": "Hello! I'm in a period of reflection and learning and would like to ask people's opinions on this take about Marxism. It's from this essay [*\"What Is Conservatism and What Is Wrong with It?\"*](https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/agre/conservatism.html) by the reclusive computer science professor, Philip Agre (note link's http, not https so be advised your browser won't like it. I will quote the part I am asking about below).  \nAgre's seen as a sort of tech prophet, who predicted many of the social problems of the internet, AI, and big data. I don't know about all that, but I do really like the beginning of the essay, the part about how conservatism functions, though it is decidedly liberal. I am less sure about his recommendations for the left in the fight for free society. At some point he says:\n\n\"\\* Ditch Marx\n\nPost-sixties, many liberals consider themselves to be watered-down Marxists. They subscribe to a left-to-right spectrum model of politics in which they, as democrats, are located in some hard-to-identify place sort-of-somewhat-to-the-left-of-center, whereas the Marxists have the high ground of a clear and definite location at the end of the spectrum. These liberals would be further out on the left if they could find a politically viable way to do it. Conservative rhetors concur with this model, and indiscriminately calling liberals communists is back in style. This is all nonsense. Marxism is not located anywhere on a spectrum. It is just mistaken. It fails to describe the real world. Attempts to implement it simply created an ugly and shallow imitation of conservatism at its worst. Democracy is the right way to live, and conservatism is the wrong way.\n\nMarx was a brilliant analyst for his time. His analysis of technology's role in the economy was wholly original. He was the first to analyze the structural dynamism of a capitalist economy. But his theory of modern society was superficial. It overgeneralized from the situation of its time: the recent discovery of economies of scale, crude market institutions, no modern separation of ownership and control, and a small middle class. Marx followed the political economy of his day in analyzing markets as essentially independent of the state. But this is not remotely the case.\n\nOne difficulty with Marx, which is the topic of a vast literature, is that his theory requires a periodization of history that does not correspond to historical reality. Capitalism, for example, is supposed to be a discrete totality, but claimed starting dates for this totality range across a good four hundred years. His economistic analysis of society, though indisputably productive in the way that many powerfully wrong ideas are, makes history seem more discontinuous than it is. In fact, the relationship between conservatism and democracy is more or less constant throughout thousands of years of history. One evidence of this, for example, is Orlando Patterson's stunning discovery that Western notions of freedom were invented by former slaves in the ancient world and have remained more or less constant ever since.\n\nIn economic terms, Marx's theory is mistaken because he did not analyze the role the capitalist plays as entrepreneur. The entrepreneur does an important and distinctive type of work in inventing new ways to bring together diverse factors of production. Now in fact the nature of this work has remained largely hidden throughout history for a wide variety of reasons. Because Marx had no notion of it, the capitalist's profit seemed to him simple theft. It does not follow, though, that entrepreneurs earn all of their money. The theories of mainstream economics notwithstanding, serious how-to manuals for entrepreneurs are quite clear that the entrepreneur is trying to identify a market failure, because market failures are how you make money. The relationship between entrepreneurship and the state is much more complicated than economics has even tried to theorize. Capitalists, moreover, are not a class. Particular networks of capitalists and other well-off or otherwise connected personages may well try to constitute themselves as an aristocracy, but this is a phenomenon with several more dimensions than just economics.\n\nNor is Marxism of any use as politics. All that Marx offered to people who worked in deadening factory jobs was that they could take over the factory. While unions and collective bargaining exist in many contexts for good economic reasons, they are an essentially medieval system of negotiations among orders and classes. They presuppose a generally static economy and society. They are irrelevant to knowledge-intensive forms of work. Nor do they provide any kind of foundation for democratic politics. People want their kids to be professionals, not factory workers, and democracy helps people to knit themselves into the complicated set of institutions that enable people to build unique and productive lives.\"\n\nPlease kindly share your thoughts on this. I hope it will help strengthen our movement one way or another. Thank you for your time.",

            "body": "This critique strikes me as very generalized and highly ill informed. I don't think the author has read much Marx.\n\n>Capitalism, for example, is supposed to be a discrete totality, but claimed starting dates for this totality range across a good four hundred years.\n\nSo? Capitalist society is a complicated and evolving affair. If it were not a historical development, the author would have a point but claiming that it evolves over a few hundred isn't very interesting as a critique.\n\n>The entrepreneur does an important and distinctive type of work in inventing new ways to bring together diverse factors of production.\n\nThe capitalist in Marx's account is a very hard working person. He is constantly trying to figure out how to extract and realize  more surplus value and that involves finding commodities which are in demand. Big deal.\n\n>Because Marx had no notion of it, the capitalist's profit seemed to him simple theft.\n\nThis is dead wrong. In Capital, Marx explicitly argues against the idea that profit is theft. The worker is paid the full value of the commodity which she sells, labor power. The worker is, however, coerced into working harder and longer than is necessary to compensate her. This is the source of capitalist profit at a societal level. That means that in a capitalist society, the working class must be undemocratically disciplined. The author makes no argument against that point, nor does the author provide an alternate theory of how profit occurs. (Neoclassical economics actually has no such alternate account of profit either.)\n\n>Nor is Marxism of any use as politics. All that Marx offered to people who worked in deadening factory jobs was that they could take over the factory.\n\nMarx's point here is that political change originates in class struggle waged from below, and because capitalism is international and undemocratic, it can be replaced with a more international and democratic mode of production, i.e., socialism. If there is a more plausible understanding of politics than the one offered by historical materialism, I would like to see it. The author provides none.\n\n>While unions and collective bargaining exist in many contexts for good economic reasons, they are an essentially medieval system of negotiations among orders and classes. They presuppose a generally static economy and society.\n\nThis is a very typical kind of attitude expressed by professionals. They often feel like they are not really workers and that they are better than unionized workers. (Anyone who has been involved in trying to organize graduate student workers experiences this classist rubbish first hand. They think they're magical because they went to college.) In reality, labor rights are part of international human rights law, and professionals sell their labor power just like all other workers. There is no reason why a vibrant labor movement could not take off among professionals. There is nothing especially \"medieval\" about workplace democracy.",

                            "body": "Sure. So let's consider an average worker in a capitalist workplace. Each day that worker contributes to the creation of a certain amount of wealth for their employer; in exchange for doing this work, the employer pays the worker wages. At a certain point in the average work day, the worker has generated enough wealth for their employer that the employer is able to cover the wages which the worker is paid. The worker is not allowed to go home at this point because the work day is not completed. A worker might wonder, though, why they still have to continue work past this point? The answer is that that is the part of the day during which the worker produces wealth that becomes the capitalist's profit. Marx calls this absolute surplus value. Alternately, a capitalist may pressure workers to speed up production. Marx calls this relative surplus value.\n\nQuick examples of these. The first job I had was as a warehouse picker: customers would place orders for products, and my job was to walk around a warehouse and pull the ordered commodities off the shelves, put them in a basket, and send them out to the trucks that would deliver them. I was paid $80 a day for this. At a certain point in the day (let's say 4 hours), I would have processed enough orders for my employer to earn the $80 they paid me as well as contributing to the other expenses of keeping the business going (electricity, rent, equipment, etc.). The remaining 4 hours of my work day was pure profit for my employer. The management in the warehouse would also begin each work day by screaming at the employees telling us that we were taking too long to process the orders. At one point, they actually brought in some model employees who we were supposed to emulate. Those employers were actually running (while we were walking) to pick up our orders. If one running employee was doing the work of 1.5 walking employees, but still getting paid the same wages as the walking employee, the running employee was generating more relative surplus value for our employer. The union, of course, was fighting this pressure to speed up. So what Marx is explaining is the pressure on capitalist workers to be more productive.\n\nIn the terminology of volume 1 of Capital: all commodities in a capitalist society have a value which is the center or gravity for their price (or the equivalent of the commodity's equilibrium price). This value is the socially necessary labor time which is required to produce that commodity, and it is measured monetarily (with a price). Workers sell a commodity--labor power--to their employer. Because labor power is commodified in a capitalist society, labor power also has a value and a price. The value of labor power is again the socially necessary labor time required to reproduce the worker for another day of labor. This would cover the labor time that goes into feeding and sheltering the worker. (In the case of skilled labor, this would also have to include the time required to train the worker.) Wages are the price of this commodity labor power. During a certain point in the work day, a worker has produced an amount of value for their employer which is equivalent to their wages. This part of the workday Marx labels \"necessary labor time.\" The capitalist employment contract requires workers to work beyond this point, a part of the work day which Marx labels \"surplus labor time.\" This surplus labor time is the part of the work day in which workers produce surplus value which is owned by the capitalist and which becomes profit when the capitalist successfully sells it.\n\nIn this exchange, workers are paid the full value of the commodity they sell, but they are coerced by the nature of the labor market (competition with other workers for scarce jobs which the workers need to survive) to work this surplus labor time even though they personally get nothing in return for this time. From a worker's perspective, this is a waste of their lives, but from a capitalist's perspective, it is the point of hiring workers to begin with. This difference in perspective between worker and capitalist explains why class struggle occurs.",

For example, say a worker works 8 hours a day making chairs, gets paid 80 dollars a day. He takes 4 hours to make a chair and a chair sells for 80 dollars. Evidently then, the next 4 hours he spends in his day making one more chair are just used to make a profit for the owner, as the worker won\u2019t be paid more for the other 80 dollar worth chair. These other 80 dollars will be converted into profit for the owner, so isn\u2019t the profit the theft part, because the owner is not giving back the value the worker produced? Or is the \u201cprofit\u201d simply a term to describe an amount of money, and the \u201ctheft\u201d itself is the extraction of surplus value?

It looks like you see the basics of his argument about the length of the capitalist work day, though.\n\n>so isn\u2019t the profit the theft part, because the owner is not giving back the value the worker produced?\n\nMarx occasionally lapses into speaking about \"theft,\" and he does refer to the labor performed during the surplus labor period as \"unpaid labor,\" but his argument as a whole is really pushing against the idea that exploitation is theft. If you look carefully at his analysis, it's framed in terms of differences of perspective and the disciplining of the working class as a whole, which, I think, is a much more interesting way to think about this.\n\nMarx assumes that in a capitalist society, commodities are exchanged at their values, so technically no one--workers included--are being robbed or ripped off. It's this that provides the surface-level impression that capitalist labor, unlike the labor of a chattel slave, is fair: workers voluntarily sell a commodity (labor power), and workers receive in exchange the full value of that commodity (wages). If it were highway robbery--in the way chattel slavery was--it would likely be much easier to abolish this relationship. Instead, it all looks fair and consensual. \n\nBut when examined more closely, there is a secret, underlying power structure which is presupposed by the capitalist employment contract, and without it, profit cannot occur: the working class as a whole is structurally dependent upon the capitalist class, and the working class is fragmented by competition for scarce jobs. (A lot of the second half of Vol 1 of Capital focuses on this.) \n\nThis relationship entails that workers have no meaningful alternative but to work surplus labor time. Instead of focusing on the alleged moral crime of \"theft\" (which would presuppose a moral argument about natural property rights), Marx is making a point about capitalist society: capitalism is production for profit, and profit requires surplus labor time, but workers have no reason to work surplus labor time, so workers must be forced to work surplus labor time, and since workers are technically \"free,\" that compulsion must operate secretly through the labor market and through the political dynamics of capitalist society which all ensure that workers are kept structurally dependent upon employers. This ultimately builds to an argument that capitalism and democracy--understood as the empowerment of the people--are incompatible. Personally, I think this is a much more interesting line of thought than the moral condemnation of profit as theft. Socialists before Marx had been making criticisms of the immorality of profit, but Marx opens up a political analysis of why it is such a struggle to achieve reforms which improve the lives of workers within capitalism. Those reforms threaten capital's ability to coerce workers into performing surplus labor time. For society to deal openly and democratically with the length and intensity of the workday, it would have to become socialist.",

They\u2019ve never read marx quite clearly. \n\nCapitalists constitute a class, any political economist who thinks otherwise should be laughed at. You can very easily see this relationship during any time of struggle whether small (Union work and how liberals bust them despite posing as left wing) or large (revolutionary situations that happen every year where the capitalists send in their goods to massacre proles). Class relations are obscured to the liberal who has no or poor structural analysis and thinks that Marxism is mechanistic. Entrepreneurs being compensated for fixing market failures is also laughable, capitalism creates market failures and entrepreneurs exacerbate them through the profit motive - this causes crisis! The Great Depression, 2008 financial crisis, what is the liberals answer to this!? \n\nThe political criticism paragraph is really bizarre. Dead factory jobs still exist, as does horrid working class jobs whether white collar or blue collar. Exploitation still exists. Ask the people in Bangladesh whether they enjoy slaving for 12 hours a day in sweatshops. Ask your local construction worker or mechanic whether they like breaking their back for the boss\u2019s profits. Marx did not \u201coffer\u201d to people the idea of taking over their factory, that comes completely independent of Marxism and is a historically motive tendency of the working class. We see this time and time again with every revolutionary situation. It\u2019s hardly a static situation as the writer makes it out to be but a class centred analysis of political forces acting in their interest. The author is arguing for class collaboration along technocratic \u201cknowledge intensive\u201d grounds which is basically having enlightened political agents run everything to keep workers and capitalists happy. Notable examples of this throughout history include bankrupt social democracies that don\u2019t last very long and fascism. It ignores that their interests are counterposed. You can look at a graph of wages vs profits in any country to see this fact demonstrated quite easily (or - the share of economic income/gdp distributed between profits and wages). When workers get wins bosses suffer and likewise the opposite is true. Profits come from workers labour - as does all value, this is the core of Marx\u2019s political economy from his manuscript Kapital. Marx also is a revolutionary and offers a revolutionary method of change based on a dictatorship of the proletariat over the capitalists and middle class (a democracy for workers is a dictatorship for everyone else and vice versa) not just \u201ctaking over your factory\u201d. Their critiques of democracy are similarly flawed. A capitalist run society and state is not democratic for workers, it\u2019s a dictatorship over workers. Similar to how Athens was a \u201cdemocracy\u201d for the slave owning middle and upper classes. Or america\u2026 Them trying to use the concept of bourgeoise democracy and back it up with \u201cwhat slaves want\u201d is absolutely absurd - ask all the real life slaves of these bourgeoise democracies (England, America, France, Spain) what they thought of them. This person has never read marx. \n\nThe whole essay is rank technocratic liberalism and should not be considered left wing at all.",
