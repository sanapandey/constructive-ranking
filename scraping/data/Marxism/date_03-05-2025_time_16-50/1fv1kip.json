It cannot be denied that we all started the road towards Marxism because people were right to be against the injustice of the current system but due to the lack of theoretical background, our views are still clouded by 'moralism' instead of being more objective similar to how natural scientists do in their research, which is understandable considering that when it comes to examining and analysing human lives, it can't be helped to get caught up in the sauce. While I more or less get the basics of being against moralism, which work specifically tackles this topic in depth in order to prevent marxists from veering to idealism? ",

The introduction defends the use of the word materialism from the opposition of \"British respectability.\" It goes into detail of its philosophical origins. Chapter 2 explains Hegel's contribution to the methodology, and how it paved the way to establishing socialism on firm historical ground, not just on depending on the goodness of people's hearts.",

Der Volks-Tribun was produced and distributed in New York, with the aim of representing the principles of the International Workingmen\u2019s Association (now widely referred to as \u201cThe First International\u201d) to communists in the United States. Under Kriege\u2019s tenure as editor, the line of the journal began to deviate away from scientific communism and towards utopianism and moralism, making irrational appeals to emotion in order to convince readers to take up the cause of communism. Finally, the editorial line of Der Volks-Tribun veered so sharply away from the principles of the organization it was supposed to represent, that Marx and Engels introduced a set of resolutions to a meeting of the First International, denouncing Kriege for what they referred to as the \u201cfantastic emotionalism\u201d he put forward under the guise of communism. These resolutions constitute the aforementioned circular. \n\nA particularly important piece of evidence in their case against Kriege is Kriege\u2019s enthusiastic promotion of self-sacrifice as a value for communists (\u201cCircular Against Kriege\u201d, MECW 6:45). Instead of arguing for the coincidence of every person\u2019s self-interest with the interest of humanity, Kriege posits a moral sacrifice of setting one\u2019s own interests aside for the good of \u201cothers\u201d who will benefit from a transition to socialism. This notion of sacrifice, of setting one\u2019s own interests aside, is totally at odds with Marxism, which argues that all human beings have an objective interest in the realization of a communist society. Kriege argues for communism not as an answer to the problems that are facing human beings, but rather as a moral imperative to be realized out of a sense of one\u2019s duty to humanity. It does precisely what, as we saw in the previous chapter, critics such as Max Stirner accused communism of doing\u2014it posits \u201cthe common good,\u201d or \u201chumanity\u201d as an abstraction that demands sacrifices from real, concrete, human individuals, and thereby only replicates alienation in a different form, rather than abolishing it. \n\nThe argument becomes yet clearer when Marx and Engels strike their final blow against the \u201csacrificing\u201d Kriege (\u201cCircular Against Kriege\u201d, MECW 6:49). Marx criticizes Kriege because he expects to be praised for sacrificing himself for the good of others, instead of seeing revolutionary activity as something that he carries out for his own benefit as well as that of others. As Kriege writes to the reader of Der Volks-Tribun, \u201cWe have other things to do than worry about our miserable selves, we belong to mankind.\u201d\n\u2026\nMarx and Engels accuse Kriege of misrepresenting communism as \u201ca religion of love\u201d (\u201cCircular Against Kriege\u201d, MECW 6:46), rather than presenting it as a science of human progress and development, because to follow Kriege\u2019s reasoning would be essentially to take up a religious attitude towards humanity as a new god rendered into pseudo-materialist terms. We do not \u201cbelong to mankind,\u201d to which we must constantly sacrifice our individual self-interest. One should be \u201cworried about oneself\u201d\u2014it is in fact this concern with oneself and one\u2019s own circumstances that can be linked together with an argument for rational social control over society\u2019s resources. There is no need for a moral leap across some perceived gap between one\u2019s self-interest and the general interest of society.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s kind of an appeal to an end without considering the means in relation to ones self.\nAlthough I disagree Marxism as analysis is empty of ethical content and Marx\u2019s crotique of moralism are for their abstractness rather than the independence of objectivity/science.\n\nhttps://ilyenkovfriends.org/2021/09/21/zaira-rodriguez-ugidos/\nAbove os a sunmary of an author who states who such a separation presupposes the other pole.",

Marxist materialism is historically based, which means it is grounded in an analysis of what has come before, but also (and necessarily) that it shifts to accommodate new historical data. In one sense, and by its own logic, any Marxist text is valid only at the moment of inscription. Marx rejects the transcendent capital-t Truth of \u2018morality\u2019 as an idealist fiction, no doubt, but Marxism does not rule out ethics, nor does it require an empathy bypass. \u2018Objectivity\u2019 is a bit like \u2018rationality\u2019 or \u2018reason\u2019 \u2014 obviously we do not dispense with these entirely, but neither do we embrace a 19th century scientistic positivism (and neither did Marx).\n\nMore importantly, what the intervening years have taught us is that never has there been an instrument more promiscuous than \u2018reason.\u2019 Objective self-interest might be called a form of instrumental reason, maybe its primary form, so it\u2019s useful to remember how slippery some of this becomes when unmoored from a historical, dialectical, and materialist context.",

He achieves success in this device through recourse to formal analogies. To him czarism and Bolshevism are twins. Twins are likewise discovered in fascism and communism. An inventory is compiled of the common features in Catholicism \u2013 or more specifically, Jesuitism \u2013 and Bolshevism. Hitler and Mussolini, utilizing from their side exactly the same method, disclose that liberalism, democracy, and Bolshevism represent merely different manifestations of one and the same evil. The conception that Stalinism and Trotskyism are \u201cessentially\u201d one and the same now enjoys the joint approval of liberals, democrats, devout Catholics, idealists, pragmatists, and anarchists. If the Stalinists are unable to adhere to this \u201cPeople\u2019s Front\u201d, then it is only because they are accidentally occupied with the extermination of Trotskyists.\n\n> The fundamental feature of these\u00a0*approchements*\u00a0and similitudes lies in their completely ignoring the material foundation of the various currents, that is, their class nature and by that token their objective historical role. Instead they evaluate and classify different currents according to some external and secondary manifestation, most often according to their relation to one or another abstract principle which for the given classifier has a special professional value. Thus to the Roman pope Freemasons and Darwinists, Marxists and anarchists are twins because all of them sacrilegiously deny the immaculate conception. To Hitler, liberalism and Marxism are twins because they ignore \u201cblood and honor\u201d. To a democrat, fascism and Bolshevism are twins because they do not bow before universal suffrage.
