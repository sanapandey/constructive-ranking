Best way to learn (for me, personally) is to sketch stuff, so I've tried to somehow illustrate dialectics via the following [picture](https://postimg.cc/svzpT5WX).\n\nFrom what I read about it, it seems like there is motion, for Socrates, it's argumentation, for Hegel it's thinking about an idea, and for Marx it's material processes. We can move from thesis to antithesis and vice versa, for Hegel, it's the idea and it's opposite, for Marx it may be, for example dictatorship of one class and dictatorship of another class. This is happening until we collect enough information or the material conditions become adequate for synthesis (for Hegel) or revolution (for Marx). After which, this state becomes the new thesis and the process continues.\n\nIs my understanding correct? Does the sketch represent the idea well? And if not, what am I missing?",

Likewise, through the fruit, the blossom itself may be declared to be a false existence of the plant, since the fruit emerges as the blossom\u2019s truth as it comes to replace the blossom itself. These forms are not only distinguished from each other, but, as incompatible with each other, they also supplant each other. However, at the same time their fluid nature makes them into moments of an organic unity in which they are not only not in conflict with each other, but rather, one is equally as necessary as the other, and it is this equal necessity which alone constitutes the life of the whole. However, in part, contradiction with regard to a philosophical system does not usually comprehend itself in this way, and, in part, the consciousness which apprehends the contradiction generally neither knows how to free the contradiction from its one-sidedness, nor how to sustain it as free-standing. Nor, when it seems to be in the shape of a struggle against itself, does it generally take cognizance of the moments as reciprocally necessary.\"\n\n\n\u00a0(Hegel, Phenomenology of Spirit, pg 2)\u00a0\n\n\nDialectics is the idea that things are not static, that they become, and that they do so because of internal contradiction, not external opposition.\u00a0\n\n\nFor Hegel dialectics is not thinking about an idea, it is more how an idea comes to be incarnated in human activity.\n\n\nAlso, it is much more helpful to discard the thesis-antithesis-synthesis formula in favor of: Idea--Its negation--The negation of the negation. The negation of the negation of the idea is not the original idea but something new. The negation of the seed is the sprout, and the negation of the sprout is the bud. The seed contains its own self-negation. We can certainly denote different stages in social development, but we might get into trouble if we assume a teleology with a specific end point, like that of a plant. Indeed whats special about humans for Hegel and Marx is an open endedness to our nature, or in other words, freedom.\n\n\n\"Synthesis\" implies some sort of successful mediation between opposing concepts that resolves contradiction. But ideas always contain their opposite and there is no end to becoming.\n\n\nCollecting information is not the same as the working out of a societal idea. \"Idea\" is a social practice for Hegel, distinct from mere mental concept that could be factually right or wrong. Ideas are lived as social reality, and they are ascertainable through observing human activity, which for Hegel is ideological expression.\u00a0\n\n\nMarx wants to emphasize the material conditions that give rise to and limit the expression/practice of ideology.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is my best amateur Hegel gloss, hope it helps!\u00a0",

            "body": "I think u/UrememberFrank has a good answer with respect to Hegel\u2019s dialectics, but not so good with respect to Marx\u2019s.\n\nHegel believes that the rationalism of his mind doesn\u2019t just reflect the real truth, but *is* the real truth; it\u2019s not bud to blossom to fruit because that\u2019s the best way we can cognize the multiplicity of processes and changes undergone in the lifespan of a plant, instead, the multiplicity of processes and changes are all unnecessary garnish on the real movement from bud to blossom to fruit. In other words, Hegel believes that the Idea is the real thing and that all other facts must conform to the rationalism of its self-creation. Marx, on the other hand, did not believe that the Idea was real\u2014he thought it was an idea (small \u201ci\u201d). Because of that, instead of the only important thing in philosophy being the theoretical attitude (or the concept of a detached, objective rationalism), *practice* and sensuous-subjectivity (or the way people come to view things and why) took on a newfound importance for him.\n\nTo zoom out, that realization was significant for young Marx because his main concern was the idea of dispelling false and historically-determined narratives about the world. For Hegel, the family came down from heaven and expressed itself through the medium of human beings; for Marx, the family was something created through constant reciprocal activity\u2014between husband and wife, between wife and husband, between son and father, between father and son, between sister and society, between society and sister, etc., etc.\u2014and that practice and subsequent sensuous-subjectivity was so essential to their lives to make them to say, \u201cMy family must reflect the holy family; it must reflect what God intended for me, and what is right and highest in this world.\u201d The idea that people create \u201cfalse idols\u201d (opiums of the oppressed, so to speak), but more importantly that they create the truth about those false idols, were facts of original interest to Marx.\n\nSo, to recapitulate, Hegel believed that there was an intangible ether whose internal struggle created everything, and that this ether could be known infallibly via rational and objective interpretation of it. Marx believed that there was no such ether, and, in general, abandoned these orthodox ontological questions of space and time in favor of the struggle between humans to build the world that they live in, the struggle between humans and the world, and the struggle between humans and themselves. His dialectics and materialism were thus no longer merely philosophical or theoretical, they constituted a historical-materialism.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty complicated shift and there are many, many people who are avowedly Marxists or anti-Marxists who don\u2019t really understand it. Still, it\u2019s completely possible to get it. One figure I didn\u2019t mention for the sake of being succinct but who is very relevant to this chapter in dialectics is Feuerbach, whom Marx and Engels were originally followers of, but then became harsh critics of (Feuerbach himself underwent the same with regard to Hegel).",

            "body": "Frankly, dialects to me is a hugely interesting subject but a bit of a hot mess and not simply reducable to a sketch, as it varied considerably depending on a given theorist or philosopher's conception. It's notoriously overused as well, and for these reasons I prefer to be rather prudent with making dialectical claims. I think I actually don't know enough to authoritatively speak about it.\n\nRather than as one dimensional thesis-antithesis-synthesis sketch, I think of it as having differerent conceptions. On the one hand, there is dialectics as something metaphysical. For Hegel, dialectics is not just thinking about an idea, it is a metaphysical logic by which history develops and unfolds. It's a gigantic claim to make.\n\nOn the other hand, there are people who like to think of it more as a method rather than something which is metaphysically manifested. I think there certainly are Marxists who subscribe to a metaphysical reading of some kind, given Hegel's undeniable influence on Marx, but there's also plenty of Marxists who prefer the more modest epistemic view. And then there are analytical Marxists who kind of just don't bother with it at all.\n\nThere are plenty of good secondary books about this. Particularly as a method for Marx, Ollman's *dance of the dialectic* is a great read. Haymarket books also has a number of books on the relationship between Hegel's Logic and Marx's Capital.  There is also a book which contains lectures from Adorno on the topic but I've heard those are not the most accessible.\n\nThe podcast What's Left of Philosophy has a number of episodes on dialectics and the role they play in the work of different philosopers but some of them are behind a Patreon wall.",

            "body": "No one has mentioned some key aspects of DM (dialectal materialism). Engels identified 3: transformation of quantity into quality; the interpenetration of opposites; and the negation of the negation. \nThere are examples in nature, one is a seed. With a quantity of water and nutrients, a seed becomes a sprout (qualitative change). Growth of the sprout then eventually produces a leaf and so on. \nFor societal transformation, we see it when a number of people get woke to socialism. Revolutionary elements emerge only after a critical mass is reached. \nRevolution doesn\u2019t happen because we wish for it. Or by posting guillotine memes or saying \u201cEat the Rich\u201d over and over. That\u2019s not going to develop working class consciousness. Organize, educate, strengthen local affinity groups. \nBring the quantity and the quality follows.",
