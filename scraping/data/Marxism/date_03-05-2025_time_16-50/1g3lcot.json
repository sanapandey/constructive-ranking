    "selftext": "Should I be opposed to welfare?\n\nHaving read the communist manifesto, Marx states that the fall of the bourgeoisie will be due to their inability to support the lives of the proletariat as the proletariat sink deeper into poverty. In which case, shouldn\u2019t Marxist organisations be opposed to welfare, as this simply reduces the alienation of the proletariat from the bourgeoisie? At the same time, I do not understand how an organisation claiming to represent the interests of the working class could oppose things like universal healthcare and other workers rights. Can anyone explain this to me? ",

He described the ways capitalism functioned and the contradictions it caused in his time. There were instances where he did favour accelationism, such as in the fact he supported free trade over protectionism. \n\nHowever, when it came to matters of aiding the working class, he was in favour of what ever you could get. He supported public education for children and a few other things like that in The French Worker\u2019s Party Program.",

We will struggle, but winning is the subjective question - socialism or fascism are the ultimate options for capitalism. So things being bad won\u2019t magically make workers able to run society collectively.\n\nI think as Marxists our only job is to help facilitate the self-liberation of the working class. Welfare does not hider working class ability to develop class consciousness, independent politics, or organization. In fact struggle for welfare can help us build consciousness and organization\u2026 welfare existing also take the pressure off of workers in terms of losing jobs. More people will fight against bad work policies if being fired is less of an immediate economic threat.",

However, the fight for reforms *can* bring us closer to a revolution.\n\nMarxists view reform struggles as a form of training, practice and education for the working class. The purpose of fighting for welfare, or better housing, or opposing this or that racist cop, is to get workers interested in fighting for their interests. In the process, workers (including us!) organize, learn who our real enemies are, and get practiced in building movements, holding democratic spaces, and winning struggles against the bosses.\n\nIt is a mistake to think that there is any level of misery which people can't tolerate. While it is true that in times of crisis, people fight back, they only do so if they believe that there is a possibility for the fight to succeed. When a revolutionary crisis does eventually break out (and it will), we will want to be as practiced as possible in fighting the capitalists over hundreds, ideally thousands, of different reform struggles. That is the only way we will have a chance of actually winning a revolution.\n\nSo in summary, we should always support any reforms that make life better for workers. But more than that, we need to argue that they have to be fought for.",

I believe that when he cited \u201ceach according to\u201d he was in fact referring to automation and abundance. Welfare is the right idea but we need to raise the floor, include ALL the basics. Every child born should have a genuine option to live a stable, ascetic minimalist lifestyle without trading time for money in a free market economy. Those who want more can go compete. Many will.
