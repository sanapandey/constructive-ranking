    "selftext": "I was having this debate with some american liberals on Instagram, of how cancel culture is a way of turning structural elements into personal and moral behaviours. And it's convenient to capitalism, because it doesn't contest itself. It's like boycotting big companies.\n\nAnd the fact that those actions can't talk beyond the financial support proves how limited this perspective is.\n\nExample: is easier to \"cancel\" a Hollywood actor with problematic behaviour than to call out the whole economic system that allows this. \n\nDon't get me wrong, of course bad behaviour should be punished. But it shouldn't be treated simply as \"bad apples\"\n\nEdit: I'm not using liberal as a democrats synonym/opposition to republican. But rather in the wider meaning of it.",

They can't raise the minimum wage, expand the right to unionize, or do any of the staple new deal liberal reforms anymore, so they cling to identity politics as the only lever they can push to distinguish themselves from the right.\n\nThe above influences Capital, which sees diversity politics as an opportunity to appeal to an increasingly diverse consumer base. They don't care about racism, sexism or homophobia. It's just that their predictive models have determined that it is more profitable to appeal to these issues than not. \n\nThe above is then interpreted by the masses of 'middle American whites' as a betrayal of an unspoken covenant between them and capital. Americans,  especially white Americans have for decades been propagandized to embrace their identity as consumers first and foremost. Every facet of American society is built to maximize consumer satisfaction above all else to protect capital. Why care about how you're treated for 8 hours of your day when, for the remaining 16 hours, Wal-Mart, Olive Garden, and Disney treat you like a feudal lord? \n\nBecause these white masses have been systematically spoiled for their entire lives, they have grown to see any attempt by capital to cater to anyone but them as a direct threat and affront to their identity. However, since the whites are also raised to worship at the shrine of capitalism, and capitalism can do no wrong, they have to concot a conspiracy between liberals and the professional managerial to marginalize them and them specifically. In this way, the MAGA movement is the ultimate attempt for the whites to speak to Capitalism's manager.",

Cancel culture in this case is a tool of domination of the employer class to maintain its power by scrutinizing the employee class.\n\n Human resources also play a role in this. They are the definition of a class traitor: employees, but who always side with the employer whenever there is an employee-employer conflict. The role of HR is to protect the interests of the capitalist class by enforcing a strict set of rules of conduct of behavior in the workplace in order to benefit the profit motive so that as much surplus-value can be extracted from the workers as possible (for example, the rule that it's impolite to talk about your salary with your co-workers). If the working class does not obey the rules created by the bourgeoise and enforced by the HR police, they get 'cancelled' and lose their job.",

Instead there are media industries which confer rewards of social and actual capital to individuals which are always precarious and in flux. When people use that term, usually they mean media industries might pay less attention or appearance fees to an individual ostensibly because of ideological motives, but the motives aren't really ideological. They're usually based on those entities own audience research and their fears about their own bottom line. Today a lot of audience research is done by \"social listening\" where advertisers and media companies scour social media for sentiments toward a person or product and since media industries must limit risk to be successful, they are prone to act aggressively to limit their exposure. Liberals have had more influence due to their connections to media industries, but today we already see them shifting the paradigm to accommodate a more conservative audience and taking up the \"free speech\" line of argument because the regulatory bodies in the administrative state say that's what they favor. So the \"cancellation\" will just shift in the other direction, but it's still mostly about media companies and brands limiting risk insofar as it exists at all. Most people who were \"cancelled\" were in fact not and just had to migrate to different venues and audiences.",

I think of it as a component of technocratic authoritarianism, in which one's public and private speech is subjected to surveillance and discipline by a dynamic between the public and bureaucratic management. It's a sincere authoritarianism, in the sense that people who cancel often believe they are acting on behalf of the public good. But it also performs the functions of a) making institutions less liable for their employees' actions in a time of declining institutional legitimacy and b) disciplining a workforce through unspoken rules. \n\nBut what does that have to do with Marx? It might not have a direct relationship to the commodity fetish, the relationship between technological development and wages, and the more specific aspects of how he described life under capital. But it might have something to do with the deeper critique of capital Marx had in mind: the relationship between freedom and unfreedom - the system of commodity production gets directed towards producing subjects who are disciplined into suppressing otherwise unavoidable prejudice. Read that way, the system tries to free its subjects from discrimination, yet has to do so through the threat of being fired by your boss or disowned by your friends and family. But even so, that resembles elite theory, Foucault, and other more recent theories than Marxism.",
