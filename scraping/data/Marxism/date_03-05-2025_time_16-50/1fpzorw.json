    "selftext": "If I had to use an analogy Marx was like Charles Darwin or Isaac Newton where he purported to find the the fundamental laws of capitalism. Inside the various strands of socialism there\u2019s those that regard it as a revolution that would occur in a developed country. \n\n[August Bebel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Bebel) or that it is revisionable and a revolution will only occur when the right level of material development occurs. [Karl Kautsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Kautsky)\n\nOthers believe that the Revolution must be advanced by direct revolution and seizing the state: [Rosa Luxembourg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Luxemburg) or that the flame of revolution once lit must be spread before the forces of capitalism regain its forces and overthrow it. [Trotsky](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Trotsky) \n\nOr believe a discipline cadre of true \"Jesuits\" intelligentsia must advance the cause of the proletariat because they\u2019ll inevitably fall into syndicalism and get manipulated by the burgeosie. And also that socialism will break our in the place where capitalism is weakest. [Lenin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin)\n\nOr that it can only be built in one nation (Stalin) or lead by the peasant class (Mao).\n\nIf you consider all the other strands have flickered out it leaves only revisionism as the path forward. Marx wasn\u2019t a believer in pipe dreams.\n\nHis theory like Darwin\u2019s was sufficient by why haven\u2019t another towering intellect added to it. Especially as commodities and direct manufacturing aren\u2019t as important in developed economies. Services have emerged as the main part in any economy.",

Also alot of leftists mistakenly read the word \"revisionist\" outside of a marxist context. Too many people think marxism is just a philosophy. Or just an economic theory. So I think that we need to start at the foundational approach of explaining why marxism is based in scienctific principles first. And once that is established, look for ways to keep that foundational points while avoid the pitfalls of scientific dogmaticism.\n\n\nAfter all marxism is a response to capitalism, not the other way around.",

It isn't just philosophy. One could call it a social science, but I see a lot of people trying to act like it is physics.\u00a0\n\n\nI realize many authors tried to make it seem as if it was just as concrete and testable as physics, but as someone who studied physics, I can assure you it is not (Do you have empirically reproducible results to 7 sigma? Any developed mathematical theory of what you are saying that makes these predictions quantitatively? No? K not a science then, sorry.).\u00a0\n\n\nWhat it is is a very useful social science approach that makes some key observations about how people work and organize society and presents a kind of framework for trying to understand various types of political actions.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen people veer into pseudoscience arguments, it actually turns people off to the good aspects of Marxism, so it would be better if people wouldn't do that.",

Dialectical materialism is non falsifiable. But then there's the question of what Marx and Engels reeaally meant and thats's impossible to say. Where they saying their socialism is scientific like current medicine? Were they using a definition of science completely different to ours? Did they mean their method is scientific at all, or is it just a weird translation, and they really just meant its logic based, as opposed to utopian socialism?\n\nPersonally I favor the last explanation.",

                                    "body": "It was a slightly different definition of science. There's this quote from Marx about science being uncovering something that was hidden or obfuscated. Like, we wouldn't need to do chemistry experiments if we could see exactly what was happening. Science reveals these hidden underlying forces and allows us to see reality for what it really is. Diseases aren't caused by miasma, they are caused by germs. We learn that through the process of science.\n\nCrucially, knowledge gained from science allows us to take the right steps, to develop the right strategy. We know about germs so we can figure out how to avoid the spread of germs to tackle diseases rather than trying to defeat Our actions will be misguided if our beliefs are misguided. And this is what Marx attempts to do with Capital. He studies capitalism from a scientific lens, i.e. pulling away the layers of ideology and mythology to unveil what was really going on. And armed with this knowledge, the working class can devise a strategy to overthrow capitalism.\n\nThe other key thing was empirical evidence and revising based on new evidence. Marx continually revised his writings and theories based on what he saw happening around him and around the world.  That's not a robust scientific process but it is basically what science is.\n\nDialectical materialism is not science itself but it's a framework. It's just one way we can choose to view the world. Engels had this belief that everything in nature also behaved dialectically. Which wasn't completely wrong as he made some pretty accurate predictions about certain scientific discoveries. I think he was after kind of this unifying theory of science based in dialectics.\n\nSo I think Marxism is not a science per se, but science should be more Marxist. I think dialectical thinking would enrich all disciplines. And if revolution or building revolutionary movements is a discipline then Marxism is a brilliant guiding light that bases the movement in empirical evidence and  a critical view of the hegemonic ideology and culture which is tied to the ruling class.",

In fact, if they actually followed scientific processes and implemented policies democratically these disasters would not have happened.\n\nAnd science is already politicized. It will always be ideologically, culturally, economically, and politically biased one way or another.\n\nThe main thing science should take from Marxism is dialectical materialism. The way we have organized scientific study and professions today is rigid and disparate. It would be much better if scientists in each subject matter saw themselves not just as studying that one particular thing cut away from everything else, but rather as part of a larger study of science, as part of a larger study of society, and based in the larger society with its cultural and ideological biases.\n\nAnd this is where Marxist political philosophy would be a huge boon to science. Today we have climate scientists uncovering all of this horrific data, writing doomsday papers, none of which reaches anyone. As Marx talked about in The Jewish Question, in liberal society we tend to live dual lives. Our personal and political selves are divided and kept apart. It\u2019s considered unprofessional, downright dangerous, to politicize science. But we need to. We need scientists, teachers, etc. to all be active political subjects in driving societal change but also in driving what they research and how they do it (equitably, humanely, etc.). We have doctors who see patients suffering from stress and anxiety but don\u2019t know or care about the socioeconomic causes of their conditions. \n\nLike the unscientific disasters you mentioned in socialist countries, we have had similar horrible things done under the guise of cold hard science under capitalism. We don\u2019t need to commit either error again but Marxism offers us a way to cradle science within a larger democratic, egalitarian, politically engaged society, where it is intimately connected and learns from other subjects like history and philosophy.",

Which in that case you still need to explain how it's \"Anti-Science\" in this abstract \"Science.\" Science is not separate from Class Struggle, it is not an institution separate from the material world as Idealists try to separate it from. And I presume that \"Ecological disasters of Maoism\" is a reference to the Great Leap Forward Famine that supposedly Lysenko's ideas are responsible for. Yet I'm yet to find evidence of (1) Michurinism being significantly established for practice in the PRC (2) the Famine being caused by factors other than the material conditions of the PRC being feudal peasant farming implements and a history of Famines in China and (3) Michurinism actually either helped Soviet Agriculture or at minimum did not harm Soviet Agriculture so why should it have shown harmful results in China.\n\n\nTo quote Richard Lewontin(an Anti-Michurinist):\n\n\n> During the war years, the Soviet Union suffered a catastrophic loss of productivity while it was recovering in the United States. Then, beginning in 1950, both countries began a period of rapidly increasing yields which kept pace with each other, the Soviet increases being somewhat higher. **We should note that 1948 - 62, the period of Lysenkoist hegemony in Soviet agrobiology, actually corresponds to the period of most rapid growth in yields per acre!** Moreover, even a time-delay hypothesis, supposing that the effects of Lysenkoism on genetical research are felt only later, is at variance with the observed continued growth in yields per acre. [...] during this period, the total acreage occupied by wheat increased in the Soviet Union from 30 million to nearly 70 million hectares, while US acreage shrank from 60 to 45 million acres. Thus increased Soviet yields have been in spite of bringing large amounts of new and marginal land into cultivation, while the opposite process was going on in the United States. While there may be particular crops and situations where Lysenkoist doctrines prevented the solution of some specific problems (breeding for disease resistance, perhaps) **there is no evidence that Soviet agriculture was, in fact, damaged**\n\n\n- **The Problem of Lysenkoism** by Richard Lewontin & Richard Levins\n\n\n\n\n> Politicizing science nevers ends well\n\n\nI'd say that with the development of Monopoly Capitalism the progressiveness of mechanical materialism has been negated and is more Reactionary and Idealist and thus it's Bourgeois science that is limited to supporting capitalism while Proletarian(Dialectical Materialist) Science upholds Practice as the criterion of Truth in science.\n\n\nBut Bourgeois Science is even having to admit that Lysenkos Dialectical Materialist Science is correct(with epigenetics) though they still try to deny it with \"oh he wasn't correct about X or Y.\" Science(even in the hands of the Bourgeoisie) is more and more demonstrating that the world works Dialectically not Mechanically.",

Revisionism in relation to Marxism, can mean a lot of things, but mainly it means abandoning class struggle. Service workers are just another part of the working class and production of commodities is still important. I don\u2019t know where you live, but if you live in the United States you probably are under the belief that in the 1980\u2019s and 1990s due to trade agreements like NAFTA. The reality is only a handful of million jobs in the following decade were lost to trade agreements and over seas production. That might sound like a lot but there\u2019s 300M ppl in the US. The US is still the largest manufacturer in the world. Full stop. Most people don\u2019t seem to know that. The goal of those trade agreements was to discipline labor and scare them into passivity.  Thats a Marxist analysis. The goal of Marxist is to unite the working class in struggle, that includes traditional factory worker, healthcare workers, shift laborers, Uber drivers and other segments of the gig economy, baristas and so on.",

            "body": "The reason \"revisionist\" is such an insult is that it usually refers to Eduard Bernstein whose theory was that revolution was not really necessary, that they could win socialism through reforms. This by itself is not the real problem but rather what the SPD in Germany ended up doing, i.e. supporting WW I and betraying the second international. \n\nSo revisionism, or at least this strain of it, is associated with class collaborationist politics and not just a denial of revolutionary Marxism but internationalist class struggle itself. \n\nBut the Communist International (which essentially replaced the 2nd international) put together a new approach to building anti-monopoly democracy which called for creating a united front and even allying with liberal parties against fascism in bourgeois democracies and fighting for fundamental reforms which would create transitional states toward socialism. \n\nI think this highlighted the significance of political rights won within bourgeois democracies. Voting is hugely impactful and can lead to real change. Unlike the Duma which was little more than an empty concession by the Czar that could be dissolved whenever he didn't like it, democracies in the West were actually responsive to popular will. \n\nIt also shows the importance of applying Marxism to shifting conditions. Lenin was all about pragmatism, using the tools available, and going where the people are. Shows Lenin's influence on Marxism as well because he really argued the importance of democracy and winning democratic reforms against Czarist autocracy and building a revolutionary movement through that.\n\nToday we see people applying Bolshevism sort of dogmatically to our current conditions, and using \"revisionism\" as a catch-all argument against anyone who argues that we aren't currently in revolutionary conditions, that they have to be built, or we have to engage in bourgeois institutions in order to reach the working class. We need to be better at applying Marxist principles to our current conditions.",

            "body": "Comrades, I am astonished by the confusion and misapprehension that pervades this discussion! One could scarcely believe that, after the countless struggles and sacrifices of the revolutionary proletariat, such fundamental misunderstandings about the nature of Marxism persist even among those who claim adherence to its principles. Let us not descend into sophistry and muddle-headed pedantry but instead clarify with utmost precision the essence of Marxism as a scientific socialism!\n\nFirst, let us dispense with this ridiculous notion that Marxism is akin to a mere philosophical abstraction or that it is somehow less \u201cscientific\u201d because it does not conform to the narrow parameters of empirical verification demanded by bourgeois natural science. This is a gross misunderstanding of what Marx and Engels meant by the term \"scientific socialism.\" Marxism is indeed a science\u2014not in the limited sense of conducting experiments in a laboratory, but in the profound sense that it provides a comprehensive and systematic analysis of the historical development of society based on the materialist conception of history.\n\nScience, comrades, is not restricted to the mere repetition of experiments in controlled conditions! This is the myopic view of those who cannot see beyond the microscopes of the bourgeois universities! Scientific inquiry encompasses the understanding of the laws of motion of society, as well as of nature. Marxism uncovers the laws of motion of capitalist society, revealing the contradictions that lead inevitably to its collapse and the birth of socialism. This is the true essence of scientific socialism: not the sterile repetition of experiments, but the dialectical analysis of the real, living contradictions within the capitalist mode of production.\n\nTo the comrades who liken Marxism to a social science, I say: Yes, indeed! But what sort of social science? It is not a mere cataloging of social facts or a collection of empirical observations. It is a revolutionary science, a science of praxis! Marxism does not content itself with interpreting the world; it seeks to change it! It is grounded in material reality, analyzing the economic base and its reflection in the ideological superstructure, unveiling the exploitation of the working class and the class antagonisms that shape history.\n\nAnd to those who insist on a definition of science bound by the bourgeois standards of \u201cfalsifiability\u201d and \u201cempirical reproducibility,\u201d I ask: Were the discoveries of Marx and Engels not confirmed time and again by the very development of capitalist society? Did not the great revolutions and class struggles of the 20th century\u2014the Russian Revolution, the rise of Soviet power, the triumph of revolutions in the East\u2014demonstrate in practice the scientific validity of their predictions? Did we not see the decay of capitalism, its crisis and war, its imperialist plunder, all laid bare in *Capital*?\n\nDialectical materialism, comrades, is not merely a \u201cframework\u201d or \u201cperspective\u201d to be debated in academic seminars. It is the method by which we grasp the reality of social phenomena in their motion and development, in their contradictions and resolutions. It is the method that allows us to discern the tendencies of capitalist development, to understand the revolutionary potential of the working class, and to see the path forward to socialism.\n\nEngels' elaboration of dialectical materialism, and his insistence on its applicability not only to society but to nature as well, was not some fanciful attempt to \"unify\" all sciences but a recognition of the interconnectedness of all phenomena. The dialectic of nature, of which Engels spoke, reflects the same contradictions and transformations that we observe in society. The unity of opposites, the transformation of quantity into quality, the negation of the negation\u2014these are laws that pervade both the natural and the social world.\n\nLet us not fall prey to bourgeois skepticism and revisionism, which seeks to strip Marxism of its revolutionary essence and reduce it to a harmless academic exercise! The truth of Marxism lies not in the dissection of dead formulas but in its living application to the struggle of the proletariat! The revolution will not be verified by university professors but by the masses in struggle, by the workers taking up arms against their oppressors, by the oppressed peoples rising up against imperialism!\n\nAnd finally, let us address one last point made here, that \"Marxism is a response to capitalism.\" This is a half-truth, and a half-truth is worse than a lie! Marxism is not merely a reaction to capitalism; it is the scientific understanding of the historical development of society, encompassing not just capitalism but all modes of production that have preceded it, and the revolutionary transition to communism that will transcend it. It is not capitalism that calls forth Marxism, but the objective necessity of the proletarian revolution, born out of the contradictions of capitalist society, that gives life to the science of Marxism.",
