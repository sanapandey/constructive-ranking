I've had it in my mind for the past 5 or so years that I wanted to start a community based off of communist/bien vivir structure, but with little direction up until a few months ago. \nI'd be interested in discussing with those interested in starting a commune. I'm a US resident but wanted to move to Mexico, but that can be up for discussion. \n",

That means, for a Marxist, organising the working class. Not escaping it.\n\nAll the marxists I know in the real world are not pessimistic at all, because Marxism shows us society can and does change. Marxism should be a source of optimism, not pessimism.",

                            "body": "What you're proposing is known as \"utopian\" socialism as opposed to scientific socialism, I.e., Marxism.\n\nI think people in the USA absolufely want a revolution, there is just lacking a revolutionary party which can lead the way.\n\nLook at the George Floyd protests: 10% of the entire population were on the streets. A police precinct got burned down and a majority of Americans thought that was a good thing. Armed self defence militias started springing up in working class neighbourhoods in place of the police. The implications of that were revolutionary.\n\nAnd now we have poll after poll highlighting widespread distrust and hatred of the system. A majority of Americans want to vote for someone other than Republican or Democrat. Only a minority of Americans have any trust that Congress, the courts, and the state work in their interests.\n\nTrump was also a sign of people wanting to tear things down, albeit in a distorted way. Trump is a reactionary and we do not support, but he was tapping into a legitimate and justified anger people have which the left failed to capitalise on. Again.\n\nThe American Revolution is coming.\n\nGet organised.\n\nI cannot tell you personally which is the right organisation for you. I can only be biased and say join the one I'm in, the Revolutionary Communist International, whos US section is the Revolutionary Communists of America.\n\nWhat I can tell you is leaving it all and joining a Commune is only good for you and your Commune. Workers won't \"see it working\", they'll have no idea your commune exists.\n\nStarting a commune is anarchism, or utopian socialism. It is not Marxism and it will not help realise the socialist revolution.\n\nA commune is trying to imagine a communist society before the fact. But the thing is we can't say in advance what a communist society would look like. That comes from the initiative of the working class themselves.\n\nMarxists do not have any pre-conceived ideas of what communism looks like beyond the idea that there'll be no classes and no state. But what that looks like in practice isn't for us to say. No where in Marxist literature will you see the idea of Soviets are what are required. Soviets were invented by the working class themselves by their own experience and marxists said \"that is the basis of a workers' state.\" A commune tries to do this process in reverse, but history doesn't work like that.\n\nEdit: If you want a clearer understanding on the difference between utopian socialism and Marxism I highly recommend *Socialism: Utopian and Scientific* by Friedrich Engels. That certainly helped me get a clear understanding of how Marxism differs from all other socialist trends.",

I've learned too much about how capitalism has made so many people so sick, and it already affects my family and has been. Her growing up in school surrounded by boys that could recreate her through AI and sell her, or end up hurting her worse than that due to the social conditioning causing young boys to be more misogynistic and sadistic. Besides all of the other reasons I've come to loathe how capitalism has influenced society, that was a major one. \n\nI've extended myself so many times in the past trying to get people to understand the suffering, and no one has ever cared. With how sick people are, physically and mentally, it's difficult for me to see that we'd make an impact significant enough to turn the tide in my daughter's generation. Yeah sure, planting the seeds of the trees we'll never feel the shade of and all. I do hope that we can make a real impact. I'll try my best but I'm not very hopeful that enough people will catch the wave before the opposing tsunami wipes us out, much less stand up when they're called to. People seem very content being entertained to death and wouldn't want to give that up.",

And it can change.\n\nRevolutionary consciousness can also change. Very rapidly in fact.\n\nIf a mass revolutionary communist party arrived and America was heading towards a revolution, do not be surprised if millions of people who currently support Trump join such a revolutionary party.\n\nWhat you are feeling is similar to what people felt in ancient Rome when they thought the end of the world was coming. But what was dying was not the world but a socio-economic system. \n\nLikewise now. Capitalism is in decline. It is in chronic crisis. It is a system which cannot continue to live but refuses to die. \n\nWe need to organise to make sure it does die.",

You\u2019re right about the destructive influence of imperialist propaganda, but the truth can only be successfully repressed for so long. Notice how widely people are beginning to question mainstream justifications for the west\u2019s aggressively self-defeating foreign policy. Baby steps.\n\n\n> We\u2019re so divided at this point. There\u2019s no real democracy here in the US. \n\nYou aren\u2019t alone in coming to that conclusion, it\u2019s an important step. \n\n\n> I have a feeling capitalism will run everything into hell before anyone realizes what needs to be done. \n\nSimilarly, this too is part of a longer process of mass radicalization, which can only come via firsthand experience of conflicts between what we are told is reality and how we actually experience it.\n\n\n> I\u2019m not looking to continue participating in this system. I\u2019d love to have a place to live and practice what I believe in safely and for my family to be safe as well. \n\nI understand the feeling, especially if you have kids. But it really is essential that well meaning, hard working individuals, who come to recognize what\u2019s actually going on, contribute in exposing loved ones to the contradictions of the system as they emerge into the open.\n\n\n> If organizing communes doesn\u2019t work, how come they\u2019ve deliberately been destroyed by capitalism time and time again? \n\n\nHistorically, they tend to fall of their own accord under a variety of internal economic and political pressures. Notice the only successful socialist projects that have lasted more than a decade have done so despite extreme difficulties, including constant military and economic assaults from outside.\n\n\n> How are we suppose to find safety in each other when they come for us, if we\u2019re diluted across the map?\n\n\nThis is what organizing is for. If we allow the despair and alienation to isolate us from the broad majority of working folks who, just like us, experience this same imposed misery and desire for stronger community connections, then we can\u2019t expect to find any safety. \n\nIronic as it may seem, it is the struggle for defending and gaining greater democratic rights (yes, this includes fighting to defend the pittance of democratic rights afforded us by our farcical bourgeois democracy) that these connections find their most open, fertile ground. We fight for socialism, the only real democracy where a society of working people can look out for each other and all of humankind, while continuously pointing out the cracks in the facade of bourgeois democracy, and while defending every millimeter of democratic principles we have now. This is the only way to demonstrate our commitment in the now, by acting with the open intention to empower ALL our fellow workers, to strengthen our ties with all who share that commitment, and continuously work to build this consciousness and the courage that is rightly justified by our sheer number, among our communities, colleagues, networks of all kinds.",
