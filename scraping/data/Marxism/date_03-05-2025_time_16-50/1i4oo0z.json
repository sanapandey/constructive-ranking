    "selftext": "There is a perception that LGBTQ-themed films with bad endings for LGBTQ people are inherently harmful, that it reinforces the idea that they are doomed, etc. I have seen similar criticism of films that did not create such an impression on me personally.\n\nActually, I think the opposite trend in cinema would be no less dangerous, at least in the depiction of LGBT persons in the working class.\n\nIn my opinion, liberal criticism often pushes creative intelligentsia to create a harmful fairy tale about pink capitalism being good for LGBTQ people.\n\nFirstly, I don't want working-class LGBTQ characters to be erased in cinema, with LGBTQ characters being shown mostly as petty bourgeois. It shouldn't be the case that LGBTQ characters are all petty bourgeoisie, who are really likely to find happiness in pink-capitalist societies.\n\nSecondly, I don't want films that portray pink-capitalist societies to romanticize the lives of working-class LGBTQ characters. I don't think that working class LGBTQ people in pink capitalist societies are happy in reality. I think that movies shouldn't portray a fairy tale that in a pink-capitalist society, a working-class LGBTQ person has a huge chance of being happy.  \n  \nOn the contrary, I think that movies should motivate working-class LGBTQ people to see that pink-capitalist society is not friendly to them. \n\nIt would be nice if working-class LGBTQ characters didn't seek happiness in the pink-capitalist society as it is, but realized that they must fight for radical change in this society.\n\nI'm not saying that movies should demonize their lives. But romanticizing them in this case seems to me to be no less harmful.",

Picking up that you call ***\"LGBTQ characters being shown mostly as petty bourgeois\"*** is a strong indicator of hollywood puke and disney sham characters.  Hollywood and the disney-like companies have never done justice to anyone. Hollywood is garbage.  We even have derogatory slang  \"oh they went hollywood\" for the most plastic-trashy person. \n\nStart looking at indie, and overseas films.  \n\nTry any of the following, \n\n* Stonewall (2015).  \n* No Secret Anymore: The Times of Del Martin & Phyllis Lyon, \n* Screaming Queens: The Riot at Compton\u2019s Cafeteria, \n* P.S., Burn This Letter Please, \n* How to Survive a Plague, \n* The Death and Life of Marsha P.

It\u2019s a tough balancing act to be sure, but making happiness conditional on radical change occurring seems like an awfully risky bet, considering we all only get one lifetime and the fall of capitalism doesn\u2019t seem to be especially imminent. I think there\u2019s a difference between happiness (complacent) and happiness (oppressed but refusing to let that ruin my life).",

I feel like you're also making a false equivalence:\n\n\nHappy ending for queer characters <=> seeking happiness within/from capitalism\n\n\nPresenting a world where queer people can be happy is radical by itself. Not every movie needs to be a critique of capitalism. Not every movie needs to have a moral. Some movies are just supposed to be fun. It's a bad thing if those movies can't have queer people in them.\n\n\nI'm curious if you've actually watched a significant amount of queer film, especially independent films. Because plenty of those are anti-capitalist. Often without torturing their queer characters.\n\n\nThere is already so much queer suffering in film. I don't think there is any danger in making movies with positive stories for queer working class people.\u00a0",
