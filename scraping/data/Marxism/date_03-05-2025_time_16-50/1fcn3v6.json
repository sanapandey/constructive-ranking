    "selftext": "In contemporary economics, GDP is (i think i may be wrong in this though so correct me if needed) the sum of all value of goods and services produced measured as its price in the market. This does not obviously take into account the socially necessary labour time was needed to put into all the goods and services etc. But i have heard that GDP is kind of like the market price put onto the labour value necessary to create said goods and services, oftenly the price of said commodities dont reflect the true labour value put into them. GDP only reflects the market price of commodities produced. Thoughts?",

A country with twice the gdp of another can purchase twice as many goods, all else being equal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Over time in the same country, gdp has little meaning. How much gdp growth a country has depends on how you count inflation, and many governments have really illogical ways of measuring inflation. And there is no perfect way to measure inflation either because the goods that are sold year to year are different.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nthe relationship between value and gdp is not straightforward either. GDP has a lot of inputs with nothing to do with economic production. For example, if you are *not* paying rent in the US, the rent that you *might* have been paying is also counted towards the gdp. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nIf you remove such manipulations, and also discount international flows of surplus value (income from foreign investments is also gdp), and imperialism (the us derives significant income from printing money and exporting inflation through dollar hegemony), then gdp does have a relation with value. In such a case, gdp will be proportional to the value produced, so the total number of hours worked in the economy. The proportionality constant will be some measure of productivity.",

It does correlate with market value but it\u2019s a bad way to measure it (because of how it\u2019s calculated)\nMarket Value of goods is more closely correlated with something like average wage for the bottom 90% of people, because that\u2019s a measure of how much can a good be sold for which closely related with wages",
