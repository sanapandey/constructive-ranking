I checked up the rules on this sub and don't see an explicit position, so my guess is that there's a wide range of opinions here.  I could be totally wrong in that assumption.\n\nIs the debate between so-called class reductionists and people who believe in identity politics over:\n\n\\-Whether a socialist revolution would automatically \"fix\" racial/sexual issues, since everyone would essentially be well off financially.\n\n\\-Whether upward mobility of minorities and females under capitalism really matters.\n\n\\-Whether we should \"wait\" for that socialist revolution.\n\nMy position is that a socialist revolution would largely resolve these issues, so that has lead me to so called class reductionist communities.   If you have economic power, everything else is secondary.  **While we wait for revolution, I don't blame people for trying to get the best deal they can out of capitalism.**   I just think the socialist movement itself should be open to the entire working class and shouldn't take the prejudices of the capitalist class and reverse them but should argue for equal treatment.\n\nI'm trying to survey this sub and find out what it thinks and maybe see if I can become enlightened by a little debate.\n\nI'm interested in hearing people explain their positions thoroughly.   I'm hoping this sub doesn't mod too hard and let's people explain their positions thoroughly so that people can academically read through the comments and learn from it.",

It also made economics  a third rail. \n\nThat\u2019s how you get legal equality, an integrated black bourgeois, female CEOs and executives at large companies, working class woman still making less than men and black people under the poverty line being double the amount of white people under the poverty line per capita. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean intersectionality is useless, but it does mean the limits of what it can do will always be based on its class composition. You may be more likely to succeed if you collaborate across classes, but that success will always be along the bourgeoisie\u2019s lines, not the working class, and that means the working class will always get less.",

But it does so and has done so on its own terms, with its own menthods, ideas, and tactics, not terms dreamt up by middle class academics and their idealist philosophies.",

            "body": "I agree that socialism will solve a lot of those issues.\n\nShould minorities and oppressed sections of society strive to climb the social ladder under capitalism? Sure, why not? Is it progress to do so? Not really. A capitalist is still a capitalist. A bourgeois is still a bourgeois. Did Margaret Thatcher, the first female UK prime minister, care about working class women? No. Did Obama care about working class Black Americans? No.\n\nMy view is identity politics, whilst perhaps well meaning for some people, is ultimately reactionary. Some examples to illustrate why:\n\n- When university staff in the UK went on strike a few years ago, there were student-led campaigns to show solidarity with their striking professors, a qualitatively progressive step (in the past student bodies would usually be against strikes by staff as it meant losing out on education  they're paying for). However, one student union voted to *not* support the strike because \"it would disproportionately affect students of BAME (Black, Asian, minority, and ethnic) backgrounds\". Now this sounds on the surface radical and progressive but it is actually purely reactionary, for obvious reasons. It served to break student solidarity with the staff, which was vital if the strike was going to win. Furthermore, given cuts to education and further privatisation, actually it would have had a *more* negative impact on BAME students if the university won in the labour dispute.\n\n- One of the major unions in Germany was having a leadership contest a few years ago. One of the candidates was a radical socialist and leftwinger who wanted to break with the \"Sozialpartnerschaft\" politics where union higher ups cosy up to bosses and do back-room deals against the wishes of the rank and file. This candidate spooked the union bureaucracy. Luckily for the bureaucracy, the left wing candidate was a white old man. Perfect! They forced through a female-only candidate list, blocking the leftwinger from running, because \"isn't it about time we have a female leader of this union? How progressive is that!\" All the female candidates were pro-Sozialpartnerschaft and defenders of the status quo.\n\nSo, as we see, identity politics can be used and is used as a stick to beat the genuine left wing with. It serves as a barrier to class consciousness and is therefore reactionary.\n\nProponants of identity politics think you can change the world simply by changing language, or \"narrative\", so it is also an idealist philosophy, not materialist, and is therefore un-Marxian.\n\nApropos language, there is a debate about gender neutral language. In German all professions have a masculine and feminine (Arbeiter = male worker, Arbeiterin = female worker). Some have adopted the \"gender star\" like so, Arbeiter*in = gender-neutral worker.\n\nAgain, looks progressive, until used (or not used) in practice and suddenly you are sexist/transphobic if you don't use it. Bear in mind most people who know about the gender star come from the academic miliue, so many workers are immediately branded \"sexist/transphobic\" if they commit the \"crime\" of simply not knowing about it. And on this point I would say as marxists, we build on the traditions of the working class. Things like gender stars did not come from the working class movement but from the petty bourgeois academic class. Actually, a proletarian answer to gender neutral language came in the GDR when women workers would call themselves \"Arbeiter\", as they considered \"Arbeiterin\" patronising and diminutive. I guess in that sense it was akin to English gender-neutral language where an \"actress\" might be offended by being called an actress and want to be called an \"\tactor\" instead like her male counterparts.\n\nThat said, I don't think there's any harm in adopting these gender neutral stars and what not, if only for the fact it doesn't ultimately change anything, therefore \"no harm done\".\n\nEdit: I hear a lot of so-called Marxist groups when talking about Palestine, open their speeches with \"Now, I know I'm white and European, so I can't speak for Palestine, but *maybe* Socialism is the answer. But if Palestine a finds a better solution, maybe they will! I'm just *suggesting* Socialism *might* be an answer.\" This identity politics standpoint of claiming you can't speak on an issue because you're not from there is just cowardice. Sorry, but if you're a Marxist, then you *know* Socialism is the only answer for Palestine. No ifs or buts and it doesn't fucking matter if you're European and saying that. Not to mention the middle east has a rich socialist tradition anyway, so all this \"eurocentric\" nonsense about Marxism is disproven right there.",

It's very tautological and open to abuse for reasons which are self-evident, but I would give another example:\n\nWhen Jeremy Corbyn (former leader of the British Labour Party) was accused of being antisemitic. It was 100% slander used to discredit him by the right-wing of the Labour Party. But what did Corbyn and the Left do in response? Apologise! They apologised for something which wasn't true, because they were already under the pressure of petty bourgeois molarity and identity politics which forced them to think \"If they say we're antisemitic, we can't deny that, because that would be antisemitic!\".\n\nWhat they should have done was say it like it is: \"We are not antisemitic. This is a slanderous campaign to discredit us because our politics are a threat to their political faction. What *is* antisemitic is using the serious issue of antisemitism as a factional weapon.\"\n\nAgain, identity politics was used as a stick to beat the left. The problem with most of the left is they play along with it, with disasterous results.",

But that's my point: these struggles are intrinsic to socialism. There's no need for intersectionality or identity politics when it comes to the question of the class struggle. These ideas are new anyway, and yet the anti-racism and women's struggle was rightly a major focal point in the socialist movement way before these petty bourgeois, alien class ideas came about.\n\nRosa Luxemburg said it best (and was proved right) when writing about feminism and socialism, bearing in mind \"feminism\" back then was a purely petty bourgeois ideology:\n\n>If it were a matter of the ladies of the bourgeois, then the capitalist state could expect only a real prop for reaction from them. Most of the bourgeois women who play the lioness in a fight against \u2018male privileges\u2019 would, once in possession of the suffrage, follow like meek little lambs in the wake of the conservative and clerical reaction. Indeed, they would surely be far more reactionary than the masculine portion of their class.\n\nShe was proved right. With a few exceptions, a good many \"feminists\" who were part of the suffragette movement in the UK ended up openly supporting fascism in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nFor Luxemburg and many other socialists, the struggle for women's emancipation was the struggle for socialism. The two were inseperable, and to separate them was (and is) reactionary.",

They won rights under the provisional government and were undoubtedly an influence on the Bolshevik policies after the October revolution.\n\nIn the same way, Black people in the US have won emancipation and huge gains in economic and political freedom entirely outside of a socialist movement. Anti-colonial movements were also influenced by Lenin and Stalin but larger were not socialist or Marxist. \n\nI think instead of dismissing these movements we have to ally ourselves with them and bring what Gus Hall called the \u201ccommunist plus\u201d into our coalition work to raise revolutionary consciousness.",

We have no right to tell Palestinians how to fight imperialism and how to fight for their liberation.

We as marxists  should be able to say that without shame or embarrassment.\n\nOr the women's strike in Iceland which \"banned\" men from taking part and striking with them.

The reductionism then is revealed as not at all a problem. The problem is specifically _class_. If someone brings up intersectionality with class, the interlocutor says: there goes the intersectionality neighborhood. In this framing it is yet another competing essentialism, which competing essentialism is the very anathema of intersectionality. \n\nWhen we abandon the reductionism that plagues intersectionality or any movement \n\n* socialism does not automatically fix issues of race and sex, and so forth, but it does remove the various ways that capitalism exacerbates such discrimination by turning our attention away from civic engagement with how to steward our common resources and instead on wielding State power to smite those we hate (including hating ourselves and all those outside the tyrannical ruling class)\n\n* prosperity always matters, but it matters for the working class as well: trying to promote the prosperity of some by trampling, with cleats, on the backs of others is the polar opposite of intersectionality\n\n* there is no waiting for socialist revolution.

Now that modern corporations and institutions are inverting this by using (employee) resource groups focused on career advancement targeted at minority identities as a buffer against unions and class consciousness, it's a problem for those that have the option to pass as the default rather than declaring an identity other than class, which suggests to me that this kind of reductionism is reactionary. edit: Even in this very thread, you see people reducing intersectionality to identity politics, which is the coopted form of stuff related to intersectionality",

A great criticism of this exact kind of theory actually comes from Harry Wells' *Pragmatism: Philosophy of Imperialism* (1954):\n\n>This is what is called \"the\u00a0factor theory\u201d of culture, in which a plurality of factors, all on the same level and of the same importance, simply interact. No one is the determining element It is an effective formula for the elimination of any possible way of understanding society. Dewey's social theory is a\u00a0factor theory\u00a0\u2014a\u00a0factor theory\u00a0of society, a\u00a0factor theory\u00a0of human nature, a\u00a0factor theory\u00a0of culture. The mass of factor interactions is so complex that there is no way of bringing order out of the chaos. Dewey admits this when he says \"Today the influences that affect the actions performed by individuals are so remote as to be unknown. We are at the mercy of events acting upon us in unexpected, abrupt and violent ways.\"\n\nBy contrast, true \"class reductionism,\" so far as I'm concerned, basically takes the same perspective but to opposite conclusions: because they're regarded as unrelated to class, these other kinds of oppression are regarded as either not actually real or just not worthy of consideration. \n\nIMO, a true marxist perspective recognizes the material and class roots of varying kinds of oppression even if and when such oppression is not a universal feature of a given class, that the above description of \"class reductionism\" is really just *economism*, and that partial struggles over democratic/civil demands are worth supporting even if they're not immediately revolutionary.\n\nAs it says in the [Lavender Guard statement of values](https://lavenderguard.org/):\n\n>We recognize that capitalism reproduces chauvinism against, and exploitation of, LGBT people, and that members of the exploiting class, despite calls for unity on identitarian lines, do not share our interests. In the last instance, all identity-based oppressions have a material, class basis that must be abolished in order to be overcome. Therefore, as a sub-type of class oppression, and not independent of class oppression, we recognize queer struggle as a form of class struggle, and reject all identity-opportunism as a form of class collaborationism. Those who provoke chauvinism against queer people, who drive a wedge between the class and its identity-oppressed minorities, or who peddle identity-opportunism, are not yet ready to consider themselves allies of the queer struggle, let alone comrades of the revolution. Therefore, members of the Lavender Guard will recognize that there is no antagonism between the interests of the working class at-large and the queer masses in-particular, and that social revolution is a prerequisite for the liberation of all oppressed sexualities and genders.",

We can get caught up in semantics over what we mean by fix, and the timescale, but it doesn't change both the theory and the experience.\u00a0 A socialist revolution, would provide the space for these issues to be fixed, but they don't magically disappear.\u00a0 For instance, the early USSR's attitude towards minority nationalism, supporting it as part of a pathway to socialism- Cuba's extremely successful anti-racism programmes that effectively eliminated differences in access to the state- whilst racism still exists in Cuba, people envision it being fixed within the revolution (which is ongoing). Neither were perfect and needed adapting, but they would have been essentially impossible without the revolution.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nSo essentially the revolution is where all the really hard work starts, right?\u00a0 \u00a0This isn't really a debate it's inherent to Marx's idea of stages- the dictatorship of the proletariat is essentially a place holder whilst all things are dealt with.\u00a0 Regarding getting the best deal- I mean this is a bit of a cynical view as opposed to capitalism. We can recognise the dangers of too much focus on certain aspects of the struggle whilst also knowing they are important- think about economism and how Marx can both support a limited workers struggle, but also recognise it's dangers.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRegarding a revolution, we should not wait (this doesn't mean go out and set fires immediately, rather that we cannot be passive). The danger of this sort of attitude is that it can only lead to accelerationism- which is another word for uselessness. I would hope we've left this nonsense behind.\u00a0 Intersectionality (as I understand it) is not a replacement for class analysis, more an addendum that allows for a deeper understanding of different contexts and provides space for more complex class alliances. I trace my own use and understanding of intersectionality to a gramscian basis. The sort of girl boss- representational identity politics that is practiced by liberal elites- is just a liberal nonsense. Part of what Gramsci would think of as the passive revolution- a way of capitalism to offer a modicum if reforms and space for the representation of an elite of marginalised people within existing hegemonic power structures (sort of inviting new elites into the hegemonic bloc).

They're the same fight. \n\n>This is why the Comintern updated \u201cworkers of the world unite\u201d to \u201cworkers and all oppressed people of the world unite.\u201d\n\nWould that be the same Comintern which advocated Menshevism in the colonial countries (advising communists to side with the non-existent \"progressive bourgeoisie), popular frontism (advising communists in advanced countries to side with the non-existent \"progressive bourgeoisie\"), and then was unilaterally dissolved by Stalin in 1943, without so much as a congress to decide on it, purely to appease US and British imperialism? The Comintern was only good in its first five years. After the death of Lenin and the consolidation of Stalin it acted as a break on the fight against imperialism and in the end ended up serving directly the interests of imperialism.\n\nEdit: Added another paragraph.",

Class struggle by the working class must overcome and actively fight oppression and the various divisions within the working class. Revolution and communism destroys the material foundations of oppression and actively targets the source of oppression, class. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they will magically be eliminated completely on the eve of revolution. Ideas can linger in the conscience of people even after their material circumstances that create and reinforce the ideas have been overthrown. So I think it will take several generations for these ideas to disappear and will be an active process by the Revoltionary proletariat to stamp them out. Communism requires an end to oppression to actually function and socially encourages people to be egalitarian and humanistic whilst socially condemning people who are not. Thus the reactionary ideas will fall away entirely.\n\nYou should look into what revolution actually looked like in Russia. It looked like decriminalising gay relationships. It looked like divorce and abortion being openly accessible for women to combat their oppression. It looked like the first gender affirming healthcare under capitalism. It looked like average workers throwing off sexist and racist ideas to come together in solidarity as a class. Women empowerment and active combatting of women\u2019s oppression in the family and workplace (it was kickstarted by women workers going on strike, inspiring a general strike for example!). It looks like workers arming themselves to fight the anti semitic pogromist and reactionary black hundreds in solidarity with their Jewish comrades. \n\n1917 Russia was one of the most reactionary capitalist countries in the world at the time. Years before the average person was a peasant who was heavily orthodox Christian and practically worshipped the tsar. Who scapegoated Jewish people for their problems and were horrendously sexist.",

I wish they actually were class reductionists instead of vulgar mechanical materialists.\n\nWhen Marx studied economics, he didn't just take a ready-made dialectical framework and apply it to the discipline. He criticized Ferdinand Lassalle for this exact thing:\n\n>\"He will dis\u00adcover to his cost that it is one thing for a critique to take a science to the point at which it admits of a dialectical presentation, and quite another to apply an abstract, ready-made system of logic to vague presentiments of just such a system\" (MECW, 40:261).\n\nI think many people make the mistake of taking \"Marxist analysis\" to be a static framework that they can apply to any field of knowledge and make novel observations. The class reductionists almost universally do this to find ways to say that struggles against racism or sexism are unimportant. It's flagrently a foregone conclusion to them based on their \"framework\". On the other hand, many intersectional theorists basically just try to use Marxism as a tool on their toolbelt, one of many frameworks to be employed. This does a disservice to Marxism but at the very least isn't nearly as openly pseudoscientific and tautological as the class reductionists. \n\nFor me, class is a structural part of our economic life and therefore will emerge as a force behind other things if you analyze them deep enough. But as Marx says, it's one thing to do a deep study of the data until that background of class emerges and another thing entirely to apply a vulgar \"class\" framework to issues. And the fact that class structures things in the background does not imply that fighting racism in the foreground is useless or that struggles against sexism meaningfully \"distract\" from class issues. In fact, it implies that all these things are class issues from a certain point of view and therefore, even from a \"class reductionist\" standpoint, deserve rigorous study and attention from intellectuals, activists, and movements.",
