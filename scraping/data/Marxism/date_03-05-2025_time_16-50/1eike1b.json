    "selftext": "The 1967 Marxist critical theory by Guy Debord talks about how life presents itself as an \"immense accumulation of spectacles.\" When I analysed the text w.r.t social media especially Instagram, it made a lot of sense. \n\nThe life we present on Instagram is chosen deliberately with a lot of thought. It is in fact a separate entity. \"Due to the very fact that this sector is separate, it is the common ground of the deceived gaze and of false consciousness, and the unification it achieves is nothing but an official language of generalized separation.\"\n\nThe posts or the presentation doesn't remain as a different aspect instead it can create a relation between users or can be the major factor in the case of networking. \"The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images.\"\nWhen the interpretation of a specific account or a post becomes a majority opinion, it has the tendency to become the general pespective.\n\" It is a world vision which has become objectified.\"\n\nThis representation is not something extra or superficial added to reality; it is more fundamental and integrated into the fabric of society. (We might often fail to see the separateness because it is deeply weaved into the society)\n\"It is not a supplement to the real world, an additional decoration. It is the heart of the unrealism of the real society. In all its specific forms, as information or propaganda, as advertisement or direct entertainment consumption, the spectacle is the present model of SOCIALLY DOMINANT LIFE. It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choice already made in production and its corollary consumption. The spectacle\u2019s form and content are identically the total justification of the existing system\u2019s conditions and goals. The spectacle is also the permanent presence of this justification, since it occupies the main part of the time lived outside of modern production.\" \nInstagram's \"language\" is made up of visual signs (photos, videos, captions) that reflect dominant cultural and economic values. These signs are both produced by and serve the goals of the ruling production systems\u2014capitalism, consumerism, and popular culture. For instance, influencers promote products and lifestyles that align with commercial interests, driving consumer behavior and perpetuating the spectacle.\n\nThe division between reality and Instagram (the spectacle) distorts the overall social experience. People may prioritise creating content for Instagram over engaging in real-life experiences. The spectacle (Instagram) becomes the goal, with users striving to capture and share moments for the platform rather than for their intrinsic value.\n\"But the split within this totality mutilates it to the point of making the spectacle appear as its goal.\"\n\nInstagram presents itself as a platform filled with positivity, glamour, and idealized lifestyles. The content often seems perfect and beyond reach, creating an impression of an unattainable ideal. \"The spectacle presents itself as something enormously positive, indisputable and inaccessible. It says nothing more than \u201cthat which appears is good, that which is good appears. The attitude which it demands in principle is passive acceptance which in fact it already obtained by its manner of appearing without reply, by its monopoly of appearance.\"  People consume content without questioning its authenticity or underlying reality because the platform dominates visual culture. Its design and user interface encourage scrolling, not always critical engagement. \n\n\"In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false.\"\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "Social media doesn't neatly map onto Debord's concept of the spectacle, because media in his era was quite different. It was broadcast from centralized sources, usually government-sponsored (in Europe); viewers could only receive content, not create it; media could not be re-experienced, the viewer was at the mercy of the broadcast schedule; and there was far less content available. \n\nThere is much of value in Debord's text, but it must be read in context, with an understanding of how media has changed.",

Debord accurately illustrates how technological advances enhance surveillance and control in capitalist power structures. It doesn't matter that he doesn't predict or anticipate social media as such, it is about how such a thing is used as a structure of power, surveillance and control, something that is as accurate today as it was then, and will remain accurate for as long as capitalism persists.",
