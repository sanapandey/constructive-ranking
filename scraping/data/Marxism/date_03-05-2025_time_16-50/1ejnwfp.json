I was just talking with a friend who doubts many facts about COVID and vaccines because \u201cthe government lies\u201d. I responded by pointing out that non government agencies as well as non allied governments around the world have very similar findings which strongly indicates the US govt isn\u2019t just making the numbers up. But it got me thinking, I feel like most people I\u2019ve talked to can list areas where the US government has an incentive to lie and therefore we\u2019re more cautious about the information they give on that topic. (The first thing that comes to mind for me is when politicians funded by wealthy donors claim a wealth tax would hurt the poor).  But since the government isn\u2019t a black and white institution it got me thinking,  what are the areas they have the incentive to tell us the truth, where their financial and political interests overlap with (for example giving accurate health information so as to not create a situation that overwhelms or shows the flaws in the current healthcare system.",

But among other things, capitalism relies on workers' private behaviour for social reproduction and the reproduction of labour.\n\nAs a broker to capital, the state will make statements contributing to the maintenance and efficiency of these reproductive processes. These might be \"honest\" and factual or not. The state might disseminate medical facts that protect and preserve public health, or give beneficial advice about conduct in emergencies, etc. Even if state language is benign its circulation is grounded in necessity, not goodwill or honesty.",

            "body": "Interdepartmental communications. If you\u2019re the government, the last thing you want is for your own institutions believing each others\u2019 bullshit.\n\n  \nWe can find out loads of accurate information from even the most authoritarian regimes, because it didn\u2019t matter what they were saying to their own people or other countries. When it comes to communication between different departments, accuracy is incredibly important, and if you let department X believe all of the stuff department Y tells the public, department X is going to suffer. So most functional governments don\u2019t do that. Instead they do truthful communication at higher and higher levels of security.\n\n  \nThis is why certain documents are classified. The government does have to have truthful communication within itself to function. When we talk about uncovering government plots this is usually the reason, because groups like the FBI and CIA aren\u2019t just doing things for themselves, but on behalf of certain other departments, like the DoD, DoE, SEC, and so on and so on.\n\n  \nAnd the truth is governments just aren\u2019t very good at hiding this shit. In classic conspiracies like JFK you may be able to get away with it with like three key people, but in that case that\u2019s not exactly \u201cthe CIA\u201d assassinating JFK, that\u2019s three people abusing their authority. In the case of Covid, this was such a huge undertaking by multiple government departments that the amount of communication makes it mathematically impossible to hide something like \u201cyeah we put rat poison in the vaccines but shh don\u2019t tell anyone\u201d. To believe otherwise you\u2019d have to imagine the government is competent enough to hide that information but dumb enough to believe it\u2019s own bullshit, and that\u2018s when you leave the realm of institutional critique and start trying to figure out what evil individuals are responsible (e.g. Jews, Communists, the Irish, etc.)",

Your government releases budget data which is verifiable and reliable usually, it\u2019s just the ideological stuff that comes along with it. Similarly for most things you can find government reports and data on it. The military is the most egregious example of it where they are quite proud generally of their military spending and on what. Context and source is important. If your government admits to something shamelessly and just says it\u2019s actually a good thing actually, then chances are they did the thing (it\u2019s just not good). \n\nRemember government doesn\u2019t just report to government or people but also to capital/business - the \u201cshareholders\u201d of the government. You can often find these reports quite plainly and easily, it\u2019s just translating them into useful info.",

If the situation is too complex, then you should look at scientific authorities on the matter and see what the consensus is on the subject and take that as a meter for what is likely true. The government lies about a lot of things.\n\n\nIf this got downvoted, I'm not sure what else to say as there is, unfortunately, no alternative to what I said.",

As much as I've been cynic-pilled, the older I get, the more I see politicians actually trying to accomplish their campaign promises, for better or for worse.\n\n\nOf course, this doesn't account for lies of omission. To use your example of the anti-wealth tax politician, they are correct in that a wealth tax will raise taxes...they just don't specify on whom the taxes will be raised.\n\n\nAnother example, during COVID, a lot of conflicting information came out, which was used as evidence that the government lies...ignoring that COVID was a rapidly developing situation and the facts were not yet known (and still probably aren't).",

That is it. \n\nThe incentive to be honest exists so long as it remains within the benefit of the State to remain honest. If backroom dealings, falsified data/news reports, and the delegitimization of democratic processes reach a point where honesty no longer best serves the interests of the State, that is when the State will no longer choose to be honest with its citizens. \n\nThink about it this way\u2026 if corporations exist solely to create profit for shareholders, they will pursue any business activities that they believe will generate the most profit possible. If that means child labor or sweatshops, they are going to be using child labor and sweatshops. If these were to no longer become economically profitable, either due to State regulations or advances in productivity/technology, then corporations would no longer choose to use these methods of production.",
