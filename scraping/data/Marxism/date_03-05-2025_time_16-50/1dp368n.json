    "selftext": "I just finished reading that text and realized that, on the second part, the way Marx characterizes the jewish religion - e.g. it being the religion of the \"practical and personal necessities\" - sounded quite strange to me, as he doesn't really cite the torah or the talmud. Maybe it's something he takes from the Bauer texts? I really don't get it. BTW i've read it in portuguese and \"practical and personal necessitites\" is just my free translation to english.",

Most of the arguments marx addresses come from Bauer or general german antisemitism at the time.\n\nPart one of \"on the jewish question\" deals with the 'sabbath jew' (i.e. religiously practicing jews). Marx tears apart all arguments \\*against\\* granting jews citizenship based on their religion. Marx's point here is that Bauer's political-philosophical arguments against Jewish citizenship are wrong and bad.\n\nPart 2 deals with the \"worldly jew\", the \"rich jew\", the jew as portrayed by antisemites. Marx's point in part two is \"Ok bauer all this shit you're saying about Jews is true of civil society in general not just jews. Hence where you (Bauer) say \"we must get rid of the jews to get rid of greed etc\" I (Marx) say \"we must get rid of civil society to get rid of greed\".",

            "body": "The essay \u201cOn the Jewish Question\u201d belongs to a time in which Marx was a prominent member of a group of idealist philosophic reformers known as the Young Hegelians. In general, it was thought that Feuerbach had opened up the floodgates to an atheistic/materialistic philosophy by taking Hegel and replacing every instance of \u201cIdea\u201d with \u201cMatter.\u201d Thus, multiple bad conceptions were maintained. Feuerbach kept the emphasis on theology and the critique of religion as the highest science, Stirner kept the sequestered Ego, and Bauer took on Hegel\u2019s radicalized history full-fold (which Marx rips apart in the *German Ideology*, written after \u201cOn the Jewish Question\u201d).\n\nMarx at this point was, in the main, a Feuerbachian, and thus still locked away in an idealist framework. His critique of Bauer was not quite ready to progress to the materialism of saying, \u201cJews are people influenced by their material surroundings, who influence them in kind,\u201d but rather went down the idealist rabbit-hole of finding the \u201cworldly religion,\u201d the concrete essence, the idea, the monad, or the substance of the Jew. \n\nIn so doing, he adopted Feuerbach\u2019s position, which was that Judaism was a lesser stage of Christianity. It\u2019s faux pas to use thesis-antithesis-synthesis, and as a whole I\u2019d say don\u2019t, but for the sake of clarity, Feuerbach\u2019s contribution was that the thesis was polytheism, the antithesis was Judaism, and the synthesis was Christianity. Marx injects an analysis of civil society which was generally lost to Feuerbach, introducing the \u201cworldly\u201d element of \u201chusktering\u201d to the Jew, which is merely a temporal expression of the creation of the \u201cego\u201d in preparation for Christianity. The language he uses is antisemitic, and you can make an argument that the Other-ing was antisemitic\u2014I\u2019d sooner say it was well-meaning if deeply wrong.\n\nThe ultimate point of the essay is arguing with Bauer over whether any special attention needs to be paid to the historical plight of the Jews. Bauer, as a full idealist, says no\u2014once they have equal rights, they will become an equal people; Marx, as a burgeoning materialist, says yes\u2014it is not enough to give people equality in political affairs, you need to fight to uplift them in society. That is far from an antisemitic message, and the purity of his aims are, I think, better demonstrated in the *Holy Family*:\n\n> The Jews' desire for emancipation and the desire of the Christian states to \"classify\" Jews in \"their government scheme\"\u2014as though the Jews had not long ago been classified in the Christian government scheme!\u2014lead Absolute Criticism [Bauer's philosophy - Orchid] to prophecies on the *decay of nationalities*. See by what a complicated detour Absolute Criticism arrives at a present historical movement\u2014namely, by the *detour of theology*. \n\nChapter 6.\n\n> The *Jews* (like the Christiana) *are* fully *politically emancipated* in various states. Both Jews and Christians are far from being *humanly* emancipated. Hence there must be a *difference* between *political* and *human* emancipation. The essence of political emancipation, i.e., of the developed, modern state, must therefore be studied. On the other hand, states which cannot yet *politically* emancipate the Jews must be rated by comparison with the perfected political state and shown to be under-developed states.\n\nIbid.",

            "body": "Several individual points to be addressed, because I constantly see this portrayed as a simple issue one way or another, and it is not.\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, yes, On the Jewish Question is a response to Bauers *book* On the Jewish Question.\u00a0I haven't found a free English or French translation of Bauer's work, and I do not read German, so I haven't actually read it. This is an important point.\n\n\nLook for an English translation of Bauer's original work. Go on google, wikipedia, look wherever. You could probably run it through a translator or find one for sale, but it's not an easily accessible text. Not like Marx's booklet sized review.\n\n\nSecondly, what Marx wrote was undoubtedly antisemitic. There are multiple instances jn Marx' writing where he is racist and antisemitic. There should be no real pushback against this! Why is *anybody* surprised by a German man in 19th century Germany being antisemitic?\n\n\nHowever, Marx' antisemitism, while abhorrent, is matched in scope of writing by his anti-Christianity and religion in general. Marx saw religion as a distraction from the achievement of material liberation, but he also acknowledged it as \"the soul of a soulless world, the opium of the masses.\"\n\n\nHere i will diverge a bit into what that specific line meant to Marx biographically. While the interpretation is often that he meant \"it makes them numb,\" or \"it makes them high,\" because of associations of \"opium\" with addictions or Oscar Wilde, I will point out that in Marx' and personal life, this was a miracle drug in terms of genuine medicine. It was often used to assist in the passing of people who were terminally ill with diseases like cholera. Marx held three of his children dead in his arms during his life. Two as infants, and one as a seven year old. His name was Edgar, but Marx called often called him his little \"fly,\" or \"fox.\"\n\n\nTo return to Marx' relationship with Judaism, his mom did not speak much German. She spoke an old dialect of Dutch Yiddish. Records of her are sparse, but sources indicate she converted to lutheranism a whole year after the rest of family (as mandated by German law - this was a forced conversion). I believe one of her daughters mentioned that she continued to say various prayers in Hebrew and Yiddish after she converted.\n\n\nMarx had a loving relationship with his secular father (Heinreich Marx, though he was born Herschele bn Mordekhai haLevi, from a prominent rabbinical family, many of whom maintained illegal contact after these forced conversions), and they both maintained correspondence with each other. Marx was buried, at his request, with a locket with a photograph of his father. His relationship with his mother is not really recorded. There's nothing explicitly negative, I believe there is a letter to her daughter where she calls a young Marx \"bad with money,\" but there isn't much on their relationship. The language barrier probably didn't help.\n\n\nWhen considering Marx' antisemitism, consider this as well: when marx was a teen, an armed guard arrived at his father's door during a dinner party. They dressed him down in front of his guests, treated him with suspicion for having been Jewish, disregarded his position as a lawyer, and generally disrupted the evening. This incensed young Marx, and I wonder how much he understood it to be an act of antisemitism upon his father, a man who was \"no longer\" a Jew.\n\n\nFor Marx, however, his own \"Jewish question\" was challenging. He was not religiously Jewish, but halakhically, he was Jewish. His mother was Jewish. He was circumcised. He lived in 19th century Prussia, and this was enough for most people to peg him as \"a Jew.\" But he was not raised Jewish. He never observed Shabbos, he read no Hebrew, and - obviously - he was quite antisemitic. Not *as* antisemitic as Bruno Bauer, because at a level, Marx understood that he was being targeted both for being a communist *and* for being perceived as Jewish.\u00a0\n\n\nIncidentally, that's why he doesn't cite the Torah or Talmud - he doesn't read Aramaic or Hebrew. Hes probably familiar with the Old Testament, maybe the popular German Lutheran translations (Luthers exegetical work contributed to the rise of antisemitism in Germany that culminated in the Holocaust). For Talmud, all he is going off of are the \"official\" translations into German, which are often distributed on pamphlets and contained decontextualized quotes to make people afraid of Jews.\n\n\nSeveral of his contemporaries dismissed his ideas as being \"Jewish,\" and that trend continues through people like Hitler, David Duke, Alex Jones, and probably Jordan Peterson at some point. A number of rabbis have written statements or thoughts on Marx' varied works and they dont see him as being particularly connected to Jewish culture or identity or religion whatsoever. And for Marx himself, that was not something he ever wrote about. He never wrote about his own Judaism, and when writing about \"Jews\" he clearly does not identify himself with them. Marx reportedly helped an orthodox Jewish union organize in France during his brief time there, but there is not much information on that. He didn't write about it.\n\n\nMarx' antisemitism is *significantly* different from the antisemitism of Hitler or Stalin or Lenin or modern antisemitic groups like neo-nazis or Islamic fundamentalists who ascribe to the hadith on killing Jews. I imagine that Marx - being an insanely smart person by any and all accounts worth considering - was probably aware of the fact that even though he didn't see himself as Jewish, many, *many* people did.",
