There were 600 players before they shut it down.",

            "body": "That's not how LTV works, merely putting a large amount of potentially collective labour into something does not mean it just has high value. As value is a social phenomenon labour must be socially necessary to add value, it is possible that not very much was done, therefore, the value and exchange value are low. Now usually people are only hired to do socially necessary labour but for game companies that is usually a projection as games take time, if they made a loss they did not predict the value correctly. But they are only one firm and will be corrrslondly punished by the market.",
