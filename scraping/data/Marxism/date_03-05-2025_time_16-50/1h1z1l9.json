    "selftext": "Gramsci's ideas sound incredibly interesting but AFAIK, he's notoriously hard to read, so I'd start with a couple of introductions and secondary literature. Currently I'm reading the book on Gramsci edited by Chantal Mouffe - not the easiest read but not particularly tough, either. \n\nWhat other books should I read before I dive into the original prison notebooks?",

            "body": "He's notoriously hard to read because he was writing in a deliberately obtuse fashion to get his work past the censor. It's basically the work of Lenin and other Bolsheviks, but written in code so that the censor reading it would go 'huh, he's writing about academics these days - lol, that's not a threat'. Much of his work is basically a set of manuals on how to train Bolshevik cadres and build a cadre organisation.  \n  \nA whole variety of western academics have latched onto it because they get the ick if they feel like the ideas are actually going to change anything, and Gramsci's writings seem to offer new ideas without getting so close to actual revolutions. There is an awful lot of trash about Gramsci out there which has to be avoided. The man gave his life for the cause, and all kinds of very comfortable middle class academics have tried to neuter him.",

            "body": "Carlucci and Peter ives have some great books on Gramsci, and Linguistic systems if you wanna read. Peter ives work is called 'language and hegemony in Gramsci' and Carlucci's work is titled 'Gramsci and Languages: Unification, Diversity and Hegemony'. You can also read some interesting papers from Alessandro Carlucci himself here: [https://isonomia.uniurb.it/vecchiaserie/2010carlucci2.pdf](https://isonomia.uniurb.it/vecchiaserie/2010carlucci2.pdf), the language dispute is prolly one of the most intellectual challenging, and interesting things to read, and shows how complicated Gramscian linguistics are, considering the historical debate on this topic. I think, this is one of those interesting cases where secondary sources do a good job at explaining primary ones, rather then primary ones themselves, as Gramsci's original works, especially regarding the language debate is notoriously hard to crack and understand.  For a more in-depth understanding you can read 'Morphologische Untersuchungen auf dem Gebiete der indogermanischen Sprachen' by Ostoff and Brugmann of the Neo-grammarian school, and contrast those with Gramsci's and even Mario Bartoli's (Gramsci's teacher) position (for which you can read his Essays in spatial linguistics, something which mirrors what Gramsci would later expound).",
