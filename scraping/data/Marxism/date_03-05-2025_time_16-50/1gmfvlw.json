    "selftext": "I'm honestly frustrated that, in an era where we have apps to find people for casual sex or to sell secondhand items, we still don\u2019t have a widely accessible platform for mutual aid (not just for money), something where people can connect locally and offer or receive support for essential needs of all kinds. \n\nWe have the technology for instant connections, yet no coordinated platform for the working class, disabled individuals, or anyone needing assistance with daily problems people face. Imagine if there was an app that made it as easy to find a volunteer for grocery shopping, help with transportation, or skill-sharing as it is to find a used couch or a date. Instead, we have communities full of people needing support and others willing to offer it, but no accessible way to bring them together.\n\nSome might argue that funding such a platform would be the main challenge, but I\u2019m not convinced that\u2019s the biggest issue. We see individuals crowdfunding significant amounts of money on platforms like GoFundMe all the time. Plus, with the collective strength of leftist communities, crowdfunding and mutual aid for setup and upkeep costs (like server hosting) would be achievable if the right people coordinated it.\n\nWhat we really need is for IT professionals who are committed to mutual aid to offer their skills voluntarily to put this idea into practice and I refusd to believe there are no leftist ITers out there (in particular cause so many people in IT will do random projects to boost their portfolio). \n\n1. Backend Developer/DevOps - Luckily, we already have someone for this role who can handle the server, databases, and other infrastructure.\n2. Frontend Developer - To build a responsive and accessible interface for web and mobile.\n3. UI/UX Designer - To make the platform intuitive, inclusive, and welcoming for all users.\n4. QA Tester - To ensure everything functions well across devices and meets accessibility standards.\n\nBeyond tech skills, we\u2019d need people dedicated to keeping the platform financially sustainable and accessible. Ideally, we\u2019d have folks committed to organizing mutual aid and gathering ongoing resources to help with monthly maintenance, like server costs, and finding volunteers for outreach /advertising the platform. \n\nPolitical ideologies are hollow if they don\u2019t translate into practical action, and I truly believe that if we had an easy way to connect, thousands of people would be eager to offer time, resources, or skills for their communities. Yes, grassroots organizing through local groups is vital, but let\u2019s be real, many community orgs struggle to meet the needs of all members, especially disabled and low-income folks. Many don\u2019t even provide basic accommodations, like masking, which excludes some people from even participating.\n\nSo, if you're a leftist IT professional or just someone with resources or passion for mutual aid, let\u2019s make this happen. Reach out to me, and let\u2019s talk about building a platform that can truly bring mutual aid into our communities in a sustainable, accessible way. \n\n(And yes I understand \"it is all not THAT easy\", but nothing about our lives is \"easy\". That should not be used as an argument to avoid helping eachother). \n\n",

I would love to see some open source tech developed that would help connect people with excess resources to people with scarce resources in a non-transactional way.",
