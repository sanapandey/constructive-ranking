    "selftext": "I want to finally get to reading communist manifesto, but I'm a non-native english speaker. I do think my english is good as I have 0 problem talking in english with friends, but it's a bit different when it comes to more \"professional\" language, esp in the area I'm not knowledgeable in. I'm a newbie Marxist and only been interested in politics for a year, and it's mainly just following online content creators. My native language is polish, and I was wondering what was your choice in which language you read Marx in?",

            "body": "With how badly \"Aufheben\" is translated, I wonder what else do we lose by reading Marx with these translations...\n\nBecause **\"abolition\"** (how it's translated in my language) isn't very correct. And it's the main thing Marx takes from Hegel's dialetics! So many people read this and clearly only interpret it as \"destruction of capitalism,\" which couldn't be more wrong. I've seen people advocating for **primitivism** citing Marx\n\nIt's hard to find any translations that emphasize its contradictory, non-intuitive meaning, or at least the difficulty of translating this term into different languages. The best effort I've seen is calling it \"dialetical sublation\".",

                    "body": "My Dover edition of the 1844 Manuscripts contains the following note on terminology by translator Martin Milligan:\n\n> *Aufheben* (literally \"to raise up\") has two opposed meanings in popular speech. (i) It can mean \"to abolish,\" \"to cancel,\" \"to annul,\" \"to do away with,\" etc. (ii) It can mean \"to preserve.\" Hegel, valuing the word just because of this double, negative and positive, meaning (see *The Logic of Hegel* tr. Wallace, 2nd ed., p. 180), uses it to describe the positive-negative action by which a higher logical category or form of nature or spirit, in superseding a lower, both \"annuls\" it and \"incorporates its truth.\" Unfortunately, there is no single English word with the same double meaning, except \"sublate,\" a technical term adopted for the purpose by some translators of Hegel; but as this is likely to be unintelligible to the general reader, it has not been used in the present volume. Instead, \"supersede\" has generally been used to render *aufheben*, where it seemed that the word was being used in this double, positive-negative sense, and occasionally it has been rendered as \"transcend.\" Where, on the other hand, it seemed that *aufheben* was being used simply or predominantly in its commonplace negative sense, the negative words listed above\u2014\"abolish,\" \"annul,\" etc.\u2014have been employed.\n\nDoes that adequately capture the subtle meaning of aufheben for you? I don't understand German so i can't weigh in on such things, but i do care a lot about translation, esp of key terms like this.",

I tend to prefer my native Dutch, simply because German translates pretty well into Dutch, much better than it does into English. However, there are not always decent Dutch translations available, whereas decent English translations are pretty readily available. But still, a lot of terms simply do not translate well into English at all, and that should be taken into account. I cannot speak for Polish in that regard.",
