With examples from insider trading laws in the alternative data business, to new forms of micromanagement through 'bossware', this essay argues that we have moved away from Foucault's disciplinary society into Deleuze's \"society of control\", where power is exercised not through disciplinary codes of behavior but through flexible axiomatic modulations strengthened by a monopoly of information from a financial aristocracy.",
