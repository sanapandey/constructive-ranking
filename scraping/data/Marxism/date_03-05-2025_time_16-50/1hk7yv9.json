            "body": "Each represents a fundamental split of the labor movement across over 100 years.\n\n  \nThe First International split things into just anarchists and Marxists. \n\n  \nThe next big major split would be between the Marxists who are more in favor of attempts to reform from inside the electoral system (Bernstein and others), and those who rejected that as not the main avenue but rather a thing that can only help or hinder the real thing that needs to happen: revolution.\n\n\n\nStalinism is the name given to the ideology of the USSR after Lenin died and Stalin took over. It's used synonymous with Marxism-Leninism, but also as a slur for it.\n\n\n\nTrotskyism refers to an adherence to Trotsky's thoughts and writings on how the USSR should have developed as opposed to how Stalin did things. It's morphed a bit in that later some Trotskyists differ somewhat on the issues originally pinned by Trotsky.\n\n  \nBolshevism is, depending on the person, could represent any, or all, of the above three.\n\n  \nAround the time of Stalin and Trotsky, a few Leninists rejected both. You can see this in people like Bordiga.  They consider themselves to be more Leninist than Lenin.\n\n\n\nSimilarity around the time of Lenin, a third group was both opposed to Lenin and Bernstein. They reject how much power is put into the party and instead want to see that in the Soviets instead. This would be the Anti-Bolshevik Communists.\n\n\n\nSyndicalism is the anarchist type idea that came to prominence in the 1920's in opposition to Marxism which would basically see unions running the political economy.\n\n\n\nMaoism can be defined in two ways, but they both also came out of the Sino-Soviet Split and how Mao differed from Khrushchev oh actual policy, or a lot of the time just in words. Mao differed due to how he led a revolution from the countryside (peasant-led) instead of a revolution led from the cities (proletariat-led).  The other definition of the term would refer to how later disciples of Mao synthesized his theory and action after his death.",

            "body": "So, there are many many different leftist/Marxist/communist variations, but they can all probably be put into 1 of 4 main categories.\n\nReformism: Soft socialism or promoting a welfare-state like Norway or Sweden without changing private property relations or calling for Revolution. Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders as well as most prominent left socialist political figures fall into this category. So do people who stop at protest, boycotts, and petitioning their political representatives. Not that these things are reformist by themselves, but doing them and them alone as if that is what is going to affect change (and not instead to gather people to build for further action) is.\n\nAnarchism/Narodnism/Blanquism: Small group or individual action. Think Pal action, Just Stop Oil, or the Anarchists who think making insulin in their basement is the way to beat capitalism. It's a type of extreme individualism that doesn't organise en masse but only in small direct action groups.\n\nThe two above ideologies are Not Marxism/Communism but frequently get confused as such, where members of both groups will also sometimes identify as Marxist/Socialist/Communist.\n\nThen you have the two broad flavours of Communism:\n\nStalinism: The idea that Socialism must start in a single country and develop for an extended period, guided by a powerful state, before developing into Communism (Socialism in one country). It sees the responsibility of a transition to socialism as that of each individual country, and that third world countries are required to undergo a period of Capitalism to develop the productive forces before they can be successfully socialist (and the Russian revolution was an exception, not the rule)(Two Stage Theory). Pretty much every variant of hard Communism falls under Stalinism due to his inheritance of the third international and USSR effectively making him the sole authority on Communism and no other Communist theory presenting the key idea in the second flavour. Marxist-Leninism in particular was actually a phrase created by Stalin himself and is just another term for Stalinism. \n\nTrotskyism: The idea that revolutions will start where Capitalism is weakest, not strongest, but that once a Socialist Revolution happens once, anywhere, the world enters a state of \"Permanent Revolution\" (Hence the theory being called Permanent Revolution) where it becomes the responsibility of Communists in every country to start revolutions in their own countries in support of the first revolution as soon as successfully possible so they can all join together in an international socialist alliance and support each other. Trotskyism directly rejects any waiting period before socialism in any country. It also emphasises a much weaker and more liberal state, and for workers to take a direct role in planning their workplaces and the wider economy instead of the strong state approach of Stalinism (although still strong enough to maintain the abolition of private property).",
