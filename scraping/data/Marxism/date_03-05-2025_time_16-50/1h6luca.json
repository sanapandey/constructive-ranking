With closer inspection and modern archaeological evidence we can see that a this perscriptivist view of class struggle is not as straightforward and a loooooot more granular, especially in pre-history.",

            "body": "Mao's writing emphasizes the particular aspects of colonial China which necessitated him analyzing the lower classes of the peasantry (non-land-owning, partial land-owning) as the primary Chinese revolutionary class. At the time of his early writing there were 500,000,000 peasants in China but only 2,000,000 industrial workers. Nearly all the industrial proletariat were employed by foreign or colonial capitalists. There was little industrial infrastructure, primarily manufacturing and railroad, nearly none of it owned/controlled by Chinese bourgeoisie. Further, this was concentrated in Shanghai, so it would be unlikely that the Communist vanguard of the industrial workers would have had much influence over the vast majority of Chinese population.\n\nThis agrarian/peasantry approach has been the model in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Peru, and Nepal; notably not in western Europe or North America.",

            "body": "I'm currently reading Decolonial Marxism by Walter Rodney, and the first section is a defense of Marxism and use of its methods in 3rd world countries, though people applying those methods will have to start from scratch, not having the prior art that those in the west do. He believes that the methods of Marxism are universal, and the detailed study of class society is vital to any liberatory movement in the world and also that the fundamental irreconcilability of communism and capitalism still holds in non-western nations, if only by virtue of western capitalism being globe-spanning. He uses an analogy like you would not question in a non-western nation using western science like electricity, similarly you should not balk at using a scientific method applied to societies, aka Marxism, just because it comes from the west. He also gives examples of how African leaders eschewed class analysis of their societies because of its western-ness, and the cases where that decision led to their downfall being overthrown by rising class forces of owners/planters/bosses/etc.\n\nI recommend checking out that book, and really anything by Walter Rodney.",

Their criticisms have often been from western communists that know or at least think a communist revolution in France or the US would lead to a better AES state than say China or Cuba. And are projecting Eurocentric views of \u201crevolution\u201d on to places where it really isn\u2019t applicable. \n\nTo simplify, oppressed people in regions western hegemony destroyed can\u2019t be expected to adopt western values or social conditions or at least can\u2019t be expected to hold them above the priorities of the working class.",

I don\u2019t care if the organization / country or individual has a hammer and sickle with busts of Lenin or Marx lying around. \n\n\n\nI also find this line of reasoning very racist. As if Arabs, Chinese, and Russians are incapable of not being horrible to marginalized communities.",
