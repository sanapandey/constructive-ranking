So I'm asking this question earnestly in the spirit of a NoStupidQuestions post.\n\nMy initial thought is: investors and market perception. But why must there be investors? In the case of companies that subsist on VC injections and below-cost pricing until they've conquered enough market segment to ratchet up a profit, I get it, because that model relies on investors from the outset.\n\nBut why does Starbucks or Southwest Airlines need to show growth? Why isn't consistent profit enough?Why does it need to increase at a *rate*?\n\nBeyond simple greed, what is it about the capitalist framework that demands upward trends?\n\n  \nEdit: I really appreciate all the comments. Learning a lot.",

That's because in principle, it can be exchanged now for a greater holding of any alternative, slower-growing investment than could have been obtained with the same money at the time of its original purchase.\n\nIf you invest in shoes and shoes go up faster than bricks, you can sell your shoes later and buy more bricks than you could have to start with.\n\nA perverse effect of this may be that some stocks that are observed to be growing fast, grow still faster.\n\nAnother perverse effect may be that some stocks that have crashed recover quickly as investors \"buy the dip\". \n\nIf these kinds of dynamics make it seem to you that stock prices often poorly reflect the practical value of investments, your intuition is working.\n\nInvestors in practice prefer to moor their decisions to concrete conditions of stock prices: little details such as \"the shoes actually exist\". However, they must often settle for deriving their judgements about prices from information provided by trusted intermediaries: for example the ratings agencies whose distorted analysis of \"AAA\" debt derivatives triggered the global financial crisis of 2008. \n\nAnd then real markets feature costs of exchange, scarcity of stocks, the finitude of any investor's free capital, and the irreducible uncertainty of price movements (see such actuarial esoterica as \"sovereign risk\" and \"Knightian uncertainty\"). This in turn leads to a whole spectrum of investor behaviours and demands conditioned by circumstance, knowledge and methods, that nevertheless all still prefer growth by degree when other factors are equal.",

It takes on a new layer of valuation in the market, and thereby adopts the incentives inherent to trading and investment. Meaning it has to swim or sink, but cannot tread water like I imagine a local restaurant could be content to do (i.e. stay in business as long as they can cover overhead).\n\nIf I understand correctly.",

However, when a company is publicly listed it is wholly or partly sold off (the IPO), and then is subject to very different regulatory law.\n\nIts shares are listed on a particular stock exchange (it can change later subject to mountains of paperwork I believe) and it has to have shareholder meetings, a Board, etc. The people in charge all have \"fiduciary duty\", most famously to \"maximise shareholder value\", but also regular disclosures of profit and loss, shareholder meetings, and so on. And if it's demonstrably failing it can be \"placed into administration\" where the regulator comes in and install hand-picked leadership to recover lost value, there are specialists who do that work in some cases.\n\nIt is a weird system with lots of shitty aspects that's also variable around the world. In the case of a listed company there's greatly reduced autonomy for company directors, but corporations law also insulates company directors from legal consequence to a great degree.",

All Capitalist together produce X of all commodities, why pay all workers together Y. Y is always smaller then X. X-Y =P profit. But how P component Of commodity to be sold? Workers can not buy it, they only have Y. In ideal situation, All profit reinvested in new factories, new means of production. In this case,  system is in balance. All produced commodities sold to workers to live and to Capitalists to grow. But nothing guaranty this situation. Opposite of true, Capitalists do not want to invest unless there is guaranty demand, do not want to risk there profits. In this case we observe what we see now, infinite grow of debt. Debt is some one else assets. So, if Capitalists can not or do not want to invest, system balanced by workers borrow from Capitalists in order to consume and system temporary balanced. Profit become debt of workers.\n\nEverything Capitalists did not spend for grow become debt. And this debt can never been payed off and always grow. When it grow so big no more can be borrowed, system crush, We have 1929 or 2008 crisis,  1929 was solved by WAR which destroy assets and debts. We are still in 2008 crisis which was masked for a time by money printing. But now we run out of this option.\n\nRisk of WW3 is evident, the only problem it will end civilization, we have nukes now.",

            "body": "There are really two questions here which need to be addressed separately. Before those, we accept the basic assumption that capitalism is a specific system for extracting surplus value from an exploited group of people, which operates according to laws we can understand (the same as slavery, feudalism etc are systems for extracting surplus value operating according to their own laws). The very motive force of capitalism is, therefore, to extract profit. \n\n1) why do individual quantities of capital (either businesses owned by an individual or corporations with stock traded on stock market and everything in between) seek growth of a) profits and b) the size and scale of the business?\n\n2) why does capitalism as a system seek growth in a) profit and b) the size and scale of the capitalist system?\n\n  \n**ONE**: each individual quantity of capital must grow or be destroyed (this happens in the form of bankruptcies etc). Assuming there is no monopoly of production or a market, individual capital is under pressure to improve productivity. This can be by intensifying the work done by the workers, or by improving the machinery/process.  If you can produce more or at a lower cost than a competitor (or both), then the competitor must improve their own machinery/processes, carry out an even more intensive exploitation of labour, or go out of business. The more profit you have, the more you can put into R&D and new plant/machinery etc. This is the pressure from within the logic of the capitalist system itself. I'm assuming that economies of scale are well understood here, and no comment is needed on that.\n\n**TWO**: As a system capitalism has to overcome a number of contradictions, the primary one being *the tendency for the rate of profit to fall (TRPF)*. This is covered in Capital III. The capitalist system operates on the basis of pumping value out of the working class. Through a given cycle the capitalist will go from C+V (capital and wages) to C + V + Pp (capital + wages + potential profit). In order to turn potential into actual profit the capitalist must sell the goods/services to someone else. How is it possible to do this if the workers produce more value than they receive in the form of wages? This is the contradiction which makes crises of over-production possible, but capitalism is not in a permanent state of crisis. It resolves this problem by reinvesting profits in new branches of production (e.g. the introduction of plastics, the introduction of railways etc), by expanding production or by renewing the stock of machinery and equipment. To paraphrase Marx's explanation, the capitalist market can be divided into two sections - A being production for consumption by workers and capitalists (food, consumer goods, consumer services, luxury items etc) and B being production for capital (mining equipment, oil tankers, 747s etc). The contradiction is overcome by reinvesting the value extracted from the workers, minus ground rent, taxes, fund for luxuries etc for the capitalist and so on (a lot of people claiming to follow Marx stop here and end up giving reformist solutions to 'crises of overproduction').\n\nThe question becomes, then, why doesn't capital endlessly spiral upwards, in a virtuous cycle of production, consumption and reinvestment? Because the capitalist system is made up of individual capitalists or groups of them, seeking the maximum return on their investment (see above). At a certain stage of development, the capitalists stop reinvesting the profit because of the TRPF. The rate of profit in individual sectors changes as investment moves in. As the rate of profit in a branch of industry falls, capital flows out into a sector with a higher rate of profit. The British, French etc set about colonising the planet as a way of opening up new areas for investment where the fixed capital was extremely low i.e. extremely high rate of profit.  \n\n\nAs capital is invested in factories, machinery, land etc the ratio of fixed capital (C) to variable capital (V) changes. Keep in mind C *does not create new value, it simply transfers value to the product.* New value is produced by V - via the wages paid for labour power. As the mass of fixed capital increases, the amount of profit made per \u00a31 of investment decreases. Each time a capitalist invests, there is a certain risk of losing that investment, and an ever growing mass of capital is required to enter existing branches of industry (imagine what it is like trying to start a new mass production car company to compete with Ford and Nissan - I doubt Bezos could do it, and Musk has attempted it only in a niche market with large scale government support). Crises emerge because the rate of profit across the entire capitalist system is too low, resulting in capitalists holding back profits until better options are available. The mechanism for overcoming the contradiction of extracting more value than is paid for breaks down, and the crisis begins. The typical warning signs of a crisis are large capital flows into speculation (e.g. sub-prime mortgages, now AI imo) followed closely by bubbles (tulips, the internet, bitcoin).   \n  \nGetting out of crises requires new branches of industry for productive investment, new parts of the world to be opened up for investment, or a more intensive exploitation of the working class. Capitalism won't die of it's own accord, but the social and cultural degeneration the decline will lead to will be ugly.\n\nOh. Wait. That should be *is* ugly.",

                    "body": "It depends on the particular stocks being invested in, as older companies and companies in certain sectors like finance and utilities tend to pay out more of their return in dividends. This of course leads the dividend composition of indices, such as the S&P 500, to vary significantly depending on what kind of companies are seeing the most investment in a given period of time. For instance, in the 1940s and 1970s, over half of the total return of the S&P came from dividends while, historically, dividends have only accounted for around 1/3 of the return. \n\nThe particular composition of the total return is largely irrelevant, though, except from a tax perspective as capital gains taxes are typically much lower than income tax (nonqualified dividends are taxed as income).",

This is a great clip from an old movie showing this mindset: https://youtu.be/gtvTY3hYYQ4\n\nIn aggregate though, capital needs to constantly expand. Note how GDP must continuously be increasing as well. For Marx this is due to: \n\nCompetition and accumulation: Capitalists are compelled to continually reinvest profits into expanding production to maintain their competitive edge. Those who fail to do so risk being outcompeted and driven out of business and cease to be capitalists.\n\nThe tendency of the rate of profit to fall: As capitalists invest more in constant capital (machinery, technology) relative to variable capital (labor), the rate of profit tends to decline over time. To counteract this, capitalists must constantly seek new markets, resources, and ways to increase productivity.\n\nRealization of surplus value: For capitalists to realize the surplus value extracted from workers, they need to find buyers for their commodities. This necessitates the constant creation of new markets and consumer needs.",
