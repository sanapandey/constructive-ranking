In the 1950s, the black church was the backbones of black civil society in the Southeastern United States. Nowadays, data shows us that churches actually redirect social energy within themselves more than they direct it to other community initiatives. If you attended church in 1950, it meant you were more likely to volunteer in your community more generally or belong to a non-religious club. Nowadays, that's not true. Instead you are likely to volunteer only through your church and to only belong to church-affiliated clubs. This is especially true for evangelical and non-denominational churches which have seen the greatest growth. The book Bowling Alone has a whole chapter on this. \n\nThis lack of outside connection makes these institutions much more limited. And the few that still have more community-wide initiatives are often firmly part of a Democratic Party coalition and very openly used to tamp down on more radical elements in any given situation. \n\nSomeone can judge their local church for themselves but these institutions are not inherently winnable battlefields for us and to present them like that is lazy analysis and bad tactics.",

But I stand by the idea that you can't write these groups off.

That strikes close to home - every person with brown skin knows they are every bit as vulnerable, and the smart white people know they're not far behind.

Maybe you even believe them when they say it was a mistake. Or maybe you throw a rock back.  Either way it's soon resolved and the world moves on.\n\nA particular group of people regularly throws rocks, and routinely makes a habit of hiding behind legal and bureaucratic immunity whenever they're called out? Again and again and again for countless decades?  That breeds resentment, and the world doesn't move on.  \n\nAnd when such an event manages to make it into the national spotlight? It provides a focus for a communal righteous rage against injustice that's been constantly simmering just under the surface.  \n\nLike when a bully finally pushes someone far enough that they snap and strike back - the rage behind the counterattack was not fueled by this particular attack, it was fueled by a long line of such attacks by the bully and those like them.  \n\nAnd if nothing changes substantially - as it has failed to happen after every such outcry so far?  Then that rage is not released, it's only fueled further to continue simmering until the next time.",

A large and important set of supporting institutions were Black churches, including their ministers and their congregations. These churches provided meeting spaces, shared movement news and perspectives,  provided many movement activists and were also fundraising hubs. Nonviolent direct action included boycotts, freedom rides, sit-ins and other actions which were also calculated to achieve favorable press and put pressure on policy makers. There were also favorable court rulings won by the NAACP, like Brown vs. Board of education, which helped delegitimize segregation. Also as pointed out elsewhere in this thread legalized discrimination against Black people was used by the USSR to propagandize against and discredit the u.s. during the height of the cold war.\n\nAll of this combined to raise the costs of segregation & discrimination. In the end the scope of the victory of the civil rights movement was largely, but not exclusively, limited to ending de jure discrimination & segregation, and then also largely limited to the u.s. south. There was *major* pushback, and economic and social equality was definitely not achieved. At this point I also think it's important to acknowledge that racism isn't explainable purely by capitalism or by the material interests of white people. White supremacy has its own logic & momentum that is intertwined with but also partly independent of class oppression. In addition to material benefits for white people it also has psychological & ideological benefits which are not necessarily aligned with white peoples' material interests. Marx would label this as 'false consciousness' but regardless of that I think that this demonstrates that a purely materialist account of this, or any other movement, is necessary but insufficient.",

Millions of white soldiers also returned having been in a shared meat grinder relying on black soldiers to keep them supplied with food, ammo, replacement equipment, cigarettes, clothes, and on and on often under enemy fire.
