    "selftext": "EDIT: My title is confusing, I don't mean that only westerners hate China or that western marxists organizations hate China, I meant online/reddit marxists (which I erroneously thought to be mostly western) seem to be share this aversion towards China.\n\nFor some context, I'm from South America and a member of some marxist organizations irl and online (along with some other global south comrades). \n\nSince 2024 we're reading and studying about China and in the different organizations is almost universally accepted that they're building socialism both in the socioeconomical and the ideological fronts. (I'm sure of this too). \n\nI've been member of this and other socialism-related subreddits and I wanted to know reddit's people opinion about this so I used the search function and I was shocked. Most people opinion on China seems to derive from misinformation, stereotypes or plain propaganda, along with a shortsightedness about what takes to build socialism.\n\nWhy is this? Is this just propaganda-made infighting? Obviously I could be wrong about China and I want to hear arguments both sides but I can't believe the hard contrast between the people and organizations I've met and the reddit socialist community. \n\nI don't want an echo chamber so I genuinely ask this. However, I'd prefer to have a civil conversation that doesn't resort to simply repeat propaganda (both sides).",

I'm Asian and not exactly convinced of the \"China is building towards socialism\" narrative.\n\nMy mother is a mainlander and I've been to China several times. Let's just say life there is really no different from life anywhere else. The system China has is managed capitalism and the capitalism part is very evident. It's not as bad as the US but it ain't great either.\n\nThe big thing that irks me is that workers in China are having it really rough. Underemployment is rising, wages are low, overworking is the norm, abuse is rampant, etc. And there is nothing people can do to change things except \"tangping\" (quiet quitting).",

Liberal and some leftist people tend to praise Lopez Obrador and Sheinbaum as presidents of Mexico, when in fact they are at best slightly above of the average mexican politician. \n\nFor example; they have been ignoring a lot of public safety issues, organized crime, etc. and they are still clinging to oil as a resource Mexico needs, neglecting other industries. And they are ignoring the reform for an obligatory 40 hours max work week. Also the environmental damage, which the opposition is using as the typical whataboutism against their regime, like if the right and conservatives didn't do a lot of damage to the environment anyways.",

Many Western Marxists would update this list with- a society that would foster community,  allow maximum room for human diversity,  full flowering of creativity, and increase knowledge and technical capacities while preserving the environment. \n\nWhat are the achievements that China can boast of? It has achieved, for the moment, political stability. It has ended mass famine and moved many Chinese into the \"middle class\".  It has created a state militarily competent to defend its interests.\nSome of these things may be real, practical achievements in light of the limited space for development in a world of scarcity and Realpolitik\n\nBut to a Western Marxist- thos was never the promise of Marxism.",

Problem, no one's ever seen Western Marxism on the ground.  Pipe dream so far.\n\nBut Marx himself missed more than a few things. As you say, \"society needs balances ...and checks\", and KM didn't make allowance for that. He seemed to think that  a government of workers wouldn't need checks.   No allowance forthe hard to dispute premise, \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" Do you think it won't be a problem when there's abundance for all? Funny how some people with Plenty of Abundance seem to want Plenty More.\nAnother problem, but also an attraction of Marxism, is it's utopian idealism.  When you are promising people paradise, you can too easily excuse a lot of Sadly Broken Eggs on the way.  \"Bye and Bye\" there'll be no government, no army, no laws, no money, no war, no jails, no bosses- everyone just plain folks. \n\nYou can't point to any history to show how to get to that place.

                    "body": "Thank you for articulating what I was going to say in a far better and more comprehensive way. My big addition here would be simply to note that China has billionaires. Nobody will ever convince me that a society where billionaires and people in extreme poverty coexist is socialist, regardless if a few of those billionaires were disappeared after they became a problem to the Party. I would call what they\u2019ve had since Deng in the 70s \u201c*capitalism* with Chinese characteristics,\u201d not anything related to socialism.\n\nIt is true China has had success in lifting people out of poverty. In fact, most of the downward trend in global extreme poverty for the past several decades is attributable to China. It is also hard to fault China\u2019s foreign policy, particularly in regard to foreign aid to poorer countries. \n\nThat said, the way they got there was essentially by importing industrial capitalism from the US and the rest of the world. Even leaving aside issues of worker exploitation, that\u2019s brought significant problems to both China and the world. Although on a per capita basis, the US is far and away ahead in greenhouse emissions, China is now the largest emitter on an absolute basis, and it\u2019s not even close. China has truly embraced a lot of capitalist thought when it comes to the products they produce as well. Although there are higher end Chinese products available, most of what gets sold in markets like the US are cheap, disposable or practically disposable products that wouldn\u2019t pass regulatory approval in Europe. With such a dangerous beast as capitalism, feeding the dragon is almost as bad as being the dragon. Those more critical than I might even say that since China should theoretically have a better understanding of the dangers of capitalism than the West, that they may be equally or even more to blame than the West.\n\nI fail to see how any of this is compatible with Marxism, except for perhaps the simplistic notion that Marx\u2019s historical materialism claims that capitalism is always a precursor to socialism. I don\u2019t think Marx gave Asia or Africa much thought when he was writing. IMO, Mao, flawed though he and some of his ideas may have been, did far more to develop socialism than anyone in the past 50 years.",

Liked it or not, China really needed to bring in foreign resources and talents to get their domestic economy running again, even if it meant engaging in global capitalism.\n\nHowever, I think they went too deep. Workers rights and self determination, two big hallmarks of socialism was basically tossed to a side. Hell, it's gotten so problematic that I'd argue life for a worker is better in Scandinavia than China, not a good look for a supposedly socialist/communist superpower.",

Secondly within the capitalist global order what society will avpid stratification *or* destruction. Third USSR was there to learn from its missteps and I think China had a significantly more wise approach to building their industrial base\u00a0\n\n\nLast - if an industrial base is necesssry and those social relations that satisfy the definition of capital are necessary to the building of socialism, which I think is consensus because labor isnt socialized there can be no socialism.\n\n\nThis is the view thhat I wonder about like OP too. It makes Western (or whoever) communists come off as idealists who would opine about revolution as the globes petit bourgeoisie privileged af. We cant even maintain any labor unity or leftist presence yet we have the nerve to say China is \"state capital\" we cant conceive that certain conditions can be the same with different ends and means leading to them. Just bc youre familiar with US capital doesnt mean you can extrapolate what you know about American capital and apply it to China. IMO there is a balancing act because upsetting your economy with shocks like what these critics see as proper socialist market economics would *surely see the end of Chinese socialist experiment*.\u00a0",

The idea of \"western hemisphere\" comes straight out of the cold war playbook and refers to the US and its allies: Canada, democratic Europe (eastern Europe switching sides after the fall of the Soviet Union,) Oceania, Japan, South Korea, debatably also the Philipines and Indonesia.\n\nThe eastern hemisphere used to be USSR, China, North Korea, Cuba and debatably Vietnam and Cambodia. This lasted until China and Russia distanced themselves from each other under Khrushchev. Nixon's opening towards China started the disintegration of that bloc, the fall of the USSR finished it.\n\nThe third world used to mean the unaligned states movement. South America was always drawn towards that position, but the US used the Monroe doctrine to ensure they never managed to fully organize alongside the African and Asian unaligned countries. This is why South America never truly belonged to any bloc: the US used a combination of military force, coups and diplomacy to ensure most of the continent remains in a very close relationship to them, but never actually allowed them entry into any of their alliances. Mexico and central America are included in this, so we're technically not just talking about South America, but Latin America. The euphemism back then was \"US backyard/playground.\"\n\nToday, \"the West\" basically means rich capitalist states aligned with the US, BRICS means up and coming challengers to US hegemony, third world means sub-saharan Africa and MENA (middle-east and north Africa) means \"I'm scared of islamic terrorism and brown migrants\". South-east Asia and South America don't need any euphemisms and just get called their actual names.",

Mao was revisionist in many ways, and pretty much from the start argued for a degree of class collaborationism with the bourgeoise. Deng then essentially decided to take a market approach and allow the bourgeois to develop within the confines of a [\"bird cage economy\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chen_Yun#:~:text=The%20reforms%20of%20the%20early,to%20fly%20as%20he%20wishes.%22) where the bourgeoise are prevented from gaining political power. I think this was based on the practical realities of the time, where China was a peasant society with almost no industrial development, and this approach would allow China to integrate itself with the global capitalist system and develop by exporting to other countries, attract FDI, etc. It probably *was* the fastest path to development and the gambit seems to have paid off as China is by no means dominated by american capital or anything of the sort.\n\nI think the market-based approach is defensible given that it has been extremely successful in developing China, but there is no need for any socialist country to have billionaires, and given China has massive problems with corruption it would be foolish to say that the bourgeoise don't hold any political power. I think the difference when compared to the US is that you can't buy politicians to the same degree, and it does appear to be the case that the state represses the power of capitalists rather than the other way around.\n\nI personally suspect that the party is full of revisionists/anti-communists, but I do suspect that the top brass are genuine marxist-leninists, and in particular at least based on the rhetoric he has put out, Xi Jingping seems to be a shift towards more marxist ideas than any leader since Deng, but time will tell I guess.",

The shell of the state withers as this action fulfills its final purpose in history. Anyone who is unwilling to understand why the American state so conspicuously operates as an appendage to the affairs of the capital class necessarily ignores the historical foundations of American society. Seeing as the basis of social unity in this country was economic ties between individuals, there has always been an explicit bias towards private bodies. A situation in which large industrial entities have developed within the confines of preexisting state control is very different. In China, checks to corporate power come exclusively from the state, and many of their recent actions, especially in the realm of finance and its relation to micro-lenders for example, were largely executed to keep power in the hands of the state bank. Investments in the citizenry only occur so that the citizens can exercise their newfound strength on behalf of the state. We do not have a situation in which workers have organized the economy in such a way that it exists to serve their interests. Capital in a very real way continues to dominate their lives. State capital, as opposed to private capital, must have a way of working out some of its inherent contradictions through forms of public investment. I suppose we can conceptualize China as a capitalist state with a polyvalent social structure in which the state acts as the supreme capitalist.",

I think comrades here have put it great. I think it's the effect of propoganda, dogmatism, and a serious lack of dialectical materialism. I don't think any real person who supports China doesn't have criticism. This is liberal slop pushed to divide us. \n\nIs it not inherently dialectical to understand that you can't just achieve socialism when your economy is still mainly feudal relations? Isn't it inherently dialectical to understand that you can't go from feudalism to socialism? China is a developing country and has a history of a strong state, i would ask anybody here how the hell you expect a poor feudal country to be able to do socialism. How the hell is it supposed to achieve the prosperity that comes with socialism if they don't have the wealth or productive forces to create that wealth. Isn't it inherently dialectical to understand and recognize that going through capitalism is necessary to achieve socialism? And look, we can have a serious dialog about china's approach, and while I also love what the USSR was able to achieve, they do not exist anymore. The PRC does, and the CPC still exists. Of course, they are not perfect, and of course, they have their contradictions. China is not utopian, and i don't think most of us that support china think of China as a utopia. I think a lot of it is propoganda. Some of it is just racism and chruvinism. \n\nAgain, as someone who held this position before, who used to say \"well China isn't real socialism is it?\", socialism is not utopian, and expecting a poor feudal economy with lacking productive forces to be able to just jump to socialism without going through some capitalist relations, seems to me, to be metaphysical materialism and a lack of understanding of dialectical materialism. Maybe that's just me, tho.\n\nI did not keep it short, lol. I really enjoy in particpating in this discussion.

Comrade Mao Zedong is less admired for his revolutionary leadership and more for being a nationalist hero as society becomes more right-wing and embrace traditional Chinese values instead of socialist ones . The working class is overworked and overstressed, with little to no say in the workplace which is highly hierarchical.\n\nThe Reform and Opening Up policies since the 80s have really done a number on the country. The people now worship money. The first questions they ask on first dates are \"do you own a house\", \"what kind of car do you drive\", \"how much money do you make\". Popular culture is dominated by brand-sponsored celebrities no different from the entertainment industries in South Korea or the US. The way the reforms were originaly sold to the people was that some people would get rich first, driving the economy and uplift the rest of the country. Whether or not this was genuine is debatable, but either way the reality is, when those first people got rich, they would rather play the capitalist role and become the new ruling class instead.\n\nI mean, it walks like capitalism and quacks like capitalism, but they insist on calling it socialism. \"Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\" is about 90% \"Chinese Characteristics\" and maybe 10% socialism. I would say the situation is more pessimistic in China than in the west. Because anti-capitalist people in the west can look to Marxism and socialism for direction. But in China, because the status quo is tied to socialism and Marxism in name, those that resent the capitalist outcomes they're experiencing are likely to associate these outcomes with socialism, so they end up adopting petty bourgeois sentiments and neoliberal ideology instead of rediscovering Marxism (some still do end up recognizing the current Party as revisionist and rediscover Marxism, but I'd say it's more rare).\n\nTo sum up the rambling, I think it's less about being \"state capitalistic\" more about the actual relations of production and economic outcomes that make China revisionist. The working class doesn't get to make decisions and doesn't get to keep the fruits of their labor. That plus the general attitude in society that worships money and capitalism. Very few people still want to build socialism, not sure how many in the top of the Party still do, the new capitalists certainly don't, the working class is no longer class conscious (and even if they are, they mistakenly look to western neolibralism instead of Marxism for solutions).",

Various communist traditions around the world reject China at various points (either Deng or earlier). I would argue Mao\u2019s revolution never even was to establish socialism. There was no transfer of power to the soviets, the organs of workers power. It was essentially a jacobin or bourgeoisie revolution built upon the backs of the armed peasants. Under the guise of building socialism it instead drove headfirst into building the productive forces for the surplus needed to industrialise and modernise from feudal relations to capitalism. The revolution had different factions of communist within China itself who thought it in different ways, many of them rejecting Maoism. The clearest criticism is that Maoism\u2019s revolutionary class was the national bourgeoisie and the peasants over the workers. It did not develop in a similar way to Russia due to the CPC\u2019s own defeats in the bid for state power - it was not led by the proletarian vanguard. Mao even writes to emphasise the revolutionary character of the peasantry as a class in themselves which is something Marx had long contested and Lenin would have vehemently disagreed with, he sought to make an alliance with the peasantry but keeping the politics and political power in the hands of the revolutionary workers. Socialism is about the abolishment of classes and commodity and in the end the state. Their state is not in the process of withering away but rather strengthening its ruling classes grip!

Your view on the withering away of the state is **literally** what Lenin is arguing against in that book. It's really quite arrogant to accuse OP of not understanding basic marxist principles or calling it \"101 stuff\" when you don't properly understand it yourself. Your view is literally the same as Kautsky's and what Lenin was arguing against in state and revolution!!\n\n*\"It is safe to say that of this argument of Engels\u2019, which is so remarkably rich in ideas, only one point has become an integral part of socialist thought among modern socialist parties, namely, that according to Marx that state \u201cwithers away\u201d \u2014 as distinct from the anarchist doctrine of the \u201cabolition\u201d of the state.* ***To prune Marxism to such an extent means reducing it to opportunism, for this \u201cinterpretation\u201d only leaves a vague notion of a slow, even, gradual change, of absence of leaps and storms, of absence of revolution. The current, widespread, popular, if one may say so, conception of the \u201cwithering away\u201d of the state undoubtedly means obscuring, if not repudiating, revolution.***\n\n***Such an \u201cinterpretation\u201d, however, is the crudest distortion of Marxism, advantageous only to the bourgeoisie. In point of theory, it is based on disregard for the most important circumstances and considerations indicated in, say, Engels\u2019 \u201csummary\u201d argument we have just quoted in full.***\n\n*In the first place, at the very outset of his argument, Engels says that, in seizing state power, the proletariat thereby \u201cabolishes the state as state\". \\[..\\] As a matter of fact, Engels speaks here of the proletariat revolution \u201cabolishing\u201d the\u00a0bourgeois\u00a0state, while the words about the state withering away refer to the remnants of the\u00a0proletarian\u00a0state\u00a0after\u00a0the socialist revolution. According to Engels, the bourgeois state does not \u201cwither away\u201d, but is \u201cabolished\u201d by the proletariat in the course of the revolution. What withers away after this revolution is the proletarian state or semi-state.\"*\n\nThe withering away of the state doesn't refer to the bourgeois state - that state is abolished immediately upon a communist revolution. It is the socialist state which withers away **upon the achievement of the highest form of communism** \\- i.e. a classless society. Because a state exists for one class to enact force on another, when the proletariat are the only remaining class the need for the state disappears and as such it withers away. The complete expropriation of capitalists isn't on its own enough though, in the sense that if you just kill all the bourgeois but the material circumstances remain otherwise the same, the logic of capitalism will be reproduced by small businesses and the like. You can't construct the higher stage of communism directly out of capitalism because it lacks the material conditions to support a stateless, classless society:\n\n  \n*\"The economic basis for the complete withering away of the state is such a high state of development of communism at which the antithesis between mental and physical labor disappears, at which there consequently disappears one of the principal sources of modern social inequality--a source, moreover, which cannot on any account be removed immediately by the mere conversion of the means of production into public property, by the mere\u00a0expropriation of the capitalists.\"*\n\n  \n*\"The state will be able to wither away completely when society adopts the rule: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\", i.e., when people have become so accustomed to observing the fundamental rules of social intercourse and when their labor has become so productive that they will voluntarily work according to their ability. \"The narrow horizon of bourgeois law\", which compels one to calculate with the heartlessness of a Shylock whether one has not worked half an hour more than anybody else--this narrow horizon will then be left behind. There will then be no need for society, in distributing the products, to regulate the quantity to be received by each; each will take freely \"according to his needs\".\"*",

Socialism converts them into common property. To that extent--and to that extent alone--\"bourgeois law\" disappears.*\n\n*However, it persists as far as its other part is concerned; it persists in the capacity of regulator (determining factor) in the distribution of products and the allotment of labor among the members of society. The socialist principle, \"He who does not work shall not eat\", is already realized; the other socialist principle, \"An equal amount of products for an equal amount of labor\", is also already realized.* ***But this is not yet communism, and it does not yet abolish \"bourgeois law\", which gives unequal individuals, in return for unequal (really unequal) amounts of labor, equal amounts of products.***\n\n*This is a \u201cdefect\u201d, says Marx,* ***but it is unavoidable in the first phase of communism***\\*; for if we are not to indulge in utopianism, we must not think that having overthrown capitalism people will at once learn to work for society without any rules of law. Besides, the abolition of capitalism does not immediately create the economic prerequisites for such a change.\\*\n\n*Now, there are no other rules than those of \"bourgeois law\".* ***To this extent, therefore, there still remains the need for a state, which, while safeguarding the common ownership of the means of production, would safeguard equality in labor and in the distribution of products.***\n\n*The state withers away insofar as there are no longer any capitalists, any classes, and, consequently, no class can be suppressed.*\n\n*But the state has not yet completely withered away, since the still remains the safeguarding of \"bourgeois law\", which sanctifies actual inequality.* ***For the state to wither away completely, complete communism is necessary.\"***",

In this sense the withering away of the state is only gradual in that these material conditions are developed gradually, but there is no requirement that the state would get smaller during this process, and if anything it is likely to get *larger*, as it will need first to nationalise what industry exists, and later be heavily involved in developing society towards the higher stage of communism.

Lenin and Marx argued for the dictatorship of the proletariat to abolish classes and smash the old bourgeoise capitalist order. This means using the proletarian state machinery to take ownership of all means of production and property with which to crush the other classes. You are correct that without the material conditions for socialism the bourgeoise order will reassert itself. Lenin however saw the proletarian state as a temporary affair specifically to win revolution and spread international revolution. His solution to Russia\u2019s dire economic situation was certainly not to spend 50 years developing the productive forces under socialism in one country until it met some arbitrary criteria of \u201cdeveloped enough materially\u201d but was to spread the revolution internationally using a hold out DOTP in Russia as the matchstick to light the fire of revolution throughout all of Europe, particularly with Germany in mind. The argument you put forward is taken outside of the political context and is ahistorical. Lenin thought **world capitalism** as a system was developed enough for the conditions for socialism. He did not think Russia, China etc had the material conditions for socialism and he did not think that was necessary - he was not for socialism in one country but internationalism. The task was to advance world communism using the dictatorship of the proletariat. In such a sense yes the state would get larger as it wages class warfare against the forces of reaction. Taken out of context, you would be largely correct in all but your understanding of socialism/communism but taken within context this is a serious distortion that advances an incorrect view of what the dictatorship of the proletariat is even for and what socialism is. It\u2019s essentially the liberal understanding of socialism that Engels and Lenin polemicised against - a form of state directed capitalism. Lenin was pretty clear about calling the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia as having a form of \u201climited state capitalism\u201d. Capitalism and socialism are incompatible. Socialism itself can only be introduced as a world system as it will always be fighting tooth and nail to end the bourgeoise internationally as the bourgeoise will fight to end the united dictatorships of the proletariats/soviet republics. \n\nYou should really read into Lasalle or read Engels pamphlet on the state which Lenin quotes in state and rev. You basically misunderstand the intent of Lenin and confuse meanings which leads to greatly different conclusions than Lenin himself advocated for. It\u2019s why Lenin argues first with the building blocs as the state as an organ of class rule. The stated purpose is to guide the abolishment of classes and universalise the working class There is no need for a state as class antagonisms disappear. The withering away is when classes themselves have been abolished, bourgeoise law begins to disappear as the \u201cgovernment of persons becomes the administration of things.\u201d \n\nChina has long since had the material conditions of abundance and a developed proletariat necessary for socialism. Its state is no dictatorship of the proletariat but rather a dictatorship over them. It really has no interest in its state withering away, such a thing is not even be possible given international capitalism. But it certainly does nothing towards progressing the class war internationally so that reaction could not step in. Nor to give the proletariat an ounce of control over their own supposed democracy. By all measures it is not socialist or a dictatorship of the proletariat. Claiming it is, is really the utopian falsification that Marx, Engels and Lenin polemicised against.",

I want to emphasise that Lenin is defining socialism as the point where the state is on its way out. It\u2019s not entirely disappeared yet in all forms but there\u2019s a reason he argues very forcibly that the state is an organ of class rule outside of just the need to smash the capitalist state. Lenin writes about the economic basis of the state withering away because it is the utmost question in Russia, where the prevailing concept was that Russia was too backward to have socialism and that yes a state is necessary to beat all the reactionary classes from the capitalists to proletariatising the peasantry. \n\nI think you\u2019re basically misunderstanding what Lenin is even saying in the passages you\u2019re quoting as you have the conclusion made up before the reading of? I\u2019m tempted to break it down line by line honestly but that is a great deal of work for an internet forum. I think you need to do more reading around it to understand what the point of the pamphlet is in context and what Lenin is actually saying as you\u2019re essentially taking a few elements of the passage as evidence for rigid definitions rather than the whole which leads to a very misguided conclusion. Socialism and communism were used by Marx, Engels and Lenin basically interchangeably for a reason in most of their texts with Lenin basically codifying it here to better explain the Marxist conception of the state itself. The dictatorship of the proletariat however was not considered socialism but the transitionary vehicle for it. Lenin did not reinvent the wheel with state and rev, he pretty much just developed earlier Marxism. I would read some Engels or Marx from the texts Lenin quotes in state and rev as a good indicator to see how they actually defined these concepts and utilised them. Use state and rev\u2019s references and footnotes to find them. \n\nIn the context of Russia, it\u2019s why he puts forward revolutionary internationalism as the reason for actually advocating for revolution in the first place and not just for carrying out a bourgeoise democratic revolution (as was the Bolsheviks conception before the April theses). He says multiple times during 1917-1921 that the revolution in Russia will be saved by revolution in Germany or elsewhere in the developed countries. He had no illusions to a state force within Russia being used to develop conditions ripe for socialism. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially applying abstract levels of the pamphlet to a situation Lenin never advocated for. Lenin\u2019s thought were not \u201cwe need to build the material conditions for socialism as they do not exist in Russia.\u201d Those conditions existed internationally or he would never had pushed for the seizing of soviet power. He pushed for the seizing of political power despite knowing that Russia\u2019s borders did not have the objective conditions for socialism as they had the conditions for a dictatorship of the proletariat to be established (which is essentially, a politically developed proletariat that has the capability to pull off such a thing). \n\nYou\u2019re working backwards to define what socialism is and getting passages muddled so you place the wrong emphasis on what he is saying. \n\nHe\u2019s basically saying that the state in just about all aspects is gone by lower form communism or socialism. It\u2019s gone but not quite, a small remnant remains. What is this remnant? Note what he is actually pointing out when he talks about the old bourgeoisie law and classes. Classes are gone. \nThe state as an organ of class rule as Lenin went to painstaking levels to define as, is gone as classes no longer exist. Bourgeoise law is essentially the old administrative tasks to organise production and the law which is to regulate the working class which has not abandoned the ideologies of the old order yet and how they guide their economic activity. \n\nSo what we should see at the lower order of communism, socialism, is actually a contraction in the role of the state after its victory over capitalism as after all its main task as outlined previously in Lenin\u2019s pamphlet, is over. This is a process that takes place across time, it is not a single instant which is why Lenin describes it in this way in these dialectic terms. The state is \u201cwithering away\u201d as opposed to completely disintegrated but its main function is already over by this point and most of it is just done by workers, no longer as an organ of class rule but just as normal being. The whole conception of withering away is essentially transferring the DoTP from a \u2018strict war footing\u2019 to just that of organising regular life. But regular life will be marred by many of the ideological and structural trappings of this past society. It will take time for them all to disappear completely. We don\u2019t know exactly how this happens as it never has done so yet. Lenin just knew that in the fight for victory over capitalism the state would have not done away with many of the inherited structures and ideas - it could not in fact until victory, or the old capitalist order would reassert itself. \n\nBut Lenin still conceptualised socialism as this phase and as essentially stateless or near stateless, with the old apparatus of the state disintegrating after the victory of world communism over capitalism. That\u2019s why he so clearly defines a state as an organ of class rule and champions the idea of a proletarian state to end class rule. And called Russia state capitalist under the dictatorship of the proletariat in this time, particularly with war communism and the NEP. \n\nYou have to take the whole text in context. \n\nNot give more emphasis to sections than Lenin intended and take those sections as a dictionary definition. They are meant to be explanatory as part of the whole, developing his ideas as they go. \n\nAnd take into account Marx and Engels writings on this topic (which were absurd by the opportunists and utopians) but also the immediate situation of Russia and Lenin\u2019s overall strategy for Russia. Your view is incompatible to Lenin\u2019s actual strategy, his practice. \n\nIt really doesn\u2019t help that Stalin seriously pushed this reading exploiting some vagueries in the text so he could justify socialism in one country after Lenin\u2019s death, which is conceptually antithetical. So the most common interpretation of state and rev you\u2019ll see floating around is wrong.",

The system is a market economy with the predominance of public ownership and state-owned enterprises. Basically, China (and the USSR) attempted to leap from Feudalism to Socialism despite Marx and Engels believing you must go through Capitalism first. That didn't work out so well so they made adjustments. One of the reasons China has been so successful is their flexibility and willingness to adapt. They are definitely Marxists. Communism, which is a long way away, is the ultimate goal. \n\n\"Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology upon which our party and country are founded; it is the very soul of our party and the banner under which it strives.

And I'm not just talking about white people, there's a guy in this very thread claiming to be asian who went on r/tankiejerk and said Americans are more likely to succeed at a communist revolution than the Chinese. Western Chauvanism is a hell of a drug. \n\nThere are two primary reasons for this\n\nThe first is that these Marxists, despite being theoretically \"correct\", fall prey to misinformation anti-China psyops propagated by the CIA, state department, and deep state. They may think the party was wrong to crack down on the Tianamen Square protestors even though that was clearly an attempt by the West to institute a color revolution. They may think China is being the aggressor in the South China Sea and is exercising imperialism, that kind of thing. These people are fundamentally not a threat to the status quo and yes, it is propaganda-made infighting.\n\nThe second are what we would call hardline \"Maoists\", or Marxist-Leninist-Maoists. Keep in mind that Mao and Mao's diehard supporters in the actual communist party, both before and after his death, did not call themselves Marxist-Leninist-Maoists. They upheld Mao Zedong thought and thought Deng was a capitalist roader and all that there but they did not think of themselves as such. MLM becomes formalized during the Gonzalo-led insurgency in Peru. Gonzalo basically was a cult leader. And no I'm not talking about a cult of personality like how liberals characterize Stalin, I am talking about an actual cult. He thought killing during a revolution wasn't necessary, but served as a kind of blood sacrifice that would appease historical forces and help move them towards victory. Like innocent villagers would be killed and he wouldnt say something like \"sometimes war crimes happen by revolutionaries, this is an unfortunate event but a few lives lost are not a reason to abandon the struggle.\" He would say that the killing of random peasants in and of itself is a good thing. So Gonzalo is crazy, but a lot of Western Marxists think Gonzalo is the highest form of theory because it has the most hyphens (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist-Gonzaloist). Gonzalo literally said he had reached the apex of theory and there would be no more theoretical contributions after him. It's like the Islamic Prophet Mohammad saying he was the last prophet, except Mohammad actually contributed something good to the world as Islam moved history forwarded by uniting the warring tribes of Arabia. And this theory is \"ultra-left\", basically a modern day version of a Trotskyist. If you don't immediately transition to 100% socialism while also trying to export revolution everywhere you go, you are a revisionist and should be condemned. So Gonzalo's group bombs the USSR and DPRK embassy. There's a book on Prole Wiki about Shining Path's connection to the CIA you should check out. But even outside of the Peruvian context there are other MLM groups that serve similar functions - for example the Filipino Maoists backed the protestors in Hong Kong even they were clearly liberals. So these people are also not a threat.\n\nSo those people are moronic useful idiots for the machine. There are people who disagree with most of Deng's reforms and think he made a mistake but aren't MLM fanatics and arent subjected to anti-China propaganda. These people are still wrong. Deng's economic reforms helped China industrialize faster and the Hu and Xi eras vindicate Deng further; capitalists werent able to co-opt the party and now we are seeing a gradual building up of socialism. \n\nHere's some fun facts for you - China has not invaded any country since the late 70s. China does not coup or threaten any country. China does not give/revoke economic assistance/military support to a country based on their domestic politics (they will sell weapons to anyone and everyone; Israel, Iran, ect. They are essentially neutral.) China has eliminated extreme poverty, the first country to do so. China is leading the green energy revolution. China has completed unprecedented massive infrastructure projects that no other country has done so.\n\nBy 2048 the entire economy of China will be publicly owned with the possible exceptions of small agricultural plots and boutique shops and resturaunts.

This divergence is rooted in their historical contexts. Western societies, having led industrial and technological revolutions, are already much further along in development. For them, dramatic progress feels harder to achieve, so their focus shifts to addressing inequality. In contrast, China sees the greater development already achieved by the West, which proves that more progress is humanly possible, and prioritizes catching up through economic growth.\n\nImagine two hikers on a mountain. The first hiker (representing the West) is farther up the mountain, where progress is slower and harder to see. They focus on sharing supplies more fairly among the group. The second hiker (representing China) is much lower but can see the first hiker higher up. Knowing it\u2019s possible to climb that high, the second hiker prioritizes moving upward, even if some resources are distributed unevenly along the way.\n\nSo for Western Marxists, their priorities are advancing labor rights, minority rights, and reducing inequality in wealth and power. Meanwhile, China suppresses labor rights and tolerates inequality to achieve faster development, believing this trade-off will ultimately improve the general standard of living.",

However, looking at the capitalist system as a global one, China is a key lynchpin in it. Additionally, China's imperialism tends to be easier for nations to deal with than the US's in our current moment. If a periphery/semi-periphery nation has the option to choose what core nation will be its hegemon, better to choose one that is farther away and more hands off. Of course, China has been restructuring the B&R initiative because of a lack of profit returns forcing the state to subsidize their local firms more than expected, so that may go away soon. \n\nAll these lead to the more developmentalist (usually Stalinist or socdem) parts of the Socialist movement to be more pro-China outside the imperial core, especially if they are geographically farther from China compared to the US. \n\nWithin the imperial core, the socdems will see China as a competitor to their own welfare state visions and the Stalinists will be split based on how dogmatic they are about copying the Soviet economy. \n\nI think all these groups are failing to analyze capitalism in any substantial way, hence their views on China being primarily informed by their idealized developmentalist or state welfare project.\n\nRemember the double-sided nature of capitalist development and remember that the ideology of those in charge, even in China, has its horizons limited by the need to accumulate capital. We all agree that China is economically capitalist. They claim this themselves! They claim to be ideologically socialist and using capitalism for developing productive forces.

So when leftists say \u201cI don\u2019t know man, I don\u2019t like how  the PRC blocks most of the Internet and I don\u2019t really think they have a right to militarily invade Taiwan\u201d these normal ish opinions while possibly rational only help the global American capitalist. \n\nIf China and the United States go to war, 1-1 China would probably loose. And that\u2019s a problem for the global working class regardless of if the Chinese starts the war, were coerced into fighting American allies or just did literally nothing and got invaded anyway. \n\nThis fact is lost on a lot of leftists regardless of where they\u2019re from. They think a Chinese dominated Africa or Asia wouldn\u2019t be a massive improvement over the current western overlords. They feel a capitalist China if it had the opportunities of the United States would behave the exact same way if not worse. \n\nSame with Russia, Russia has even less of a claim to attempting socialism, but a lot of Marxist believe that if they lose the war in Ukraine and the Putin regime collapses, that\u2019s one less potential ally for overthrowing the United States. \n\nIt\u2019s political realism\n\nPolitical realism doesn\u2019t go over too well with idealists or those that have their beliefs wrapped around heavy principles. Especially if they have visited China and were less than impressed. Especially if you\u2019re a Marxist from a country China or Russia is interfering with or from a country the USSR did things too.",

Though there are a lot of saner people who are somewhat critical of it, the majority of whom I've seen are supportive of it (with the exception of Maoists, most I've met seem to be very opposed to modern China)\n\n--\n\nI'm not a westerner, but I'll say that China is capitalist, pure and simple. Their privatization efforts so far have not stopped, and the recent CCP congress shows no signs of a turn to the left in any way, as comrade Xi only pledged to further help the enterpreneurs. Local state propaganda activities have been aimed at fostering nationalism. IIRC the Premier have stated that there won't be any return to the planned economy. They are in no way on a transitory stage towards socialism, you may argue that NEP happened, but it was far shorter, and the government did not put such blatant pro-corporate statements like this. \n\nSo, Chinese government does support the interests of its own big and flourishing bourgeoisie, and assists them heavily in expansion of their influence both inside and outside the nation.
