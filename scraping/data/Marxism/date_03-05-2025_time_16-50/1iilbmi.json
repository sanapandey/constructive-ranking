            "body": "It's easy to keep a fundamentally Christian framework while substituting Marxist concepts- like the Messiah and the Rapture for a revolutionary icon and the Revolution itself. Some Marxist practices mimic Christian practice too-raising class consciousness is very similar to proselytizing or mission work. Practitioners can be dogmatic and argue about the true meaning of the sacred text- Das Kapital, Mao's Little Red Book, etc- or what their personal saint- Che, Lenin, etc- would've wanted. As a result, many orgs can function in kind of cult-ish ways.\n\nI don't think that necessarily makes Marxism a religion. But, in our current society where it's marginalized to the point only a tiny number of people are dedicated enough to pursue it, it's going to attract a certain kind of obsessive personality- perhaps, the same type of obsessiveness that exists at the heart of many religions.",

During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes constantly hounded them, received their theories with the most savage malice, the most furious hatred and the most unscrupulous campaigns of lies and slander. After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonize them, so to say, and to hallow their names to a certain extent for the \u201cconsolation\u201d of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping the latter, while at the same time robbing the revolutionary theory of its substance, blunting its revolutionary edge and vulgarizing it. \n\nState and rev, 1st paragraph. One of my favorite openings! Applies to Jesus as much as Marx and Lenin.\n\nI believe the correlations you have laid out signify an underlying process of consciousness that can be traced thru time. Marxism is the invariant line of this process, the historical process of consciousness freeing itself. Marxism is merely the most logical pathway, necessarily so, that has revealed itself so far in our journey as we move past idealism.",

I will leave it at: the USSR at a certain point in its lifetime could be seen as an oppressive distortion of Marx. Same for Mao who famously opposed book worship, probly because he was distorting the hell out Marx and oppertunism is easier when people dont or are not allowed to read.",

I think it's more akin to not following the theory so closely that you ignore modern material conditions. Marx believed the proletariat would lead the revolution, but Mao's struggle relied on the peasantry. If the CPC \"worshipped\" what was written before and clumsily applied it wholesale to their contemporary conditions, they would not have been as successful at organizing during the civil war.\n\nAlso your comment \"don't or not allowed to read\" is weird considering literacy rates skyrocketed in China during the 50s and 60s.\n\nEdit: Here's the quote from Oppose Book Worship: \"Of course we should study Marxist books, but this study must be integrated with our country's actual conditions. We need books, but we must overcome book worship, which is divorced from the actual situation.\" https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-6/mswv6_11.htm#fn1",

It seemed to just be talking about these influences on Marxism. I really have no issue with those influences as long as it\u2019s sort of poetic or aesthetic and not a fundamental aspect.\n\nI like Marx\u2019s language and poetic images\u2026 it\u2019s one of the strongest points of his writing on an aesthetic level (as far as I can tell in translation anyway.) And the manifesto is intended to be a sermon, millennialistic, an impassioned cry backed by a very punchy and reductive mythology-like sweep of history. \n\nThe manifesto is also that - it\u2019s not a dry nuanced explanation if anything.\n\nI disagree with their take on Marx being antisemitic - yes casual Victorian bigotry and yes the pamphlet is a gross\u2019s read because max\u2019s style is like \u201clet\u2019s say antisemites are correct and\u2026\u201d At any rate, Marx said some bigot stuff in personal letters and was probably shitty to his wife.

Every movement has martyrs and heroes. How is the question what would Lenin do any different than Americans asking what the founding fathers would have wanted. Is the belief in a revolution similar to judgment day? Maybe, but almost every political movement believes that once they have power they will make things better for people.

The way that historical stages have developed are not necessarily deterministic for humankind, it is just how they have developed in the context of the European capitalism in which he lived, and which has since then entrapped the rest of the world, whose peoples may have had different courses of economic development.",

(However Marxism differs slightly in not having metaphysics and occultism as a root)-though some weird parts of communist writings do touch on the occult for some fucking reason.\n\nNow with religion from what I\u2019ve noticed there are generally several elements to organizational structure.\n\nMarxism is most similar to the Abrahamic schools of thought\n\n1. it propagates through text and is an ideology geared to be marketed towards the masses. Very similar to Christianity and Islam. Its benefits are also propagated to the masses. (This is very much the opposite of mystery cults but that\u2019s a different discussion)\n\n2. Communist writing and intellectual discourse hinges on dialectical analysis and class theory. It is debated in a very similar manner to Christian discourse regarding interpretation of Cannon.\n\n3. Quality control, when a individual significantly deviates from the predominant interpretation of communist theory, they are usually considered to be \u201crevisionary\u201d this pretty much identical as a process to the Christian concept of orthodoxy and Hersey. with revisionists being shunned on punished. \n\n4. Evolution of thought, as revisionists or cliques are ostracized from other communist circles they begin linking up and developing social group of their own, developing their own dialectics and theory. Before part 3 inevitably reoccurs\n\nThis is basically the same ideological evolution process of the Protestant churches and associated variations.\n\n5. Very similar to Islam and the Christians after dominating their host societies they seek to propagate as an ideology through more then words spread by influencer/educators/propagandists/priests. The next step is spreading the revolution internationally with more than words but through military action, \n\nTrotsky of the Soviet Union, china\u2019s annexation of Tibet and fights with India.\n\n6. The elimination of other socialist sects, socialist anarchists, syndicalism, and Stalins handling of the Spanish civil war. The reason I bring this up is contrasting it with a different set of religious traits largely removed from western civilization namely syncretic thought which is more common in eastern religions and pagan thinking. However common practice for Christian and Islamic religion.",

I never claim to be a Marxist or Socialist. In a debate or organizing context, I try to avoid giving myself an ideological label in front of others altogether. But if pressed, I tell people I am \"of the left\".\n\nThe pitfall of ideology as religion plays out constantly in online and academic spaces when leftists argue with each other about \"what is to be done?\" to achieve our \"utopia\". We start quoting our favorite theory at each other in debate the same way clergy of the Abrahamic religions do when they debate how we might best live a holy life. I cynically refer to this form of leftism as cosplay.\n\nLike... don't get me wrong. Marx got a lot of things right and it's fundamental to a lot of the beliefs I hold for how the world could be more egalitarian, but he was trying to diagnose the modern capitalist society before we even had the telegraph, let alone the internet. While many of those fundamentals are similar, the overall conditions we are operating under are about 1 billion percent different than when he was writing. Our religious attachment to 150 year old ideology stifles our imaginations about what solutions we can actually apply to the reality around us and alienate us from people we need to organize onto our side.",

In my opinion, its better to have faith in humanity and history than to be wry and detached and not believe in anything greater than yourself. Its also better than putting your faith in the intangible. Moreover, its better to recognise this as faith (or at least similar to faith) than to do what some dogmatic strains of communism do, and pretend that it is all pure reason, because it isn't and can never be. That is cult logic of its own. \n\nBut faith does not necessarily imply religion. That there is some affinity between communism and religion should be no surprise, but a critical Marxism also adapts itself to what it faces, which religion doesn't do so much - at least not consciously. Critique, political economy, and the materialist approach to history are what I think distinguishes Marxism from religion; and a lack of any of these can collapse it into more religious tendencies.",

It is, at its core, an evidence-based framework. However, a lot of people struggle to apply it as such.",

Marxism really isn\u2019t a religion no more than say Heideggers worldview is a religion. They may appear to hold beliefs that resonate or resemble religion. Marxism is eschatological to an extent, Heidegger borrows quite a lot of language from Christian mysticism but fundamentally they took great pains to function on reason and not revelation. Marx ultimately believed his worldview was historically self evident rather than revelatory. That\u2019s the main difference between religion and philosophy.\n\nWhen people hear this they can mean that Marxism is \u201cculty\u201d which it can be. But it kinda goes into the flaw of the term \u201ccult\u201d rather than the more accurate \u201chigh control group\u201d",
