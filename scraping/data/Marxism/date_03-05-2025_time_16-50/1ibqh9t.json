    "selftext": "I am going to give you 2 simple examples of how the state sees the human being as a commodity, example 1: looking for a job, When you look for a job in an interview you have to \"sell yourself\" in the sense of giving your best and telling them that you are the best of all to get hired and you have to compete with other candidates to stay and how is that done? Selling your best version, 2 is a military commodity, the state has to have and manufacture many soldiers through propaganda, in a war, for the state, you become a military commodity. ",

Basically once you become a burden on the state/ social services (in US at least) you are discarded, or exploited as with foster children and prisoners for example. It\u2019s dehumanizing and very arguable that the state treats these people as commodities. Since the rest of us are at risk of becoming homeless, disabled, etc and a burden on the state at any moment, we can count ourselves lucky that we are considered profitable enough that the state hasn\u2019t fully robbed us of our freedoms and discarded us yet, but we have little control over whether that happens.",

Right now, the US State indeed views its people as expendable cannon fodder, but that is because the United States has been instrumentalized by materialistic corporations and private billionaires who view the people living in it that way. It is *not* necessarily true that the state *must* come to view the people living in it as cogs. That is a truism of Materialism, but ethnostates like the Scandinavian Countries for instance have robust social welfare systems that are not condescending or predatory as the diabolical ones in the American system which might be what we're thinking of here.",

But these are analogies, not literal relations or dynamics. We do not actually sell ourselves, which is both a contradiction in terms and blurs the lines between our society and a society based on slavery, which involves the actual exchange of people as means of production. Marx accepts their differences but insists capitalist society is still barbarous: formal freedom to sell our labor or starve, brutal working conditions and power imbalances, etc.\n\nWe should talk about flaws of the state, but we should keep in mind Marx and Engel's view: the state is a non-market entity that plays a functional role with regard to the market. By virtue of its independence from the marketplace, the state can operate as a lever to shepherd the private sector (through violence, regulation, legislation, etc.).",

A state that does not have legalized abortion tends to have more labor in the future. That is a great example of how the state looks at how a commodity it is. Like I have a farm and I make the chickens multiply more with the intention of selling them, the starting companies are already a product for them, in fact you are a replaceable number for them.",
