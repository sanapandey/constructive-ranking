    "selftext": "The Equitable Future Manifesto\n\nA Vision for a Just, Sustainable, and Empowered Society\n\nBy the People, for the People\n\nIn the face of mounting inequality, ecological crisis, and unsustainable economic\n\npractices, it is time for a bold reimagining of our world. The Equitable Future Manifesto\n\npresents a roadmap for dismantling the systems that perpetuate wealth concentration and\n\nsocial division. It is a call for a new societal order, one grounded in fairness, sustainability,\n\nand the empowerment of all people. We commit to shaping a future where wealth serves\n\nthe public good, where opportunities are shared, and where all individuals have the means\n\nto thrive.\n\nThis manifesto outlines a comprehensive framework for redistributing wealth,\n\ndemocratizing economic structures, and ensuring that every citizen has access to the\n\nessential services and opportunities needed to lead a dignified life.\n\n\n\n1. Citizen-Led Wealth Redistribution Fund (CLWRF)\n\nWe will establish a Citizen-Led Wealth Redistribution Fund (CLWRF), managed by the\n\npeople, for the people. This fund will collect surplus wealth from the wealthiest individuals\n\nand corporations\u2014those whose assets exceed the Universal Wealth Cap\u2014and\n\nredistribute it into public initiatives such as healthcare, education, housing, and worker\n\ncooperatives.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: The fund will be governed by local citizen assemblies, ensuring\n\ntransparency, accountability, and participation. Public investment decisions will\n\nfocus on long-term social welfare, environmental sustainability, and community\n\nempowerment.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: The wealthiest 1% in the UK own approximately 25% of total wealth,\n\nwhile the bottom 50% possess only 9%. This redistribution aims to level the playing\n\nfield by reallocating up to 10% of national wealth annually.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To reduce wealth concentration and provide equitable opportunities for all,\n\nstarting by collecting surplus wealth from the top 5% of earners.\n\n\n\n2. Demarketization of Essential Services\n\nWe will demarketize services that are essential for human dignity and wellbeing, such as\n\nhealthcare, education, and housing. These services will be removed from the profit-driven\n\nmarketplace and operated on a cost-recovery basis, ensuring universal access to all\n\ncitizens.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Nationalize and fund key sectors, while introducing robust\n\ncommunity oversight to ensure these services are equitable and efficient.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: The UK spends \u00a33.5 billion annually on private healthcare, while 1 in\n\n4 households faces unaffordable housing costs. Public services will be expanded\n\nthrough efficient, transparent management.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To eliminate barriers to essential services, improving quality of life and health\n\noutcomes for all.\n\n\n\n3. Universal Wealth Cap and Redistribution\n\nWe will introduce a Universal Wealth Cap, limiting the wealth of any individual or family to\n\na maximum of 100 times the median household wealth. Any excess wealth will be\n\nsubject to high taxes, with funds redirected into the CLWRF for redistribution into the\n\npublic sector.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Introduce progressive taxes on wealth, focusing on assets such\n\nas property, stocks, and financial holdings. Tax avoidance schemes will be tightly\n\nregulated and penalized.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: The wealthiest 5% in the UK currently hold 44% of total wealth. A cap\n\non individual wealth and a progressive tax structure would mitigate further\n\nconcentration, providing more for public investment.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To break the cycle of generational wealth concentration and provide a more\n\nequal starting point for future generations.\n\n\n\n4. Cooperative Economic Models\n\nWe will foster the creation of worker-owned cooperatives, shifting power away from\n\ncentralized corporations and ensuring that the workers who create value also benefit from\n\nit. Through public investment and legal reform, we will make cooperative ownership the\n\nnorm in key sectors.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Provide seed funding, training, and legal support for new\n\ncooperatives. Transition existing businesses, particularly those over the wealth cap,\n\ninto cooperative ownership.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: Worker cooperatives have 2\u20133 times higher survival rates compared\n\nto traditional businesses, and the average worker-owned cooperative sees a 15\u2013\n\n20% higher wage than its non-cooperative counterparts.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To empower workers and communities, create sustainable jobs, and\n\nredistribute economic power more equitably.\n\n\n\n5. Dissolving Generational Wealth\n\nWe will challenge the entrenched systems of generational wealth that perpetuate\n\ninequality by capping inheritances at a reasonable level and redirecting excess wealth into\n\nthe CLWRF.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Introduce a cap on inherited wealth of \u00a31 million per beneficiary,\n\nwith anything beyond this going into public investments.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: In 2020, wealth passed on through inheritance in the UK was worth\n\n\u00a370 billion annually. Capping inheritances will help reduce disparities while still\n\nallowing reasonable intergenerational transfers.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To prevent the perpetuation of privilege through inherited wealth, creating a\n\nmore meritocratic society.\n\n\n\n6. Land Reform and Community Ownership\n\nWe will enact land reform policies to ensure that land is no longer a vehicle for the wealthy\n\nto concentrate power and wealth. Large estates and unused land will be redistributed into\n\npublic ownership or transferred to community-managed trusts.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Seize large estates and land holdings that exceed the wealth cap,\n\nconverting them into public housing, cooperative farms, or environmental\n\nrestoration projects.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: The top 1% of landowners in the UK hold half of all private land,\n\noften leaving rural areas underserved. A reallocation of land would ensure broader\n\naccess to housing and community spaces.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To ensure that land is used for the public good, benefiting communities and\n\nthe environment rather than the private interests of a few.\n\n\n\n7. AI and Automation Redistribution\n\nWe will create a fair economy of automation, ensuring that the profits generated by AI and\n\nautomation benefit all of society, not just the tech giants. Automation will be taxed, and\n\nthose funds will be used to support public services and initiatives such as Universal Basic\n\nIncome (UBI).\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Introduce a tax on the profits of automated systems, with funds\n\nused to finance UBI and other public sector initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: AI could lead to up to 30% job displacement by 2030. The revenue\n\nfrom automation taxes will help fund UBI and retraining programs.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To ensure that automation leads to societal benefits, including economic\n\nsecurity for displaced workers and equitable investment in public infrastructure.\n\n\n\n8. Long-Term Sustainability and Climate Justice\n\nWe will ensure that our economic policies align with long-term sustainability and climate\n\njustice. All wealth redistribution efforts will be guided by principles of environmental\n\nstewardship, and investments will prioritize green technologies, renewable energy, and\n\nclimate-resilient infrastructure.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Direct CLWRF funds into green infrastructure, environmental\n\nprotection programs, and regenerative agriculture.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: The UK aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Investing in clean\n\nenergy and regenerative agriculture could create over 1 million green jobs by 2030.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To build an economy that is sustainable for future generations and capable of\n\naddressing the climate crisis.\n\n\n\n9. Citizen Engagement and Participation\n\nA fair and equitable society requires an engaged and informed citizenry. We will establish\n\nregular citizen assemblies to ensure that all voices are heard in decision-making\n\nprocesses, from the allocation of wealth to the development of public services.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Digital platforms for real-time participation, local town halls, and\n\ninclusive citizen panels.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: Over 70% of UK citizens support community-driven decision-making\n\nand feel that local governance should have more influence in economic policy.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To foster a political culture of collaboration, transparency, and direct\n\ndemocracy.\n\n\n\n10. Behavioral and Cultural Change\n\nTo achieve true equity, we must also foster a cultural shift that challenges the values of\n\nmaterialism, individualism, and unchecked competition. We will encourage a society\n\nbased on cooperation, community, and shared prosperity.\n\n\u2022 Implementation: Public education campaigns, media outreach, and social\n\nprograms that promote collective well-being over individual gain.\n\n\u2022 Data Insight: In 2022, 65% of the UK population expressed concern over growing\n\ninequality. A shift toward collective well-being will inspire sustainable consumption\n\nand stronger community bonds.\n\n\u2022 Goal: To create a society where people value community, sustainability, and\n\nfairness over accumulation of wealth.\n\n\n\nConclusion: A Just and Sustainable Future\n\nThe Equitable Future Manifesto presents a vision of a society where wealth is not hoarded\n\nby the few, but rather shared for the benefit of all. We aim to create an economy where\n\nopportunity, health, education, and sustainability are accessible to every person,\n\nregardless of their background or starting point.\n\nThis is a vision for a future where humanity comes first, where we transcend the\n\nlimitations of our current economic system and build a world where everyone has the\n\nresources and opportunities to thrive.\n\nJoin us in creating this future. The time for change is now.",

The parliamentary road has been tried and is now being destroyed by the capitalist class as even the democratic rights they instituted in their revolutions against feudalism are incompatible with the levels of social inequality that exist. \n\nHow do you propose to deal with the reactionary aims and actions of the capitalist class who have no intention - similiar to the feudal aristocracy and the slavocracy - of peacefully relinquishing their wealth, power and privileges?\n\nI suggest you read\nCritique of the Gotha Programme (Marx, 1875)\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/\n\n\u2026 because some of the criticisms he makes in there he could apply to your program. \n\nMarx and Engel wrote in the Communist Manifesto (1848) \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\u201d  You don\u2019t mention social classes.",

                    "body": "Some very good points.\n\nFirstly, i agree. None of this can be achieved without a social revolution of some kind. How that looks? I think very different from those of the 20th century.\n\nAs well, I think legislative means aren't beyond us to facilitate a bloodless, co operative transition into this economic model. However, I have of course thought of contingencies in the case of such groups being unwilling to reliqunish wealth, power and privilages (as you say). It would not be too difficult to incorporate them into the framework.\n\nI shall read it and share my thoughts with relevence to this manifesto.\n\nFinally, I feel as though the point about the social classes is implied, I didn't think it needs explicilty mentioning as, by nature, Marxism is inherintly about the social classes. Wether you agree or not it's genrally more palitable to voters when presented in an interpritable way. The reader doesn't need to be told over again that a document propsing a soloution to our modern class struggle is such. If you read it, you'll know.\n\nThank you for the feeback :)",

So this is very much not Marxism.\n\nThis is why proposals such as Universal Basic Income aren't Marxist.\n\nThis is also a politically untenable program given the prevailing decline of mass worker politics.  \n  \nThis proposal is the kind of thing \"Corbynism\" would've been if it weren't cut off at the knees by a muscular ruling class \u2026 a lot of relatively banal and orthodox, progressive mainstream economic thinking that doesn't get implemented as law or policy because as Marx points out, society is class struggle and the class that's winning doesn't want any of this good gravy to happen.",
