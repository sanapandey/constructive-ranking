    "selftext": "I'm trying to find where the 3 laws/principles of dialectical materialism are stated in the works of Marx or Engels. I have read a bunch of secondary materials that discuss these principles but I am writing a paper and I will likely be asked to identify where in Marx/Engels these are elucidated. Another reason I ask is that there are slight differences in how the 3 laws are described among the secondary materials. Is there one place where these are stated, or did the 3 laws emerge later through study of Marx/Engels?\n\nFor reference, I state the 3 laws as I understand them here:\n\n1. the law of unity & conflict of opposites\n2. the law of quantitative change into qualitative change\n3. the negation of the negation\n\nThank you!\n\n  \n**edit: Not sure why, but my comments are being deleted. The comments simply say \"thank you\" - so thanks, the comments were v helpful!**",
