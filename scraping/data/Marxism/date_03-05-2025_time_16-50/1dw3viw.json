As between one country, one province and even one place and another, living conditions will always evince a *certain* inequality which may be reduced to a minimum but never wholly eliminated. The living conditions of Alpine dwellers will always be different from those of the plainsmen. The concept of a socialist society as a realm of *equality is* a one-sided French concept deriving from the old \u201cliberty, equality, fraternity,\u201d a concept which was justified in that, in its own time and place, it signified a *phase of development*, but which, like all the one-sided ideas of earlier socialist schools, ought now to be superseded, since they produce nothing but mental confusion, and more accurate ways of presenting the matter have been discovered.\n\n- Engels to August Bebel, 1875\n\nMaybe thats' the one?",

When Marx talks about, \"after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly,\" did Marx also anywhere more explicitly weigh into the growth/degrowth debate regarding development of productive forces and the flow of abundance? Wondering if he stipulated limits on production congruent with nature's limited resources and stewardship of the environment in a way that doesn't contradict increasing productive forces and the flow of abundance. I suppose \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his *need*,\" emphasis on *need*, could be read in such a way that we should only produce as much as people need rather than producing for production's sake, but I'm wondering if there's anything more explicit.",

He\u2019s pointing out that IF you\u2019re going to use labor as a measure of compensation (as the political economists, whose whole project and way of thinking he is criticizing, suppose) then you\u2019re going to end up with a system of different levels of compensation because ability, opportunity and inclination to labor or development laboring abilities vary. This is not the same as saying people deserve different amounts of compensation because they\u2019ve invested in themselves, because people deserve what they need not what they\u2019ve earned. The latter principle is political economy, while the former is communism beyond political economy.",

It is an offspring of that false and superficial radicalism that accepts premises and tries to evade conclusions. Upon the basis of the wages system the value of labouring power is settled like that of every other commodity; and as different kinds of labouring power have different values, or require different quantities of labour for their production, they must fetch different prices in the labour market. To clamour for equal or even equitable retribution on the basis of the wages system is the same as to clamour for freedom on the basis of the slavery system. What you think just or equitable is out of the question. The question is: What is necessary and unavoidable with a given system of production? After what has been said, it will be seen that the value of labouring power is determined by the value of the necessaries required to produce, develop, maintain, and perpetuate the labouring power.\n\nValue, Price and Profit  (Pag. 20)",

            "body": "I'm thinking of Critique of the Gotha Program where he criticizes the idea of \"fair distribution of labor\" as sort of a meaningless slogan. The distribution of wealth in capitalism is fair as it stands because that is how property and capital are owned. The equal right to the proceeds of labor is another bourgeois right as it applies an equal standard to unequal people. (e.g. everyone has the right to buy a house in our society, but not everyone can afford it.) He argues that to address the underlying relations of production rather than focus on distribution. If property is commonly owned, the distribution will naturally be different.\n\n>But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This\u00a0*equal*\u00a0right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only \u2013 for instance, in the present case, are regarded\u00a0*only as workers*\u00a0and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.",
