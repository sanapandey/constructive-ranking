    "selftext": "I was reading this section from the introduction chapter to Capital by Ernest Mandel: \n(pg.77 of the penguin version)\nA page ago he just mentioned how Marx essentially advocated a \"commodity theory of money\"\n\n>In the first place, for Marx, with paper money as with metallic money, it is the movement of the value of commodities, that is fluctuations of material production and of productivity of labour, which remains the primum movens of price fluctuations, not the ups and downs of the quantity of paper money in circulation. In that respect, in Capital Volume 3, Marx examines the need to increase money circulation at the moment of the outbreak of the crisis, and he sharply criticizes the role which the Bank of England played, through the application of the currency principle, in accentuating money panics and monetary crises as accelerators of crises as overproduction when these coincided with an outflow of gold from England. In the same way, however, he denied any possibility of preventing recessions by issuing additional money.\n\nI'll probably answer this question when I get to this section later but I wanna know and so I can have a better understanding while reading. \n(correct me if I get any of this wrong)\nThis section is generally about inflation, so how should I think about inflation today? And what tf is the very root of inflation.\n\nIn America in 2020, we had a stock market recession, a big reduction in consumer spending, and reduction in economic activity. I'm pretty sure I saw somewhere that relative wages increased during this time which would reflect the labor theory of value where wages and capital fluctuate in an inverse relationship. Around 2021 and 2022 we have a big stock market run up while inflation is skyrocketing. The Fed increases interest rates to decrease the money supply but the damage is already done, real wages fell a ton because everything costs like 10%-20% more it feels like. Reflecting the labor theory of value- capital increased dramatically and real wages fell.\nSome factors that support that is the increased efficiency by moving operations online, more work from home decreased operating costs, and generally just increasing prices because they could.\n\nNow conservatives always point to the government and say that government spending is the cause of inflation but I don't think that's totally true because the overwhelming majority of govt income comes from capital and the rich while things like a stimulus check is literally increasing people's real wages in effect.\nCentrist/liberals (i think) will say overall spending and economic activity causes inflation.\nProgressives like Bernie have said inflation in this instance was caused by corporate greed, record profits and price gouging. I tend to agree with this because it sort of follows with the labor theory of value but also- wouldn't more money in the stock market (aka money sitting in assets and not moving) in the stock market decrease the money supply and cause money to be worth more not less?\nThe supply of money can make a big difference (like when Zimbabwe prints a bajillion dollars) but keeping that equal does it just come down to how much labor is required to create it?",

            "body": "First, I completely disagree with Mandel's reading of Marx which is essentially that Marx's economic theories are the same as Smith/Ricardo's but just \"on the side of the workers\". I think Diane Elson does a good job refuting that in [this long article](http://digamo.free.fr/elson79-.pdf). \n\nThis article [*Marx's Explanation of Money's Functions: Overturning the Quantity Theory*](https://marxismocritico.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/marx_s-explanation-of-money_s-functions-overturning-the-quantity-theory.pdf) is a good overview of Marx's theory of money, which is helpful for understanding inflation. \n\nFrom there, I recommend [this article](https://brooklynrail.org/2024/02/field-notes/Understanding-Inflation-Friends-of-the-Classless-Society-speak-with-Paul-Mattick/) where Paul Mattick Jr. discusses his book on Inflation from a Marxist perspective. The book is a good read and I can send you a pdf if you like. \n\nMattick says:\n\n>\"But firms which are in a position to raise prices raise them. For example, there are three or four companies that control the world's food supply. There are a very small number of car companies and a very small number of oil companies. Because everybody needs oil, the oil companies can just get together and decide what the price is going to be. But something like that happens in all of the areas which are extremely concentrated, areas that are central to production, like steel, ship-building, or the transportation of goods. Companies have learned to compete by raising prices or by simply not allowing them to fall. Sometimes this is organized with the help of the state, as in agriculture. The state subsidizes agricultural producers, so you have a kind of tax on the whole system which goes to agricultural producers in order to keep them producing food at all, because otherwise the price of food would be so low that they know nobody would bother to produce it. Then, of course, society would come to an end.\n\n>If you raise the price of oil, then the price of transportation has to go up. Any company that uses trucks or boats to move their goods, they then have to raise their prices, too. So there has been, since the 1940s, a general tendency for the price level to rise all over the world, the opposite of what happened in the course of the nineteenth century when there was a general tendency of prices to fall. This is a real change in the operation of the system.\n\n>As prices rise, the value of money\u2014what a unit of currency can buy\u2014falls. So more money must be provided, in the form of government-created money or bank-created credit, to make possible the circulation of goods at higher prices. This supports the illusion of the quantity theory, that the quantity of money causes the price level to rise. But in fact it is the other way around.\"",

            "body": "The key Marxist concept for analysing inflation is devaluation of capital.\n\nOveraccumulation of capital - not only of products but of capital in any form - means the bearer of capital cannot realise a sufficient return on their investment and withdraws the money capital from the productive investment cycle. \n\nThe tendency of the rate of profit to fall, conditioned and temporarily ameliorated by countervailing factors that operate through each trade-industrial cycle and are ultimately overwhelmed, periodically obliges owners to break the cycle and flee back to cash. Projected future profits on investments are suddenly written off, and a vast array of equities and derivatives plummet in price - their value is rudely exposed as fictitious.\n\nA crisis ensues and its principal substance is devaluation. Devaluation of shares, devaluation of asset prices, devaluation of derivatives, devaluation of wage labour, devaluation of sovereign currencies. Unlike the growth of fictitious capital in the later stages of the expansionary phase of the crisis, devaluation takes place in real space and real time. A frantic struggle ensues over who will bear the cost of devaluation: a struggle between states, enterprises, classes.\n\nInflation is the devaluation of wages. It is a form of the devaluation of capital. It is driven by the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, which is not only an empirically verifiable fact, but a phenomenon that can be logically derived from the general principles of the labour theory of value.\n\nIf value is socially necessary labour-time, then increases in labour productivity driven by technical development must by definition drive a reduction in the proportion of an investment that generates profit. Because technical improvement facilitates scaling up operations, this does not typically or immediately cause a fall in the mass of profit, but of the rate of return. \n\nThe driver of profitability crises is therefore fully explained, anticipated and logically coiled up within the labour theory of value. Devaluation of overaccumulated capital is the result. Inflation is a form of the devaluation of capital. Inflation is therefore fully described by the theory.",

This created the possibility of governments dramatically increasing the quantity of coins relative to the quantity of bullion in the country. This made hyper-inflations in the modern sense possible. (5)\n\nIn order to establish a stable system of paper money, the state that issues the paper money must provide a mechanism not only for issuing the paper money but also withdrawing it from circulation. If the state purchases labor power and supplies its needs to operate with paper money and there is no mechanism to withdraw the paper money from circulation, the quantity of paper money relative to real money in the country \u2013 gold bullion \u2013 will explode, causing the paper money to lose its value and collapse. If the state purchases commodities (including labor power) with newly issued paper money, it must withdraw paper money through taxes. As long as the state maintains the a fixed ratio of paper money and bullion in the country, the paper money will not depreciate.\n\nTherefore, when a government issues paper money, it must at the very least declare that it will accept the paper currency for purposes of payment of taxes. Sometimes the state goes further and declares the paper money legal tender payable for all debts both public and private. Marx was well aware of this, and some supporters of MMT use this to claim Marx as one of the forerunners of MMT.\u201d\n\nThe above author tends to emphasize that value must still be grounded in a money commodity, regardless of token money/currency.\nIt adds a complication to theorizing money and price in relation to value but money isn\u2019t now independent of Gold because it isn\u2019t as tightly connected to Gold bullion\u2019s value.",

This is the same mistake that so many Marxists make who accept Marx\u2019s law of labor value\u2014without fully understanding it\u2014when it comes to crisis theory.\n\nA tell-tale sign that a given Marxist writer has not really fully grasped Marx\u2019s theory of value comes when they try to explain the nature of paper money that is no longer convertible into gold at a fixed rate. They explain that modern \u201cnon-commodity\u201d money somehow represents value directly or reflects the values of the commodities that it circulates rather than simply representing the value of a money commodity such as gold that acts as the universal equivalent\u2014that is, acts as the measure of the value of commodities in terms of its own use value.\n\u2026\nInflation targeting\n\nThis blog has concentrated on crisis theory, not value theory. But it has been built on the foundation of value theory. Marx\u2019s distinction between value, exchange value as the form of value, money and prices has played no small role.\n\nI have relied heavily on the fact that the general price level is not arbitrary but is ruled by a world of labor values. When the general price level rises too much above the underlying values\u2014or more precisely the direct prices of commodities\u2014a violent adjustment in the form of an economic crisis of generalized overproduction becomes inevitable that one way or another, whatever policies that capitalist governments and their central banks follow, will bring the general price level below the direct prices of commodities. I have often shown that such divergences between the general price level and the direct prices of commodities is, given the nature of capitalist production, not only possible it is inevitable.\n\u2026\nIn truth, most Marxists of the time could not explain why the Depression had occurred in the first place. When the boom\u2014or, more strictly speaking, several industrial cycles with strong and prolonged booms and weak recessions\u2014occurred, many Marxists retreated from Marxism entirely or at best ended up giving undue credit to government policies that were justified by the prevailing Keynesian economic theories that then dominated the universities.\u201d\n\nSo I think we may need to be more critical of adopting what appears progressive in MMT but may not be necessarily radical and compatible in Marx.\n\nThere are direct (Germany) and indirect methods (Modern states today) of raising the amount of money in the economy. Direct is printing more, and indirect is the case of helping central bank\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/hardcastle/1974/inflationfacts.htm\n\u201cThere are two ways in which currency depreciation can be operated, the direct way used by the German government in the \u2019twenties and the more indirect way used in Britain. Professor F.W. Paish summarised them:\nIn some countries it [the Government] might simply print more notes and use them to pay for its expenditure. Nowadays, in such a country as Great Britain, the government would borrow from the banks, printing more notes to enable the banks to maintain their cash reserves. (Benham\u2019s Economics. 1967, p. 465)\nThe additional notes and coin get into circulation through the joint-stock banks (Lloyds, NatWest, etc.) which bank with the Bank of England.\n\nThese banks withdraw notes and coin from the Bank of England and in turn the additional notes and coin reach the individuals, shopkeepers and employers who make withdrawals in that form from their deposits with the banks..\u201d\n\nBut having moved away from the gold standard and the value it represents, prices can diverge more wildly.",

Historically, and for a rather long time, it remained a particular relation of people and things in production although occurring haphazardly. It was not until capitalism and the \u201cfree enterprise society\u201d came into being that value (i.e., the market form of the product) became the general form of inter-relationships among the component parts of production.*\n\n*Similar transitions, of the \u201cindividual and accidental\u201d into the universal is not a rarity, but rather a rule in history. In history \u2013 yet not exclusively the history of humanity with its culture \u2013 it always so happens that a phenomenon which later becomes universal, is at first emergent precisely as a solitary exception \u201cfrom the rule,\u201d as an anomaly, as something particular and partial. Otherwise, hardly anything could ever be expected to turn up. History would have a rather mystical appearance, if all that is new in it emerged at once, as something \u201ccommon\u201d to all without exception, as an abruptly embodied \u201cidea.\u201d*\"\n\n[https://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/Ilyenkov-History.pdf](https://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/Ilyenkov-History.pdf)\n\n\"*The essential task then in the study of history is to determine the germ cell of the present day, most advanced formation. It was in Evald Ilyenkov\u2019s chapter on abstract and concrete in the same work I have referred to that we find an exposition of how once the germ cell is isolated, its further concretisation can be traced as it colonises, so to speak, all the other elements of the social formation, and in the process of merging with other relations the cell is itself modified, ultimately able to reproduce itself out of conditions which are its own creation.*\"\n\nMoney for Marx absolutely get's it value from commodities which are made commeasurable through abstract labor where as previously exchange is more accidental in it's exchanges and thus more subjective because it lacks the regularity of commodity production under capitalism.  \nIf one disconnects money from commodities and commodities from socially necessary labor, then I don't see on what grounds one can agree with Marx's analysis of capital and the value-form or money.",

Capitalist overproduction is overproduction of exchange values, not overproduction of use values. A crisis of overproduction of exchange values breaks out when there is still very much an underproduction of use values, especially use values that the workers themselves need.*\"\n\n  \n[http://gesd.free.fr/carchedi9.pdf](http://gesd.free.fr/carchedi9.pdf)\n\n\"*To sum up, both theoretical an empirical investigation has provided substantiation for the thesis that the crises\u2019 ultimate cause is the tendential fall in the average rate of profit. Wage movements can explain neither the crisis nor the cycle. The explanation is to be found in Marx, not in Keynes. But, internal critique aside, one should be aware of each of the two views\u2019 political and ideological ramifications. If lower wages determine crises, higher wages are the way out of crises. And if higher wages determine crises, lower wages are the way out of crises. Crises are at least in principle avoidable. If they are not avoided, it is because \u2018mistakes\u2019 have been made in wage, fiscal, monetary, etc. policies or because labour has not been able to impose better work and living conditions on capital. The reformist matrix of this redistributional view is clear: if the system is reformable, a different system is not needed. However, if crises are a constant feature of capitalism, we need a theory that theorizes their unavoidability, their necessity. This is exactly what the Marxian explanation does by focusing on the decreased production of (surplus) value due to technological innovations and concomitant rising value composition of capital as the ultimate cause of crises. Given that this is a constant of capitalism, the necessary, constant and unavoidable way capitals compete with each other, crises are unavoidable. Stated differently, in the former case (basically, a Keynesian perspective), if crises can be avoided, the system does not tend objectively and necessarily towards crises. The possibility is created to conceptualize capitalism as a system being or tending towards growth and equilibrium (even if at a level lower than full employment). In the latter (Marx\u2019s) case, the system tends towards crises through the economic cycle. In the former case, the system is inherently rational (it tends towards equilibrium and growth) and Labour\u2019s fight to supersede it is therefore irrational. Labour is deprived of the objective, rational base for its fight. This fight becomes a pure act of volunteerism.*\"\n\nIt seems to me that following Chartalism, MMT places the value of money as arising from state power rather than in production. So fair enough if that's your take, but I can't say I see such a view being compatible with Marx and his value-theory. I remain skeptical, and still feel it takes on a progressive or reformist, but not radical character (abolishing commodity exchange/capital).",

If their share of capital doesn\u2019t increase proportionally to the increase of the total, then their wealth and social power effectively decreases. The only way for them to raise their wealth proportionally is to raise prices based on how much money is injected into circulation.\u00a0\n\nThis increases their profits because the wages of workers are much slower to respond to inflation increases than prices are. And without workers unionizing and collectively bargaining, the capitalists will do everything in their power to keep these profits and their increased social power high.\n\nWhat economic crises are are a crises of over production. They occur because consumers (~90% of which are members of the working class) cannot consume the products on the market at a rate a which ensures profitable production for the capitalists. Capitalists layoff workers further compounding the issue. The state, a tool of the capitalist class, acts in a reactionary manor to ensure capitalist profits - by bailouts and in extreme cases giving handouts to the general population (stimulus checks). But neither of these solutions remedy the underlying market conditions creating the crises in the first place.\u00a0\n\nIn my understanding, money in the stock market doesn\u2019t take money out of circulation or decrease the money supply. It is still in use and used by the capitalists to speculate on future profits. Transactions, buying and selling, are constantly ongoing. The stock market is great for the capitalist class as a whole because it allows them to shift capital from non-profitable investments to profitable investments very very easily. I know I am reducing this a bit, but in the end, when an economic crises hit, most companies become less profitable causing a stock market contraction - a massive selling of stock. This, if the money from the sold stock is not reinvested, is what would lead to a decrease in the money in circulation, as it would be sitting in savings accounts waiting for more profitable investments to arise.\u00a0\n\nI am curious what you\u2019re trying to get at here?\u00a0\n\nIn the Labor Theory of Value, value is crystallized labor or dead labor - labor that has already been carried out in the form of transforming materials from one state to another. Every commodity, even money, has a use value and exchange value. The use value of money is that it is a universal storer of value. This makes it the best medium for exchange. We, as humans, produce commodities with use values to survive. Capitalism is an inherently exploitative system largely because the capitalist class produces solely for the creation of exchange values. Everything about the capitalist system is geared towards maximizing profit, with some veneer of \u201cequality and opportunity\u201d for the masses. Marx goes over a lot of this in Value, Price, and Profit.\u00a0",
