    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about Marxist aesthetics and what defines Marxist art. Is it a movement with clear boundaries, or more of a theoretical approach to art and culture? Who would be considered a Marxist artist, does it come down to political alignment, subject matter, or something else?\n\nIf Marxist art aligns with Marxist politics, how do Marxist artists navigate the art market? Do they sell their work through commercial galleries without contradicting their principles, or is there an inherent tension there?\n\nWould love to hear thoughts on this, book recommendations on Marxist aesthetics, art, and cultural production.",

Socialist realism, surrealism, various avant guard schools. Our concepts of film editing are basically from a Marxist thinking they were making a dialectal approach to movie storytelling.\n\nI don\u2019t think we should consider there to be a \u201cMarxist aesthetics\u201d - politics and history are material, but art is idealist, emotional, associative, and unknown to an extent.\n\nA Marist artist is just someone who is a Marxist who makes art. The art will inevitably reflect the art maker\u2019s views and attitudes in some way regardless of making something with an intentional perspective or to express certain values and whatnot.\n\nFor the big mid-century Marxist art debate:\n\nSocialist realism: https://www.marxists.org/archive/gorky-maxim/1934/soviet-literature.htm\n\nAnti-socialist realism (pro surrealism and avant guard): https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/lit_crit/works/rivera/manifesto.htm\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/",

            "body": "Marx and Engels wrote about art and thought it was important, but they never took time to establish a proper Marxian theory of art. Marxist aesthetics was developed by several different traditions in the twentieth century, and there's not a lot of consensus about what it is or how to do it.\n\nThe most prolific moment of Marxist aesthetics was in the first two decades after the Russian Revolution, especially interwar German writers (Kracauer, Bloch, Adorno, Benjamin); Russian/Eastern Bloc writers (Lukacs, Lifshitz, Marothy, Hauser), and English-language writers (Siegmeister, Shapiro, George Thomson). There was also a resurgence of it in the 1960s and '70s in Europe and England, plus a continued academic tradition that holds to Marxian ideas to various degrees.\n\nIf you want to learn more, I'd recommend the collection *Marxism and Art*, edited by Maynard Solomon. Other good sources are *Marxist Literary Theory: A Reader* (Eagleton + Milne, eds.) and *Aesthetics and Politics* (Verso). The last of these is just focused on the Germans + Lukacs, but it's the most important debate in the history of Marxist aesthetics.\n\nSince we're on a Marxist reddit, I will say the most Marxian (e.g., like Marx and Engels) way to think about art is in terms of production, labor, and other core Marxian comments, not necessarily all the symbolism/idealism/mirror theories held by the Germans and Lukacs. Marx and Engels mention art a lot in their economic writings, and it's very different from the things later writers cooked up - M&E mostly write about how artists make a living. I'm a subscriber to this tradition. I think Stephan Hammel's recent *Toward a Materialist Conception of Music History* is a very important book to check out in this regard.\n\nHow to make art as a Marxist is a whole other can of worms. The most prominent tradition is called socialist realism, which uses art as a form of political education (e.g., to explain society, the virtues of socialism). It was most extensive in the Soviet Union, and it's often criticized in the west because of anti-communism, but there were lots of variants around the world (Frida Kahlo even called herself a socialist realist). There were a lot of interesting writers/artists who made realist art, and it's very nuanced and led to some incredible art.\n\nSome really cool things I like are:\n\n\\-Bogdanov's *Red Star* (about a Bolshevik who gets invited to go to Mars to meet communists who live there)  \n\\-Belyaev's *The Air Merchant* (imagine an HG Wells novel about a crazed capitalist who comes up with a scheme to charge people for air)  \n\\-Brigitte Reimann's *Siblings* (about a patriotic sister whose brother is considering defecting from East Germany)  \n\\-Bertolt Brecht's stories and plays, especially *The Threepenny Opera* and *St Joan of the Stockyards*  \n\\-CLR James' Minty Alley (about poor people living in Trinidad)  \n\\-Diego Rivera's painting, *Man, Controller of the Universe -* my favorite painting, with a really cool story  \n\\-Any music by Hanns Eisler",

The revolution demanded the creation of a wholly new proletarian public sphere \u2014 the total reconceptualization of art\u2019s function, technique, medium, distribution format, mode of reception, relation to politics, etc. This generation of artists included, inter alia, El Lissitsky, Vladimir Tatlin, Olga Rosanova, Gustav Klutsis, Alexandr Rodchenko, Liubov Popova\u2026\n\nAs a group and individually, they blaze through one avant-garde paradigm after another like a pyroclastic flow. (Rodchenko especially.) In a few short years they go from primitivist folklore-inspired Cubo-Futurism to abstract geometric Suprematism to rationalist, spatially expansive Constructivism to factory-industrially integrated Productivism and factographic film & photo installation. The rigor is nuts, and probably so too was the project itself. It all ends pretty badly, but what a stunning run.  \n\nThe tour de force history of these shifts is the classic essay [\u2018From Faktura to Factography\u2019](https://frontdeskapparatus.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/factography.pdf) by Benjamin Buchloh. It\u2019s an incredible essay. \n\nHere also is the W. Beej I mentioned: [The Author as Producer (1934).](https://monoskop.org/images/9/93/Benjamin_Walter_1934_1999_The_Author_as_Producer.pdf)\n\nAnd, for the brief moment when it made sense to be a vanguard artist, a Marxist revolutionary, a factory worker, and a new woman of high fashion all at once:\n\n[The Soviet Constructivist Flapper Dress](https://monoskop.org/images/6/6d/Kiaer_Christina_2001_The_Russian_Constructivist_Flapper_Dress.pdf)\n\nI\u2019d be remiss not to shout out Berlin Dada, too \u2014 the most pugnacious and political Dada group. Hannah H\u00f6ch, Raoul Hausmann, George Grosz, and John Heartfield. These guys and the Soviets knew of and admired each other, but Heartfield might be the only one who makes the full transit from unique, highly-skilled, handcrafted objects for individual aesthetic contemplation to mass-produced, radically de-skilled, technologically reproducible agitprop for mass distribution and simultaneous collective reception. Heartfield was the real deal.",

There were other movements though, like \"Constructivism\" in the 20's, that were far more avant-garde.\n\nProbably the most prominent Marxist in the western artistic canon is Bertolt Brecht, who was a playwright who actively sought to promote class consciousness and materialism in the way he constructed his plays.  He was also a significant theorist and essayist, and I would highly recommend his writings for insight into some of his questions.",

Art and science function differently, and this can be a source of confusion. In the artist's field of operations, he or she takes in social life, so his or her ideological prejudices are much more obviously exposed. Art does not operate with laws and equations, but with images. The question is the objective content of those images.\n\n>The greatest representatives of bourgeois thought, as well as the entire current of classical Marxists, were always very clear on that issue, in opposition to the spiritual descendants of Immanuel Kant.\n\n>G.W.F. Hegel (1770-1831), in his writings on aesthetics, stressed the \"universal and absolute need out of which art ... arises.\" He wrote: \"But the productive imagination of the artist is the imagination of a great mind and heart, the apprehension and creation of ideas and of shapes, and, indeed,\u00a0*the exhibition of the profoundest and most universal human interests in the definite sensuous mold of pictorial representation*.\" (Reviewer's emphasis.)\n\n>Even more categorically, Hegel explained that \"it is necessary to maintain that\u00a0*art has the vocation of revealing the truth in the form of sensuous artistic shape*\u00a0... and, therefore, has its purpose in itself, in this representation and revelation. For other objects, such as instruction, purification, improvement, pecuniary gain, endeavor after fame and honor, have nothing to do with the work of art as such and do not determine its conception.\"\n\n>V.G. Belinsky (1811-1848), the great Russian thinker and critic, in his work\u00a0*The Idea of Art*\u00a0(1841), under the obvious influence of Hegel, wrote: \"Art is the immediate contemplation of life, thinking in images.\" Belinsky uses the evocative phrase \"art thinking\" in his writings on aesthetics.\n\n>Trotsky absorbed this tradition, through the work of such figures as G.V. Plekhanov and Antonio Labriola, and advanced it, providing the most specific and profound answers from a Marxist point of view to quite complex questions of the relations between art and social life.\n\n>The well-known discussion between Trotsky and the emerging Stalinist cultural spokesmen in 1924, contained in the pamphlet\u00a0*Class and Art*, centers precisely on the issue of whether art is reducible to the class outlook of the artist under consideration.\n\n>In the course of the discussion, Trotsky responded to Feodor Raskolnikov, who had advanced the view that Bolshevik political writing had to be supplemented by artistic work in which the Communist world outlook was presented. Trotsky commented: \"*In works of art he*, \\[Raskolnikov\\]\u00a0*ignores that which makes them works of art*. This was most vividly shown in his remarkable judgment on Dante's\u00a0*Divine Comedy*, which in his opinion is valuable to us just because it enables us to understand the psychology of a certain class at a certain time. To put the matter that way means simply to strike out the\u00a0*Divine Comedy*\u00a0from the realm of art.\" (Reviewer's emphasis.)  \n  \n[The objective character of artistic cognition \\[A review of 'Culture and Imperialism' by Edward Said\\] - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1993/09/said-s13.html)",
