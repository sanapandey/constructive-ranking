    "selftext": "Hello, recently I was reading a book by David Harvey in which he in passing mentions that automation would be the end of profitability according to marxist theory. This confused me and he does not expand on this in the book but after doing some research of my own I came up with this:\n\n1. According to Marx value is created by the socially necessary labour time used in the production of a commodity.\n\n2. Socially necessary labor time means the average labour and intensity required by a human worker to produce a given commodity.\n\n3. Automation reduces the amount of socially necessary labour time for the production of a commodity.\n\n4. Surplus value is extracted from the total value created by the worker and is appropriated as profit.\n\n5. Hypothetically, if the production of a commodity was 100% automated and required 0 socially necessary labor time, i.e. 0 human labor, the product produced would have 0 value because value is produced by human labour.\n\n6. If this is true no profit could be made from a product which was produced in a fully automated system.\n\nThis seems intuitively wrong so what am I missing?",

Your logic seems correct, it would be reduced to zero. But the problem here is that value as theorised by Marx wouldn't really apply to such a situation in the first place. The value-form as conceived by Marx is an effect of labour, of the necessity of labour. If we no longer need labour, then the question changes completely.",

It\u2019s possible to conceive of it along a spectrum.\n\nStart by imaging a market economy where firms need 0% labor; say because our machines are really efficient.\n\nIn that economy, the only way it can logically work is if 100% of income is funded through a UBI. Everyone gets all their spending money completely for free.\n\nOf course in an economy that needs even a little bit of labor, that\u2019s impossible. If everyone gets all their money for free no one would have an incentive to work. Production would flatline.\n\nIn the real world, we do need labor\u2014maybe even more than a little. This implies maximum market production requires a *balance* of total income: a balance between wages and *non-waged* income (free money / UBI).\n\nWe can get the balance wrong in either direction. Too much UBI and useful labor doesn\u2019t have enough incentive; production falls and the UBI just causes inflation.\n\nToo little UBI? Now we have to create unnecessary wages and unnecessary jobs to fill in the difference. People\u2019s time is wasted, resources get wasted in busywork jobs, output goes down, and we probably have unnecessary poverty, too.\n\nMarx wasn\u2019t thinking about free money as an option. Like most economists today he was assuming the average consumer is also a worker and has to earn their income somehow\u2014instead of just getting it for free from the government.\n\nIf it turns out some amount of UBI higher than $0 is possible and improves production, then not only LTV, but conventional economic wisdom about \u201cmaximum employment\u201d has to be thrown out the window.\n\nIt\u2019s possible we\u2019re already wasting labor today by over-employing the population; by making people work for money, instead of just distributing it.",

            "body": "Marx (and frankly me also), considers the idea that labor produces value as a necessary relationship. For simplicity, you can think of it as a logical relationship. I.e. if there is a part missing in your equation, that seems to imply that not all value is produced by work, then you have missed something. In the case of machines, you've missed the fact that someone produced those machines. This is why Marx says that the machines (or means of production) don't add value, because the value they have, was already contributed by the work when they were made.\n\nAnother problem is in your idea of \"socially necessary labor time\". Marx does not mean that this is determined by the smallest number of work needed to keep people alive. Rather, it is defined by the ability of a society to exist as it has existed yesterday. Because of  this, automation never reduces the amount of socially necessary labor time. Automation only redefines it. So, 100 years ago it didn't include everyone having a computer and internet, but now it does. And this is also one of the reasons labor never really feels more valuable with progress, within a capitalist society. The capitalist society just keeps upping the necessity, so to speak.",

Prior to that, the fully automated producer would receiver super-profits equal to the former socially necessary labor in whatever he is producing. Once other firms adopt these same fully automated methods, the socially necessary labor drops and only then do profits dry up. Pursuit of such super-profits is what drives all advances in productivity under capitalism, but they are always temporary, and in the long run this trend of squeezing out labor explains the observed tendency of the rate of profit to fall.\n\nBut maybe this is all an aside as I'm not clear on what your question is or where exactly you see a contradiction?

This capitalist is able to produce commodities below their value (which is understood to be just that society's current average of efficiently expended labor power). \n\nHowever, assuming a completely competitive economy without any protections (including intellectual property protections), other capitalists will eventually adopt the same technology and that capitalist's advantage will disappear. Eventually what counts as value would settle at a different point because a new social average of what counts as efficient labor would develop because workers throughout society would have become more productive.\n\nNow assume that somehow everything becomes fully automated (so there is no value) and that the economy is completely competitive. (The robots are repairing the robots indefinitely, I guess.) All the capitalists use exactly the same technology, so no one has an advantage over anyone else, and competition drives the produced commodities' prices down to essentially nothing. It is hard to see how anyone could make a profit in that system.\n\nPut alternately, if time is the ultimately scarce resource, then in a fully automated economy, time would no longer be scarce (because the robots are doing everything), so workers' labor time would no longer be the center of gravity of prices (i.e. value). Prices would no longer measure anything, so why would anything even have a price?",

            "body": "There is no contradiction, because you mixing different thinks, markets and Labor theory of value.\n\nBTW, we do have fully automatic production of an essential commodity and it market price as expected is ZERO. Air, Nature, a self replicating machine produce it in abidance.\n\nHere more extended explanation:\n\nThere are no such thin as a perfect markets. Markets are social construct, how they are function completely defined by society.\n\nHere is an illustration: There is nothing wrong with Labor theory of value. It correctly describe, how much of total available labor society used to produce something. What it does not answer, is why that commodity was produced, no it explain market prices. Here dialectical examination of connection between Labor theory of Value and markets. It is in no way invalidate Labor theory of value. Imagine a futuristic society where everything is produced and distributed by self-replicating machines. There is no human labor anywhere. What value what they produce have? Zero. There is no human labor; anyone can have what they need at any time, us much us someone needs. In a way we have such machine - Earth, Nature. It produces clean abundant air we need to live. In the past it produced food and water. Monkeys only need to lift their hands to a tree. What is the market value of Air? Zero in normal conditions. We are not paying for it yet, but it is going this way. What is use value or Air? Near infinite, as we will not live more than a few minutes without.\n\nNow imagine some enterprising people ask machines for guns, order them to build a fence around themself and reprogram the delivery system to not to deliver without their consent. Basically, a few people declare machines their private property. Private property is an ability to deny others what they need. Now they only need to introduce some currency, let's for simplicity call it $Time. You need something? Give us your time first. We tell you what to do, clean up my shoes or have sex with me. Then you can have what you need. So, first these people spend some of their time in order to create a social construct, private property, markets and scarcity. This is unproductive labor, labor that is not needed in order to produce and distribute what people need. Why does unproductive labor exist? In order to extract productive labor from others. If you look, practically every one of as do both, productive and unproductive labor. So, as you can see now, production, realization and use value have nothing in common. What is production value or Air? Zero. What is the realization value of Air? Capitalism is in the process of building fences, in the form of Carbon credits. You are already paying for air try cost of energy. What is Use value of Air? Near infinite. In addition, I will try to show that \u201clabor theory of value\u201d cannot be used to explain any aspect of markets. That market is a social construct, not any \u201cnatural structure\u201d with \u201cnatural laws\u201d.\n\nThe second thin Labor theory of value cannot explain is why something is produced. Use Value is a real concept, and I will try to answer, at least partially, why something is produced. Lets introduce dialectic. We established that in society of Abundance, if any market created it will be a pure social construct. But what happen on other specter, in society that barely produce what it need? We will come to conclusion that market is impossible. Everything has to be distributed according to one's need. Everyone has to produce at his maximum capacity. There will be no market. So, what happen in between? How market will look in between? When society start to produce some surplus, it could afford individual distribution, but still everyone need to be working near there maximum capacity. So, Value of goods on market will have to be very close to what Labor theory of value say, or people who underpaid will not be able to survive. (that what Marx observe in his time, that why he believed it is possible to use labor theory of value in order to explain markets). The bigger surplus is, the less it matter, as even underpaid population will be able to survive and reproduce. So, prices structure will be representing a social construct this particular market set, and have less and less to do with cost of production and in society of abidance cost of production no longer matter. Here is dialectic of markets as society develop. Material ideas of abundance and scarcity and syntheses of market as a social construct.\n\nSo, wold market we observe does not have any natural laws, Market structure completely defined by society. Just one small example how. Industrial goods are protected by patents and trade marks. That make them monopolies. So, they sold with big premium. I remember a few years ago I Phone had cost of production a 100$ but sold for 3000$. Agricultural good and mineral resources sold on \"free market\", for very low price. That is part of a structure imperialism used now in order to keep colonies underdeveloped in continue imperialism true economics, instead of direct control.",

See, for example: [Marx's (labor) value theory in the limit as SNLT \u2192 0](https://www.reddit.com/u/C_Plot/s/6wuodCNTrY). \n\nIronically, in a communist Universe, where labor is no longer needed, things start to look more like the neoclassical economists sees the World (the neoclassical economist was always annoyed with having to deal with labor and production anyway). In this utopian communism, natural resources are distributed as an equal endowment to all\u2014according to their renewable pace of consumption each period or any exception for depleting and exhausting non-renewable resources or renewable resources consumed at a non-renewable pace that society, through supermajority consensus, might deem justifiable and also Just to deprive posterity. \n\nThen we are merely exchanging our endowments in a market. No SNLT is performed and so no SNLT is congealed in these commodities. These resources, even as commodities, bear no value (though as commodities, these resources have exchange-value). If they circulate with money, then their exchange-value is expressed as a price in the money commodity. Rather, than myopically pursuing a capital process of M\u2013C\u2013M\u2032, more value as congealed surplus labor, we instead merely exchange use-values with one another. Our ancestors therefore have, through diligent and innovative application of SNLT, meticulously arranged the natural World, so that our material needs and desires are fully satisfied by nature reproducing itself as designed: and in that way reproduces all persons as they desire. No labor need he expended. We merely consume the material natural World tailored to our every whims (or some embodied labor as congealed SNLT still persists in the asymptotic approach to infinitely lifed trickle of value depreciation of the self-reproducing instruments of reproduction rigged up by our ancestors).\n\nNo profit exists (no surplus labor has been performed). Only the utility (use-value), gained by the mutual exchange of our endowments, drives our political economy. We neither live from our own necessary labor nor do exploiters live from the surplus labor exploited from an oppressed working class. \nThe capitalist ruling class ideologue vulgar economists merely fantasize that we already live in this communist utopia and they denigrate communism nonetheless, because it is a prerequisite to pursuing their careers.",

            "body": "The key thing is to understand that value is the opposite of wealth, an insight that comes from Ricardo. \n\nTake the example of pencils, since it's a famous example in economics. Before pencils were produced industrially, they were hand-crafted by artisans. As a result they were quite valuable; a great deal of skilled human labour had to be expended to produce a pencil. Now that pencils are produced by advanced industrial techniques, they are much less valuable. But is society less wealthy now that pencils are less valuable? No. On the contrary, society has become more and more wealthy as commodities have become less and less valuable. The value of a pencil is not zero, because of course the process is not fully automated; there is still human labour involved. \n\nNow imagine that pencil production is 100% automated. Everything from logging the trees and mining the graphite, crafting the pencil, painting it, shipping it -- everything is automated. In fact, the process is so perfected that no human technicians or engineers are even needed to oversee or repair the machines. There are two possible outcomes if this happens: \n\n1. In a functioning free market, the value of pencils would drop to zero. They might still need to have a price to cover input costs of raw materials (like oil to run the machines say). But there would be no way for any one capitalist firm to make a profit while still underselling their competitors, and the core reason for this is that there would be no labour in the process to exploit. Perversely this would mean all the pencil producers would go out of business or, more likely, only one pencil producer would survive, meaning: \n\n2. In a monopoly condition, the value of pencils would still be zero, but the price would become completely detached from the value. The monopoly firm would be in a position to set the price however they liked; the price would be entirely artificial and have nothing to do with the commodity's value. This is obviously another very perverse outcome.",

No human labor is required. The machines necessary to produce it (tree, algea, the Sun, etc) do no require any added labor, neither to function nor to be maintained and reproduced.

In almost all cases, the vast majority of value is produced by the dead labor of the historical process that led to the society where a worker can quickly produce goods on an assembly line.\n\nImagine a capitalist spends a $1 million to buy an automatic widget making machine, then hires someone to press the on button every morning. Should the guy pressing the on button get the full value of the widgets? No, according to the LTV the majority of value is the work of the people who made the machine, but they sold the rights to that value for a lump sum.\n\nNow imagine an inventor makes a Better Widget Machine that makes twice as many widgets a day. The average socially necessary labor was just cut in half. Does the worker whose job it is to turn on widget maker classic deserve a 50% pay cut? He\u2019s still doing the same amount of work but he is just a part of a production process that on average needs less labor.\n\nNow imagine both widget makers are working simultaneous to have their widgets ready to ship out for sale. They don\u2019t even know how much the average required labor is because they don\u2019t know what innovations the other may have made. Should the worker just ask to be paid a salary up front or should he wait to see how much value his labor produced?\n\nThis is why investing exists. If you pay a team of people to work on something, even under the LTV (which no one uses anymore) you can\u2019t know exactly how valuably the team\u2019s time is being spent. This is why workers prefer a fixed payment and the investor is at risk of losing money if it turns out he had them making the wrong product.",

            "body": "Others have pointed out but there are two points here: You can never have 100% automation and no physical labor. People will always produce products, i.e. I will devote some of my time to carpentry, sewing, cooking etc. So there will always be labor expended in society. On the other side of this, if there is 100% automation and no wage-labor, then no one is receiving a wage and no one can buy commodities. This crashes the entire capitalist system, since it requires circulation of money through the market. Another side of this is that capitalist society requires that one class of people are dependent on labor for their reproduction/survival. In a capitalist society that eliminates labor, this class-system cannot exist and you either will have one part of society's population die out or a complete revolution where society changes.\n\nThe other point here is that, again, you can never have 100% automation in a *capitalist* system because if there is more machines in a sphere of production, then the labor of that sphere will become more qualified (since people will need, for example, CS degrees or engineering degrees) in order for people to work in said sphere. Sure the number of laborers will be reduced but there will always be people *behind* the machines. This is what Marx means is dependence of other capitalists (I can't remember the actual term) - effects of productivity in one sphere of industry necessarily impacts a, seemingly, separated sphere.\n\nHere is my own reflection, which can be faulty. Machines don't create market value on their own, the workers operating them do. So, again, if a worker makes sure machines operate smoothly, then the wage he receives for operating them will be pushed down since his operation isn't as physical anymore. Of course this could always even out with the level of qualification of said labor: However, by using machines, he can produce MUCH more products per hour than if he was assembling said products himself. This means that surplus value actually skyrockets, since the ratio of surplus products to necessary products skyrockets. But surplus value can only be realized in a market, which necessitates that there are people that can buy the products, and we kind of get back to my very first paragraph.",
