But it is infuriating to try and reason with these people because they get to cancel your argument out on the basis that I'm a commie.",

If you are a communist it is *you* who can refute *their* arguments.\n\nLike, they think humans are inherently selfish? Okay. If that's the case, ask them to explain how civilisation and society itself even came into being, considering all societies require some form of co-operation amongst humans, and the more complex a society is, the greater the amount of co-operation needed. \n\nIf humans were inherently selfish we would have at worst become extinct hundreds of thousands of years ago and at best still be living in small nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes with not even rudimentary agriculture (tribes who would no doubt be arguing and bickering all the time because, you know, everyone's selfish).",

And even then, at a theoretical level market transactions are supposed to happen voluntarily by a sort of contract, whereas Hobbes's main concern is that in the absence of \"a common power to keep them in awe\" people would basically see themselves forced to violate other people's rights preemptively. This would make the sort of contract a market economy requires impossible (as well as all other contracts, since there's no one to enforce them), by Hobbes's argument, so there could never be a market economy in the absence of a Sovereign (again, this is all Hobbes's views, I'm not endorsing them!). In fact, enabling that type of contract between individuals is the main motivation behind establishing a Sovereign.\n\n I would definitely say, though, that the civil war period Hobbes lived quite clearly influenced his thought, as it would have seemed to him that the inability of different parties to agree on said common power led to a seemingly endless cycle of violence and misery.\n\nThe SoN is definitely not an ontological claim, I agree, nor really a historical one, IMO, but more of a thought experiment to justify political authority, and to even make it compatible with individual rights.",

But the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries correspond to the emergence of several of the conditions of possibility for the consolidation of a capitalist system (expropriation of peasantry, nascent colonization, accumulation of property in the hands of fewer and fewer lords, development of a market in land following the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s, etc.). \n\nMacpherson\u2019s main claim is that an ideology of the possessive individual takes shape in these centuries, as the breakdown of customary relations in favor of enterprise is already underway.  Hobbes is in integral figure in defining this conception of the individual. But he recognizes and fears the consequences of unrestrained economic individualism. In this sense he\u2019s a transitional figure.",

Is it about changing the world one person at a time by changing their mind, hypothetically, or is it about feeling powerful by debating someone to compensate for how e really feel about ourselves? I used to feel the same way, I was a libertarian and I argued online all the time, it gave me a false sense of empowement, and I felt like I was doing the right thing, but really I was scared and felt powerless. \n\nI'll be frank, the best way to make meaningful change and to challenge the establishment, is to work on self-improvement - not toxic self-improvement, but mindfulness, being in the present moment, being grateful. The more you improve your state of mind and are coming from a full cup, the more you can help others. But if you are exhausted you're just another cog in the machine.",
