    "selftext": "Regarding the upcoming elections in Germany and their importance for the fate of Europe and the world I have some basic questions about Marxism. In Germany we see the trend of the petit-bourgeois voting for fascism repeating. The strongest party is the conservative right and the second strongest is the fascist Nazi party. Ultimately fascism was the middle classes reaction to their impending proletarisation in capitalism. \n\nI\u2019m asking if Marx or other communists wrote about this topic. Some Marxist analysis would help me sort out theoretical questions. If the working class is the minority in a society, why should the majority of society be for revolution when it\u2019s not in their economic interest? Advice would be appreciated thanks. ",

Well, the internal contradictions of capitalism dont always result in something better, especially in a society with little to no class consciousness.\n\n\nI dont think AfD votes are all petit bourgeoisie. I suspect it's popular with the working classes who are fed up with the establishment which has been pitting them against immigrants to drive down wages for years and created economic environment where living standards have stagnated.\n\n\nWhat I AM sure of is that the establishment that claims to hate AfD so much would 1000x prefer them to the \"far left\" (people who want radical shit like decent wages) and will work harder to sabotage those parties who intend to mess with the country's capital superstructure.",

Point being that there is not a clean mapping from a (specific) marxist conception of class to the fuzzy default societal definition.\n\n\n>Doesnt that point to the incompetence of Left parties if the majority workers they claim to represent are turning to fascism?\n\n\nSpeaking as somebody who was involved in them - it wasnt so much incompetence as it was being outgunned. The capitalist establishment hates the AfD for sure but they go go absolutely *nuclear* on parties who lean marxist in any way.\n\n\nThis combined with these parties being resource poor (no billionaires to prop them up) means they often wither and die.\n\n\n>This situation is even more hopeless than I thought.\n\n\nJoin the club.\n\n\n>How can the middle class if they are working class support fascism?\n\n\nFascism offers nice easy answers, a clear and obvious scapegoat and a path for the perpetually shamed to feel pride in who they are. Many within the working class crave these things and dont feel that they are on offer anywhere else.\n\n\n>The class-consciousness must be nonexistent\n\n\nPretty much. The working class have zero media representation. None. Therefore they cant talk to each other. Therefore they dont build class consciousness.\n\n\nEven the parts of the media that *look* left wing are actually capitalists wearing a left wing mask which they use to better manipulate the working class. This has all sorts of weird side effects like co-opting \"woke\" and changing it to mean \"more black lesbian CEOs\" and other such absurdities.\n\n\nThere's a reason our elites are so comfortable with democracy. They are *really* good at manipulating it.",

Both rural and early industrial societies were centered a lot more around the local community. That's why something like atomization or suburban sprawl is so insidious. It doesn't just have demonstrable negative impacts to human health and quality of life. It also serves as a subtle way in which capitalists disrupt left wing organization and class consciousness by further isolating members of the working class from one another and insulating them from real class consciousness. They intentionally keep us apart because they know we stand no chance on our own and that our power lies in our numbers and acting as a collective rather than as individuals",

If workers build up strong Democratic institutions (unions, parties, media, etc ) then the middle classes will follow them. But the modern Party and the party system forces workers to rally around moderate political organizations that appeal to middle classes.

If you destabilize capitalism by liquidating their imperial assets, the middle class parties will fracture and the workers will lead again.\n\nIn the modern world, this means initiating revolutions in semi-feudal countries like the Arab monarchies.",

Petit Bourgeois is a rapidly shrinking group of people that don't exist anything like the way they did when Marx wrote about them. Most of what we'd call the middle class are some form of proletariat. Petit Bourgeois implies some significant ownership of private property but not enough to be sustaining without performing their own labour, the term I find most useful these days is 'passive income'. Most 'middle class' people have little to no passive income.\n\n2. Even then, reactionary and non-revolutionary doens't necessarilly mean counter-revolutionary. You can't count on the petit bourgoeis to enact the revolution but you needn't expect them to get in your way. That's what Marx says abut them deserting their own standpoint.\n\n3. Most of the support of fascism *is* likely embodied in the working class, and probably in all strata from the poorest to the richest. This isn't a death bell for communism, and it doesn't mean \"the majority of workers are fascists\"",

Yes so what Marx means when he says that the petit-bourgeoisie desert their own standpoint is that they will support the winning side in a class war and that could be fascists or it could also be communists. \n\nSo fascism has also support among the working class. My question is how that can be then. I read a lot of Trotskys analysis of fascism and he talks about the petit-bourgeoisie role in it a lot and how they betrayed the working class. Which is true because National Socialism was an ideology crafted by petit-bourgeois for petit-bourgeois.",

The Fascista and the Nazis (the **specific** parties) were both fascist reigimes. They're not the only way to implement fascism (the idology), as best exemplified by how different the two were. Trotsky's analysis of fascism was of the Parties more than the ideologies - in no small part because the ideology was so new. While his writing is helpful in contemporary analysis it holds us back to assume that contemporary fasicsm **must** follow the same patterns.\n\n1a. Modern thinking on fascism is that the ideology has very little in the way of rigid structure and is relitively adaptive to the right situations.\n\n2. fasicsm (as an ideology) is not a resolution to Marxist class contradictions. In part this is why Marxist analysis of the ideology are either fairly vague or focus on specific instances. It is perfectly possible for the proletariat (any individual of which may be completely unaware or unconvinved by Marx, and who is primarlly interested in his own struggle) to take up fascism as the 'solution' to their problems, and for some great mass of workers to do the same.\n\n2a. Marxists would say that fascism is not revolutionary, it will tend towards late stage capitalism and the need for revolution will remain until it is eventually taken.\n\n2b. Communists and fascists (ideologically) are not opposite sides in a war, the 'left/right' dichotomy isn't all that useful here. From a dialectical materialist analysis fascism contains within it the same contradictions, perhaps formatted a little differently.\n\nTL;DR Trotsky's analysis of Fascists is incomplete, in no small part because it is 80 years old, the proletariat (against their best interests) can enact fascism",

For any given population of fascists you will find some group who are desparate for change, and who found fascism before communism - as an ideology it has an easier time advertising because it doesn't have strict parameters. To this end fascism may gain more members quickly on paper but communism remains superiour at holding dedicated cadres.\n\nMost importantly, if the section of the fascist movement who simply desire change is large enough then they can be considered to not be counter-revolutionary.\n\nTo be clear this does not mean they are revolutionary, nor that it is the duty of any communist to march with a self-proclaimed fascist (deluded or otherwise) just that, with the right circumstances, there is no particular need for the communists to fight the fascist ideology when they can instead attack the bourgeois.\n\n>We need a revolutionary party that organizes workers like an army. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this, but it feels misguided.

Du Bois's discussion of the class position and psychopolitics of the \"poor whites\" is forever relevant.  \n  \nNot because of a need to introduce the historical formation of race into this discussion of Germany, but because it gives a concrete example of how a section of the proles can attach and detach itself ambiguously from the interests of (a section of) the bourgeoisie subject to changing perceptions of relative advantage.\n\n[PDF of the book](https://cominsitu.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/w-e-b-du-bois-black-reconstruction-an-essay-toward-a-history-of-the-part-which-black-folk-played-in-the-attempt-to-reconstruct-democracy-2.pdf)\n\nThe other would be Bologna's \"Nazism and the working class\".\n\n[Article on Libcom](https://libcom.org/article/nazism-and-working-class-sergio-bologna)\n\nBologna makes one point I always find crushing, that in economically disastrous 1930s Germany, state welfare assistance became dependent on an increasingly narrow municipal patronage:\n\n> \u2026 during the Depression an increasing number of people fell out of the first two levels and ended up in the third, with the result that local councils found themselves having to cope with a demand for funds which hadn't previously existed. Thus unemployed people were receiving less and less money.\n\n> To phrase it differently, the unemployed were being turned into the assisted poor, and the judgement as to whether, and to what extent, they had the right to assistance was decided no longer by a ministerial bureaucracy but by a municipal bureaucracy which was in part unprepared, but which was also overwhelmed by the huge demands being made upon it.\n\n\u2026\n\n> The result of driving the unemployed onto the system of municipal welfare was to create an army of people obliged to go asking for charity from a bureaucrat, who very often judged their needs solely on the basis of subjective impressions. The unemployed could receive social security only if they succeeded in convincing the benefits officer in a face-to-face interview. This led to the creation of a mass of millions of people who were open to blackmail. Furthermore - a fact which was important for the subsequent Nazi regime - the details of all these people were thoroughly documented.\n\n> But this was not all. As I said above, social security benefits paid by the municipal councils were expected to be repaid. Thus large numbers of people found themselves saddled with lifelong debts to their respective municipal authorities. (In a shrewd move, in 1935 Hitler issued a decree which cancelled all debts of welfare recipients to their respective councils.)\n\nMarxist analysis will point (in my view correctly) to fascism being an arrangement of class collaboration (between the bourgeoisie and a \"national\" power of the proletariat, usually but not necessarily a population majority). But this account doesn't necessarily make it clear the ways in which this collaboration can emerge, or even be compelled, by specific historical conditions.",

Petit bourgeoise, i.e. the most reactionary cohort of the class strata, are overly represented in movements such as fascism and Trumpism etc., this is borne out by the polling done on the subject. The reason why the working class supports fascism on the other hand is quite symptomatic; the working class movement has been defeated. This is a basic historic point.",

                            "body": "Basically the nature of this section of the proletariat being relatively well paid and comfortable obscures their class interest. They may be a member of the proletarian class due to their relationship to the means of production, but if they're in a sector of the economy that would not exist in a socialist society (like a speculator providing liquidity to a capitalist market) or have a negative rate of exploitation (are paid more than the value they produce) they might immediately suffer from the socialist transformation of the economy, even if it's just for a short time.\n\nCollectivisation could threaten overpaid workers' status as a labour aristocracy since their wages might fall in line with their productivity. Members of the PMC might lose their employment if a workers' government decides to focus on self-management in the economy. Transitioning to a socialist economy is not an easy road, and won't immediately make every proletarian's life better. \n\nAll that contributes to why some sections of the working class might feel more attracted to Fascism as an attractive 'alternative' to Capitalism. Then the movement spreads false conciousness among more sections of the proletariat, and the bourgeoisie is very happy to appease Fascists as a ward against Communist and Socialists since Fascism doesn't fundamentally challenge the structure of the capitalist economy. It instead reinforces it by co-opting themes of struggle and revolution while stripping their class analysis away.\n\n(also it kinda sucks that the original commenter is getting downvoted just for mentioning Trotsky, I'm no Trot, I just think it's sad that the communist movement is like this)",

Even without the age issue such a large cohort are not rebelling for socialism. They will do so for a Caliphate and their presence makes everyone else unwilling to go socialist if the fact the AfD and CDU are combined who the youth vote goes for.",
