    "selftext": "This pretty long winded and may ramble at times, so thank you if you decide to take the time to read all of this. And if you want to bow out because I'm too much of a windbag, no hard feelings. I also don't really have a TLDR other than that I think that there are problems with the idea that all struggles should be embraced to form strength in the working class, and that identity politics are ultimately less important than workers rights.\n\nIn contemporary discourse, I would very likely be considered a bigot, and would likely be subjected to incredible amounts of physical violence if I expressed what I really believe publicly. That's why I choose keyboard warfare.\n\nBut the thing I want talk about is the idea that communists should embrace all forms of struggle, because when people are united in their struggle, the strength of the coalition empowers the working class enough to overthrow the bourgeoisie. \n\nI think that's a great idea in theory, but in practice, it's significantly more complicated than that.\n\nIt becomes complicated because issues that people are fighting for are more often than not in direct opposition to values individual people have. And in the modern political climate, identity politics is what people attach themselves to in order to clearly define who is and who isn't their enemies. There are many forms of \"identity politics\", but I tend to devote attention to lgbt identity politics.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that identity politics is completely secondary to working class struggle. That's why I get irritated when the mainstream politicians - namely the American Democratic party - embraces and promotes transgender rights and lgbt rights so heavily, and frames the argument as \"your opposition hates you, so vote for me\"\n\nI admit that is true, and as a straight white male, I can't know the experiences of someone who is lgbt. But what actually ends up happening is that other people of the working class see a \"leftist\" party embracing a specific minority of people who they don't relate to, and the more fundamental issue of workers being able to get enough money to actually put food on the table for their families gets put on the back burner. In turn, that makes it even easier for the snake-oil salesman capitalists to appeal - by outright lying - that they care more about unions and working people than the \"liberals\" who are promoting an agenda to turn your kids into gays and transgenders. And, naturally, they get the votes, and once they're in office, turn their backs on the working class and enrich themselves and their corporate donors.\n\nThat is very much the reason why El Bebe Naranjito won the election. And it makes sense. Of course I mourn the loss of reproductive rights personally, but, if someone was doing better economically under the first term of the cheeto's presidency, and then they did substantially worse under Biden's presidency, and if the only argument being put forward to appeal to keep his party in charge was that they would protect abortion rights (something that much of the country believes is morally repugnant, and that many others still don't really like the idea of it), and lgbt rights (which are rights for a minority of people who many people don't relate to at all), while families can't pay a decent price for eggs, it just ultimately is tone deaf. And of course, the orange blobfish  is pulling a con, but the calculus in voting for the fascist is that he seems like he's going to implement policies that will better help your family economically than the party in charge. \n\nWhether or not I believe there are only two genders or if it's immoral for two people of the same sex to become married is ultimately irrelevant. It's great that gay couples who love each other can marry (for the time being), but is their right to marriage more important than them or us having to worry about becoming homeless or being able to eat? What is the point of having the right to access gender affirming care if you can't afford to pay for that gender affirming care in the first place? What good is Target flying the lgbt flag during pride month if they're cutting pay, hours, and benefits to their employees?\n\nFor what it's worth, the only communistic literature I've read has been the Manifesto, Das Kapital, and Bhaskar Sunkara's \"The Socialist Manifesto\". I'm familiar with Maoism, understand ideas like reformism, adventurism, and have a general understanding of Leninism. I also admittedly have my own prejudiced biases.\n\nBut to me, it seems that the embrace of identity politics - for both the right and left - is double-edged sword used by the capital-holding ruling class to make it seem like they are fighting for the common man, yet ultimately is used to further divide the working class. It's easy to take up the mantle of identity politics as a politician, because if you achieve those goals, you ultimately don't have to pay your staff more money as a result. Whether or not someone is gay or transgender, they still have to work for a living.\n\nIn the context of the struggle to get the working class a fair shake, where am I going wrong with my thinking?",

We have been scapegoated and victimized for various frustrations in societies and ruling classes have created division to control the frustrations of the masses by planting ideas of who their enemy is. Gay and trans people have been that enemy, for various reasons. In similar ways that ethnic minorities are used as a distraction to scapegoat other failings and contradictions of ruling classes lording over the working class. \n\nYou yourself already admitted that you have barely consumed communist literature, and let alone, haven\u2019t touched a single book on the struggle of gay and/or trans people most likely, and while yes, there are reactionary and liberal responses to the issues that plague us, there are still revolutionary answers. \n\n\nAny revolution or popular support must be built off the support of the people. Sidelining the most vulnerable and discriminated against groups will be nothing but chauvinism with socialist characteristics. and more pragmatically, you are sowing more division by not promoting unity and equity.\n\nHow can you believe in freedom of the masses if you think the freedom to equal rights is not as important as your so called class struggle? What class struggle do you really advocate for if you are choosing to exclude other people? It sounds like you are the one that is sowing division by singling out LGBT people as dragging down the movements or however you want to phrase it. \n\nThe more I think about it, you are scapegoating LGBT people for social and political failures, just like the capitalist sock puppets and feudal lords and popes of history. \n\nthe more you hand wave away the concerns of others, deeming them less important than your cause, the less compassion you have, the less revolutionary you are. \n\n\nyes, you can tell me I\u2019m \u201cappealing to emotion\u201d but isn\u2019t that what you are doing? You admitted yourself you have biases that would likely warrant scorn if expressed. So are you not aware that you maybe, have some things to think about more?",

I don't comprehend the vision some people have of creating, essentially, a Marxist utopia which would require the complete destruction of basically all systems of power in the Western political world, but believing that the equal rights of women, or of LGBT people, or any of these marginalized groups is somehow the barrier to getting to that point? It feels to me as capitulation, as surrendering to an enemy you have not even met yet, for the purpose of apparently getting additional leverage or support or resources for your cause? I struggle to read this kind of thing and not believe that these ideas are coming from people who are unaware of their misogyny, or homophobia, and believing that because they are applying those biases towards hypothetical large demographics of people rather than specific persons that this makes those views somehow align with the ideology of Marxism or communism? I feel the same way about this as I do towards nazbols I guess, in that I cannot find a place in my mind where these two concepts meet coherently.",

Marginalized people are more often the deepest most oppressed masses, their struggle is ultimately a form of class struggle, this is extra apparent with the black liberation struggle in the United States, but this is true about all oppressed identities. Identity politics is a natural phenomenon that is imposed on those groups by a society that is hostile to their identity.\n\n The problem is when identity is elevated above politics. This is what post-modernism often tries to do, that is one reason post-modernism is intentionally propagated by the ruling class. It produces identity pessimism( the idea that other identities are not capable of changing/ can never stop being oppressors, and that the only solution is separatism) which is extremely corrosive. Separatism can only liberate a privileged few within those groups and ultimately preserves class society. But we also know from many decades of experience that class reductionism is as reactionary and corrosive as identity opportunism. In fact there are many Marxists who analyze class reductionism as a type of identity opportunism. I'll link some pieces on the topic later when I have time to dig them up.",

            "body": "The struggle for democracy in the workplace is tied to the struggle for equality of civil rights. You cannot have one without the other. I agree politicians pretend to advocate for LGBTQ rights while only really having an interest in representing corporations, rainbow capitalism is a problem. Yes division is sown by corporations around the topic of queer rights, abortion, and race but that doesnt mean these topics should be ignored as secondary to class struggle; these topics are microcosms of class struggle itself. \n\nSubdividing the working class into gay/straight, abortion/antiabortion, pro immigrant/anti immigrant creates a counter revolutionary working class heirarchy that undermines working class solidarity. There will always be a diversity of identity in the working class, so the only class conscious thing to do is support the civil rights of all workers, to acknowledge and embrace that difference, not because we pretend our identities are secondary to class struggle but because we affirm the reality that if one of us is not free then none of us really are. \n\nThe lie that is sown by the owning class is the lie of \u201cculture war\u201d that decieves people into thinking that one subgroup\u2019s civil rights cannot exist without impeding on another, this is a patently false narrative that was created for the specific purpose of pitting us against each other. There is no \u201cculture war\u201d there is only class war. LGBTQ rights take nothing away from anyone, and the people making the argument that they do are the same people who spread the same bogus lies about racial equality in the 1950s. Its the same story over and over. We are all just human beings who want equal rights, dignity, respect, and safety; the thing preventing that is not identity, it is capitalism itself. Yes the mind numbing debate around identity is frustrating, but abandoning the subject all together is surrender, it is exactly what the owning class hopes we will do. If we give up on fighting for civil rights that is a major victory for the corporate state, and a major loss for the class struggle.\n\nI would argue that deprioritzing identity for the sake of the class struggle is in fact sabotaging our movement for a classless society, because it tricks us into creating a class heirarchy within our own movement. As long as some workers have less rights and protections than others we have a heirarchy among the workers, and this division can be leveraged by the owning class and used against us. To remove that point of leverage we must unabashedly unite, and support the civil rights of all workers regardless of race, identity, sexual orientation, gender, religion, etc. If you sell your labor to survive you are working class and your struggle is the same as mine, we all must stand up for each other no matter how \u201cdifferent\u201d the ruling class tells us we are, because we have more in common than we do in difference. I am lgbtq, I am a fighter for working class solidarity, I would fight for a religious conservative to have their civil rights protected and I expect the same in return because we are all working class. There is no contradiction in that, their rights are the same as mine however different we are.\n\nIf one worker is more harshly exploited by management because they have dark skin, because they are queer, because they dont have papers, because they have a religion, because of their gender, or because of their age or physical capability\u2026 this is a crime committed against us all. That worker\u2019s struggle is the same as yours no matter how different you perceive them to be. We must lean into our different identities, embrace them, unabashedly rally around them in defiance of the rulings class who sells this lie that our identities are mutually exclusive and somehow cannot exist in the same movement.\n\nManagement will say some version of \u201cthis person doesnt deserve civil rights/workers rights because they are different than you\u201d. Defeating this tactic of division requires we confront it head on and unabashedly stand shoulder to shoulder with the targetted worker. We cannot simply deflect into a conversation about class struggle that pretends we can accomplish economic equality without needing to prioritize civil equality in equal measure.",

A left wing identity politics unites an oppressed group against the ruling class. Right wing identity politics separates an identity from the diverse working class and oppresses/exploits it, creating a privileged group and an oppressed group.

The working class is not an undirected mass, but a collection of individuals and the first tenet of Marxism is to maximize the possibilities for the individual to truly be themselves in the fullness of humanity. The problem you rightly identify is when we need to prioritize policies, how do we advocate for rights struggles alongside distribution struggles? They are fundamentally the same struggle, but in US politics they often don't play out that way. But this itself is a trick of capitalism, to create social pressures that must be seen as competitive because of artificially imposed scarcity. The horizon must remain revolution, which was something I and many modern socialists have been reluctant to acknowledge as we have tried to work through social democratic proposals engineered by the bourgeois state. If anything the current political moment should make clear, it's that the enemies of rights for the marginalized are also the enemies of fair distribution.
