    "selftext": "Why do some people think Marx was talking only about economics and sociology? Some people think that the dialectical method is limited to the analysis of the development of capitalist society. But dialectical materialism is broader than that, in fact it is a \"refined\" form from the metaphysical materialism or mechanistic materialism, which posited \"static indivisible units of atoms\" instead of seeing it as Heraclitus saw it. \n\nMetaphysical Materialism is the last residuum of God. Yet, this seems to be overlooked by some people. Either I am crazy, or they are just missing the point. Didn't Lenin, Mao, Trotsky and Stallin say the same thing? Sure, dialectical materialism is not a metaphysics. But that's precisely the point! It cannot be, even in principle, because materialism is proven in praxis, not in the thought, not in the abstraction of matter.\n\nBut then people will say: but I can believe in God and be a marxist. Like bruh.\n\n",

            "body": "I agree, dialectical materialism can and does apply to fields outside economics and sociology.\n\nStephen Jay Gould, the evolutionary biologist, was a dialectical materialist and discovered that the evolution of new species follows dialectical laws, not mechanical, gradual laws.\n\nDialectical concepts like \"quantity turning to quality\", \"negation of the negation\", etc are abundant in nature.\n\nEdit: I would also say dialectical materialism should be a counter weight to fight creeping ideas of mysticism into the fields of physics. Theories like \"consciousness is primary\" or \"consciousness brings reality into existence\" are fully bourgeois and belong to the pre-scientific age. It is the duty of marxists to fight these ideas in science, not just in economics and sociology.",

I apply this to immanent critique: Hegel's system can't be undone to restore the idea of God, lest the same contradictions give out that killed the idea of God. It's my same problem with Liberation Theologists who view primitive communism as Eden (Which is a Hegelian revision) and wish to undo contradictions in capitalism, undo sin, to return us to Eden, rather than sublate virtue and vice (beyond good and evil, coincidentia oppositorum), individuate by confronting and subsuming the shadow self, moving us beyond capitalism, necessarily arising out of capitalism. Undoing vs sublating contradictions is akin to a peasant revolt vs a bourgeois revolution, a peasant revolt merely burns the records of debt and land holdings but doesn't challenge the feudal system itself, whereas a bourgeois revolution does, because that's by nature what it does, arising immanently from the contradictions being sublated in the material base of the old mode of production to produce the new mode of production, quantitative to qualitative shift.\n\nI personally view the idea that a soul existed before the universe did to be irrelevant as it's empirically untestable, as the enlightenment's attempt to merge science and religion to find a natural religion in deism discovered.",

But the intellectual context is ghastly different and even such a seemingly obvious word as \u201cmatter\u201d can mean many things. Additionally, physicalism is, I\u2019d say, formulated within the dualist discussions of the problem of consciousness of the past decades. That has virtually nothing to do with dia materialism.\u00a0\n\nEdit: Marxism does talk about consciousness abundantly and as far as I\u2019m aware it never tries to reduce it to material processes in the sense of physicalism. Sure, it\u2019s not idealist. But I\u2019d definitely not say it holds the scientistic physicalist position.\u00a0\n\nEdit 2: This is not to say I disagree with the god part cf. OP.

It's not about quantifiable matter divided into perfectly identical particles. Sure, there defo are (vulgar) Marxists going this way, but then where goes the dialectics? What happened to it?\n\nYou can emphasise the material conditions of existence *without* subscribing to the physicalist view of matter. The two are results of *very* different traditions and all they share are words, accidently. I can't emphasise this enough, it's a dangerous misconception to hold. Physicalism as an offspring of modern science belongs to the tradition of the bourgeois thought. It's the outcome of the rationalisation and mechanisation of the production process, if I dare to oversimplify it. I'd recommend Luk\u00e1cs here. Would you like some short references?\n\nPlease do consider this. I don't mean to be arrogant, but this really is a wrong step to take.",

Estou surpreso com a postagem honestamente, \u00e9 raro achar uma pessoa aqui que foca de fato nos aspectos praticos da dial\u00e9tica, e \u00e9 claro, tinha que ser voc\u00ea.\n\nFocusing on your post now, I would expand this matter into the practical lives of the people that uses those concepts. I just made a post about this here at the sub, discussing literally the same thing (except I call \"God\" intrinsic value, but into action, they are the same are they not?), and I can tell with absolute certain: they (99% of marxists) tend do focus on the socio and economics aspects of Marxism exactly because they do not know of it, they are, into practice, the people they so oppose. They do not recognize the role of practice into shaping the concepts, to many communists, God took the form of morals, manifesting itself into \"right\" and \"wrong\", and thus, the emancipation of the human \"spirit\" must be done through the almighty revolution.\n\nAlmost no one recognizes, by using dialectics, they can make a conciliation of not having moral standards, and wishing satisfaction, so they use God for it. As you previously said days ago, there's no need for dualism: the use of a God for a justification, or your own individual belief, they are part of the same process and develop, the Being, our Being. A constant coming-to-be.\n\nAt the end, it's all about **intrinsic value**, because intrinsic value is the foundation of life. \"Why do we eat?\" To survive \"Why do we survive?\" For the sake of it. For the sake of it isn't an illogical argument, because it's only for the sake of it we are constantly adapting, and being, therefore, being a part of reality itself. God is simply a manifestation of this, and, if the practice remains the same, is no less valid than a godless world of view. Basically, you can be a marxist and believe in god yet, your own god.\n\nI hope I answered you, and didn't got away from the topic.\n\nEdit: I also don't think there's any meaningful (practical) difference between historical and dialectical materialism to simple and plain *dialectics*. Dialectics already implies reality itself (matter) and is inherently historical, so, those words at the end just end up being fancy.",
