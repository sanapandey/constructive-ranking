    "selftext": "I\u2019ll preface this by saying I have no background in finance so if I\u2019m completely wrong about this then please correct me.\n\nBanks in the US are federally insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000 per depositor. Unless you\u2019ve got over a quarter million sitting in your bank account then all your money is getting reimbursed regardless of what happens to the bank. Hypothetically, if we convinced everyone to pull all their money out on the same day it would primarily hurt the capitalist class. The bank would run out of money before everyone could withdraw their savings but the FDIC claims to reimburse depositors within 2 days of a bank failure. Certainly we could prepare ahead of time to take care of ourselves and provide mutual aid for two days while some people wouldn\u2019t have access to savings.\n\nYou might be thinking \u201cthe government would just bail out the banks like in 2008\u201d and you\u2019re probably right. But if we did this regularly for a year, I can\u2019t imagine the US government could get away with multiple bank bailouts in a single year. I think this could have 2 benefits. First, it could be targeted to break up large banks. Second, and more importantly, it could be a powerful demonstration of the fact that life would still go on without the banks. Our labor is the source of value and their system of accounting bares little impact on the lives of people already living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI\u2019m just riffing but I\u2019m interested to hear y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Only real, consistent, honest revolution by the masses can achieve that. And even then it would ne a very long process (over generations), with a lot of setbacks.",

Because it's one thing for people to be okay with withdrawing money from their own banking account and quite another to convince them to take up arms; in the former, I can see situations where people who aren't even really marxists could get into it. More importantly, revolution is not an overnight process; the violent portion will take months, years, maybe even decades, and in the meantime strategies like this can absolutely supplement armed struggle. \n\nI also don't think OP is necessarily talking about doing this for a bank like Wells Fargo or BoA--if they are, then I agree that this is kind of an absurd hypothetical--and I think there are potential situations where smaller regional banks could be the target of an organized run even in today's America.",
