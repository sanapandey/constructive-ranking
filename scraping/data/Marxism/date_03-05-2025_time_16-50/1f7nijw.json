    "selftext": "I\u2019m not referring to conflict between bourgeoisie and aristocracy in the transition from feudalism to capitalism; rather, I\u2019m referring to conflict between two kinds of bourgeoisie distinguished by how long they have had their wealth. Old Money have inherited wealth for generations while New Money acquired it only recently. The former generally disdain the latter. It seems to me that the cause of this disdain is primarily cultural, as the Old Money think they are in more traditional and respectable lines of business, and they disdain the kind of reckless \u201cget-rich-quick\u201d ethos of the newly rich, who haven\u2019t yet developed the etiquette and values of those born wealthy. \n\nBut I wonder if there\u2019s also a more materialist explanation of this sort of inter-bourgeois conflict and if Marx ever wrote anything specifically related to it.

            "body": "> While each faction, Orleanists and Legitimists, sought to make itself and the other believe that it was loyalty to the two royal houses which separated them, facts later proved that it was rather their divided interests which forbade the uniting of the two royal houses. And as in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must distinguish still more the phrases and fancies of parties from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of themselves from their reality. Orleanists and Legitimists found themselves side by side in the republic, with equal claims. If each side wished to effect the restoration of its own royal house against the other, that merely signified that each of the two great interests into which the bourgeoisie is split \u2013 landed property and capital - sought to restore its own supremacy and the subordination of the other.\n\n(\u201818th Brumaire\u2026\u2019, [chapter III](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/ch03.htm))\n\nIn the post-1848 era of France, the Legitimists were in favor of the rights of succession of the House of Bourbon (reigned from ~1814\u201330). The Orleanists were in favor of the recently-overthrown Louis Philippe of the July Monarchy. The former were the landed-property bourgeoisie, and the latter the financial and industrial. This is usually what is meant by \u201cold vs. new money\u201d\n\nThe \u201818th Brumaire\u2019 demonstrates how the tension between these groups enabled the rise of Louis Bonaparte. Maybe give this work a try and read out of it some answers? (Also, it\u2019s a phenomenal and underrated piece). Hope this helped!",

What I can tell you is that there are Marxists, specifically Anton Pannekoek, who refer to the old middle class as part of the petty bourgeoisie: this class was made up of people whose businesses were smaller in size; small capitalists. This old middle class began to transform into a new middle class, with varying degrees, but mostly made up of proletarians. This new middle class was simply proletarians with a good economic and labor position. Thus, we see how this class goes from being capitalist to proletarian.  \nThe transformation of small capitalists into proletarians has materialized due to competition, in which large capitals come out on top.  \nP.S. : Excuse me if my message contains errors.

            "body": "\"...I realized my foolishness in suggesting that generational thinking was someone's way of organizing their concept\u00a0of change, but someone who lacked the conceptual tools to properly grasp historical and social systems.\u00a0 I say I realized my foolishness not because I think that's not true, but because I never explained why this \"someone's\" explanation of the world takes the form of generational thinking, other than just saying they suffer from some kind of \"false\" consciousness and a desire to grasp the world in the face of an anxiety about change. That's too ahistorical a claim -- a kind of analytical cop-out.\u00a0Essentially, it's not enough to say something is \"wrong\" or \"false\" because you also need to explain why that \"false\" thing takes the shape or appearance it does.\u00a0And so I want to add another explanatory narrative to why \"generational\" thinking appears today, other than just some generalist way market society organizes time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI think with the shift in global class structures that are now occurring, by which I specifically mean the immiseration of the western \"middle class\" (i.e. transfer of wealth from them to the financial class, stagnation of wages, rise in prices) a split between the \"old\" middle class and the \"aspiring\" or \"new\" middle class is occurring. For the old middle-class, lets craft a narrative and say it was the norm and expected that you could secure a full-time job after learning a trade or getting a degree, stay in a single career for the entirety of your life, get paid a salary that would allow you to afford a single-family home, and pay off your mortgage in about 30 years time just before retirement, all while putting some money away and taking a vacation here and there.\u00a0 Nowadays, the children of that \"old\" middle class are realizing that this reality, which they may have grown up with, is no longer possible. Housing prices are 10x what they were while wages have stagnated and the cost of subsistence goods and commodities has also risen, leading to increases in volatility of employment, which we call precarity.\u00a0\n\nEssentially, as the current western worker entering the workforce grapples with new economic conditions, the old western worker lives a past one.\u00a0For the current worker, increasing asset values (homes, stocks, etc) makes entry into middle-classdom unattainable and is therefore seen as a problem; whereas for the old worker -- now likely retired -- increasing asset values are a boon that allow them to live a more comfortable retirement via access to greater credit. This credit allows them to gain additional rental incomes through possibility of leveraging their current home equity to purchase another property, or increasing retirement investments as stocks balloon, etc.\n\nAnd so the differing material conditions of these two subgroups of workers creates an antagonism that takes the appearance of a \"generational\" divide.\u00a0\n\nBut the \"younger generation\", when we do a Marxist analysis, is just an obfuscating term for a conjunction of forces:\n\na) new working conditions under capitalism in the west (precarious employment, etc)\nb) working classes disregard and disbelief in the state's ability to secure their fantasy of upward mobility, and their eventual radicalization to the left or right. \n\nSo that's why today's antagonism sometimes take the shape of a generational divide: because what people are actually describing is a divide in class composition that often appears to them as a division between \"in my parents time...\" and their own.\"\n\nFull text in the link above.",
