In my prior post I meant capitalism is materialistic in the basic sense of the term.\n\nSo would it be safe to say that Marxism is founded on logic? By way of which the observable world is reality, x+y=z, which is contrary to idealism as idealists romanticize reality and believe in the unseen...not necessarily believe but exist within the realm of thinking of religion, ghosts,  the supernatural and so on.\n\nSomeone pointed out that idealists are effectively solipsistic and I agree with this..they believe they are the main character of the game...\n\n\n\nMarxism seems like a more scientific approach to socio economics to me, with minimal sentimentality applied to the class conditions that it observes/critiques. Marx sees that logically,  the pursuit of wealth must necessarily create class imbalance which must lead to class inequity, and that capitalism requires this imbalance to function, which in turn gives rise to the myriad of inner class conflicts ie racism, sexism and so on. \n\nIs this on the right track?\n\nAlso I can't seem to reply to my own thread? I am clearly a noob lol",

It\u2019s the belief that ideas are what is most important and our world around is a reflection of the thoughts in our head. But Marx and Engels show that Infact it is the opposite; it is the material world that affects peoples thoughts. For instance, thoughts on what is considered \u201chuman nature\u201d have changed with the means of production. A slave owner would have told you slavery is just a natural hierarchy and some people are born to be slaves. Kings and nobles would say they are in power because of their divine bloodlines. And capitalists will tell the world that human nature is greedy and people are born to be individualistic  and uncooperative",

            "body": "Yes, Marxism is supposed to be analytical and logical.  We analyze first, and then turn to morals second.  We also are materialist and reject idealistic or supernatural understandings of the world, which is why many (though not all) Marxists are atheists.\n\nI should point out that dialectical materialist logic, in many ways, is different from \"formal\" logic.  In formal logic, we can say precisely that a thing is equal to itself, that something cannot be two different things at once, and things like this.  While this is true in 99% of real life cases, when you zoom out to any serious time scale, or zoom out to any serious distance, this breaks down. Real life is filled with paradoxes and contradictions which cause things to be in a constant state of evolution and change.  But that is perhaps a discussion for another day.\n\nAnd Marx did not exactly believe that the pursuit of wealth created inequality.  He saw that as society became more complex and economically developed as we rose out of the stone age, there came to be a more complex division of labor, including some people being assigned roles as leaders and administrators.  Class division doesn't arise out of greed, but out of the fact that society requires division of labor to function.  This doesn't mean that class division is necessary indefinitely in the future, but it was a necessary aspect of society growing more complex in the past.\n\nAnd this class division occurs in many types of societies, not just capitalism.  It just so happens that in the modern era, most of the world functions on a capitalist basis so we don't get much first hand experience of what those other types of class based societies look like.\n\nCapitalism inevitably comes along with class division because capitalism is by definition a system in which there is a working class that relates to the ruling class through the wage labor contract.  There is no class free capitalism because of it didn't have class decisions, the definition of the word \"capitalism\" would no longer apply.\n\nAnd yes, capitalism dies go hand in hand with other types of oppression such as racism and sexism, though things like sexism certainly existed before capitalism did.",

            "body": "Marxism poses a critique on formal logic though. Not that it considers it to be strictly wrong, but rather as a restricted outcome of the fixed categories born of Aristotelian thought. Our materialism is dialectical, which means that it has to recognise the constant change contained within the subject matter. \n\nThe three laws of logic posit a world where elements can be observed detached from their context as well as transcendental, static through time. I'll list the three fundamental laws of Logic as a  reminder:\n\n* The Law of Identity: An object is equal to itself. \n* The Law of Non-Contradiction: An object cannot have a certain quality and lack it at the same time.\n* The Law of Excluded Middle: An object has to have or not have a certain quality, it can't find itself in an intermediate position between these two.\n\nMathematics, for example, is historically constructed upon these extremely useful pillars, and yet these pillars abstract reality to a drastic degree, while sometimes making us believe they depict reality as is (That's how you get economists; people who use and idolise the math without understanding where it does and does not apply). It is no surprise that quantum mechanics can sometimes get very ugly in its mathematical expression, because the maths at our disposal is not that well-suited to describe existing natural phenomena which clearly transgress the principles of Logic.\n\nOn the socioeconomic sphere, there are many situations where we see the principles of Logic being defied by reality as well, such as the bourgeoisie going from being a revolutionary class to a reactionary one, freedom existing but in a one-sided manner, which means that it is also being denied, or the existence of a feudal society whose motor force isn't based on feudalism but on the capitalistic relations of production.\n\nAs someone who sees the value of logic as an approach to thought, I see it as something akin to Newton's law of gravity: useful, when you know its limitations and the restricted conditions under which it would apply. But that's not how it's been historically treated by bourgeois intellectuals.",

            "body": "I feel like this misses the humanistic concern at the centre of Marx's philosophy and which gives his work its ethical and political significance. Marx's critique of political economy is a materialist critique, but its *reason* is to overturn the alienation of humans from that which makes us fully human.\n\nSo, yeah, Marx was \"social scientist\" (indeed, generally understood to be a key figure in the genesis of sociology as a discipline!), but he was also a philosopher with a concern for \"human nature\" or *species-being*. Putting aside what I think is a mistaken notion about non-human animals (a very European prejudice), I think this passage is illustrative: \n\n\"Man makes his life activity itself an object of his will and consciousness. He has conscious life activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life activity directly distinguishes man from animal life activity. Only because of that is he a species-being. Or, rather, he is a conscious being \u2013 i.e., his own life is an object for him, only because he is a species-being. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being, makes his life activity, his essential being, a mere means for his existence.\"",

If logic means that Marx makes use of consistent argumentation, than this is simply true, but not something noteworthy.\n\nMarxism is an attempt at a fundamental theory relating to everything human.

The fundamental structure of Marxism could be synthesized in an analysis of the material reality to the understanding of the course of history. It's important to take in mind that even if Marxism is a science not al Marxist analysis might be scientific. There has been a lot of dogmatism in the history of Marxism that influence in a negative way the analysis of many Marxist. It's important to understand that we don't believe in enlightened people or prophets, we critically analyse flawed humans with a subjective and often times wrong view of the world... and that is fine, that is how science work.",
