    "selftext": "Hi, I'm thinking my reflections here because I don't have any Marxist friend to talk to me about that and I really wanted to see other people's perspectives. I am not even Marxist, just a curious guy who is very interested now to understand this ideological anthro.\n\nI was thinking about the great historical conflict between Stalinist and Trotskyist; taking it to a theoretical resolution. In most of the cases, Trotskyist argument to criticize Stalinism refers to several ideological contradictions in terms of nationalism, bureaucracy in soviet state, very, centralized power etc. when compared to what they original Marx idea.\n\nSeriously, I agree with them at this because its most realistic and theoretical coherent position about Stalin's era. However, does the orthodoxism we visualize in Trotskyist people about defending a \"pure Marxism\" something good?\n\nIt looks for me this people sometimes put Marx as a god, as every single aspect of his theory had to be followed as he thought like it was the Bible for an extremist Christian.\n\nAs the time passes, it generates huge conflicts including the inside part of Trotskyist groups, because if you have a different interpretation than most or punctually disagree, you are automatically an \"infiltrated petty bourgeois agent,\" as Marx is an absolute perfect man who hasn't one single issue.\n\nWhen thinking like that, it looks Stalinism has given the freedom for it self to say: pure Marxism utopia cant be followed if we dont adapt it for the real world. Like... if not by stalin state and national military strutcture, maybe the Soviet Union wouldn't had lasted so much, not even other socialist centers in the world. ",

Trotskyist or not, taking \"Marxism as a dogma\" but not having a clear understanding of Marxism as a scientific understanding of the dialectic of movement and change is not the right way to apply the theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky. \n\nAny group, party, or individual in history that does not reckon with the philosophy of Marx and Engels, that is Dialectical Materialism, is doomed to run up against their own limits and contradictions by virtue of not having a firm and worked out philosophy(the best philosophy we have to date) and being unable to reckon with necessity of change. \n\nMarxism, as a product of the class struggle under capitalism, a struggle that changes and passes through various stages and forms, must be applied appropriately at all of these stages. Marxism can do this because it is based on the material truth, it describes the inner workings and processes of capitalist society and from that we can draw conclusions as to the necessity of proceeding out of the old and into the new, that is the socialist transformation of society.",

Or was it just a strategic mistake?\n\nIt strikes me as a compromise similar to the NEP.\n\nThere's probably better sources for this, but I have been reading the diary of Dimitrov (Comintern GS). Judging from it, Stalin believed a proletarian revolution in Spain was very unlilkely to succeed at the moment; the alliance was necessary to secure a democratic republic and could win; Spain falling to fascism would be disastrous and demoralizing.\n\nThe USSR started helping immediately with discounted fuel and soon with military shipments, humanitarian aid, and coordination of volunteers (International Brigades).\n\nI haven't seen anything about them being hostile to the anarchists, only to (perceived) Trotskyists/anti-Stalinists (POUM). The only mentions are:\n\n> \"Regard the anarchists as a mass workers\u2019 organization.\"\n\n> \"Communist and Socialist parties must join forces\u2014they now share\nthe same basic aims\u2014(a democratic republic).

First, \"workers\" is too vague; there were like a dozen groups among the non-fascists. You seem to suggest that the PCE were \"betrayers\" rather than \"workers\". Is that your position?\n\nSecond, workers cannot build their power if they are killed and overpowered by fascists, so in that sense, preventing a fascist takeover contributes to \"building workers' power\" by securing some necessary conditions for it.\n\nThe popular front didn't lead to choosing bourgeois alliance as some unintended consequence. That's simply what an alliance of enemies is. You cooperate to defeat a common enemy. It makes sense to criticize an alliance with someone because they aren't your biggest threat or you are strong enough to win without them or they are untrustworthy or you aren't getting good enough terms or your goals are being lost. Criticizing an alliance for being an alliance is just being against alliances for no reason.\n\nThe letter you cite does not support the claim that alliances are never acceptable or that Lenin in particular was against them.\n\nFirst, for the argument to apply, you need to establish that similar relevant conditions existed in the Russian Revolution in August 1917 and the Spanish Civil War twenty years later. Lenin's letter supports the dependence of tactics on conditions---it is about a change in tactics in response to a change in conditions:\n\n> The Kornilov revolt is a most unexpected (unexpected at such a moment and in such a form) and downright unbelievably sharp turn in events.\n\n> Like every sharp turn, it calls for a revision and change of tactics.\n\nThe failure of the German Revolution in 1919 and the rise of fascism were also unexpected sharp turns in events.\n\nOne relevant consideration is the chance of a workers' revolution succeeding without an alliance. Lenin's assessment was that the Russian revolution was close to winning:\n\n> It would be wrong to think that we have moved farther away from the task of the proletariat winning power. No. \u00a0 We have come very close to it, not directly, but from the side. ... (remembering very well that even tomorrow events may put power into our hands, and then we shall not relinquish it).\n\nOne assessment, again probably not the most elaborate that exists as it's just notes, of the conditions in Spain can be found in Dimitrov's diary:\n\n> The people and the whole world must be told the truth\u2014the Spanish people are in no condition now to bring about a proletarian revolution\u2014the internal and especially the international situation do not favor it. (Things were different in Russia in 1917\u2014[geographic] expanses, wartime, squabbles among the capitalist countries, in the bourgeoisie, and so forth.) \n\nThere's another big difference: capitalists were fighting a world war in 1917 but not in 1936, when they were trying to avoid a world war. You can disagree with the assessment, but the assessment is that the conditions are not the same.\n\nLenin's letter is not even against supporting the Provisional Government ever. It lists specific terms for support:\n\n> We shall become defencists only after the transfer of power to the proletariat, after a peace offer, after the secret treaties and ties with the banks have been broken\u2014only afterwards.\n\n> ... We are changing the form of our struggle against Kerensky. Without in the least relaxing our hostility towards him, without taking back a single word said against him, without renouncing the task of overthrowing him, we say that we must take into account the present situation. We shall not overthrow Kerensky right now. We shall approach the task of fighting against him in a different way, namely, we shall point out to the people (who are fighting against Kornilov) Kerensky\u2019s weakness and vacillation. That has been done in the past as well. Now, however, it has become the all-important thing and this constitutes the change.\n\n> The change, further, is that the all-important thing now has become the intensification of our campaign for some kind of \u201cpartial demands\u201d to be presented to Kerensky: arrest Milyukov, arm the Petrograd workers, summon the Kronstadt, Vyborg and Helsingfors troops to Petrograd, dissolve the Duma, arrest Rodzyanko, legalise the transfer of the landed estates to the peasants, introduce workers\u2019 control over grain and factories, etc., etc.\n\nThose are specific demands stressing concrete end goals of the revolutionaries even while fighting a common enemy. Do you have specific demands that you think should have been made?",

Also I am being highly reductive here to try and boil things down. It was very messy and difficult and they did not have our hindsight. So things like \u201cbetray\u201d is not moral condemnation but descriptive.\n\n>This is still too vague to mean much to me. First, \u201cworkers\u201d is too vague; there were like a dozen groups among the non-fascists. You seem to suggest that the PCE were \u201cbetrayers\u201d rather than \u201cworkers\u201d. Is that your position?\n\nBy \u201cworkers\u201d I am talking about the movement of actual workers in Span and the organizations related to that. (Basic communist manifesto)\n\nYes there were many groups related to the actual existing movemebt of workers. All of these orgs had left and right pulls within them\u2026 left vs right in the sense of supporting a dual power and class mobilization vs republic (explicitly like reformist socialists or de facto as with most of the anarchist leaders.) The CP supported the republic whereas I think the Bolsheviks would have likely tried to pull the left socialists and anarchists around pushing for a DotP through the cooperatives and unions as a means of both mobilizing the population and defeating Franco. Like a gather up all the mist advanced forces into some kind of vanguard.\n\n>Second, workers cannot build their power if they are killed and overpowered by fascists, so in that sense, preventing a fascist takeover contributes to \u201cbuilding workers\u2019 power\u201d by securing some necessary conditions for it.\n\nThen couldn\u2019t the same case be made with Kornilov? We need to stop worker collectivization and military organizing to back the shaky bourgeois state and more regular military discipline just as a means of survival?\n\nWorkers in Spain were already taking initiative - as it was in Russia. At that point the question is trying to influence the workers movements through organizational abilities.\n\nThe CP forces did arm the people of\u2026 Madrid (I think.) But they did this tactically not as a general mobilization of armed workers to defend their cities and take management of them. \n\n>The popular front didn\u2019t lead to choosing bourgeois alliance as some unintended consequence. That\u2019s simply what an alliance of enemies is. \n\nYes.\n\n>You cooperate to defeat a common enemy. \n\nCooperate is vague here.\n\nThis could be an argument that people in the US make for defeating Trump by voting blue no matter who. \n\nOn a much different level, there are parallels: the neoliberal center cannot defeat fascism, backing and bolstering their efforts does not create a social counter-weight to fascism. You might live to fight another day but fascism remains and resistance to it is eroded with each new wave. The bourgeois liberals will make peace with fascism ultimately.\n\n>Criticizing an alliance for being an alliance is just being against alliances for no reason.\n\nThis is not my intention. I am criticizing a popular front alliance of support for the republic. Like the Bolsheviks, we can have an alliance in which we also push tactics in a strategy of building class forces and dual power.\n\n>The letter you cite does not support the claim that alliances are never acceptable or that Lenin in particular was against them.\n\nAgain you may unintentionally be straw-manning my argument. I am arguing against Popular front style alliance. Like the US CP joining the Democrats and taking a patriotic turn\u2026 their thanks for loyalty was McCarthy and a post-war red scare.\n\n>Like every sharp turn, it calls for a revision and change of tactics.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where you are going with all this.\n\n>One relevant consideration is the chance of a workers\u2019 revolution succeeding without an alliance. Lenin\u2019s assessment was that the Russian revolution was close to winning.\n\nNo, this was after the July days\u2026 a counter-rev reaction to it I think. I don\u2019t think the Bolsheviks did feel like pushing for a second revolution yet. Lenin was arguing to defend Petrograd but in a way that would show that the Bolsheviks and revolutionary forces were more capable and more in support of the workers and soldiers initiatives than the formal government.\n\n>It would be wrong to think that we have moved farther away from the task of the proletariat winning power. No. \u00a0 We have come very close to it, not directly, but from the side. ... (remembering very well that even tomorrow events may put power into our hands, and then we shall not relinquish it).\n\nThis implies to me that the Bolsheviks generally DID feel defeated and he\u2019s saying - no, things are just in flux in a dialectic and we are still in a revolutionary period even if the half-assed attempt failed and things have turned against us.\n\n>The people and the whole world must be told the truth\u2014the Spanish people are in no condition now to bring about a proletarian revolution\u2014the internal and especially the international situation do not favor it. \n\nI mean this is, what, the opinion of someone arguing for this popular front approach, right? The international situation\u2026 of the USSR being afraid of Nazi attack, correct? What might social revolution mean for how France and UK respond to the sides in the Spanish conflict?\n\nWhat if you prove in practice to the imperial powers that you support bourgeois rule outside of Russia and only want to stop the Nazis?\n\nIt makes sense from a national perspective of Russia, not from a class struggle sense imo. But in their view Russia was the worker\u2019s movement so defending that is more important than workers of the world unite idealism.\n\n>There\u2019s another big difference: capitalists were fighting a world war in 1917 but not in 1936, when they were trying to avoid a world war. You can disagree with the assessment, but the assessment is that the conditions are not the same.\n\nDo we mobilize the class and build class power to stop fascism, or do we side with liberal-republics and imperial powers and hope that they don\u2019t have a bad day and just decide:  \u201cscrew it, you know the left really are worse.\u201d Or they accept your help and then gun down communist partisans after the war or purge you from public platforms and unions while re-installing Nazis.",

I'm not very informed on the permanant revolution vs. socialism-in-one country debate, but I believe SIOC was adopted in 1926, and I'm inclined to agree that everyone shouldn't have to wait on Europe, which doesn't prevent supporting others when the time comes.\n\nYes, Stalin was telling some Spanish writers that he thought the revolution couldn't succeed.
