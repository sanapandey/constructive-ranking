            "body": "My recommendation is firstly read the communist manifesto with a critical eye. The Manifesto was largely outdated even in Marx\u2019s lifetime, but it provides an essential baseline for further development.\n\nNext, read Wage Labour and Capital, and Value Price and Profit. \n\nCritique of The Gotha Program is a must. It is Marx\u2019s most developed description of a communist system. The labour voucher system is so important to building the foundations of communism and the fact that the Soviet Union never implemented it, in my opinion, was why it backslid into markets and then eventually broke apart as a result.\n\nThe Civil War in France is also a great description of Communism in The Paris Commune chapter.\n\nEngles Socialism, Utopian and Scientific is good too. I was surprised when I first read it because the title actually means Utopianism contrasted with scientific socialism, whereas when I first read the title, I had assumed it was a selling point like \u201cit\u2019s both utopian *and* scientific.\u201d The book really digs into the differences between the two philosophical approaches to socialism and shows how scientific socialism must win out.\n\nAnti-Duhring is also essential reading. It goes into what the revolution will look like. I have only read excerpts of it, but it\u2019s on my list. This is the book that the \u201cwithering away of the state\u201d concept comes from.\n\nI haven\u2019t read the German Ideology yet but I think it\u2019s a refutation to Max Stirner. \n\nOn Authority is good when read with a critical eye. Many MLs seem to think that On Authority gives any aspiring authoritarian carte Blanche to do whatever they want, but it\u2019s actually more of a semantics piece about contrasting anarchist philosophy with Marxist, nowhere does it endorse Central Committee style Leninism. \n\nThe Origin of The Family, Private Property, and The State by Engels is an in-depth application of historical materialism to history. Any and every historical materialist ought to read it.\n\nAnd then finally, there\u2019s Capital. You\u2019ll likely have to read this excessively long tome multiple times because you\u2019ll glean more from each reread. Understanding it is hard. I\u2019d recommend with the first read-through to just get through it, then on subsequent reads get out a highlighter pen and critically analyse each chapter.",

Lenin is not exempt from criticism by any loophole: like the US Supreme Court declaring Lenin imminent to criticism. \n\nIf you\u2019re saying that worker co\u00f6peratives alone are insufficient to end class distinctions and class antagonisms, then I would agree fully. I imagine Resnick and Wolff would agree as well, who call worker co\u00f6peratives \u201ccommunist enterprises\u201d. \n\nAnd Marx also celebrated worker co\u00f6peratives and saw them as vital for communism (**emphasis** added):\n\n> Yes, gentlemen, the Commune intended to abolish that class property which makes the labor of the many the wealth of the few. It aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators. It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming the means of production, land, and capital, now chiefly the means of enslaving and exploiting labor, into mere instruments of free and associated labor. But this is communism, \u201cimpossible\u201d communism! Why, those members of the ruling classes who are intelligent enough to perceive the impossibility of continuing the present system\u2014and they are many\u2014have become the obtrusive and full-mouthed apostles of co-operative production. If co-operative production is not to remain a sham and a snare; if it is to supersede the capitalist system; if united co-operative societies are to regulate national production upon common plan, thus taking it under their own control, and putting an end to the constant anarchy and periodical convulsions which are the fatality of capitalist production - **what else, gentlemen, would it be but communism, \u201cpossible\u201d communism?**\n\n\u2014 [_The Civil War in France_ (1871 p27)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/civil_war_france.pdf)\n\nCo\u00f6peratives alone are insufficient: especially just a co\u00f6perative here and there. We require a universalization of worker co\u00f6perative enterprises for all collective commercial production. We also need a socialist Commonwealth to steward allocation mechanisms that co\u00f6rdinate and administer commercial production and consumption, as well as other common wealth and common concerns, such as those listed in the planks in the _Manifesto of the Communist Party_.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re saying that class analysis is not economic analysis, you are way off base. Class analysis is the kernel of Marx\u2019s (critique of) political economy and his historical materialism. Marx\u2019s opus shines a light on the performance, appropriation, and distribution of socially necessary labor-time (SNLT), and surplus labor, in various social formations and modes of production across history: focusing primarily on the contemporaneous capitalist social formation and the capitalist mode of production. Value and value-form are central to class analysis within capitalism.",

JohntheDuncan should have started with _Knowledge and Class_. The ruling ideology is the ideology of the capitalist ruling class. And because of authoritarianism, JohntheDuncan merely squeezes the roundness of Marxism into the square hole of capitalist thought. For example, his distinction that capitalism is about solely economic control through the market, whereas feudalism was political control, forces the capitalist trite trope onto Marxism. Marx focused on \u201cpolitical economy\u201d, as a dialectical unity. The idea that capitalism could exist without political control\u2014without a capitalist State controlled by the capitalists ruling class\u2014would have not been coherent to Marx. Same for separating politics from economics. \n\nOr the idea that Soviet workers were not producing commodities, sold by merchants for rubles, is bizarre. Marx does not deride money. Rather he believes once capitalism is ended, and with it the fetishism of commodities, we will find superior mechanisms to allocate resources superior to commodity circulation (so that resources never need to become commodities in the first place). Therefore money is obsolete because there are no commodities for money to circulate (no M\u2013C\u2013M\u2032, C\u2013M\u2013C\u2032, nor M\u2013M\u2032). \n\nThe Soviet planning planned the market crony capitalist political economy. It is only capitalist ruling class subterfuge that imagines Walmart and Amazon do not centrally plan, or on the other hand that the Soviet Union had no commodities,  no money, and no circulation of commodities. \n\nJohntheDuncan engages in too many errors for me to address here, but they all begin with that authoritarianism regarding knowledge that I already described. JohntheDuncan understands Resnick and Wolff as misusing terms because their deployment of terms offends the ruling capitalist ideas. Having read _Knowledge & Class_, as my companion to reading Marx, I can assure you that there is bountiful prose in Marx to support the understanding of Marx we get from Resnick and Wolff. \n\nIronically, the state capitalism moniker that Resnick and Wolff use for the USSR aligns with Lenin\u2019s view after the revolution (ironic given you complained about Wolff being critical of Lenin). It was Stalin who rebranded the state capitalism as \u201csocialism\u201d and went on developing state capitalism from there because whatever else one thinks about Stalin he was a capitalist sympathizer through and through.",

In fact, I clearly stated that I appreciated it in my first sentence.\n\nI misread you as being snarky then. This suggestion was so irrelevant to the thread, I took it as a dogwhistle to the Stalinists. \n\n> That superior method of circulation begins with the labour voucher and is supplanted eventually by to each according to their need. \n\nThe superior mechanism of allocation (not circulation) inevitably begins socialist markets as socialism/communism emerges from the womb of capitalism\u2014midwifed by the proletarian State. Socialist markets (not market socialism, which is a misnomer that misunderstands socialism) is already vastly superior to the capitalist markets\u2014manipulated, commanded, and controlled by the capitalist ruling class as they are. Already with socialist markets, the ability and willingness to pay criteria of market allocation is already improved because ability to pay is determined by genuine contributions to society (labor, arbitrage, conservation, warehousing excess) rather than anti-social detractions from society (exploitation, pilfering the common treasury of natural resources, outright swindle and grifting). \n\nMarx is a dialectical thinker so an orthodox Marxist understands that just as the transition from capitalism to communism is a process of becoming, so too is the transition from capitalist allocation mechanisms to superior allocation mechanisms also a process of becoming. The process requires a science of allocation that brings with more perfect socialist markets and develops understanding of how to find even more perfect allocation mechanisms. However, already with socialist markets\u2014combined with direct-production-consumption in the residential commune and communist household\u2014the most glaring deficiencies of capitalist allocation mechanisms are removed. \n\n* Externalities are internalized, \n* information about resources is made abundantly available, \n* market frictions are removed (such as no sales taxes nor tariffs between socialist nation-states), \n* boom-crisis oscillations are dampened, \n* market risks are universally hedged, \n* natural monopolies are governed through republic rule of law by the socialist Commonwealth as the common wealth that they are, \n* natural resources and natural resource rents shared as a common treasury and distributed equally as a social dividend, and \n* market hegemony by monopolists and the like are tightly regulated. \n\nFrom the greater understanding of allocation we gain from socialist markets and residential communist direct-production-consumption, the science of allocation may very well discover superior allocation mechanisms: ones that make labor vouchers appear trivial. \n\nTo each according to need, in some sense, is already achieved by the social dividend while natural resources remain scarce (as in the demand exceeds the supply at a zero \u201cprice\u201d, and where supply is scientifically determined as a renewable rate of extraction or an exhaustible rate as determined by a democratic deliberative supermajority concerned with posterity). \n\n> I\u2019m not really sure what you mean by authoritarian. To my knowledge, JohntheDunkan is an orthodox Marxist, not a Leninist and I think he is critical of the Soviet Union.\n\nLenin was not much of an authoritarian. However, if we read Marx through the authoritarian capitalist ideological lens, we invariably produce an authoritarian Marxism. That authoritarianism manifests itself in the rigorous insistence that terms can only mean one thing (homonyms must not exist) and so nuance and meaning in Marx is obliterated.  \n\n> It almost feels like we must have watched two different videos. \n\nPerhaps you posted the wrong link. \n\n> His point was that capitalism is a totalising system, not that capitalism is economic and feudalism was political.\n\nWell he said capitalism is economic and feudalism was political. If he merely meant a capitalist social formation is a totalizing system, then he should have said that. If he did, he would not have disagreed with Resnick and Wolff, who also see the capitalists social formation as totalizing and hegemonic. That capitalist social formation totality, for Resnick and Wolff also includes class processes and specifically capitalist class processes that are nevertheless distinct from the social formation (but also serve as conditions of existence for the hegemonic social formation). Even more, there are classes of persons\u2014appropriator (industrial capitalist), receiver, and performer of surplus labor (worker)\u2014who each have unique positions within the capitalist social formation and with respect to the class processes of performing surplus labor, as well as appropriating and distributing that surplus labor to recipients. \n\nThe communist class process that JohntheDuncan derides is therefore not a continuation of class distinctions and class antagonisms, in terms of those who occupy class positions, but rather the process of performing, appropriating, and distributing surplus labor continues even though class position distinctions are abolished. This is much like the term \u201creal (Royal) property\u201d continues even after the royalty have long ago been beheaded (\u201crepublic property\u201d more apt). \n\n> You say that \u201cJohntheDuncan understands Resnick and Wolff as misusing terms because their deployment of terms offends the ruling capitalist ideas.\u201d Can you explain what you mean by this? How does the construction of class as purely political without materialist foundations offend the capitalist class? It seems to me as if idealism is right at home among the bourgeois philosophers.\n\nIt is the insistence of JohntheDuncan that the discourse must he dismissed that reflects capitalist ideology (which is an idealism). It must be dismissed because the capitalist ruling class insist their power is solely an accident of their good fortune on the market (and the misfortune of the workers; they merely have different endowments because kf an accident or Divine intervention; though the capitalist ideology also says that the workers are also deficient and unfulfilled due to faulty preferences).\n\nThe conditions of existence to which Resnick and Wolff constantly reference are the material conditions for the class process, the class positions (class structures), and the class social formation. There dialectical overdeterminants both profoundly shape the (political economic) class processes but also have their own existence (where the class processes are conditions of existence for the non-class processes as well). What is it about the term \u201coverdeterminations\u201d makes you think these processes are divorced from and exercise no influence whatsoever over the class processes?!",

I don\u2019t know how you can call Richard Wolff\u2019s idea allocation when it is subjected to the whims of market fluctuations. \n\nThere inlines the key difference between orthodox Marxism and whatever you\u2019re advocating. You have adopted from Wolff the idea that it is the capitalist class that \u201cmanipulates, commands, and controls\u201d the markets when it is in fact the other way around. The anarchy in production means that the market forces dictate where this or that will be circulated, not a common plan. The capitalist class conspires to control the market, but markets are slippery things and slip through their fingers like sand. It is the markets that control the capitalists.\n\nA capitalist is just as much pressured by the market to act as they do as the proletarian is pressured to sell their labour-power for a wage. The Capitalist class does not consciously create the various problems in production such as crises of overproduction, inflation, economic crashes, economic imperialism, homelessness, the reserve army of labour, and the impoverishment of the 90% and the enrichment of the 10% because they are moustache twirling villains. They do it because market forces force capitalists to make tough decisions day after day to keep their businesses profitable.\n\nIf every company in the world was cooperatised today, in absence of a labour voucher system or some other such system of non-market and non-monetary resource allocation, absolutely none of the problems of capitalism will be solved at all. The whip will simply change hands from the capitalist to everyone. Socialism isn\u2019t when every worker is holding the whip against each other, it is when all the whips are disposed of after using them against the capitalists.\n\nTake the reserve army of labour, as an example. This exists because with full employment, in a monetary economy, regardless of whether it is individually owned or cooperatively owned, full employment will cause massive inflation, which will lead to massive firing of fellow workers from worker cooperatives, and eventually bring homelessness back to default capitalist levels.\n\nA society that allocates resources based on capital, regardless of whether that capital is individually or cooperatively owned, is a capitalist society. There has as of yet been no society that has reached the first stage of socialist production which is defined by industrial production without capital or commodity production. Thereby, there is no such thing as market socialism or a socialist market, regardless of which word you put first.\n\nProducer and appropriator are not classes. If that was the case, then there has never been such a thing as a classless society, even under primitive communism because the sick and elderly and children appropriated from the abled during that time. \n\nIt\u2019s all well and good to say \u201cperhaps people will still use the term \u2018class\u2019 colloquially in the same way as \u2018royal\u2019 property is used colloquially now\u201d and it\u2019s a very different thing to insert the term class into complex theoretical discussions of communism on the hunch that the word may be used that way.\n\nClass exists as a mode of oppression based on the scuffling over resources. That scuffling does not stop if every company is now cooperatively owned or privately owned or state-owned. The scuffling ends when the monetary system of circulation ends. When the law of value is abolished.",

So much of what you write here \u201cactually does no more than interpret, systematise and defend in doctrinaire fashion the conceptions of the agents of bourgeois production who are entrapped in bourgeois production relations\u201d and then you call it\u2014without any sense of irony\u2014\u201corthodox Marxism\u201d.\n\n> In a labour voucher system it would be allocation\u2026 [but not allocation] when it is subjected to the whims of market fluctuations.\n\nWe must distinguish three separate overdeterminations:\n\n1. vagaries from material conditions independent of allocation mechanism but which will exert their weight in market allocation. These overdeterminations exist independent of allocation mechanism, such as when a drought creates severe scarcity for water (exerting its weight in the market through a sharp rise in price)\n\n1. vagaries due to inherent traits of markets\n\n1. vagaries imposed by a capitalist ruling class (or capital person dodged by the capitalist ruling class if you prefer) as they dump risks and consequences in the working class.\n\nMarkets ration/allocate according to one\u2019s ability and willingness to pay. Labor vouchers do as well. Both suffer from the vagaries of (1) that are independent of allocation mechanism. Socialist markets and labor vouchers are both exempt from (3) because the capitalist ruling class are deposed and class antagonisms are ended in both cases. The question then is what vagaries of markets remain with socialist markets that labor vouchers avoid?\n\nMarx says this in the topic in his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ (notes to himself) after he allowed himself to get sucked into distribution issues):\n\n>  Quite apart from the analysis so far given, it was in general a mistake to make a fuss about so-called distribution and put the principal stress on it.\n> \n> Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves. The latter distribution, however, is a feature of the mode of production itself. The capitalist mode of production, for example, rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of nonworkers in the form of property in capital and land, while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production, of labor power. If the elements of production are so distributed, then the present-day distribution of the means of consumption results automatically. If the material conditions of production are the co-operative property of the workers themselves, then there likewise results a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present one. Vulgar socialism (and from it in turn a section of the democrats) has taken over from the bourgeois economists the consideration and treatment of distribution as independent of the mode of production and hence the presentation of socialism as turning principally on distribution. After the real relation has long been made clear, why retrogress again?\n\nThough perhaps Marx would be expelled from the orthodox Marxist club (though as another Marx said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member\u201d; that\u2019s contradiction for you).\n\n> You have adopted from Wolff the idea that it is the capitalist class that \u201cmanipulates, commands, and controls\u201d the markets when it is in fact the other way around. \n\nMy language was imprecise. I meant that capital, as personified by the members of the capitalist ruling class, manipulates, commands, and controls the markets for the interest of the capital they have conjured through spells (number (3) in my list of vagaries). \n\n> The anarchy in production means that the market forces dictate where this or that will be circulated, not a common plan. \n\nSocialist markets do not eschew a central plan. The anarchy of the market is deliberately subdued with socialist markets, augmented by a central plan (but a central plan that meets the needs of producers and consumers alike who are not divided into classes, in class structures with class antagonisms, and not central planning in the service of the monopolist kings of the capitalist ruling class as with capitalist markets) . In so doing the science of allocation discovers new mechanisms of allocation that further subdue the chaos of the market by superseding the market.\n\nIf you feel science of allocation has already discovered all it needs to discover, can you articulate the vagaries we suffer inherently from market allocation, (2) in my list: vagaries that are absent from labor vouchers? Because I cannot (hence Marx\u2019s note to himself that it was a mistake to get stuck in the muck of thinking of socialism turning on distribution).\n\n> A capitalist is just as much pressured by the market to act as they do as the proletarian is pressured to sell their labour-power for a wage. \n\nNo. The capitalist ruling class is positioned to dump risks and other sufferings on the working class from their vantage as the ruling class. They do not suffer just as much from capitalist markets as the oppressed classes.\n\n> The Capitalist class does not consciously create the various problems in production such as crises of overproduction, inflation, economic crashes, economic imperialism, homelessness, the reserve army of labour, and the impoverishment of the 90% and the enrichment of the 10% because they are moustache twirling villains. They do it because market forces force capitalists to make tough decisions day after day to keep their businesses profitable.\n\nSome of those arise from (1), some from (2). But many arise from (3): suffering imposed by the capitalist ruling class because the capitalist ruling class, in its personification of capital, commands and controls the capitalist markets.\n\n> Socialism isn\u2019t when every worker is holding the whip against each other, it is when all the whips are disposed of after using them against the capitalists.\n\nThere is the whip imposed by material conditions, regardless of allocation mechanism. The whips of exploitation and pilfering the common treasury of natural resources are both gone with socialist markets. Whatever whips remain in socialist markets, that don\u2019t exist with labor vouchers, remain for you (or someone) to articulate. I\u2019ve never encountered such a discussion. \n\n> Take the reserve army of labour, as an example. This exists because with full employment, in a monetary economy, regardless of whether it is individually owned or cooperatively owned, full employment will cause massive inflation, which will lead to massive firing of fellow workers from worker cooperatives, and eventually bring homelessness back to default capitalist levels.\n\nThis is the sort of misconceptions propagated by today\u2019s libertarians\u2122\ufe0e who are the most severe and vanguard propagators of the (mis)conceptions of the bourgeoisie. Full employment does not in and of itself cause inflation. Full employment achieved through expansion of the money supply causes inflation.\n\n> A society that allocates resources based on capital, regardless of whether that capital is individually or cooperatively owned, is a capitalist society. \n\nSee my earlier quote of Marx from the _Civil War in France_.

In a market \"socialist\" society, the capitalist class just becomes universal. Marx perfectly described this kind of socialism in the bourgeois socialism section of the Communist Manifesto.\n\n  \n\"The Socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois Socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march straightway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality, that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.\n\nA second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this Socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence, in economical relations, could be of any advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, *this form of Socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production* (emphasis mine), an abolition that can be affected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labour, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work, of bourgeois government.\n\nBourgeois Socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.\n\nFree trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison Reform: for the benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism.\n\nIt is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois \u2014 for the benefit of the working class.\"\n\n  \nA world with cooperative societies is exactly this. A bourgeoisie without a proletariat. Competing private business ventures without any workers who work *for* a company. Instead, they own the company and they willingly sacrifice their humanity to the alienation and abstraction of market forces.",

Then, in response, other worker cooperatives must do the same, especially in the case of lowering prices competitively, meaning the cooperative members have less surplus value to share amongst themselves and or reinvest in production. Practically every ill of capitalism, with the one exception of technical legal ownership, will exist under a market co-operative based system. You will see some rich co-ops and some poor ones, and you'll see some rich members of a co-operatives and poor members of that same co-operative. You will see some members with disproportionate power and sway, and you'll have the same problems that happened in the soviet union.

This makes profits impossible, and therefore massive firings have to take place or money has to be injected into the economy to pay the wages of the highly paid workers. Full employment under a market system is terrible for the economy, and that is one of the main reasons why market systems are bad.",

Before this mode of production is the transitionary period, which can be \\*nothing but\\* the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. Meaning not yet socialism, but more like a cocoon of socialism.\n\nSo many words when you could have just said \"I think socialism is when markets.\"\n\nUnder the socialist mode of production, workers do not perform surplus labour and surplus value does not exist. With the labour voucher system, the worker takes home exactly in proportion to what they have produced. If they work for 10 hours, they can take from society their due of items that collectively took 10 hours to produce when put together, minus a deduction for the common good. This deduction is not a surplus, it is not surplus labour, it is a component part of necessary labour. Concrete rather than abstract labour.\n\nIn contrast to all class societies, socialist production differs in that none of the working day is done for the sole benefit of the individual labourer, but rather for them and the whole collective. It is not their labour to begin with, it is social labour, and therefore there can't be a surplus. In slave society, the whole working day was done for the master, under feudalism, a portion of the working day was spent making a surplus for the lord, under capitalism, the worker is confronted with a working day that is entirely their own individual property until they sell it to the capitalist, upon which it becomes a commodity that they have bartered off. Under a socialist system, the labour is social from the very inception and therefore does not confront the labourer as a separate, abstract, inhuman entity. For the first time since primitive communism, human social nature is not at loggerheads with social production. \n\n Labour is administered according to a common plan so that surplus does not exist because each worker is producing what is planned. It is not produced for sale, but for use, meaning products do not take the form of commodities. There is only necessary labour, no surplus labour. The elderly, sick, and young do not receive a surplus, they receive a share in the total social stock.\n\nExactly how long have you been studying Marx. This idea that Marx only used critique of economy to gently nudge people towards political ends is something so outside of the realm of reality that I must question if you are a visitor from another dimension in the multiverse. His most volumous work is capital. How can you read capital, the hundreds of pages on the commodity form and the law of value and the intricate workings of the market system and then say Marx's \"real\" concern was only surplus labour and distribution? \n\nThis idea that class processes can exist without class distinctions is bizarre. Sharing doesn't produce classes, hoarding does. It is not a class process when food and housing is given to those in need.",

I say the issue of allocation is far inferior to the revolutionary transformation in the mode of production.\n\nThe _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ lists several distributions of surplus labor still necessary in communism. Marx also takes pains to distinguish the gross from the net product which distinction you trample in your characterization of labor vouchers. Some deductions might be a part of necessary labor, but others, such as to account for natural resources as means of production (what in pre-communist societies we call \u201crent\u201d) are purely distributions of surplus labor and can thus serve as a monetary or in-kind social dividend (SD) for equal distribution to all. \n\nAs for the rest, you seem to be a generative AI model, carefully taking Marx\u2019s text and spinning it to be its opposite. For example, Marx explains how slaves only appear to be working all day for their masters, but must also perform necessary labor. You also seem to think the market is economic and that production is political (yet another bourgeois misconception I might get from a Libertarian\u2122\ufe0e. For Marx, it is all political economy.

Then his masterful segue where he transitions to the next nearly 100 chapters discussing the performance, appropriation, and distribution of surplus labor as surplus value within a capitalist mode of production and distribution. \n\nWe can\u2019t have capitalism without the commodity: commodity production is the manner by which capitalists extract surplus labor from their workers. However, we can and do have commodities without capitalism. We can and will have communism, where exploitation and pilfering of the common treasury of natural resources are both abolished, yet still with commodities produced and circulating. The claim that we _must_ find a better allocation mechanism is a delay tactic that the capitalist sympathizers use to hold out the false promise of socialism/communism which they never want to deliver (much like the claim that the working class is not competent to expropriate the capitalist ruling class expropriators for at least a few more centuries which we got from Bakunin to Stalin).",

That\u2019s what the dictatorship of the proletariat is for. The dictatorship of the proletariat still has markets and commodities, but it is in the process of eliminating them, upon the success of which it becomes the socialist mode of production.\u00a0\n\n\"*Between capitalist and communist society* (emphasis mine) there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which *the state can be nothing but*\u00a0(emphasis mine, meaning it is not socialism, it is nothing but...) *the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat*.\"\n\nThe thing I linked goes into far greater detail than I possibly could.\n\nAs for quotes from the Critique that directly attack Market Socialism, which at the time was represented by Lasalle\u2019s worker co-op socialism, Marx said:\n\n\u201cIt was made clear that the wage worker has permission to work for his own subsistence\u2014that is, to live, only insofar as he works for a certain time gratis for the capitalist (and hence also for the latter\u2019s co-consumers of surplus value); that the whole capitalist system of production turns on the increase of this gratis labor by extending the working day, or by developing the productivity\u2014that is, increasing the intensity or labor power, etc.; that, consequently, the system of wage labor is a system of slavery, and indeed of a slavery which becomes more severe in proportion as the social productive forces of labor develop, whether the worker receives better or worse payment.\u201d\u00a0\n\nRight here is the key. It is not the capitalist that causes the contradictions in production, but wage labour. The wage is not defined by the distribution of surplus value, but its presence in the first place. Wage labour, whether done for a worker cooperative or for a capitalist, is a system of slavery. Marx goes on to say:\n\n\u201cAnd after this understanding has gained more and more ground in our party, some return to Lassalle\u2019s dogma although they must have known that Lassalle did not know what wages were, but, following in the wake of the bourgeois economists, took the appearance for the essence of the matter.\n\n\u201cIt is as if, among slaves who have at last got behind the secret of slavery and broken out in rebellion, a slave still in thrall to obsolete notions were to inscribe on the program of the rebellion: *Slavery must be abolished because the feeding of slaves in the system of slavery cannot exceed a certain low maximum!* (emphasis mine)\n\nThis shows Marx\u2019s feelings on the matter. To abolish classes without abolishing the conditions of those classes means nothing. If a slave\u2019s master is removed but the slave still must obey the rules previously set out by that master, the slave remains a slave even in absence of their master.",

Labour under communism only takes its use value form and does not appear as an exchange value which worker's could then be handed by their cooperative enterprise. If a worker is being paid a wage, then they are a wage labourer, and therefore still enthralled to class systems. \n\n\u201cFirst, the general costs of administration not belonging to production. This part will, from the outset, be very considerably restricted in comparison with present-day society, and it diminishes in proportion as the new society develops. Second, that which is intended for the common satisfaction of needs, such as schools, health services, etc. From the outset, this part grows considerably in comparison with present-day society, and it grows in proportion as the new society develops.\u201d\n\nThis line shows the profundity of Marx\u2019s thought. Because of the economic foundations that are built during the dictatorship of the proletariat, the capitalist aspects of the economy shrink and the socialist parts grow in proportion to societies development, not as a result of a bunch of bureaucrats willing it to be so or people in cooperatives voting for it to be so. It happens because the economic building block of socialist production (the labour hour/labour intensity) inherently creates different outcomes than the capitalist building block (the commodity).",

The disappearance of alienation and abstract value. Labour, under communism, would no longer confront the worker as an abstract and opposing force, but rather as a part of life itself. It is a purely social activity, without appearing as an individual one. You critiqued me earlier because you thought I was saying that slaves worked entirely for the master, but I was not. I was saying that slaves appear to work for the master. This creates an abstract and confusing environment that just puts the rotten icing on the cake of that particular class system. For the first time since primitive Communism, under the socialist mode of production both appearances and content coincide rather than obscure and confound. \n\n\u201cWithin the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the *value* (emphasis is Marx\u2019s) of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, *individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor.* (emphasis mine)\u201d The phrase \u201cproceeds of labor\u201d, objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all meaning.\u201d\n\nHere is what I was saying about component part of social labour. Under socialism. social labour appears as what it is. Social labour. Under class systems, social labour appears as the property of individuals, whether the slave master, the capitalist, the proletarian, the serf, etc. Under socialism, all labour is social, therefore there is no abstract labour. Given that production is brought under control and market anarchy is done away with, there is no surplus labour because all labour is done to fulfil the necessary needs of society. \n\nUnder a class system, when a worker produces and then gets expropriated of their produce, they have produced a surplus. They initially produced either directly for themselves or for a wage to sustain themselves, and then a surplus after the end of that necessary labour is converted into the property of the capitalist. Surplus labour. Under socialism, labour is from the very start social, and so there is no expropriation of surplus. There is only gifts. Sharing.\n\nIf, for example, I were to cook two fish, one for myself, and one for my father, the extra fish does not appear as a surplus. It fulfils a necessary social and material role, and so is considered part of necessary social and material production. It becomes a surplus once I part with it on a market because I created it for sale, to receive an abstract value payment. Under socialism, this does not exist, production is done according to a plan, and therefore it is not surplus, but part of the total social product.  It is not something extra on top of anything else, it appears as a use-value from start to finish.",

It goes back to what Marx said about products not appearing as values under socialism, but as use-values. If there is no individual ownership of any of the produce until it is passed into means of consumption, and if workers can give nothing but their labour (which necessitates that value cannot exist because if it could, then a worker could also give value, not just labour), then content and form cannot exist in the capitalist sense with its value, capital, and commodities, etc. \n\n\u201cAccordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it.

It shows that exchange does still exist under the socialist mode of production, but in a very different way to one in which capital exists. One hour equalling one hour, or one unit of effort equalling one unit of effort, sets up the foundations of how socialism develops. Without this foundation, it cannot develop any further than what Lenin achieved. It is the fact that all labour is treated with an equal standard that creates the incentive to continuously improve the efficiency of the means of production because, 1: when products are made according to a common plan instead of for sale, how much needs to be produced is decided beforehand. Therefore, the quicker and more efficiently the work gets done, the quicker you get home, and the more free time you have. \n\n  \n2. the workers automatically become entitled to a greater amount of products as a result of new efficiencies in production, therefore incentivising everyone to cooperate and work smarter, not harder, thereby building socialist consciousness and paving the way for higher-phase communism.",

To create for the common stock becomes life's prime want, as Marx put it. One does less overall labour, yes, of course, but the form and quality of that labour is inherently changed to be exclusively non-alienating and non-abstract, rather than a combination of some necessary concrete labour and some abstract, surplus labour.",

This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor.\u201d\n\nHere, Marx is saying that even though under communism, everyone has equal right in proportion to their labour, given that their labour is unequal, some will still be entitled to more than others. He says:\n\n\u201cBut these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. \\*Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby\\* (emphasis mine).\u201d\u00a0\n\nBut of course, according to you, Marx only used economic conditions as a springboard to talk about surplus labour performance and the distribution of its products, but bizarrely, at the same time you claim that surplus labour exists under communism as well as being Marx's prime focus. Marx says:\n\n\u201cQuite apart from the analysis so far given, *it was in general a mistake to make a fuss about so-called distribution and put the principal stress on it.* (emphasis mine)\n\n\" *Any distribution whatever of the means of consumption is only a consequence of the distribution of the conditions of production themselves.* (emphasis mine) The latter distribution, however, is a feature of the mode of production itself. The capitalist mode of production, for example, rests on the fact that the material conditions of production are in the hands of nonworkers *in the form of property in capital and land* (emphasis mine), while the masses are only owners of the personal condition of production, of labor power. If the elements of production are so distributed, then the present-day distribution of the means of consumption results automatically.\"\n\nHere we have it. If the material conditions of production is in the form of property of land and capital, and if workers have nothing to give but their labour power (which would be the case even in a cooperative unless we want to assume that some individuals own greater proportions and voting rights in cooperatives than others, which would be a form of class itself), then the present-day means of consumption results automatically.\n\n\"If the material conditions of production are the co-operative (this isn't referring to a co-operative societies but rather co-operative and social property in general) property of the workers themselves, then there likewise results a distribution of the means of consumption different from the present one. *Vulgar socialism* (emphasis mine) (and from it in turn a section of the democrats) has taken over from the bourgeois economists the consideration and treatment of distribution as independent of the mode of production and hence the presentation of socialism as turning principally on distribution. *After the real relation has long been made clear, why retrogress again?* (emphasis mine).\u201d\n\nIn the last part of the comment, you say:\n\n \"However, we can and do have commodities without capitalism. We can and will have communism, where exploitation and pilfering of the common treasury of natural resources are both abolished, yet still with commodities produced and circulating.\".\n\nThis is just unfathomably wrong. This is like saying we will abolish slavery but keep the slave markets. Commodities are by their nature inseparable from capital. Commodities are things that are produced for sale rather than for use. They are property, they are inherently pilfered from the common treasury of the products of social labour (unless we're talking about a single handicraftsman or something, but in that case he would have to barter because the presence of money indicates a universal abstract value applied to every product). A society with widespread commodity production is a capitalist system, because commodities are a form of capital. The sale of a commodity implies a seller, and if there is a seller, the seller must be making a profit, and the profit motive is the defining feature of capital. If capital is something that determines resource allocation in a society, then it is either a capitalist society or the embryo of a future one.",
