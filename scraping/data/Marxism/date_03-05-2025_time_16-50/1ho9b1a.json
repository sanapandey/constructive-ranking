This coincided with the newly emerging capitalist development of neoliberalism. \n\nAs other people have noted, this began with the 1973 Coup in Chile that removed the democratically elected Marxist, Salvador Allende in replace for the US backed conservative leader, Pinochet. \n\nChile essentially became a testing ground for neoliberal policies which were later to be adopted by Thatcher and Reagan. Nixon famously commented that he wanted \u201cto make the [Chilean] economy scream\u201d.\n\nThis was followed by other US backed leaders in the region (Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, etc.) which also implemented a vast array of neoliberal policies (privatisation, financialisation, deregulation, austerity, etc.) sadly tearing through the Americas and causing tremendous poverty and inequality. \n\nThe US helped tremendously with the legitimisation and instillation of these governments.",

                            "body": "That's a complicated question but I'll try to give a fairly simple answer.\n\nWhen I teach history and these concepts to students (I'm at a university) I first introduce them to FDR's quote because it is fairly simple:\n\n\u201cThe liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerated the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself. That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power.\u201d -FDR\n\nI think this definition is actually quite useful as an introduction for students who have no clue what Marxism is or have a fear of socialism. It's something they can grasp. When one person is more powerful than the entire collective will of a voting nation, that's pretty bad. That gives us a really good starting point and then we look at Germany, Italy, and Japan to see how this fits.\n\nWe continue to look at post-war nations like South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Chile that all struggle with militant nationalist parties that strictly control the state while defying democratic will. The students draw their own conclusions on how to apply the word fasicsm. I think this really, really works and they start to see the blur of this line between nationalism and fasicsm.\n\nI also use Aleksander Dugin's 4th World Political Theory to explain the modes of modernity. While I absolutely hate Dugin, I think he does sort these structures *fairly* well. We look at how modernity developed away from Feudalism. The first is liberalism (this is the western bourgeois capitalism). We explain why it's called \"liberalism\" and see that it's really about entrenching the bourgeois. Of course this new system of capital produces a surplus of value - wealth. And where does it go? It goes into the hands of the bourgeois who \"own\" the businesses and investments.\n\nDugin then gives us the second mode: Socialism. Here, the state collects that surplus (or a significant portion of it, varying degrees) and reallocates that. The state typically functions as the bourgeois, too: the state owns the business and means of production and so the wealth goes there for redistribution, typically among the workers. (I spend a lot of time talking about different ways this can and could look, but the emphasis for many historical socialist states connected to the Soviet Union is a belief (and honest attempt) for workers/the masses to truly be and own the state and therefore the means of production). That surplus manifests then as welfare programs, housing, health care and down the line.\n\nFascism shows up as the third mode. In this, we see **some** of the same trappings of socialism except that the surplus isn't redirected toward the working class. It's often redirected toward a specific group - typically along ethnic lines. It could be the military, a corporation, etc but not the people at large. Introducing this to them after the FDR quote helps. They're looking for that individual power and here is how it clicks the most: some **one** is sitting at the top of this structure and redirecting the surplus away from a lot of others toward specific people to shore up their base. They do this under the trappings of nationalism or ethnic purity and squeezes this.\n\nAnd yes, I teach socialism here to be a version of capitalism. My study of Marx leads me to believe I'm in line there. I then teach communism (Marx didn't always differentiate here) as a proposed post-capitalist system that has different trappings, isn't so market reliant and doesn't have that \"investor driving labor saving technology in order to squeeze the worker of wealth\" nature that shows up in all three modes here. This also helps them understand why folks tend to view socialism as this wealth-robbing thing but is really a system in which the workers function as that investor/owner class through the collective state.\n\nOne last bit: something *really* clicks for most of my students here. If you're in this sub, you likely know that the Nazis were pretty sneaky. As \"National Socialists\" they got a populist support wave at one point from people who felt they were a new form of socialism which was popular. Dugin argues that they were socialist, he's wrong, but this scheme of modernism shows how that works. Fascism can and does work similarly to socialism - it is a means of redirecting wealth and typically (at least for a while) to a group that **does** need it. The ethnically German working class were lifted considerably with the onset of Nazi Germany with a lot of strong social programs. It came at a cost of separating out working class groups against each other and squeezing them - and eventually, the German working class would suffer too. This is where the nationalism really kicks in and brings us to a close according to FDR's quote:\n\nThe \"nation\" is contested terrain. Who is and isn't part of the nation? By shrinking the nation or defining it around a smaller identity like race or ethnicity, one creates a strong \"group\" that vies for power over the whole. Nationalism leads directly toward fascism and is rarely very different. It may start with saying the pledge of allegiance. It ends with hurting those that don't.",

Allende wanted to nationalize these mines so that the profits would go directly to the Chile economy, instead of international investors (mostly US).\n\nThe US funded propaganda campaigns and funneled money to Allende's political opponents.  When Allende eventually won an election in 1970, the US spent $8 million covertly to fund political opponents to prevent any national legislation from being passed.  The CIA also started recruiting military officers to enact a coup, which included [kidnapping and assassinating a general](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/chile/2020-10-22/cia-chile-anatomy-assassination).\n\nChile was politically polarized, with many wealthy business owners who had ties to international businesses being upset with Allende.  The CIA tapped into this and helped organize it.  They bought a newspaper that helped provide the illusion of public support for a coup.  The US was not directly involved in the coup itself, but it took many, many actions to help create a climate of support for this coup, and it applied pressure on Chile with covert promises that this pressure would be lifted if he were ousted.\n\nKissinger is on the Nixon tapes taking credit for the coup indirectly.  But he's also a blowhard who likes to take credit for anything.\n\nAll of this has been documented in various congressional investigations, many run by Frank Church.",
