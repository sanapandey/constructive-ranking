Our goal as communists at the current time is to educate the population and organize and not to accelerate the fall of the system, because the material conditions for a revolution are not ripe yet.",

It might not be the trigger to fascism, but the fall of socdem capitalism would more easily give way to the rise of socialism if there are high rates of organization and class consciousness among the masses, whereas capital would more easily steer those same masses to fight for fascism otherwise. In my view, accelerationism is not the having the power to accelerate things, but wanting for things (and by that I mean the degradation of the quality of life of the working class) to accelerate. So, I won\u2019t use Harris and Trump as an example, but I\u2019ll use the last bourgeois elections of my country as an example. Lula vs Bolsonaro. Lula is seen as a socdem that won\u2019t do much to improve things, but won\u2019t outright facilitate the stripping of workers rights, and the killing of minorities. Bolsonaro on the other hand, is clearly fascist and would do so if it depended on him. So, the accelerationist approach would be willing for Bolsonaro to have won the last elections (and maybe actively voting for it), so the quality of life of the working class would degrade faster, and thus people would revolt faster, and capitalism would end faster. That problem with that approach is that fascism thrives in chaos, and things would not go well without an organized working class.",

It goes against strategies the Comintern devised to fight fascism. \n\nSo many so-called Marxists want Trump to win because they think it shakes people into being politically active. Descending into fascism would kill any socialist movement. \n\nLeftists also fall into this trap that since we are against the liberal capitalist state, and so is the right, we can find common ground there. Or at least take advantage of them dismantling the state for us. But fascists are not going to dismantle the repressive apparatus, only those democratic aspects which benefit the working class. And it\u2019s in our interest to preserve the state to do the things we want to do, e.g. nationalize industries.\n\nAnother aspect to this belief is an idealist understanding of how to organize. Socialists think if we just hold the right positions, and offer people the right ideas in times of crisis, that they\u2019ll come flocking to us. Having the right ideas means nothing and holds no power to convince people. It is only through shared struggle and building relationships and connections that we can move people.\n\nThe way we build a revolutionary movement is by fighting with the working class for better conditions, even if they are meager reforms.",

He believes that capitalism, particularly its technological and cybernetic elements, is a kind of unstoppable force that, if pushed to its extremes, will lead to the destruction of current social and economic structures, potentially paving the way for post-human futures dominated by artificial intelligence and advanced technological systems.\n\nIn his early work in the 1990s, Land wrote about how capitalism is an abstract machine, almost like a virus or an artificial intelligence, which increasingly erodes human agency. Rather than seeing this as a negative, he believed this collapse of traditional structures could accelerate the transition to a post-human world driven by technology and intelligence beyond human comprehension.\n\nThis view contrasts with the more left-leaning forms of accelerationism, which tend to seek the use of capitalist technologies to create more egalitarian or emancipatory futures.",

They just wait for something good to spring out of nowhere or they just parrot the usual stuff about 'organizing' (even if no organizing is ever taking place anywhere). Some have things to lose in the current systems (think academics, people in corporate jobs, some have savings, etc). Because no one knows what to do and no one acts, I would prefer accelerationism. It is cynical ? Yes. It will hurt people ? Yes. But they are hurt or will be hurting anyway as the current system is getting worse and worse. That's why I take the most unpopular position on accelerationism. It may be bring a fascist revolution, not communist. But the fascism is coming for you either way. Just stupid libs think that voting for x, y candidate would prevent fascism, as if fascism is something that can come from one single party/candidate. No, it is a general system of oppression. It will come anyway even if the working people will no longer tolerate living in this system. Trump/fascist candidates are just symptoms of a system decaying into fascism, not causes themselves. That's why is stupid to vote liberal and hope for the best and parroting about 'organizing' (when you do nothing actually, just 'vote' and hope) thinking that this way you keep 'fascism' aside when it is this sort of political elite that caused people like Trump to actually become dangerous. I think they are doing it by design. The liberal elite is so rotten and out of touch with reality that fascism you get either way - you vote for them or for Trump directly.",

I will lose everything eight way if this rotten system is sustained too long on life support. We can lie to ourselves that voting for the candidate that will do everything to uphold the stability of the financial system just so we won't lose those pennies we have as 'savings' will somehow magically allow us to educate the masses into socialism/communism. Keep dreaming - it is exactly this extraction machine, the corruption of the establishment that brought Trump into the foreground in the first place. It is voting for a candidate just because it is lesser evil that allowed this critical events to unravel. And it will be even worse. The more we align to side with a party that polarizes the working class the more working class will associate us with them. Fascists are already IN. The war on Gaza demonstrates that to everyone which has eyes to see. You just encourage them to be ever more transparent by still voting for one of the oppressors.",

I think there's more that could be done on this front on an individual level than could be done on an individual level in support of revolution.\n\n>Do you really suppose that capitalism is when people vote for it?\n\nWhat?\n\nEdit: well that was a pretty quick ban",
