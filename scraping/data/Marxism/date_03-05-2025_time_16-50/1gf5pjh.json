Is it the antonym of 'progressive', and why?\n\nAs in Henry Winston:\n\n'In Marcuse\u2019s view, the working class was hopelessly **reactionary** and contentedly integrated into the system \u2013 the upholders, not the gravediggers, of capitalism.'",

Reactionaries clamp down on the differences of the emerging productive forces in society, and attempt to remove those differences, silence them, or segregate them in order to keep the stability of the established order.\n\nExamples of the political position of reactionaries can be seen throughout history: during the US Revolutionary War, the reactionaries were the ruling British aristocracy, who sought to maintain their feudal government over their American colonies, while the US\u00a0*revolutionaries*\u00a0sought to establish a government to represent the interests of capitalist values and practices. Hundreds of years later in Russia, the tables would turn and capitalists became\u00a0*reactionary*\u00a0while the Socialists are revolutionary.\"",

It\u2019s somewhat derogatory but it\u2019s an actual classification for a real demographic. \n\n\nWhenever a revolution takes place, certain people will fight against it or continue the fight from a position in the previous regime (physically, ideologically or culturally). In Marxist terms it\u2019s \u201canti revolutionary\u201d. The reactions against successful communist or Marxist upheavals more specifically. \n\n\nNow reactionary is somewhat vague because lots of people have negative reactions to Marxist (or self proclaimed Marxist) policies for wildly different reasons. \n\n\nThere are people who would sit out a civil war and only take up arms when the communist are on the verge of winning but there also \u201canti revolutionary\u201d elements that come out years or decades after a revolution. This is usually in response to a specific policy attempted in the name of communism or Marxism from a self proclaimed Marxist-Leninist  country. \n\n\n\u201cReactionary\u201d is a term that encompasses fascist, liberals, conservatives, theocrats, anarchist and basically whoever doesn\u2019t like a policy, upheaval or decision from a group of people claiming to be Marxists.",

            "body": "It essentially means someone who wants to maintain the status quo. It doesn't exclusively mean conservative or anti-socialists. Anti-capitalists can also be reactionaries.\n\nIn Marxist writings you often see applied to people who opposed social change. So when Feudalism is being overthrown and replaced by capitalism, the monarchist, nobles and peasant classes are the reactionaries because they opposed liberalization for a variety of reasons.\n\nThen when capitalism and socialism are in upheaval, the peasants and capitalist classes are the ones opposed to socialism. Lenin and Mao utilize the peasants by promising them land reform and distribution of the capitalist and Feudal estates.\n\nYou also see the term \"extreme reaction\" applied to Fascism. This is because Fascism was defined as when the Bourgeoisie tried to establish their own version of Feudalism. So rather than the Bourgeoisie being normal Reactionaries and opposing socialism, they become extreme reactionaries because they want to take two steps backward and oppose both socialism and liberal capitalism. They favored Feudalism instead of free market capitalism and liberal democracy.",
