    "selftext": "I'm writing an essay for my Ideas of politics in classical times class. It's about the differences between Plato and Aristotle on family and property. I'm trying to draw a line between Marxist thought on family. For Marx family is a way for the aristocracy to protect their interests and pass it on from generation to generation. That much I understand. Plato lived under the same kind of conditions where in Athens, to be considered a citizen, your parents also had to be citizens. Only about 10% of the Athenian populace were considered citizens. \n\nMy question is this : do any of you have citations or references from Marx's work that I should look into? These need to come directly from Marx or Engels. I'm not sure where to look and don't have time to read every single thing Marx wrote. Maybe just point me in the right direction so I know where to look. Thank you.\n",

While Engels wrote this after Marx\u2019s death, it builds directly on their shared ideas and Marx\u2019s *Capital*. Engels argues that the institution of the family, as we know it, emerged alongside private property and class society. It functions to ensure inheritance\u2014passing wealth and property to legitimate heirs\u2014thus protecting the interests of the ruling class across generations.\n\nA key passage to consider:  \n**\u201cThe monogamous family \\[\u2026\\] was the first form of the family to be based, not on natural, but on economic conditions, namely, on the victory of private property over primitive, natural communal property.\u201d** (Engels, *Origin of the Family*, Chapter 2)\n\nThis ties directly to Marx\u2019s ideas in *Capital*, particularly in discussions of private property and the accumulation of wealth. Marx himself touches on this in **Volume 1 of** ***Capital*** where he discusses the historical development of private property under capitalism. While he doesn\u2019t focus explicitly on family, you\u2019ll find his broader framework of property and inheritance helpful. Specifically, look into the sections on \u201cprimitive accumulation\u201d and \u201cthe general law of capitalist accumulation\u201d to understand how property relations shape social institutions.\n\nAdditionally, Marx and Engels discuss family and inheritance in **The Communist Manifesto** (1848), where they critique the bourgeois family:  \n**\u201cThe bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.\u201d** (Section II: Proletarians and Communists)\n\nHere, Marx and Engels argue that the modern family is rooted in private property, inheritance, and economic exploitation, making it a tool for perpetuating class divisions.",

                    "body": "In **The Republic** (Book V), Plato argues for the **abolition of family and private property** among the guardian class to prevent personal interests from corrupting loyalty to the state. Guardians would raise children collectively, so no one knows their biological parents: *\u201cThese women are to be all in common, and the children are to be in common.\u201d* (460b-c). He sees private property as a root of division: *\u201cThe possession of private property is the root of all evil.\u201d* (464c-d). Later, in **The Laws** (Book V), Plato takes a more pragmatic stance, allowing family and private property but regulating them heavily, including limits on wealth accumulation (744e).\n\nAristotle, in **Politics**, directly criticizes Plato\u2019s ideas. He sees the **family as natural and essential** to society: *\u201cThe family is the association established by nature for the supply of men\u2019s everyday wants.\u201d* (I.2, 1252b12). In Book II, he rejects the abolition of family, arguing that collective families would destroy affection and responsibility: *\u201cIt is impossible to care for what is common to the greatest degree.\u201d* (II.3, 1261b30). Aristotle also defends private property, saying it promotes responsibility and virtue: *\u201cProperty should be private, but the use of it should be common.\u201d* (II.5, 1263a30).",
