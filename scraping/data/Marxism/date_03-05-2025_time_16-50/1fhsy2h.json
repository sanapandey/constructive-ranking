    "selftext": "I do love the idea of a socialist/communist utopia; one where resources are allocated from each according to their ability to each according to their need. But I also belive it's super naive to think that a dictatorship of the proletariat, carried out by only a few, will be anything more than an authoritarian regime. The Communist Manifesto is basically a how to guide for a small group of people from the proletariat class to size power from the bourgeoisie. It's done by pretending to be doing it for the people. In turn causing them to revolt led by this new group (named the nomenklatura in Leninist-Marxist USSR.)\n\nI think that Marx's idea of what communism was supposed to be is aligned with my ideal scenario. However, this opposes how it has been carried out in reality. In part this issue has arisen due to the fact that Marx never specifically laid out a plan for how to keep the power of the new regime in check.\n\nAt the end of the day the real issue is the human condition. It was Acton that told us 'Power corrupts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely, great men are almost always bad men'. As soon as people make their way into the new bourgeoisie; they fall to the same pattern as the previous bourgeoisie. ",

It is silly to set your goals according to imaginary ideals of perfection, we operate pragmatically according to present conditions, not ideals.\n\n>But I also belive it's super naive to think that a dictatorship of the proletariat, carried out by only a few, will be anything more than an authoritarian regime\n\nThe alternative is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Western society is run solely by a few ultra wealthy people who own virtually the whole economy and use lobbying and campaign financing to control the government to do their bidding. Is this somehow a better system? In class based society, one class must be the ruling one on top. I'd much rather it be the class which constitutes a majority of people than a minority. You may be conflating DotP with one party states, and you may also be uneducated on how these states function.\n\n>The Communist Manifesto is basically a how to guide for a small group of people from the proletariat class to size power from the bourgeoisie\n\nThis is not true at all. It describes the Communist worldview and describes some basic positions Communists hold in regards to various issues in society. It's very surface level and is meant to describe what Communists \\*are\\*. Also, Communists do not want a \"small group of people\" to seize power, a revolution would require a united working class, which is what we seek to create.\n\n>It's done by pretending to be doing it for the people. In turn causing them to revolt led by this new group \n\nI'm really curious what you think of the American revolution\n\n>I think that Marx's idea of what communism was supposed to be is aligned with my ideal scenario. However, this opposes how it has been carried out in reality. In part this issue has arisen due to the fact that Marx never specifically laid out a plan for how to keep the power of the new regime in check. \n\nMarx is not some magic man, he shouldn't be expected to have all the answers because he was just a guy who wrote some really good books, not the messiah. And what do you mean exactly by kept in check? Your post is kind of vague and I would love to have a discussion with you about this topic if you could be more specific",
