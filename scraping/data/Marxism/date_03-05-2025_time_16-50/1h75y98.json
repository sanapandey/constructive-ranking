Another would be the goal of the capitalist to pay as little as possible and the goal of the worker to get paid as much as possible. So the property of non-coexistence.\n\nAnother property would by symmetry, where if A is in contradiction with B, then B is in contradiction with A.\n\nMaybe another one would be the contradiction with reality? If something contradicts reality, then it is currently not realized. Socialism contradicts the current material reality of capitalism, so we may say that we are not currently living within socialist world.\n\nWhat would be other such properties that contradictions have? Or is any of what I've said incorrect?\n\nI am aware of three laws of dialectics, and I am not talking about those, I'm talking about dialectical reasoning about contradictions, not on how to observe change.",

            "body": "This is not how Marx talked about dialectics. He was focused on contradictions within a given notion. Take for example the proletariat.\n\nThe very oversimplified argument is: The interests of the proletariat is to receive compensation for their labour equal to the full value of their labour, but if they got that, there would be no surplus to be made, and therefore no capitalist would hire them. This gives rise to a lot of interesting and fundamentally unstable dynamics. The way to resolve it would be for the proletariat to abolish itself which in classical Marxism is the same as abolishing private property. The argument is pretty clearly stated in \"the principles of Communism\" by Engels or \"wage labour and capital\" by Marx.\n\nCapital vol 1 for instance, explores the dynamics of the commodity form with this kind of logics, where the flow of commodities gives rise to internal contradictions within the capitalist system.",

Like capitalism contains all of the class dynamics, where workers' desire for higher wages is in contradiction with capitalist's desire for higher profits?\n\nSo when we talk about these dynamics within the system, what would the structure of contradictions be? Of course, since desire for higher wages contradicts desire for profits, then the symmetric is true, the desire for profits contradicts the desire for higher wages.\n\nSome properties fail, if we have two things A and B in contradiction and we also have B and C in contradiction, we cannot see a general rule for A and C, are they in contradiction or not.\n\nI'm interested in this kind of properties of contradictions.",

His dialectic is developed to explore material conditions, and therefore he takes a specific interest in political economy. I'm quite frankly not sure of the details of his method, to say how to generalize it outside of political economy, or to use it in abstract categories like A and B.\n\nRemember, Marx is a systems thinker, and his methods are developed to understand capitalism as a system with certain inherent features.\n\nFor a more abstract kind of dialectics that can deal with non material categories, you should take a look at Hegel",

That's why I'm looking at Hegel, too, yeah, but my primary interest is Marx.",

I'm not sure anyone knows the exact ins and outs of it. To your specific question - let's say A, B and C represent properties of a class and A is in contradiction with B and B is in contradiction with C, then we probably can't say anything about the relation between A and C would be my guess. \nJust as the conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat doesn't illuminate much about the conflict between the peasantry and the bourgeoisie. In Marx he makes a point of always looking at the features within a given notion and not assuming stuff based on the notions relation to other things",
