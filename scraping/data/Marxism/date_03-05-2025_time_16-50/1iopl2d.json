    "selftext": "Hello Comrades, hope you're having a nice day.  \nWe've written an article which we seem appropriate and important to read for the people of this subreddit.   \nIt focuses on a materialist view on why the US is now pursuing direct control over Gaza.   \nA little excerpt here:  \n\"Regardless of the further course of the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, Trump's proposal of the \u201c**Middle East Riviera**\u201d has set an inevitable turning point for the people of Palestine and the surrounding states.\n\nRegardless of what agreement Trump, or Netanyahu, will reach with Jordan and Egypt, the ideological conditions for the **further strengthening of the Palestinian resistance have been created**. (...)\n\nContrary to what can be read in the liberal press, Trump's tariff policy is of course not the \u201cconfused action of a madman\u201d, but a **logical action to safeguard US capital**, which sees itself more threatened than ever by Chinese exports.\n\nBecause US capital is facing hard times in the coming years, the United States knows how to help itself by **safeguarding capital interests** in a post-war Gaza. (...)\n\nThe reaction of the central EU states that Trump's proposal is \u201cunacceptable and contrary to international law\u201d (Baerbock) does not, of course, stem from a **sudden pro-Palestinian awareness**, but from the fact that control of Gaza by the United States would cause **considerable geopolitical and economic problems for the EU states** (...).\n\nFor Trump, a takeover of Gaza would therefore mean that US capital would have preferential access to Gaza's oil, i.e. he could both **make the EU more dependent** on (then probably) American oil and **smooth out the consequences of his protectionism** to some extent.\u201d\n\n# Read the article: [here](https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/02/13/kapital-greift-gaza/).\n\nYou can translate the article from german to english or arabic with the language button in the bottom right. \n\n# If you enjoy what we do, the greatest support is following us on Instagram: [here](https://www.instagram.com/kritik_punkt/). \n\nThank you for reading!",

There are indeed capitalist groups who want to go into Gaza and turn the population into rentiers, but none of those groups are in the US. They are among the BRICS member states and that is the group that Trump is more interested in dealing with than his own Neocon savages in the State Department he\u2019s trying to lay off. Trump\u2019s ties through BlackRock give him and the Saudis pretty easy access to eachother and Marxists would do well to pay careful attention to the Big Capital Firms eg BlackRock, Statestreet, Vanguard, and carefully watch who\u2019s connections and strings those 3 facilitate rather than the worthless bluster Trump trolls the media with.",

And resentment towards the US would be extensive, likely drawing us into regional conflict at a high cost with lost lives, countering whatever economic benefits might happen for the US.\n\nHere's a truth - Trump's own team had no idea he was going to say this.  And as they're all members of the cult, they bow to his genius and try to spin this into a reasonable plan.  Trump is a real estate developer, he sees that opportunity, and much like any developer who wants to build high-end buildings in a poorer region, you need to get rid of the current occupants.  It's a slimy New York real estate deal, just now from the White House.\n\nThe guy is just hell bent on expansion to prove he's a great leader.  So Panama, Canada, Greenland and Gaza are all floated like he's just browsing Zillow.  Other ideas from the Trump administration may have some thought behind them.  Taking over Gaza isn't that.",

We must not let Gazans suffer the same fate.](https://www.jta.org/2025/02/05/ideas/my-jewish-family-was-forced-out-of-our-homeland-we-must-not-let-gazans-suffer-the-same-fate)\n\nYou don\u2019t counter the fantasy of erasing Israel by proposing the same for Gaza, writes an Israeli influencer whose family was forced to leave Iraq and Tunisia.\n\nI grew up on stories of exile. My family was forced out of Iraq and Tunisia for being Jewish \u2014 homes stolen, communities erased and history rewritten. To this day, too many people insist it was \u201cvoluntary migration,\u201d as if nearly a million Jews in Arab lands simply woke up one morning and decided to leave behind centuries of roots, culture and history.\n\nI\u2019ve spent years pushing back against that erasure, making it clear that my family \u2014 and so many others \u2014 were forced to leave. And yet, today, I see a disturbing echo of that same denial. The same people who overlooked Mizrahi Jews\u2019 suffering are now casually advocating for the forced displacement of Palestinians as \u201cthe only option\u201d to deal with Hamas\u2019s terror.\n\nThis is what\u2019s missing from the argument that Palestinians would be \u201cbetter off\u201d leaving Gaza \u2014 that they would have safer, more comfortable lives if they were resettled elsewhere. It\u2019s the same logic that was used to justify the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands. And while my family may have found security in Israel, that doesn\u2019t mean the original trauma was justified. Nor does it account for the cultural and communal annihilation that came with it.\n\nThe destruction of Gaza under Hamas\u2019s rule is undeniable. But forced displacement doesn\u2019t solve that problem \u2014 it only ensures that the pain and resentment of this war will last for generations. I am not blind to the fact that anti-Zionists today demand the ethnic cleansing of Jews from Israel. Not only is that hateful, but it fundamentally denies the Jewish people\u2019s historic connection to the land of Israel. That\u2019s racism. And it\u2019s unacceptable.\n\nIndeed, the loudest voices in the \u201cFree Palestine\u201d movement aren\u2019t calling for a two-state solution. They\u2019re not talking about peace. They want Israel gone. They want Jewish sovereignty erased. They don\u2019t see Oct. 7 as an atrocity \u2014 they see it as a model.\n\nBut you don\u2019t fight anti-Zionist eliminationism with eliminationist rhetoric of your own. You don\u2019t counter the fantasy of erasing Israel by proposing the same for Gaza. \n\nThat\u2019s not strength. That\u2019s surrender \u2014 to the idea that this is a zero-sum war where one side must be erased for the other to survive.\n\nThe more we entertain the idea that one side must be erased for the other to live, the further we get from any future that isn\u2019t defined by endless war.\n\nThere are no magic wands here. No shortcuts. And no amount of forced migration \u2014 of Jews or Palestinians \u2014 will bring the peace we all deserve.\n\nThe only way forward is to dismantle Hamas, empower Palestinian leaders who reject extremism and invest in a long-term solution where both peoples can live with security, dignity and self-determination \u2014 without adding to the traumas that must be overcome another episode of ethnic cleansing like what my family experienced.",
