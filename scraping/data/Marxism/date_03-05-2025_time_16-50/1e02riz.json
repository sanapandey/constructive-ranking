Veeery often, turning a passion into a job can make it feel more routine and less enjoyable compared to pursuing it freely and on their own terms.

That doesn't make sense because profit is income minus labor and expenses, and \"most people\" are labor. Secondly, [money can be exchanged for goods and services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A81DYZh6KaQ) such as housing and food, and many other things besides. I mean you have a lot more in your life than just the base things necessary to survive, don't you?\n\n\"Being rewarded for innovation\" is a macro-level statement as to why individual pursuit of wealth is supposedly a good thing. People are not innovating for its own sake, they are innovating because they want money - and that innovation is supposed to be helping society, so if people innovate because they want money, then it follows that the pursuit of money is helping society by encouraging innovation.\n\n>So if I currently make 800/wk, but wind up with only 200 after rent, food, taxes, etc, what is the difference between the current system and one in which rent, food, etc are free while I receive a 200 weekly stipend?\n\nBecause there is a certain degree of labor necessary to keep society running and in this system you have no material incentive to do that labor. Marx's proposed system for the \"lower stage\" of communism was trading labor hours, but again, that is *trading* - you still have do to work in order to receive someone else's work.\n\n>Well, in the latter system, the rest of my labor value is going to benefit all of society (including me) rather than some parasite\n\nThis is the actual conclusion of Marxist economics...I just don't understand how all the preceding things you said somehow led to this point.

In medieval times, the community made their own clothes, extracted lumber, built horseshoes, tools and the like. Usually the production wasn't specialized and people shared the things produced.\n\nHowever, I think I'm missing the context of this affirmation. I can't stay working forever without being paid because the payment is what allows me to keep living. I do unpaid work (most of us do at our homes, for example), but in order to buy food, clothes, or even renting a space, I need my payment.\n\nWe communists aren't against incentives to work. What we are against is the exploitation of our work so we make someone else rich with the excess unpaid labor  (the surplus value) we collectively employ on their behalf. What incentives we have if all effort we employ will just stay in the hands of a shareholder who has never stepped in my workplace.",

Some people are motivated by other things, such as morals, reducing suffering, contributing to society, or the satisfaction of helping someone. These people will work regardless of monetary/power incentives. The sad things is that in a capitalist system people who are motivated to do a job because of these other considerations will get less monetary/power compensation, since not as much of that is needed to motivate them to do the job.

People are not demonstrably equal in those regards. \n\nIn a workable communist society, everyone would be afforded basic needs (housing, food, medical care, education). Ideally, those who actually work harder and/or contribute more to the aims of a proletariat society should have access to more resources, better housing and recreational opportunities than those who do less. You wouldn\u2019t have egregious wealth-hoarding and profiteering, because resources would be much more equitably distributed amongst the populace.\n\nIn this current system, there is a largely sedentary wealthy class that simply continuously increases their wealth via exploitation of the labor of others, without contributing much back other than \u201cinvestments\u201d that drive further exploitation. A janitor objectively works harder and contributes more real-world usefulness than a CEO.",
