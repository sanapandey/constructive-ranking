    "selftext": "I am honestly running out of ideas where to discuss actual marxist philosophy, when everywhere since the 20th century Marxism became synonymous with \"economy\" and nothing more. Marxism has been attacked since it origin, and in consequences, most communists focused on those same aspects, that is, the economic aspects. It's obviously an important point, but anyone that minimally comprehend dialectics know it's not the main focus - the main focus of Marxism is to deny intrinsic value, that's why it's scientific.\n\nThere's a very good guy called \u771f\u7406zhenli that discusses this topic, answering a question asking if someone can be a marxist without understanding dialectics.\n\n\">No, I find that almost all the misunderstandings of Marxism come from people who only read the economics and then try to apply the metaphysical outlook to Marxism and come away with completely backwards views.\n\nThis leads people into completely incoherent ideas like Maoism, Trotskyism, or left-communism. These people do not see the development of socialism as a dialectical process, they tend to view it as more of a moralistic process. They do not see it as something that arises from the bottom-up material conditions, but instead see it as something forced onto society from the top-down through legal decrees.\n\nThese kinds of people view society in a very black-and-white, puritanical way, whereby they apply a kind of \u201cone-drop rule\u201d to socialism. Every economic system in human history has contained internal contradiction, but they will insist that socialism is different and contains zero internal contradictions. \n\nThus, if a socialist society has a single hint of remnants of the past society, such as the existence of commodity production, is automatically not socialist in their eyes.\"\n\nI won't repeat the classical \"oh Marxism is over...doomed...\" speech it's repeating since ever. What happens is that almost no one truly comprehend true dialectical reasoning.\n\n People didn't read Hegel at all, and failed to see where Marx critized him, and took his philosophy. Many call Hegel an idealist as if to invalidate his views, but process to think of the Geist as the own human spirit, the working class, which will \"free\" us from the \"tyranny\" of the bourgeoisie. They didn't read anything, and merely follow the aesthetics, picking up some good points here and there... but individually, which makes it useless.\n\nBy following merely the aesthetics, most so called \"communists\" and \"marxists\" are **glued** to the economy part, ignoring completely the metaphysics and epistemological part. They do not know how to know, how are they are therefore able to *surpass*(the whole point of dialectics) anything? That's no different from the \"liberals\" they criticize.\n\nI put liberals in quotation because it seems too many Marxists forgot they are too humans. I do not refer to humanism, I refer the fact they are living biological creatures with an individual and collective history implied within every action, and so, by the lack of dialectical reasoning, those \"marxists\" do the opposite of science and apply intrinsic value: \"They are bad because they are liberals\". Why are they liberals? \"Because they're are bad\".\n\nIt's rare to find a marxist that knows basic epistemology, which can actually know beyond Marx, and primarily, know Marxism is a science, not merely a position.\n\nTL;DR: People don't read, don't know dialectics, follow aesthetics. It's reasonable to be angry over bourgeoisie (humans) exploiting other workers (humans, you), but this isn't what Marxism or communism is about. No intrinsic value, it's a personal belief, a collective personal belief.",

            "body": "I think most people follow aesthetics and don\u2019t read, I agree in that respect. I remember seeing a Stalinist reading list that did not have any Marx, Engels, Lenin or Luxembourg in it. Then they put out material praising modern day \u201cMaoist\u201d China or attaching themselves to the Assad regime lol. That\u2019s more of a product of right wing revisionism and opportunism which dominated \u201ccommunist\u201d politics for years though. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t need to read Hegel to be a Marxist though. Philosophy is the least important aspect of Marxism. People who over emphasise it I think are missing the forest for the trees. Marxism is about organised Revolutionary class struggle. Being an activist and a trade unionist and an organised socialist who debates questions of the time (who to support, what do we make of this world event, with what strategy do we act?) is the most important. Dialectic and historical materialism is important in understanding the foundational theory of marx\u2019 critique of capitalism. And thus stuff like markets, commodity exchange and crisis which is important for a wider understanding.",

Modern China is *NOT* maoist, maoists generally *really really don't like* modern China.  \n\nFrom a ML perspective (which I agree with), \"Maoism\" (MLM, MLMpM, etc) is a left deviation, which dogmatically treat Mao Zedong Thought as universally applicable rather than as an application of Marxism Leninism to the material conditions of China at the time (with some mistakes that we should learn from etc).  This results in (among other things) denouncing post-late-1970s China, the USSR post-1953, Cuba just in general, etc. as capitalist, social imperialist, etc.  More just dogmatically repeating out of context Mao quotes than a scientific development of MLism\n\n>Marxism is about organised Revolutionary class struggle.\n\nIts a lot easier to do that when your country isnt in a state of perpetual war and plundering by Imperial powers \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f the ML position on assad's government knd syria was that this was the least bad option, and that if it fell Syria would be carved up by Turkey, US and Israel and everything would get so much worse.  ...idk really what to say, this was entirely correct, what did you expect to happen?   No one (except for laroucheite/ACP freaks) actually likes the Assad government any further than memes, it was just far better than any of the actual alternatives.",

                            "body": "I put it in quotations for a reason. Maoism is largely split between the completely unprincipled position of thinking modern day China is socialist (those in the nationalist or dengist camps) or those who think it\u2019s no longer Maoist. Asserting that the nationalist/chauvinist camp doesn\u2019t exist would be incorrect and it\u2019s arguably larger than the other camp. \n\nI think Marxist Leninist and Marxist Leninist Maoist infighting is humorous given that they are largely the same ideology pointing fingers at which is the more unprincipled and how their own camp whether ussr Yugoslavia or China is actually socialist. These countries were state capitalist with Russia being a notable exception for about a decade. Their dictatorship of the proletariat became a dictatorship over the proletariat by the new ruling opportunist bureaucracy. \n\nThis position on Syria is extremely backwards. It sees the Syrian people as essentially an agent without autonomy and reduces Syria down to base geopolitics. It does not consider the popular proletariat uprising during the Arab spring. Nor the material conditions of the proletariat under Assad. Under Assad 50% of the population was homeless, 1/3 of the population fled the country as a refugee, and food insecurity was rife. More people lived in tents in refugee camps in rural areas than in actual buildings. The country if you can even call it that had complete economic collapse with its primary export being literally illegal narcotics to the gulf states, no political freedoms, mass starvation. Assad was basically a puppet propped up by foreign imperialism, by Iran, Russia etc. Now the Syrian people are marching through the streets in celebrations and returning to the country en masse in their tens of thousands. The highways are completely packed. People who have not been in Syria for 10 years return. Prisoners in Assad\u2019s torture dungeons who have been locked up for 30-40 years see the light of day. It\u2019s objectively a much better situation for the Syrian working class even despite Israel\u2019s bombings. Any other conclusion is campist at best, racist at worst. It\u2019s not looking like Syria will cede territory to Turkey, the Kurds and the golan heights were already ceded to Israel. There\u2019s now an opportunity for some level of political freedoms and a recovery of the economy so not everyone is homeless and starved. A prime opportunity for the Syrian working class to reclaim some political power too. Trying to say Assad\u2019s four way civil war stalemate is better because there\u2019s no foreign imperialism is crazy. His entire state existed due to imperialism and collapsed pretty much immediately.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re pro Palestine which I assume you are. Assad was seen as a friend of Israel. The Israeli times and Israeli strategists published openly how the Assad regime collapsing was terrible for them. Hell they only started bombing Syria because they were afraid of all of Assad\u2019s modern weapons being turned on Syria by the Syrian people who are all pro Palestine. They barely gave a shit about those weapons when Assad was in power because they knew he wouldn\u2019t do anything to move against them. Syria now has a situation where they have a heavily armed population that hates Israel and wants to actually do something about it and is for the first time in a position where they are not dominated by any power that is not attached at the hip to US imperialism or beholden to an entrenched and selfish capitalist class.",

But at the point the productive forces \\*are\\* fettered - it requires collective action to advance the society beyond the point of fettering.\n\nWhich in your vocabulary is much closer to \"top down\" than \"bottom up\"\n\nYou're lamenting that people haven't read Hegel when Marx inverts Hegel and largely abandons whatever nonsense Hegel was on about in Science of Logic.\n\nI have read Science of Logic and I can tell you it's utter nonsense along with the Critique of Pure reason.\n\nThese philosophers were champions of their day but their ideas weren't perfect and don't always hold up to careful scrutiny.\n\nAnd as far as my readings on dialectics go - it's a very complicated concept. I'm studying nothing but Marxism and philosophy and I still can't relay in perfect detail what all Dialectics means in total.\n\nBeyond Engel's 3 laws it's not even clear there's consensus in the literature about what Dialectics means.\n\nSo all your lamentations to point have either been moot or self-defeating.",

This is possible, but it is an insignificant difference in degree, if we take the question in its political, i.e., in its mass aspect. Certain individuals among the present social-chauvinist leaders may return to the proletariat: but **the TREND can neither disappear nor 'return' to the revolutionary proletariat**... We have not the slightest grounds for thinking that these (Social Democratic) parties can disappear BEFORE the social revolution. On the contrary, **the nearer the revolution approaches, the stronger it flares up ... the greater will be the role in the labour movement of the struggle between the revolutionary mass steam and the opportunist-philistine stream.**\n\n\nIt is important to analyze the Opportunist *Trend* of Amerikkans and realize that we must Oppose the Trend and the Opportunists that ignore the Trend. Sakai analyzed the Trends of Amerikkkans and found that this was a result of their class interests as Settlers rather than any proclamation of \"False Consciousness\".\n\n\nTo make this Starker let me Ask:\n\n\nDo the First Nations, New Afrikans, and Chicane occupied by the U$ have the Same Class interests as Amerikkkans?\n\n\nDo Palestinians have the Same Class interests as I$realis?\n\n\nIf you can say yes to one but not to the other then you should investigate your double Standards.\n\n\n> To never organize the majority of the american population?

Amerika had no feudal or communal past, but was constructed from the ground up according to the nightmare vision of the bourgeoisie. 2. Amerika began its national life as an oppressor nation, as a colonizer of oppressed peoples. 3. Amerika not only has a capitalist rul- ing class, but all classes and strata of Euro-Arnerikans are bourgeoisified, with a preoccupation for petty privileges and property ownership the normal guiding star of the white masses. 4. Amerika is so decadent that it has no proletariat of its own, but must exist parasitically on the colonial proletariat of oppressed. nations and national-minorities. Truly, a Babylon \"whose life was death\".\n\n\n- Settlers, J. Sakai\n\n\n...\n\n\n> Class is not like a brass badge or a diploma, which can be carried from Old Europe and hung on a wall, dusty but still intact. Class consciousness lives in the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed-or dies in the poisonous little privileges so eagerly sought by the settler servants of the bourgeoisie.\n\n\n- Settlers, J. Sakai, Chapter 4 Section 5\n\n\n...\n\n\n> EC: Would you say that organizing within the present-day white working class is hopeless?\n\n\n\n\n> JS: We need to talk about how people unthinkingly objectify the working classes. It never occurs to anyone to believe that the metropolitan middle classes are going to overthrow the system that privileges them. No one says, \"The white doctors and professors and managers are the revolutionary class.\" Yet, without any big fuss or posturing, middle-class radicals just organize in those classes when and where they can, all around themselves. Students just form issue groups in even the most elite universities. Teachers try to open minds to social justice, while even some doctors volunteer to serve in refugee camps or argue with the majority of their criminal profession about being healers not rip-offs or stock market addicts. For better or worse, success or defeat. No big political deal, it's just living the life, the meal that's set before us. ... But when it comes to the working classes, whoa, then it's all this ideological ca-ca. To believe what we're told, no one should want to organize or educate workers unless they can be sure that the entire class is \"bound for glory\" as the main force for revolution! (which you won't see here in this lifetime, trust me). So the white workers as a whole are either the revolutionary answer \u2013 which they aren't unless your cause is snowmobiles and lawn tractors \u2013 or they're like ignorant scum you wouldn't waste your time on. Small wonder rebellious poor whites almost always seek out the Right rather than the left.\n\n\nhttps://libcom.org/article/when-race-burns-class-settlers-revisited-interview-j-sakai",

I mean our job as people who understand this shit is to guide the working class and point out their gaps. The working class isn't going to all become rank and file professional revolutionaries (like Debord and the anarchists seem to think). \n\nPeople are fucking stupid and they definitely don't have time to understand what even the word \"epistemology\" means let alone the Marxist conception of it. I, like Marx, fully believe every human being is capable of doing so -- I just believe that they are too consumed with the libertarian-liberalism of consumer lifestyle to give a fuck to try.\n\nIt is however pretty apparently that most Western leftists think that socialism is about morality. They get into socialism because they think killing Arab children is \"wrong\" -- they don't really understand much else beyond that. I think Marxists need to capitalist on this moral imperative that the masses feel and find a way for people to connect to it through art or some other expression that shocks them out of their daily life. \n\n  \nThere's a new book Marx's Ethical Vision which I wonder if it has any guidance on this.",

These things might be \"bad\", I find those bad, but it's exactly by being subjective it is the way it is, we don't need to appeal to any higher form god like intrinsic value idealism to \"justify\" our actions. Things do not need justifica\u00e7\u00e3o to be done. That's exactly what Marxism is all about, there's no moral dilemma behind proletariat emancipation and bourgeoisie dictatorship - it's humans being humans, and it's exactly by being humans we, workers, desire a revolution and try to make it happen and the bourgeoisie try to maintain the status quo.\n\nRight now, I would say we are in a stage of capitalism where propaganda isn't much worthy, simply because the productive forces aren't developed enough, enough to highlight capitalism contradictions and it eventual chronical crash. Because of that, due to the premature forces, every time we try to spread Marxism, it comes out as religious magic words to those who don't know (because, by empirical evidence nothing is yet happening globally) and those who try to know simply put Marxism into matters that interest them about capitalism while liking their privilege of it - that's the origin of the petty bourgeoisie, and it mindset about youngsters (99% of online \"marxists\"). This privilege is capitalism morals, it superstructure - because of that, people with the petty bourgeoisie mentality are incapable of seeing revolution as the *real* and *practical* emancipation of the human subject as human in this mode of production. No more, no less. They are the Feuerbach Marx described at the first thesis.\n\nFinally, I will say something to you which might help in something, since you look someone that understand Marxism beyond the economics and politics: if communism is the theory of the practice of the abolition of private property, marxism is the theory of the practice of the surpass of intrinsic value.

But is this just because the Western imagination is  limited? I find the argument a little curious since China currently exists as the single greatest and most successful socialist experiment in history. I think maybe it just takes some recentering of the history of class struggle to get through to the masses. But capitalists own the mental means. So I don't know",
