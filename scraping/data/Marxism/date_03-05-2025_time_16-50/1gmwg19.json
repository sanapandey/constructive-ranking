    "selftext": "So, I'm struggling with an idea I've seen used in some classical theories of value like Ricardo or Marx.\n\nNamely, the classicals take the wage rate as exogenous to the broader price system. So, like, they tend to think of the wage rate as set at the socially determined level of subsistence, to borrow marx's term: the means of consumption. \n\n\nBut the price of the means of consumption is itself determined by the price system right? And therefore, since the wage rate equals that price, how is the wage rate exogenous?\n\n\nI suppose you could represent it as a portion of all value created, so the wage is say 1/2 of all produced value, but you still need a way to translate that into a price right?\n\nCause price = (1+ROP) \u00d7 (resources + price of wage rate) and the price of wage rate = total value produced \u00d7 proportion of total value allocated to labor.\n\n\nSo how do you translate that into a price? How is the socially determined means of consumption translate into a price which can then be used to calculate values?",

            "body": "Your equation represents the capitalist's conscious concept of price of production. It's the idea that you take the cost (in terms of how much money you have to spend) to produce it, add a markup based on the average rate of profit (which, note, is taken as a given), and voila, the price of production.\n\nIt doesn't represent the Marxist concept of what determines the price of production, becaue we don't take the ROP as a given. Also, since you're talking about the price of production, you're not even talking about the price expressing the product's true value. They are different. The latter has nothing to do with the average rate of profit across all commodities. Indeed, the price that reflects the true value could be expressed as V = C + V + S, where (C + V) are what something cost to produce (C being constant vapital, V being variable capital) and S is surplus value. On the other hand, price of production would be P = C + V + Pi, where Pi is the profit (derived from the average rate of profit). There's a big difference, because the ratio between (C+V) and Pi is the same for every commodity, but the ratio between (C+V) and S is different for each commodity depending on how it gets made. (Only at the level of the entire economy in aggregate are these two ratios equal, because total Pi equals total S).\n\nAnyway, here's how to think about this. In Marx's economics, the value of every commodity is determined exogenously and prices merely are how value communicates itself to human beings, how we represent it to ourselves. Take a hammer. Its value is determined by the amount of labor required to produce it using average socially normal techniques of production. I like to call this, following Marx, the hammer's dead labor. The quantity of value of the hammer, and therefore the magnitude of price reflecting that value, is determined by how much dead labor the hammer contains. The latter, the labor time, the amount of dead labor in the hammer, is not determined by any \"price system\".\n\nIt's the same when instead of a hammer you look at the commodity labor-power, which is what a wage worker sells to a capitalist. The value of that particular commodity - and therefore the price expressing that value, which we call the \"wage\" - is determined the same way as the hammer - how much dead labor is in it? The only dead human labor that is required for producing labor-power is the dead human labor in the means of consumption the labor-power needs for its reproduction. So that's what determines labor-power's value. As Marx says, this is very fortunate for the capitalist (they can consume the labor-power to produce much more dead labor than the labor-power itself contains and therefore use labor-power to produce surplus value and hence profit), but is not an injustice for the worker, because the worker gets the value of the product they are selling, which is all any commodity owner can rightly expect to earn.\n\nEvery product, not only labor-power, but also including labor-power, has its value determined by the dead labor it represents. So, exogenously.",

Value is a real property that commodities have at any moment in time.\n\nThe means of subsistence are just a bunch of commodities. Their value is determined the same way as any other commodities' values. It's determined by the dead labor they contain.\n\nLabor-power is just a commodity. Its value is determined the same way as any other commodity's value. It's determined by the dead labor it contains.\n\nValue is translated into price very simply. A certain quantity of dead labor means a certain amount of value. Double that amount of dead labor means double the value, and so on. A certain amount of value is expressed by a certain price.\n\nYeah, the wage rate is a function of the value of the means of consumption (simply because that happens to be the only labor input to producing labor-power). And the value of the means of consumption is a function of the dead labor the means of consumption contain. So the wage rate - or the value of labor-power - is a function of the dead labor contained in the means of consumption.\n\nFor example, Marx coins the term \"relative surplus value\" to describe how, when technological improvements make the means of consumption cheaper to produce in terms of human labor, the result is that the wage rate goes down and so the capitalist can pocket more surplus value in a working day. Less dead labor in the means of consumption, results in less dead labor in labor-power as a commodity. Labor-power became cheaper to produce. So its value goes down. Therefore its price, the wage, goes down. What's really determining the wage rate is labor, dead labor.",

This bundle of commodities represents the social \"average\" of what a worker needs to consume in order to survive (the actual consumption of an individual worker may differ from this bundle of commodities, but the average is going to represent the wage rate in the economy because that's the average wage needed to survive). This bundle of commodities is itself exogenous \n\n\nHowever the value of these commodities is endogenous. And therefore we can argue that the wage rate, in monetary terms, is endogenous even if the average consumption bundle isn't. \n\n\n\nSo in effect we can express the wage rate as the dot product of the matrix of physical quantities of goods needed for subsistence and their respective values.\n\n\nSo in effect the value of a commodity = (1+ROP)*(input matrix \u2022 respective value matrix + subsistence matrix \u2022 respective value matrix) = S+C+V=SNLT?\n\nIs that basically correct?",

But if you must, I would say yes to the first paragraph - which commodities are in that bundle is based partially on physical need, partially on the given culture and morals - for Marx it is very important to grasp that capitalism creates progress for society when use-values that were once luxuries or nonexistent turn into necessities of life for the working class (e.g. tea). But that's a whole other story - your narrow point is correct. It's just a given bundle of commodities.\n\nThe second paragraph doesn't seem right. To repeat myself, I would call the determination of value exogenous. It is determined by the prevailing state of scientific and technical progress in production. All else equal, assuming a certain amount of tea is part of the bundle of the commodities making up the worker's normal MOC, if some technical innovation is widely adopted that cuts the labor time needed to produce tea is reduced, then the value of labor-power is also reduced (and hence the wage as a value). Hence \"relative surplus value\" - capitalists can extract more surplus value from a fixed-length working day if they can \"cheapen\" (produce more efficiently) the wage commodities.\n\nFor any given commodity, it's usually not true that the value, (C+V+S) is going to equal anything having to do with (1 + ROP). You deifnitely should forget about the concept of \"markup\" - an average rate of profit added equally to every commodity's cost price to create a price of production, or a price at the average rate of profit. S, surplus value, is like the ROP, but the difference is, every different commodity has a differently sized S component of its value. Its not an average S, its a commodity-specific S.\n\nSo yes, if you have the scalar of the physical quantities of goods needed for consumption by labor-power, and the scalar of the values per unit of each of those goods, the dot product gives you the total value of the MOC and hence the wage. But you don't multiply this by (1+ROP).\n\nC + V + S = total output. V, variable capital, is the wage itself, and is equal to this - the sum of the values of different goods that make up the MOC. S is value produced by the labor beyond the labor needed to replace the MOC. And the final term, C, is the constant capital - the value of the means of production used up to produce the output. This is equal to the product the worker produces. It's not equal to the product the worker consumes. That's just V. The worker produces an amount of value each day equal to (V + S). They are only paid an amount equal to V because that is the value of their labor-power. In doing so, they also transfer an amount of value equal to C from the used-up MOP to the output.\n\nWage goods are only a component of the total output.\n\nWhat you're missing is that C + V + S aren't a formula that determines the value of anything. It simply represents a breakdown, an analysis, of the component parts of the value of the total output based on the function of each component. I'm a capitalist and my factory outputs $100 worth of boots each day. The reason it's $100 and not $105 or anything else is simply because we produce X number of boots and each boot has a value of Y and X \\* Y = $100. It's exogenous. But for me, they're not boots, they're capital in the form of boots. They're $100 of capital. I spent only $70 to produce them: $30 on wages, $40 on MOP. I spent $30 on wages because the workers only need bread and cotton to live on and a day's worth of bread is $10 and a day's worth of bread is $20 so that's what workers get paid. My workers create each day $60 of new value, of which $30 merely replaces what I spent to hire them, and the remaining $30 of which is surplus value. In this case, it is obvious that the workers MOC, the daily bread and cotton, must require only half a day's labor to produce. That's because the whole day's labor produces $60 of value and they are only worth $30. This is very fortunate for the capitalist, because they can find a product in the market, labor-power, which itself is only worth $30 and therefore only costs $30, but which when used properly alongside the proper MOP, can yield $60 of new value, replacing itself and yielding surplus value in addition. And yet I need not violate any laws of commodity exchange to make this happen, since the labor-power is purchased at its value, and the boots my factory produces are also sold at their value. So therefore, it makes sense to analyze my daily $100 worth of boot output as follows: $40 + $30 + $30. Each component has a different function. The first one, C, replaces the capital spent to purchase MOP. The second one, V, replaces the capital spent to procure labor, and therefore replaces the value of the means of production consumed by the worker. The third one is surplus. I can repeat the whole process without spending this third component, I can buy MOP and labor-power again and produce another $100 of boots tomorrow while retaining this third component, S.",

And therefore, since the wage rate equals that price, how is the wage rate exogenous?\n\nThe value of labor power is exogenous. In other words, the bundle of commodities consumed in aggregate, and thus on average for each productive worker household, is determined socially and morally (as in \u201cmoral\u201d in \u201cmoral support\u201d meaning spiritually/psychologically, rather than physically determined\u201d)\n\nThe bundle, given the material conditions independent or prices, then has a specific socially necessary labor-time (SNLT) required on average to produce the bundle of commodities: which SNLT, once congealed in commodities and expressed in money, is the value of the means of consumption for productive workers. All of this is determined independent of prices. \n\nPrices, though , then add their own complications to these conditions. For example, the prices of these wage-bundle commodities can be higher or lower than their value magnitudes (in the aggregate). If the prices of the aggregate means of consumption for productive workers exceeds the total value magnitudes of that bundle of commodities, then the price of labor-power must rise accordingly. If the prices of the aggregate means of consumption for productive workers falls below the value magnitudes of that bundle of commodities, then the price of labor-power will decline accordingly. The prices (as in, exchange-value expressed in the money commodity) deviate from the values, but the total value magnitude of those means of consumption ordinary commodities nevertheless remains the same. The productive workers get the value of the means of subsistence and the surplus value goes to the purchase of unproductive capital, the compensation for unproductive labor and the consumption of the capitalist exploiters. Such adjustments in the price of labor power do depend on various price determinations, but the value of labor-power\u2014as in the aggregate value magnitude portion of the aggregate net value added in any period, and going to productive workers\u2014is independent of prices. \n\n> So how do you translate that into a price? How is the socially determined means of consumption translate into a price which can then be used to calculate values?\n\nThe wages do not determine values. Only the SNLT\u2014dead and living labor\u2014determines the value magnitudes. The exchange-value of money then determines the value-price or what contemporary Marxian economists call the monetary expression of labor-time (MELT)",

Value tells us something about the total labor-time available for distribution. Price tells us how that net produce and gross product has been distributed.  Changes in the deviation of price from value can occur for all sorts of reasons: a change in SNLT is only one possible influence for the deviation. \n\n> The SNLT is divided between C (constant capital), V (Variable Capital) and S (Surplus value).\n\nI would more characterize it as the net value is divided between variable capital and the surplus value. Or the net product is divided between the means of consumption for productive workers and surplus products. Or that the living labor is divided between necessary labor and surplus labor. \n\nIf instead you want to think about the gross product, it is divided between replacing the means of production used up and the net product I already covered. In terms of value, the gross product includes the value of means of production produced earlier (SNLT congealed as the value of means of production), diligently transferred to the new commodity by living labor, plus the value added by that living labor (according to the  SNLT of the living labor). _Capital_ v1, ch8 is a great read on this process.\n\n> So, because of competition there is a uniform rate of profit (again it may not actually be uniform at any given time, but the tendency is for it to equalize), if capital can chase higher profits it will and that will bring down those profits until they equalize across the economy.\n\nI read the equalization of the rate of profit as more a hypothetical: what happens _if_ competition leads to an equalization in the rate of profit. Later chapters in v3 cover monopoly where the tendency is for the rate of profit to _not equalize_, but rather prices must adjust so that the monopolists enjoy higher profits and the many other underlining capitalist enterprises face prices that bring less than the average rate of profit. \n\n> We can basically say that the SNLT (value) = C + V + S\n\nMore precisely the SNLT equals the SNLT embodied in the means of production + the living labor as measured by its living SNLT. \n\n> Now, the means of subsistence have associated with them their own SNLT.\n> \n> What I am struggling to understand is how that value gets translated into a \u201clong term equilibrium price\u201d.\n\nIt is more that the price determines (partially) how the net value and net products emanating from the living labor in each period get distributed among the many recipient facilitators and conditions of existence for the capitalist mode of production (productive workers and others)\n\n> Basically, I\u2019m wondering if the wage rate is a function of the \u201clong term equilibrium price\u201d of the commodities in the means of subsistence consumption bundle.\n\nThe prices of the means of consumption for workers, as well as the price of labor power that affords productive workers the revenues to purchase those means of consumption must adjust to facilitate the reproduction of the worker and bring that worker to market, as you said.

Marx has the benefit of all of the criticisms lobbed against Smith and Ricardo, which he analyzes in _Theories of Surplus Value_ and elsewhere.\n\n\nEDIT: also I think it is fair for Ricardo to think in terms of dynamic process (discrete or continuous) where prices exist prior to production and reproduction of the workers which enables the production process M\u2013C\u2013 Production\u2013C\u2032\u2013M\u2032) to begin again with a new turnover responding to those initial prices and producing new prices subsequent to that process. Rinse and repeat.\n\nIn his development of his prices of production, Marx imposes the restriction that the prices at the beginning of the turnover of capital remain the same at the end of the turnover to impose the necessary ceteris paribus conditions necessary for his thought experiment, so he can trade through the redistribution of value among the competing capitalists. This is much like the restriction he places on prices in the first volume that they remain equal to value magnitude so that he can show how surplus value does not arise from price fluctuations.",

Enforced obligation is.\n\nIn theory you should not accept to work for an amount that will not allow you to at least meet your government obligations. Taxation could never be outside of what wages would allow, because no one could work and produce a surplus.  In rare occasions where the government asks for your life in defense of the country that becomes part of your obligation. Ultimately, it is your citizenship that you value when you accept government obligation.\n\nThe key concept here is that everything else is a commodity and is given a market exchange value in market exchanges. The standard of value is not that. It is set and it is for you to negotiate a wage based on it. There is also the possibility to trade the token of the standard of value in market exchanges outside of the country, but that in no way changes the amount of government obligation that is attached to the money. One dollar always settles one dollar's worth of obligation in the issuing country. We trade based in this government guarantee. The government cannot refuse your paper to settle your obligations and it will accept nothing else when it asks for money.",
