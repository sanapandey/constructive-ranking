    "selftext": "Hello Comrades, \n\nWe've written an article addressing Trumps Ukraine-Plans and which capital-interests the US, aswell as the EU, try to carry through the current developements in the Ukraine-war.   \nThe article is an analysis of the fact that the EU is trying by all means to continue this war and why the United States is pursuing other interests in Ukraine.  \nHere's a little excerpt: \n\n\"Trump's plan for Ukraine includes Pizzo payments totalling **500 billion dollars**, which Ukraine should pay as \u2018compensation\u2019 for the aid provided from the United States and, as mentioned above, the c**ontrol of half of Ukraine's mineral resources by American corporations.** (...)  \nThe situation is different for the EU; this \u2018forever-war\u2019 not only legitimises the **armament of the war industry** and the **political legitimisation of social budget cuts**, but also the **preservation of transatlantic alliances**, which could weaken if American-Russian relations normalise. (...)  \nConversely, this would mean that American capital would expand towards the Pacific, leaving European companies and their representatives with **more expensive LNG, a weakened euro, (even) greater competition from Asian companies** and a **radical decline in global demand**.\"\n\nYou can read the article [here! ](https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/02/20/wem-nuetzt-der-krieg/)  \nIf you enjoy the article, [follow us on Instagram, here! ](https://www.instagram.com/kritik_punkt/)\n\nSolidarity,   \nKP",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
