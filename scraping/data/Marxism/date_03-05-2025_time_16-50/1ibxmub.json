I don't want to step on any toes or chase a dead end. For the most part I've found mostly historical analysis on soviet cybernetics.\n\nSafe to assume I've read the first page of Google\n\nThank you comrades!",

Designing Freedom is a good introductory text before diving into the more technical stuff like Brain of the Firm and Syntegrity, etc. \n\ninsofar as cybernetics is related to dialectics, its likely more useful to understand cybernetics as a practical attempt at applying a dialectical approach to systems construction.",

Also you had to wait until the second cybernetics to go out of the homestosasis paradigm, while Bogdanov was already partly out of it.",

The underlying assumption is that the failure of the Soviet system was in parts due to ignoring feedback loops (via disincentives and the like). This is why one should really start with Heinz von Forster's initial writings.",

While I think this is logically sound it seems antithetical to comprehending a material world.\n\nI will look at Heinz von Forster, thank you for the reccomendation",

                            "body": "I do not agree with this characterisation of dialectics and I am tempted to attribute this to the manifold of authors that make it obscure because they have not properly understood it themselves.\n\nSorry for the Germansplaining (or the opinionated attempt at clarifying the conversation), but: \n\n1. Kant noticed that the antinomy of pure reason follows from the property of self reflectivity in certain conceptual frameworks. Speaking with G\u00f6del or Russel, every system capable of evaluating itself produces the liar's antinomy. (What's the cause of causality?!)\n\n2. Kant noticed that \"you can put this in perspective\". The antinomy only appears if the evaluation undermines the statement's validity. However, one can synthesize a frame of reference that avoids the antinomy (\"freedom is not absence of causality, but presence of responsibility\").\n\n3. Hegel considers this the standard heuristic for intellectual progress: conflicting ideas result from a deficient interpretative framework. Dialectics is an evolutionary process of finding the optimal point of view.\n\n4. Marx noticed that history is the result of an evolutionary process resulting from social conflicts (class struggle) that is capable of also explaining Hegel's thought evolution out of the material conditions. This is why he put Dialectics from its head to its feet.\n\n5. In Marxist thinking the social conditions are self contradictory: Social systems create their own spanners in the wheels, their own social conflicts, which produce the \"antinomy of society\". However, it is important to note: self contradictions appear in the realm of claims of validity, in a conceptual world. In this regard, they are a natural phenomenon of a materialist perspective. Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's electrodynamics are for example contradictory, which is resolved in special relativity. But the contradictions live of course in the realm of judgments or concepts (im begrifflichen Denken).\n\n6. The self reflectivity in cybernetics is a different story. It reflects the contingency paradox. I write this because I expect you to read it, but you read it only if you expect me to write it because I expect you to read it, and so on. This is related, via the hangmen's paradox (the judge tells the habitual liar: if the next thing you say is a lie, you will be hanged tomorrow. What do you say? - I will be hanged tomorrow.), but it is not the same thing.",

Class struggle therefore becomes a pragmatist incoherence in the model that is human society.\n\nBeer's idea of 'killing the cat' from designing freedom points towards how capitalist forms of organising production causes this mess. Designing freedom is a short read (or listen--it was originally a set of radio lectures) and your inner Marxist will be screaming for Beer to mention class struggle because he all but explains it!\n\nCybernetics is not just feedback/feed forward loops, it's about the characteristics of models within their environments--what makes a good model is especially important. Ashby's law, good regulator theorem, the darkness principle and the principle of least surprisal (AKA the free energy principle). \n\nUnfortunately, a good treatment of these aspects are missing from a lot of 'cybernetic' philosophy which seems to have inherented a lot of Cybernetic terminology but err more towards the psychoanalytic.",
