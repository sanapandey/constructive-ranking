    "selftext": "I am an amateur, so I am sorry if my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nIn a capitalist market, this equation is the representation of trade.\n\n`PP = CP`\n\n`PP = Producer Price`\n\n`CP = Consumer Price`\n\nFirst, let's talk about consumer price. `CP` is the the price the consumer assumes. which is influenced by utility (determined by the consumers, subjective). It depends on how the consumers think how useful the item is to the consumers.\n\n* Need: Does the item fulfill the need of the consumer?\n* Market: How the market can influence the perception of the consumer.\n\nSecond, let's talk about producer price, which is the price the producer assumes. Producer Price is a lot more complex than CP.\n\nGenerally, the final price of a product according to the producer (`PP`) is determined by this equation:\n\n`PP = PrP + AV`\n\n`PrP = Previous Price`\n\n`AV = Added Value`\n\nWhen producing a bread for example, `PrP` is the initial ingredients (flour, egg, etc), and is based on the final price determined by the deal between the producer and the consumer in the previous trade of the initial ingredients (e.g. buying flour, egg, etc).\n\nAdded value is the value added by the producer.\n\n`AV = MV + SV`\n\n`MV = Market Value`\n\n`SV = Surplus Value`\n\nSurplus Value is generated through labor, and is based on an agreement of wage between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Thus, SV is determined by the amount of socially-necessary labor needed to produce the product.\n\nMarket Value is a new variable, and will be above zero if the mechanism of capitalist market is implemented. Market Value is interesting, because it will increase if `CP` increases. Essentially it can create values out of nothing.\n\n**How the bourgeoisie obtain a profit?**\n\nThe bourgeoisie can obtain a profit from the extraction of `AV`\n\n`P = EMV + ESV`\n\n`P = Profit`\n\n`EMV = Extraction of Market Value`\n\n`ESV = Extraction of Surplus Value`\n\nGenerally, if a bourgeoisie wants to rely purely on `EMV` for profit, the bourgeoisie has to ensure that the market is stable (continuous demand), since nobody likes volatile profit (you want to constantly generate profit). Continuous demand is assured through:\n\n* Sustaining growth: By sustaining demand (planned obsolescence, aggressive marketing, lobbying the state for advantage in the market, creation of consumerist and non-environmentally-friendly culture to fuel thae demand), the market value is guaranteed to stay constant. This phenomenon is short-term.\n* Corporatist (tripartite) economy: In a late-stage capitalist economy, aka developed economy, the market has stabilized into an oligarch of bourgeoisie and a large population pool of the proletariat. Thus the only one who can buy the products of the bourgeoisie is the proletariat. By ensuring good wages (and minimizing the damage caused by boom-bust cycle), the bourgeoisie can ensure demand.\n* Boom-bust cycle: If the bourgeosie decides not to do anything, the proletariat will be unable to keep the demand, thus causing the rapid fall of demand, causing the collapse of growth. The bourgeoisie will be forced to either lower its market value (restarting the growth) or by redistributing money in the form of raising wages (social democracy).\n\nNote that the extraction of market value is harder to do for non consumer goods market, e.g. raw resources.\n\nHowever:\n\n* The extraction of market value in a corporatist economy is contradictory to the main concept in capitalism, that is the mindset of financial growth. Think about it, you have to give your profit to the proletariat just to ensure demand, isn't that contradictory to the reasoning of you founding the business at the first place (thus no maximum profit for you).\n* In a developing non-late-stage capitalist economy, the market is still volatile, the petite bourgeoisie is still going strong. Thus, `EMV` can not be the only way, some kind of surplus value extraction is still required. Corporatism hasn't formed.\n* This is why neo-colonialism happen, the core countries generally are corporatist in nature due to strong labor laws, the bourgeoisie, realizing that third-world global south countries labor army is cheaper and easier to mess around with due to the lack of strong labor laws in the global south, decided to export their capital and to extract surplus value in the global south.\n\nNow, this time we are going to talk about the tendency for the rate of profit to fall. Due to automation, labor are reduced in favor of automatic machines, thus causing the lowering of surplus value to 0, thus causing the rate of profit to fall (according to Marx). In my hypothesis, market value can still guarantee profit. But market value depends on consumer price. And in a developed economy, the majority of consumers are the proletariat. Thus, if the bourgeoisie wants to keep the demand, like it or not the bourgeoisie has to redistribute its economy to the proletariat to ensure demand, yet again causing contradiction.\n\nThus, the ways the bourgeoisie can counter the tendency are:\n\n* If the bourgeoisie extract the surplus value, the bourgeoisie has to exploit the proletariat in order to increase surplus value.\n* But, the proletariat won't be able to keep the demand, thus decreasing the market value. Now redistribution is needed to be done to keep the demand. Note that this case only applies in developed countries where majority of the consumers are the proletariat. In a developing country where a lot of the consumers are still petite bourgeoisie, this case won't apply.\n* Either way, the bourgeoisie won't be able to increase profit in a long term, only in short term. The only thing the bourgeoisie is able to do is to keep the flow of profit, neither incresing or decreasing.\n\nAssuming that humanity still survives after late-stage capitalism without a socialist revolution, the only thing left is a large global social democratic economy, which is similar to the nature of feudalism, where capital is heavily consentrated in the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie still enjoys wealth, however the bourgeoisie needs to act like a child giving the remains of his/her food to the street cats. And the street cats are the proletariat.\n\nThis is what I refer as power inequality. I won't go in depth (I have developed my own thoughts regarding this, might continue in the next post), so I will stop here.\n\nThat's it. Comments are appreciated.",

            "body": "No. You are making elementary errors conflating market price with value. Value is not price, it is a determinate or indicator of it. Price is determined by market forces and hovers around value. Bourgeoise economics is largely a sham that also cannot determine price as much as it wants to. The distinction is important for exactly this reason as otherwise it seems value comes out of thin air - your \u201cmarket value.\u201d \n\nAll value comes from labour. Total profits are equal to the total surplus value, equal to the total value generated by production subtracted by the cost of labour power (wages). Your \u201cprecious price\u201d conceals the crystallised dead labour inputed beforehand by workers. \n\nProfits from the point of view of the capitalist are equal to their total income minus expenditure. To put it another way, the total surplus extraction minus variable and constant capital costs. Capital is in competition and must go through continual reinvestment into capital known as capital accumulation to survive. But as value only comes from labour, profit rates decline the more money is invested into constant capital as opposed to variable capital (variable capital being an investment in workers). Thus there is a the tendency for the rate of profit to decline due to this inherent nature of capitalism. As the rate of profit falls the economy goes into crisis and basically capital has to self cannibalise one another, cut wages etc to re-establish the profit rate - one of the reasons for the boom bust cycle. Extracting value through suppressing workers wages is the way capitalists expand their profit rates. But wages are also the primary thing used to fuel consumption spending. This can lead to basically bottlenecks in production as businesses go out of business and have a knock on effect on other businesses. This is another reason the boom bust cycle occurs. \n\nCapitalism can\u2019t be kept stable as it\u2019s inherently not a planned economic system and is determined instead by chaotic, individualised exchange on a market. \n\nThe implications of your corporatist points basically suggest that all capital needs to do is have social democracy, it\u2019s basically a less developed form of Keynesian economics. But it\u2019s the exact internal logic of capital itself that causes itself to collapse through competition and the declining rate of profit. Also it ignores why capital accumulates into large blocs at all. That\u2019s the cannibalisation process that occurs when profit rates fall. I don\u2019t think you really understand \u201ccorporatism.\u201d You would not be able to apply this analysis to a third world country and try explain how their own bourgeoise acts and interacts, according to your own assumptions. All capitalist states are imperialist, even in the third world. \n\nThe neo-colonialism concept is also pretty poorly developed. You should look into imperialism which is a much better lens with which to understand how blocs of capital function and interact with the state. If your hypothesis was true then we would see a flood of capital to the third world. Instead a larger degree of domestic first world capital expenditure as a % of total capital expenditure. Imperialism is about crude capital accumulation in its earliest forms and in its higher developed ones it\u2019s about expanding the markets for blocs of capital so that said blocs capital can expand outwards and put off running into crisis. It\u2019s part of the way capital moves to stave off the declining rate of profit and is really just another cannibalisation method.",

                    "body": "OK, got it. Here is my responses:\n\n1. For the value part, under a market a consumer might value a product based on his/her subjective preference. Both theories are right, basically. A bourgeoisie can utilize consumer subjective preference to generate profit out of thin air by extracting market value. In a socialist and communist society, such mechanism will disappear. Extracting market value however is unsustainable in long term, only short term. That's why in history the dominant method of value extraction is usually through the extraction of surplus value. Market value is also easier to manipulate for consumer goods which have complex parameters, unlike non consumer goods which is simpler, thus harder for its market value to be manipulated. I forgot to add the previous statement, I've added it, sorry.\n2. All capitalism can develop into a corporatist economy due to political reforms. However, the application of corporatism contradicts the nature of capitalism (class collaboration vs extraction of surplus value which causes class struggle). Which continues to the third point.\n3. The bourgeoisie hates the model of corporatism created in the core countries (because it forces redistribution to keep the labor from being angry, thus a contradiction to the bourgoeisie principle of growth and competition, the bourgeoisie can't extract surplus value to create growth), so they decide to do their dream (read: exploitation) in third world countries where corporatism is not developed.\n4. That doesn't mean corporatism must be applied in all corners of the globe. It contradicts the nature of capitalism, it violates the interest of the bourgeoisie. Thus it can be abandoned, going back to cannibalization.\n5. But if the bourgeoisie suddenly decide to be smart and decide not to attack the proletariat again and suddenly become benevolent for some reason, corporatism will fall anyway. This is due to power imbalance. Let me explain. If humanity has developed some kind of global corporatist economy, the boss will be the bourgeoisie. But when there is some kind of \"instability\" such as a famine due to natural disaster, an incident that basically causes a national crisis, the bourgeoisie will suddenly loses popularity in front of the proletariat, causing a proletarian revolution. This is how French Revolution started in the first place anyway, due to a famine and an economic disaster due to the royalty's mounting debt.",
