    "selftext": "\"To put it briefly, capitalism has been able to tolerate an unprecedented distribution of political goods, the rights and liberties of citizenship, because it has also for the first time made possible a form of citizenship, civil liberties and rights which can be abstracted from the distribution of social power. In this respect, it contrasts sharply with the profound transformation of class power expressed by the original Greek conception of democracy as rule by the demos, which represented a specific distribution of class power summed up in Aristotle's definition of democracy as rule by the poor.\" Ellen Meiksins Wood\n\nVery important points by Ellen Meiksins Wood. Again, \"a form of citizenship, civil liberties and rights which can be ABSTRACTED from the distribution of social power.\" The apparent separation between the political and the social allows \"democracy\" without \"democracy as rule by the people\" or \"individual freedom\" without human freedom where people governed their world and life.\n\n\"It was capitalism which for the first time made possible a purely 'formal' political sphere, with purely 'political' rights and liberties. That historical transformation laid the foundation for a REDEFINITION of the word 'democracy'.\" EMW\n\n\"...with the intrusion of the 'masses' into the political sphere, the concept of democracy began to LOSE its SOCIAL connotations, in favour of essentially procedural or 'formal' criteria.\"\nEllen Meiksins Wood in \"The uses and abuses of 'civil society'\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt that modern conceptions of equality have expanded - at least in breadth if not in depth - far beyond the exclusive Greek conception which denied the democratic principle to women and slaves. At the same time, the changes that have occurred in the meaning of democracy have not all been on the side of delegitimizing inequality. Far from it. In fact, one of the most significant dimensions of the 'democratic revolution' is that it marks the DISSOCIATION of 'democracy' from its meaning as POPULAR POWER, rule by the DEMOS. It is precisely for this reason - not simply because of some general advance in democratic values - that 'democracy' ceased to be a dirty word among the dominant classes.\" Ellen Meiksins Wood\n\nWe can also see the changes in the meanings of 'freedom', 'equality', 'responsibility', 'agency', 'anti-racism', 'justice' and recognise why these words have \"ceased to be dirty words among the dominant classes\".",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
