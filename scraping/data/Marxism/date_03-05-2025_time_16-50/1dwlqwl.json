Kanafani was one of the PFLP\u2019s major early theoreticians, and his history of this period is an attempt to give a critical Marxist diagnosis of the state of revolutionary struggle in Palestine from the perspective of 1972, the year Israel assassinated him.",

George Habash is also great, however, he took a mildly pro-Arabist stance on several issues, Arafat (not really that fond off, and took the idea of compromise, and put it to the grave). For a surface level understanding you can read Leila Kali's \u2018the basic political document of the armed Palestinian resistance movement\u2019, as it lays out the central principles around which the PFLP operate.",
