In this section Engel praises the german worker's party because of their keen theoretical approach and how they built their movement based on the english and french experiences.\n\nIt reads:\n\n>For the first time since a workers\u2019 movement has existed, the struggle is being conducted pursuant to its three sides \u2013 the. theoretical, the political, and the practical-economic (resistance to the capitalists) \u2013 in harmony and in its interconnections, and in a systematic way. It is precisely in this, as it were, concentric attack, that the **strength and invincibility** of the German movement lies.\n\nI'm aware Lenin is writing from 1902 and Engels from before that, waaaaaay before the WWs.\n\nIf the german movement was so strong... How come the nazi movement managed to squash it so thoroughly? And with the rebirth of the neonazi party, it looks like Germany was never moved from the far-right. Even in the golden, peaceful years of Merkel, Germany has been solidly right-winger for +1 century. And yet in Engel\u00b4s time the worker's movement was considered\u00a0*strong and invincible*...\n\nSo, my question is... What happened to the German Left? Was it exterminated by WW1 or the nazis? Its still there, like a shadow movement? Or did it migrate never to return, joining the Soviet Union?",

            "body": "The German left for most of the period was the SPD or Social Democratic Party, the party formed by Engels and Marx. They had millions of members and developed militant, extensive trade unions. \n\nBy this point they were dominated primarily by reformist thought, dominated by Karl Kautsky on the \u201cleft\u201d (who was once a revolutionary considered the pope of Marxism) and Bernstein on the right/ parliament. The split between Revolutionary and Reformist had not happened yet, the socialist movement had not politically clarified enough to be able to realise the significance of the opportunistic reformist tendencies and the entrenched, conservative trade Union bureaucracy. \n\nThe trade unionists in Germany had a highly regimented top down approach to running their unions, primarily to maintain their bureaucracy\u2019s monopoly on the workers movement. The SPD\u2019s parliamentarians also tend towards reformism, with an idealogical commitment to socialism through parliament. The revolutionary factions within the SPD and Russian left were widely crucial of the reformist current but did not understand the need to split from them entirely yet as the Bolsheviks did with the Mensheviks. \n\nThe SPD largely backs the German Kaiserreich and military in ww1, making an unprincipled pro imperialist move against the internationalism of socialism. This spurns a whole new wave of criticism and denouncements from the revolutionary left. Lenin can barely believe it when he hears of it but comes to terms with it and goes on the attack. German communists Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebnicht, the leaders of the revolutionary faction in the SPD, viciously attack the SPD from a revolutionary internationalist standpoint. Eventually they are expelled from the party and go on to form the KPD, the German communist party.  \n\nThe Russian revolution happens. Suddenly revolution is on the cards. Millions of German workers become radicalised, the German military collapses. The Kaiser abdicates. Germany\u2019s SPD takes power in the wrap up of the German revolution at the end of ww1 in 1918- not the victory of the revolution but through a parliamentary election. But the workers themselves want more and the SPD is incapable of challenging capitalism with their reformist politics. Mass demonstrations and strikes feature in this period. \n\nThe SPD finances and founds fascistic paramilitaries called the Freikorps, made up of the most right wing sections of the military. Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Liebnicht are killed when their faction argues for essentially an armed revolution prematurely, which they reluctantly agree too. The German revolutionary left loses much of its leadership, shot and dumped in the river by fascists. \n\nThe communist party then goes through a series of renewals and defeats, assisted by the Bolsheviks through the Comintern. By this point they have tens of thousands of members but are still quite fringe and inexperienced compared to the SPD, which in itself is fracturing into the right and left sections. They jump from ultraleft adventurism which finds no purchase in the workers movement (for instance a refusal to work with the SPD unions due to viewing them as fascists to ANOTHER failed attempt at an insurrection) to relatively pessimistic conservative outlooks where they fail to properly take advantage of opportunities. The Bolsheviks and more reasonable KPD members several splits in the KPD to try course correct. They manage to win over large sections of the left of the SPD as the SPD continues its trend to the right as a bourgeoise-trade-unionist-bureaucracy alliance. \n\nNow we are in the early 1920s. By this point Russia\u2019s revolution itself has deteriorated significantly, Lenin has passed away and there\u2019s a power struggle between members of the Bolshevik party notably Stalin. The troika and later the Bukharin Stalin rivalry. The Nazi party is formed in the wake of sheer economic destitution in Germany\u2019s Weimar Republic. The Comintern again tries to meddle in the German communist party KPD\u2019s strategy but this time they are not thinking of international revolution but rather Russian foreign policy - their intentions are corrupted by the corruption in the party. They champion the line that the SPD are social fascist and working with them is worse than working with the Nazis. \n\nTime skipping, the Nazis grow massively and are relatively uncontested by the KPD who prefer to focus their fire on the SPD and say \u201cafter the SPD, Hitler\u2019s nazis are next!\u201d The Nazi party comes to power and essentially declares war on the German workers movement. The SPD and KPD both prove incapable of mounting a working class resistance to the nazis and still will not form a United front against the Nazis. They are isolated and picked off one by one, with mass killings and the destruction of all unions. Party members from both are stuck in gulags or shot. Many flew to Poland and Russia but in a historic betrayal Stalin makes a pact with Hitler over Poland and even sends some communists seeking refuge back to Germany to meet their end as part of a good will sacrifice m. Thus ends the German left. \n\nIt\u2019s good to understand the different specifics so I recommend reading something on the German revolution and the Comintern during this period. It\u2019s such a criticism of both ultraleftism and right wing opportunism and reformism. It\u2019s a major tragedy. So many martyred revolutionaries including the luminary figures like Rosa Luxembourg whose theoretical contributions and polemical were on par with Lenin. So many young and hopeful radical workers were butchered. It should boil your blood and call for mourning. If the German left had succeeded we might very well have had international revolution throughout all of Europe and then the world. World communism. Certainly Russia would not have travelled down its path into an isolated authoritarian state. And Germany would not have seen the horrific rise of the nazis. \n\nLenin was always betting on revolution in Germany to succeed for the one in Russia to succeed, for Russia\u2019s working class was comparatively small and could not hold out alone without Germany or another suitably large industrial power coming to save them and alleviate their poverty from first ww1 and then the civil war. They bet everything on it and did their part, the international left let them down.",

And those who stayed at the UltraLeft were assassinated. \n\n\nFrom 1900s until 1930s, the Revolutionary fraction kept losing people to the Reformists, the later trusting the democratic process through Parliament and by doing so they were dancing to Capitalism's tune. The democratic arrangement dampened the commitment to the communist cause, rendering the Reformists impotent.\n\n\nWhile this *cooling*  was happening, imperialists and fascists were on the rise and a divided Left was unable to fend it off. Even worse, in WW1 leftists aided the Reich and between wars they founded fascist groups that eventually destroyed their \"parent\", the SPD. \n\n\nAm I rigth?\n\n\nAlso, I have the feeling that the moral of the story is to always be Revolutionary, hence UltraLeft. They, it seems, have the heart in the right place, have clarity of purpose and a fixed moral compass.  But... you mentioned there are criticisms to the UltraLeft... So... could you mention one criticism?",

                            "body": "Yes the spd divided itself and has schism based on the right wing leadership of the spd making terrible opportunistic decisions. I would not call Rosa and Liebnicht ultraleft although their premature revolution was technically. The KPD\u2019s leadership were not so much assassinated as gunned down in the streets in open armed conflict. \n\nThe reformists actually lost people to the revolutionary side with a schism in the SPD and many millions of workers going to favour the KPD. So other way around. The reformists however funneling their section of the workers movement into parliamentary reformism and did their best to stifle the radical sections of workers who wanted general strikes and the formation of soviets. There actually was the formation of proto soviets in Germany but they were either extinguished by the SPD or became dominated by them as a new bureaucratic layer. \n\nThe left was divided yes. And the unprincipled supporting of ww1 and the SPD tolerating or even creating fascist paramilitaries did bite them in the ass and paved the way for Naziism. \n\nThe ultralefts are revolutionaries but the ultralefts made several tactical mistakes. Not wanting to work with the spd against the Nazis decrying them as butchers of the revolution (true but misses the point that the majority of workers favoured the SPD still as opposed to the KPD). They tried disastrous military coups or established extremely isolated pockets of resistance that got crushed, massively overvaluing their actual support in the working class. And providing a good excuse to bring repression on them. They did this not once but twice before large numbers of them were expelled from the KPD with recommendations from the Comintern. When the nazis started to claim power the ultralefts who had reclaimed the KPD still tried to say the SPD are just as bad as the Nazis whilst the trade unions were smashed up violently and spd and kpd members alike were rounded up and killed or sent to the camps. They did not try to defend the democratic wins from the nazis saying they were essentially worthless due to the reformists dominating them. This meant they lost those same democratic wins and then being a socialist became illegal, and the whole left was then wiped out. \n\nThe ultralefts are much more sympathetic than the SPD\u2019s Right but they still made disastrous decisions based on essentially moralism and a head in the clouds approach. \n\nThe moral of the story is 1. You have to be revolutionary. 2. You have to actually understand how much support you have and how to win more support. This means not abstaining from arguing with and forming a United Front with the reformists against fascism based on the common interest in not wanting to all be murdered. Winning workers away from the reformists means you need to not boycott them but rather engage with them. 3. We should not downplay fascism.",

SPD was faced with a choice between giving significant policy voice to communists and keeping support of more conservative power blocs and picked the conservative blocs. I'm more than happy to call that funding the Freikorp, but conservative political violence seems to have been a direct reaction to communists, in part a conservative strategy trying to influence and threaten the SPD.\n\nI struggle to label that dynamic as SPD\n*founding* the paramilitaries.\n\n>made up of the *most* right wing sections of the military (emphasis added).\n\nNot that it matters to your overall point, since the military was overall very conservative, but the Freikorp were made up of former soldiers no longer permitted in the German army because of size caps imposed by the victorious Entende. I'm not aware of any ideological screening between those who stayed in the armed forces and those who were forced out/resign.",

This played a part in them voting for war credits because they were afraid going against the Kaiser at the time would mean persecution for the socialists. So there they betrayed the 2nd international and Lenin turned from taking his lead from the German Marxists to paving his own path.\n\nThen during the 30s, the German left made the mistake of not taking Hitler seriously. Sort of succumbed to the opposite extreme. It would have been better to unite with liberals against the fascist threat.",

            "body": "The German Left pretty much split three ways. The SPD went full reformist and was satisfied with bourgeois democracy with the fall of the empire. Then there was the KPD that split from them that remained revolutionary, and finally an even more \"ultra\" wing of the KPD that wanted to set up Soviets at the time at the end of WW1. The party followed that branch, and got crushed by the alliance of SPD and Freikorps.\n\nI think the writings of Rosa express that she was initially hesitant in pushing for revolution at the time (please correct this if it's wrong), but the party as a whole moved that way so she went with that in the end.",
