    "selftext": "A little preface about myself, I'm from Singapore and have grown up exposed to these expat circles as I have lived in a few other non-western countries in my life outside of my home country (not proud of that but ya.) And though I have only recently started identifying as a ML and I have only just recently found these communist/leftist subreddits (including this one), I haven't encountered another marxist discuss the class antagonism that expat circles would fundamentally develop in the countries they are situated in (or at least not as in-depth as I would like.)\n\nTo put it simply, even before I became a marxist (I've always been into post-colonial ideas and have been a staunch anti-imperialist beforehand though), I've always fucking hated expat circles. Their very presence brings forth the same kind of class dynamics and dialectics present in colonial capitalism and they ultimately prove that the current economic wave of neo-liberalism and globalisation are there to make sure the capital accumulation and the relationship the western imperialist core has to the rest of the world economically are maintained. This is evident in countries like Singapore and South Korea that, though are industrialised, prosperous countries, are also in the economic mercy of the west with MNCs holding a substantial presence, having good relations with the world bank, having to take part in free trade agreements etc, and I believe that expat circles are the result of this phenomena. Also, the exclusive, elitist characteristics that these circles sometimes enact toward local peoples (even resulting in crimes being committed) and how some members of the local bourgeoise would adopt self hating characteristics to \"make business\" with expats are the results of this class antagonism.

Did you bitch and moan when the german bourgeoisie adopted \"self-hating\" characteristics at the end of the second world war to appear more attractive for foreign investment? And what concern is it of ours anyway what machinations the bourgeoisie is up to? Your whole discussion centers around and never leaves the sphere of inter-boug or inter-petty boug social dynamics and I don't think this has anything to do with Marxism at all.",

What I was trying to point out is how this colonial inspired class dynamic has the potential to make the common people think that they only way for them to \"progress\" and materially benefit from class is to adopt western supremacist views and to neglect (or outright hate) their own heritage since they tie this homogenous perception of western culture as to being \"upper class\" and \"prestigious.\"  Hence, they should subconsciously adopt western supremacist views and believe in stereotypes as they see as beneficial if that makes sense. \n\nI view this phenomenon to be quite real to countries outside the western imperialist core and members of the national bourgeois helps perpetuate these ideas. It's like how Frantz Fanon mentioned that the colonised people would subconsciously gain an inferiority complex due to the percieved nature of class/social superiority of the coloniser class, and how European colonialism has led to us correlating being white to being rich. That's what the point I was trying to make and sorry if I didn't make that clear enough.\n\nA bit weird how you said my perspective is inter-petty bourgeois tho.",

This is why I label such concerns as \"petty-bourgeois\" - because they are! Concerns about \"culture\" and \"heritage\" and whatnot are staples of petty-bourgeois socialism. They oppose capitalism because their artisanal professions, or their traditional authority is threatened by it. Marxists oppose capitalism on a materialist basis: the present system is not in the favour of the proletariat, and hence the proletariat has an interest in abolishing it - this is the first and last word of Marxist communism. Let the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois do as they like, it is *not our concern*.\n\nAlso it's very strange the examples you picked: korea and Singapore. These are core countries in any meaningful sense. They might not be independent, but apart from maybe China and the US (and even these are contentious), which country is?",
