    "selftext": "As a young union member, I did have politics. I ended up in a shop with a union, and in my earlier days I just wanted more money. Through experience I slowly started to learn and read more about labour history (IWW, OBU) and different types of unionism (business vs. liberal, etc.) and eventually I ended up adopting more political thought into my work. Long story short, I am now a 20 year labour veteran who firmly believes in trade unionism, which is radical considering where I came from (the opposite of that). However, I have been dabbling more in leftist literature to teach an old dog new tricks and it has helped me distill my experience. \n\nWhen I was a younger trade union member, it was easier to rally workers around a cause, and to expend resources to bring the unorganized into our membership. We even had a solidarity committee, and we sent activists abroad to support international trade union work. Some 20 years later, we are a shell of our former selves, and I could never understand what happened. We just lost... our way. Our membership eroded from layoffs, closures, and consolidation efforts, yet then we could not better radicalize workers. From that we lost money, and our ability to get members to vote for organizing drives, or to raise money for local causes. And then I read this term - Labour Aristocracy - and I flipped out. It perfectly encapsulated my recent experiences as a union organizer. Though our members are materially above the vast majority of workers, they could care less. They cannot stomach the idea that their dues ought to go to other workers who deserve better. It is sad, and all it is serving is our boss. \n\nSo I wanted to say, to you all, that I have much to learn, and hello!",

            "body": "Hello from me.  Your post points to many monumental issues about the role of unions, how political consciousness develops and the type of organisation necessary for workers to defend and advance their interests.    I'm assume you are familiar with some of the following but I will lay it out plainly.\n\nI think the basic questions I think you, and we all, are faced with are: \n\n1.  Is whether trade-unionism is an expression of bourgeois/capitalist consciousness in the working class?\n2.  Is the role of the trade unions to win the best wages and conditions WITHIN the capitalism?\n3. While class consciousness can arise spontaneously it will always be limited. \n\nThe following from What Is To Be Done? (Lenin, 1902) sums it up:\n\n>We have said that\u00a0*there could not have been*\u00a0Social-Democratic\\^ consciousness among the workers. It would have to be brought to them from without. **The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade-union consciousness, i.e., the conviction that it is necessary to combine in unions, fight the employers, and strive to compel the government to pass necessary labour legislation, etc.** The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical, and economic theories elaborated by educated representatives of the propertied classes, by intellectuals. By their social status, the founders of modern scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia. In the very same way, in Russia, the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose altogether independently of the spontaneous growth of the working-class movement; it arose as a natural and inevitable outcome of the development of thought among the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia.  \nQUOTED IN [Lenin\u2019s Theory of Socialist Consciousness: The Origins of Bolshevism and What Is To Be Done?](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/library/russian-revolution-unfinished-twentieth-century/08.html)\n\n\\^ before 1914 \"social democracy\" is what \"socialism\" was called.\n\n[Why are trade unions hostile to socialism?

Aristocracies are not permanent fixtures, especially not when they are within reach of the capitalists.  \n\nThe capitalist class has no confidence workers will continue to be quiet.  The use of censorship, repression, the attacks on democratic, legal and constitutional rights and the turn to dictatorship and even fascism is how the capital class are waging class war on workers to defend their interests from a population hostile to the fact that the weal created by the collective labour of the majority flows predominantly to a tiny minority who did nothing to earn it. \n\nBut the wealth of workers is not just withing a country.  The imperialist centres have been able to use wealth extracted from workers in the colonies and former colonies to raise wages at home.  Hyper exploitation abroad was needed for class peace at \"home\".   (This goes back a long way.  One reason Britain didn't have a revolution in 1848 was due to successfully extracting more from its empire, especially the plantations in the West Indies.)\n\nIn 1914, the trade-union backed social democratic parties of the Second International backed sending workers to fight, kill and die for \"their\" capitalist class because of a more advance version of the same.\n\n>Lenin had rooted the development of opportunism and the eruption of social chauvinism in 1914, within the Second International, in the social relations made possible by imperialism: the ability of the ruling class to buy the loyalty of privileged petty-bourgeois strata, including the labour aristocracy, which functioned as the principal social base of the Second International.   \n[Lessons of October: The political crisis within the Bolshevik Party on the eve of the seizure of power - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/11/03/lect-n03.html)\n\n2/2   \n  \nThere is much more to say but my reply is long enough already.

It has left me thinking about what lies beyond their apathy, and my answer would be... no, I don't think their conditions are secure, and I imagine they must care about if their kiddos will be poorer then them. My mind keeps asking, though, if they do care, why are they so... close-minded about a more meaningful strategy of organizing more workers to buffer them from the whims of the market instead of opting for overtly centralized campaigns of pulling more concessions from our single employer. Because again, we are well above what most workers have in our industry. \n\nNot sure if what I said was remotely thoughtful or not.",

This is a long answer but I think the following is warranted.\n\nI would offer a number of elements \n\n* The working class is an oppressed class.  Despite history showing numerous example of extraordinary courage and self sacrifice by workers, its ideas will be affected by the bourgeoisie until it can become conscious of them.  Workers only began to develop a conscious leadership in the 1840s and its first **coherent** political program was in 1848 with the Communist Manifesto (Marx & Engels). \n* a belief, engendered by a superficial understanding of events that has been reinforce by relentless propaganda, that the post-WWII boom showed capitalism could be regulated to overcome its crises.  \\[What is the popularity of \"MAGA\" but the fantasy America can \"go back\" to rising incomes and job security for workers?\\]\n* The betrayals of the workers movement by social democracy, the trade union leaderships and liberalism.  \n* The role and legacy of Stalinism is particularly important.  The great lie of Stalinism is that it was the logical and necessary continuity of Marx, Engels and Lenin. This lie is repeated by the Stalinists but also utopian socialists, anarchists, fake-Marxists, Stalinists, fake-Trotskyists, Maoists, leftists, the pseudo-left, conservatives, liberals, monarchists and everyone **EXCEPT the Trotskyists.**  The defence of capitalism has been \"the alternative is worse\".  If they were honest they would say \"I don't care how many socialists Stalin had killed in the Great Terror of 1936-1939, if Stalin is a socialist and a Marxist then we HAVE to believe him.\" \n* The effectiveness of the bourgeoisie in waging their side of the class war.  The capitalist class are a ruthless, cunning, vicious and determined enemy with 500 years of history. **SEE NEXT COMMENT**\n\n\\-\n\nThe political independence of the working is stressed in the writings of Marx and Engels and given a new organisation form by Lenin, democratic-centralism (complete freedom of discussion followed by unity of action, then repeat).  \n\nThe alternatives to this have all been tried and yet we have just witnessed an imperialist backed genocide and face world war, austerity and dictatorship.  An opposition must start with the most class conscious layers. The crisis of capitalism will begin to sort out the confusion, disorientation and naivete of the rest.",
