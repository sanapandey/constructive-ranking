It doesn\u2019t matter how much you organized, how much you read, how much you cared, try anything and a U.S backed coup awaits you. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in MENA, South America, or Africa. \n\nI\u2019m from Latin America and lived during the 2008 coup in Honduras and saw how at the end of the day it doesn\u2019t make any difference how educated you are if you dont have any sort of might (especially seeing many teachers, some of them family friends being captured by American backed police ). Unfortunately might does make right. \n\nI\u2019m not a seasoned Marxist I\u2019ve just started reading as much as I could but it doesn\u2019t matter how many ideas we come up with if they can\u2019t be safeguarded. North Korea had the right idea with WMDs. \n\nMonroe can only be nullified with might, realistically speaking good luck trying to mimic the US industrial output without interference, then perhaps nuclear weapons (unfortunately) might be the only way for the global south to BEGIN to liberate itself. Africa, MENA, and LATAM all need our own North Korea, otherwise you\u2019re just inviting US backed paramilitaries to massacre innocent proletariat ",

But I\u2019m curious to hear what more educated people in the thread say; nuclear proliferation is not something I know a lot about.",

            "body": "Nuclear weapons are probably one of the most horrific weapons ever created. No one power should have access to that kind of weaponry. That being said, do we trust the US to wield that power responsibly? Obviously not, so what do we do with this fact? \n\n\nI think the creation of nuclear weapons speaks to the massive ego of western culture American culture more specifically. The ability to destroy the entire world flatters the ego. It instills a kind of \u201cI can do whatever I want and you can\u2019t do anything about it\u201d attitude. We see that with how the US through around its weight geopolitically during the Cold War. \n\nBut it also highlights the contradiction. The ego cannot fathom its own annihilation. It will do anything I can to prevent its own demise. That is why to me the mad doctrine makes sense. The only way to protect yourself from a egomaniac like the United States is to threaten them in a way that\u2019s existential. To threaten them in the same ways they threaten others, and that\u2019s by making them look down the barrel of a missile silo and remind them that they, too, can die.",

And China industrial might... China does not want to start war and hope for peaceful decline of empire. But Russia could be an ally, the only problem Russia military is not designed to project power, it is defensive in nature.

So that could mean developing a rocket program as well, or a submarine program that could rival the US/UK and/or USSR and/or China or a bomber program that can get to the target.  Otherwise you are just kinda driving it up to the thing you hate and running away really really fast.  \n\n\\- Several nations (South Africa, Kazakhstan, Ukraine) gave up their weapons to avoid the costs above, to gain prestige on the world stage & to take a target off their own backs in the event that nukes did start flying - no one would have any reason to bomb them just for good measure/to be safe.  \n\nUnless you face an existential threat - more often than not from an immediate neighbor - there is more to lose than there is to gain by having a nuclear weapons program.  \n\nHowever once you have nuclear weapons the tables turn and you are now the existential threat that must be defended against.  US Developed them to beat Germany in WW2.  USSR was threatened by the US being the only nation with them.  England, France and Germany are all concerned Russia would like to own them.  India and Pakistan have their whole thing that escalated into dueling nuclear programs.  \n\nIn the early years after Israel became a nation (again) pretty much the whole of the Middle East went to war with them - four times - I don't know if its every been 100% confirmed that they have at least some, but I can see why they would have some as a last resort.",

Better for them to have a nuke then get turned into another Iraq or Libya one day.",
