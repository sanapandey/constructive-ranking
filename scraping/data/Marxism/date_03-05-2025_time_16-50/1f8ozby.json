    "selftext": "Abstract: This essay explores the relationship between globalization and the centralization of power, challenging the notion that today's interconnected world resembles a decentralized rhizome, as described by Deleuze and Guattari. While some theorists argue that globalization fosters a diffuse, networked form of power, this essay contends that the opposite is true: globalization has led to the concentration of power in the hands of a few entities.\n\nThrough examples such as multinational corporations, global financial institutions, and Big Tech, the essay demonstrates how economic, political, and technological power is increasingly centralized. It further discusses how interconnected financial markets and global supply chains create systemic risks, where the collapse of one node can trigger widespread failure. Ultimately, the essay argues that despite appearances of decentralization, power in the contemporary global system remains fundamentally hierarchical and concentrated.\n\nhttps://lastreviotheory.medium.com/unmasking-globalization-the-centralization-of-power-in-a-connected-world-586806ed7b44",

            "body": "capital is a flow within the rhizome. institutions that hold power hold power over the territorialization and deterretorialization of flows. it is true (within the sphere of argument that you have used in your article) that if one node falls, other nodes can connect to one another and \"patch\" the network because D&G are referring to a grand schema that is cannot critiqued by this cause and effect style of thinking. according to D&G, if institutions fail, the rhizome remains intact because that is the nature of the rhizome; it is so large and complex that it will always stay connected.\n\nim not saying that you're wrong or explaining and im not providing a political stance of mine, but i do think you are misreading D&G to some extent. maybe if you're reading 1000 plateaus as a marxist you should try to think of it more as a thought experiment rather than a direct contradiction to marxism. you'll find it isn't really something for marxism to \"disprove\" due to its nature being so different. they're not talking bourgeois vs proletariat. they're not talking about wage, labor, etc. they're using the rhizome in the context of post-capitalism. the post-capitalist does not exert power top-down. for D&G, capital and power moves in flows. i think in order to provide a critique of D&G, you need a more substantial argument.\n\nlike for starters D&G aren't discounting that power is at the hands of a few. fundamentally you are disputing philosophy with geopolitical analysis rather than disputing philosophy with philosophy as you should be doing\n\nthis is post-structuralist philosophy. maybe start with understanding foucault's reading of nietzsche to get into the post-structuralist realm of thought regarding power/capital.",
