            "body": "I also haven't read this book, but to me it seems clear that he is delineating his materialist viewpoint from [Hegel's idealistic one](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hegelianism). Roughly, Hegel rejected the idea that the universe was static and proposed a more dynamic view, where the movement was driven by conflicts in ideas. Marx \"turned this upon its head\" by suggesting that this change was driven by contradictions in the material world and that ideas only approximate this. \n\nMarx looks at history and the state as an example of this difference. Hegel believed that a 'Christian constitutional monarchy', like the one he lived in, was the highest form of government and that this state can most effectively hash out these ideological differences which drive historical change.  Marx disagrees since he thinks these government proceedings are ultimately caused by material differences, class conflict. As such, it gives the illusion of true conflict when the real conflict causing these proceedings usually happens outside the offices of government. \n\nI think the second quote can be similarly understood. Hegel's work includes his *Encyclopedia*, in which he develops a far-reaching system of metaphysics using his system, which essentially equates being to thinking. From a Hegelian standpoint, it's then reasonable to look inward for a solution when one's existence is undesirable. Again, Marx disagrees and argues that according to his materialist system, the most effective relief is to remove the real cause (the 'social relations') of this existence.",
