    "selftext": "If anyone has any book recommendations about the life and works of Thomas Sankara that\u2019d be greatly appreciated. I\u2019d prefer a text with a Marxist analysis of the man rather than just a history book, but if a dry text is the best route to go with I don\u2019t really mind. I\u2019m relatively new to Marxist literature (only read the manifesto, Capitalist Realism and Blackshirts and Reds) so I\u2019m curious to learn more about real revolutionaries and Sankara I find particularly fascinating.\n\nIf anyone knows of a documentary or other media that you feel would be essential to my understanding of Sankara then I\u2019d also appreciate dropping it below. \n\nThank you in advance.",
