    "selftext": "Hello Marxists!\n\nI am in the process of reading and, trying, to understand Marxist critique of capitalism. I should make clear that I have not yet started *Capital*, but am right now reading Isaak Rubin's *Essays on Marx's Theory of Value*. I just want to, in a way, vent my, up until now, understanding of abstract labor as a source for value and would love all of your inputs.\n\nSo far I understand that concrete labor becomes abstract labor at the point of exchange. Once we engage in exchange with money, we equalize all forms of concrete labors with one another since we also equalize all products of labor with one another. However, Rubin also points out that while value creates abstract labor in this sense, abstract labor also creates value precisely through the equalization of all products of labor. I think I've understood this but, as said before, I want input to this understanding. I've understood, more broadly, that Marx's LTV is not a theory that labor creates value, but rather that these two processes occur alongside each other and are dependent on each other as social processes: Abstract labor can only exist due to value, but value can only exist because of abstract labor. Rubin also clarifies that abstract labor is not a general category of labor, but rather a category that exists specifically within commodity-producing society.\n\nThanks for any and all inputs you can give!  \nAll the best",

I think especially his focus on the profoundly different implications of laboring to produce value (M\u2013C\u2013M\u2032) rather than the focus on producing use-value (as in ordinary commerce, C\u2013M\u2013C\u2032, or direct-production-consumption)  is vital.  However, we students can do no better than reading Marx himself. \n\n> So far I understand that concrete labor becomes abstract labor at the point of exchange. Once we engage in exchange with money\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since I read Rubin, so perhaps he does present value in this way, but I would disagree with this characterization (whether from you or Rubin). In a commodity producing social formation, abstract labor occurs in the process of production: before exchange takes place. But in a commodity producing society it is the profound transformation of production, when value and imminent commodity exchange is on the forefront of the mind of the producers, that transforms production in a seismic manner. \n\nIf i recall correctly, Rubin indeed insists on abstract labor as not general labor, but only existing within commodity producing social formations, but I read Marx, in ci trait, as instead locating the genesis of abstract labor in the division of labor (far more widespread than mere commodity producing social formations with their specific competition induced division of labor). My reading of Marx is that abstract labor does not take the form of value unless commodity producing has become routine. But the abstract labor exists qualitatively, even if it does not have a ready made quantitative measurement. The utopia socialist use of labor vouchers is an attempt to measure the magnitude of abstract labor when resources do not routinely take the form of commodities and circulate as commodities. \n\nSo while abstract labor and value form necessarily a dialectical unity within a commodity producing social formation, abstract labor can also exist without value in non-commodity producing social formations. Marx evokes the example of Robinson Crusoe as a lone individual who nevertheless divides his labor-time into different concrete laboring tasks that nevertheless all involve particular concrete expenditure of Crusoe\u2019s general _and_ abstract labor, though Crusoe\u2019s products never take the form of value. When Marx writes of higher phase communism, where resources need no longer circulate as commodities, he regards the chief task of the commercial resource production planner (commercial production as in production for consumption by a different entity than the producers: the opposite of direct-production-consumption) is to allocate different concrete labors, as the components of society\u2019s abstract labor, to the requisite tasks in order to fulfill the innate interdependent needs of production.",

                    "body": "Thanks for the response, it's very appreciated! And as you point out, Marx would be a far better source and as such, my theorizing of abstract labor is primarily based on Rubin's account of Marx, which can be a rocky road no matter whose account we rely on.\n\nRubin does mention that abstract labor can only happen when there is a social division of labor. But he writes, on the relationship between exchange and the production process as you bring up: \n\n*To the extent that* \\[Marx\\] *deals with exchange as a form of the production process, Marx clearly says that without exchange there is neither abstract labor nor value. Labor acquires the character of abstract labor only to the extent that exchange develops. When Marx speaks of exchange as a separate phase which stands in opposition to production, he says that even before the process of exchange, labor and the product of labor possess determined social characteristics but that these characteristics must be realized in the process oof exchange.* (150-151)\n\nWith that said, the example you provide is a similar exposition that Rubin gives. Basically that concrete labors producing use-values are congealed into abstract labor once exchange happens: we equalize products of labor with money which is equal to all products of labor. And when you speak of abstract labor existing in non-capitalist societies, I believe Rubin distinguishes between *socially equalized labor* and *abstract labor* and it seems, to Rubin, to be a fine line between the two. Rubin points out that: \"In a spontaneous commodity economy, \\[abstract labor\\] plays the role which socially equalized labor plays in a consciously organized socialist economy. Thus Marx constantly mentions that abstract labor is a 'social substance' and its magnitude a 'social magnitude'\" (152). \n\nHowever, and what I see in both Rubin and what you explain, there seems to be diffuse border between what Rubin explains as *socially equalized labor* and *abstract labor*. It seems to be, from my point of view which can be wrong, a situation of \"abstract labor is socially equalized labor (in capitalist society) but socially equalized labor is not abstract labor\" type of situation, because once Rubin invokes a \"consciously socialist economy\", abstract labor becomes socially equalized labor, but when he speaks of capitalist society, it becomes abstract labor. But again, I am extrapolating from Rubin and as you say, as students of Marx, we should study Marx.",

                            "body": "As I said, Rubin certainly made important contributions. He certainly shakes my understanding of the importance of producing for value rather then use. And a theorist can develop and expound on categories in any way they want. I just don\u2019t understand his motivations, as a theorist, in denying abstract labor in other modes of production and distribution. Or his repositioning abstract labor as a separate category: _socially equalized labor_. That just sounds like abstract labor to me. However, perhaps there\u2019s an insight I\u2019m missing only gleaned through such a differentiation. Whereas I treat abstract labor as arising from any division of labor production (slave, feudal, ancient, or communist) since it aids in understanding the delineation between necessary labor and surplus labor that takes place in all of thee modes production. \n\nEven more, I think the characterization of exchange alone giving value (and giving abstract labor, as well) to commodities is even counterproductive. This is already a widespread misconception that leads to confusion in, for example, what is called the \u201ctransformation problem\u201d, where the transformation is misunderstood as giving to commodities a different value magnitude than the congealed SNLT magnitude the commodities bears and is stamped with from production (or as redefining what the SNLT magnitude is). \n\nThe value remains constant, altering only through changes in the conditions of production (the productivity) of each batch of newly produced commodity specimens of that same commodity species. That means, when produced for exchange, resources are always already commodities bearing value of a given magnitude even before they get to market because the intent of the producers was always to bring them to market as values. If i recall correctly, that idea is prominent in Rubin\u2019s work. The value the commodity bears is merely realized in the sale of the commodity (in part or in whole): because  its cloaked hieroglyphic value magnitude becomes _realized_ in the unambiguous money value paid for it (since unlike the hieroglyphics of ordinary commodities, the money commodity shouts its value magnitude, from its face, wherever it goes).",

As we live under Capitalism we assume it mean exchange value. Lets check condition when no labor used in order to produce something. Futuristic society where everything produced by self replication machines. No human labor involved.\n\nWill there product had exchange value? No! No human labor was used, no one had to work. Everyone can have as much as they need.\n\nWe do have such machine for a critical commodity, Air. Nature is a self replicating machine which produce it in practically unlimited amount. So, Air is free. It is changing now, Capitalism building fences around it, create an artificial market and scarcity in form of Carbon credits, but for individual Air is still free.\n\nSo, one can see that machines do not produce value, only human labor does.",
