    "selftext": "Hey guys, if this post isn't allowed remove. I'm a NYC based marxist and work with multiple people for learning and organizing. One thing that gets tiring is the lack of moblization and constant talking online. If allowed I'd like to invite anyone in the tristate to discuss learn and organize together be it online only ot in person in the future. I would love to actively work in our communities be it basics like food drives or more intense work. Feel free to reach out to me if that is in your wheel house. ",
