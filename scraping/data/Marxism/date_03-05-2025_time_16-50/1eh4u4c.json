Therefore people see unions as bad and are against them. \n\nFrom what I understand unions are one of the best ways to give us workers rights and organize against the ruling class. \n\nAre these claims about unions being exclusive and white valid criticism? Or is this anti union propaganda just perpetuating its way into the public? Or has white supremacy tainted unions as well? I watched some prominent union leader give a speech at the republican presidential convention recently. Genuinely confused. ",

Remember MLK said that the poor white man had a lot more in common with the average black man than the rich white man.",

            "body": "I'm a rank-and-file teamster and a marxist. ive read plenty of critiques of unions from the left and ive gotten to experience union bureaucracy. at the moment, my local is fighting over a contract and asking for a strike vote, partially just as a scare tactic to get people to increase monthly dues to fund a strike fund next month and partially bc hiring shortages have left my local with funding problems. \n\nUnions have always been double-edged swords. There is no original untainted heroic unionism you can point back to. Unions are workers uniting over workplace struggles and producing new consciousness of their class position and the power they hold over society through those actions. This struggle both maintains and undermines capitalism. It maintains it by helping to make sure that workers' wages dont fall below subsistence levels and therefore more workers can be produced. It undermines it by producing in workers a consciousness that they have a kind of power over their bosses, which can develop into a comminist consciousness. When workers form these organizations whose job is to deliberate and get the best deal out of the system, they become invested in the system if they can get a good deal. This is what happened to the trade unions in the lead-up to WWI and WWII. This is sometimes referred to as \"golden handcuffs\". The more unions allowed themselves to be constrained by the benefits of the fordist era, the less they acted as organizations where the class struggle happened and the more they opporated like an insurance company for workers. In fact, a lot of unions advertise themselves to workers these days like insurance companies\u2014you'd rather have it and not have to use it. They've also become modestly lucrative pension funds. Why spend money on a strike that could get your local decertified when you can take the same money and ensure a decent retirement fund for your members?\n\nThe economic crisis of the 70s led into the dismantling of the fordist labor compromise and pushed a lot of unions into rearguard fights that they cannot win. It's culminated in more aggressive stances by the Teamsters and the UAW, which i am very directly seeing the results of. Ultimately, the only question worth asking as a communist is how these struggles effect the consciousness of the workers on the ground, not whether the leadership of the unions is good.",

            "body": "The way modern labor unions are organized is inherently anti-labor. Union boards often consist of executives appointed, not voted, into their positions through exterior processes. These people are often not working class and are among the same circles as the corporate business class.\n\nThey have had many of the rights and tools that make unions scary to employers made illegal through anti-labor legislation. Such as wildcat strikes, or even strikes in general. \n\nIn cases of arbitration or disputes, the union often  becomes relegated to a 3rd party to the employment process. Members are not consulted about contract negotiations or dues beyond a vote once everything has already been decided. Union leadership works closely with corporate leadership. \n\nAnd, finally, as Lenin points out in \"What is to be Done?\" Limiting the labor struggle to the unions is never going to achieve any lasting progress for the working class. Eventually, like we are seeing now, the bourgeosie will find ways to remove those reforms friendly to labor. and the Union struggle is one that occurs *within* the Capitalist system, and so, will be stuck in an endless cycle of regression > strike > reform > regression.\n\nThe other critiques you mentioned are certainly a real concern. We've seen many industries create a hierarchy where the older employees are union but the new hires are on contract and do not receive the same pay or benefits the older union members do. Employers use this sense of privilege to divide their labor force against each other and the older employees play along enthusiastically to their own detriment.",

And are used by the state to control labor at the expense of workers. Them being exclusively white is a red herring.",

The problem is they have long tied themselves to the Labour Party here and since the minors strikes the leadership has willfully allowed their powers to be curtailed while demobilising street protest to funnel it towards the labour party. Now there has been a formal split from labour but functionally they continue doing the same thing. They are hostile to actual Marxist organising or any independent organising that refuses to come under their umbrella and as such are one of the biggest barriers for building a movement in the UK.\n\nI'm regards to what they do as unions? It's massively limited to largely the public centre and the main unions have zero interest in unionising smaller workplaces which make up a big section of the economy here.\n\nThey're also very anti-Cuban and generally distance themselves from socialist projects. Hell they even supported the HK protests here which was just weird. They refuse to actively engage with the grassroots Palestine protests instead choosing to lead pro-Ukraine protests in the context that the UK already fully supports the Ukrainian state so it seems to be an excuse for more right wingers to march, even seen some fascist flags among them. Again very weird.",

            "body": "There are 14.3 million union members in the United States spread across two major coalitions (the AFL-CIO and the Strategic Organizing Center). Undoubtedly, some unions, some places, are racist and exclusive. Also undoubtedly, there are numerous organizations in the major cities near you with diverse memberships and leaderships, visionary and\u2014for lack of a better word\u2014progressive political programs, and accepting and cooperative cultures.  There\u2019s a lot to be said about American unions\u2019 internal problems, but ultimately, with exceptions, unions represent their workers. Most Teamsters are white males. Most white men vote for Trump. There isn\u2019t a significant communist polity exerting influence over these groups\u2014for the most part, even within the AFL-CIO and the SOC, they\u2019re completely on their own. That doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t locals of the Teamsters which are radical, cosmopolitan, and militant. There are.   \n\nUnions are imperfect political institutions. Ultimately, a union represents a group of workers, under given circumstances, joining up as one interlocutor with the bosses. American unions have a history of being poor on immigration, poor on solidarity with minority workers, etc., but they also have a history of violently battling police officers with illegally immigrated workers, burning busses to stand against apartheid, and today, fighting tooth and nail for Palestine. The most important thing that can be said about all unions for a Marxist is that no two unions are the same\u2014no two union *locals* are the same. Every other generalizing statement is made by populists: either to unfairly besmirch them, or to pump them up unnecessarily.",

            "body": "The diminished relevance of western labour unions can be seen in terms of the conditions of their power, rather than the results of their lack of power.\n\nUnions flourished and had greater solidarity when their technical repertoire of resistance to capital was more effective\u2014notably the strike. Since the era of globalisation got going, capital (influencing the state) has advanced greatly as far as: \n\n* using punitive contracts and agreements\n* dividing and stratifying workforces with more layers of management\n* suppressing workplace organisation and removing militants\n* breaking links between communities and workplaces (suburban planning)\n* changing law and policy to restrict and penalise strikes\n* making individual workers more replaceable (automation, induction programmes, knowledge management ...)\n\nThese factors along with the collapse of the USSR are what led to union power and density dropping off. There are now new industrial sectors without unions or in which production occurs overseas, and the former labour movement is reduced to a rump that continues more strongly in sectors where the character of production (for example its spatial conditions or its relation to the state) mean union action can still be effective: transport, logistics, construction, mining, police, education, health, etc.\n\nPerhaps there's little fundamentally wrong with unions beyond what they struggle to do: influence or threaten production and profit in order to win concessions from capital.",
