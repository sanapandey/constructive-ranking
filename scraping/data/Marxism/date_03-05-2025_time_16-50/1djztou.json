    "selftext": "*Everything that will be reported concerns an investigation of a rather personal nature, which certainly seeks to be theoretical, philosophical, political and economic...*\n\nI and the collective I'm in, thought it was very interesting to do a comparative study regarding what could be the co-research of tendencies but clearly in the stage of accumulation of today's capital. An interesting \"formula\" concerns the creation of \"tools\" built around the following tendency reproductions:\n\nPS. there is no cardinal order in the following list.\n\n1\\\\ Trend characteristics of the Italian \"communist left\" mainly between the 40's and 50's (Amadeo Bordiga highlighted).\n\n2\\\\ The critical-theoretical thought of Rosa Luxemburg.\n\n3\\\\ A certain integral Marxism that refers especially to Marx, not in a privileged way (everything evaluated, specifically capital v1,2 and the grundrisse).\n\n4\\\\ A theoretical take on J. Camatte.\n\n5\\\\ Insights from the post-structuralist and structuralist area (particular attention to Deleuze, Guattari, Foucault, Althusser and Lacan).\n\n6\\\\ Take a look at Open Marxism, like Paul Mattick.\n\n7\\\\ Situationism is fundamental, especially our dear Guy Debord.\n\n8\\\\ Consiliarism like that of Bookchin is very interesting.\n\n9\\\\ In general, the entire 70's to 2010's theoretical-political construction, which includes praxis and theoria, of the Italian Operaismo tendency (literally \"Wokerism\"). In a particular way, let's focus on the work of Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. The so-called \"Italian Theory\" is also important. In addition, as for \"Con-Ricerca\" (literally \"by-research\") there is Tronti's work, but not since 2000.\n\n10\\\\ M. Fisher can sometimes be helpful.\n\n11\\\\ The french concept of \"Communization\" can be of great help.\n\n12\\\\ It would be stupid to let neoliberals co-opt the analysis that derives from the risk of climate eco-collapse (and its worsening right now). Eological militancy is cool.\n\n13\\\\ Class intersectionalism is an integral part; The transfeminist, anti-colonialist, anti-racist, anti-neoextractivism etc struggle is profoundly antagonistic.\n\n14\\\\ A look at those of the work: \"Decompositions\".\n\n15\\\\ Lenin is Marxism 101, clearly present in the list.\n\n16\\\\ Mao's presence is fundamental even if it may seem out of place.\n\n17\\\\ Internationalism is not off the list either.\n\n18\\\\ Starting again from Kondratieff's economic analyzes on the waves, but also Schumpeter who obviously cannot exclude Juglar and Kitchin.\n\n19\\\\ Very important focus on Kohei Saito.\n\n20\\\\ In a rather critical way there would also be a need to verify some notions that derive from Egoism (Stirner).\n\n21\\\\ We can conclude the list with Judith Butler, which is a constituent piece.\n\nIn my opinion, this critical, materialist and communist development is a critical apparatus that should be very thorough, because this theoretical and certainly also practical network can be truly revolutionary in many terms. What do you think comrades?",

It is a book that talks about everything you need to know about lotta continua (one of the most important communist and opreaist movement in italy). not sure if you can find it translated tho",
