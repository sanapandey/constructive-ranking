    "selftext": "Mine is on merchant capital. Before ChatGPT, I had this idea that traders were unproductive but ChatGPT has made my understanding more nuanced. \n\nI used to see merchants as making their profits simply through markups. But I am now aware of how merchants also extract surplus value from their workers. \n\nChatGPT also opened my eyes to power imbalances among the capitalist class. Big merchants like Amazon are now getting a larger share of the surplus from farmers and industry. \n\nIt felt nice to learn this. ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Marxism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

The trick I've found is to give it as much context as I can and my own reasoning.\nAlso important is to ask it to talk about Marx rather than Marxism in general because it will start to lean towards social democracy.",

They aren\u2019t geared towards truth but just iteratively spitting out a new word as a probability function of the words which came before it. \n\nThey will routinely invent facts and misinformation. Especially when there is a great deal of misinformation in the training data. These LLMs are trained on the internet where misinformation about Marxism is rife. You\u2019d be much better off ignoring LLM\u2019s for theoretical study.",

Mostly so far I have only ever used chat gpt to help with statistical coding for my line of work.  Lmao.\n\n\"Using R, how do I perform a Kaplan meier survival analysis on a dataset that shows survival time and censorship status?\". Things like this are notoriously hard to Google.\n\nOne word of caution however is I have noticed that sometimes chat gpt will give different answers when the same prompt is inputted different times.",
