The continent as a whole has had massive amounts of wealth stolen from it and much of it has lived under extractive foreign rule for most of its modern history with dictators and repressive governments foisted on them by outside powers. That's not a recipe for long term stability and economic success. Many places in South America are still recovering from this process. Quote\n\nCan some here on left explain how countries like Brazil, Argentina, El Salvador and Venezuela got looted and much of the wealth stolen from it. Was Spain and Portugal extraction different than the British?\n\nHow did foreign rule see to it there was dictators and repressive governments?",

The Pope gave permission to kill as many natives as they wanted, unless they converted to Christianity, in which case he gave permission to enslave them. All of Central and South America and much of North America were simply colonies, there were no independent countries. The Mexican and Cuban wars of independence merely turned the existing ruling colonists into ruling dictators, and carved out separate countries from \"New Spain\".\n\nThe only difference from the British colonies was that Spain and Portugal only sent men. The men \"married\" native women, had children, and made it clear that the Spanish-Native caste were the only allowable rulers. Again, guns and tuberculosis.",

After the independence, this lead to a bunch of dictators appearing in America. \n\nNothing compared to the Portuguese colonisation in Brasil, Guinea, Mozambique and such. They established Portuguese cities in those countries. \n\nAnd obviously nothing compared to the british colonial empire.",

            "body": "Well the main difference was the Spanish were in the Americas much earlier and their practical purpose/ motivation was a bit different from the later English. \n\nFirstly the Spanish after laying claim to the continent(s) wanted first and for most to extract as much wealth from the Americas and take it back to the halls of Madrid. They toppled the Aztec Empire when they are in the midsts of a civil war and started extracting gold from their mines. Several decades later they would conquer the Inca empire and try to pull silver out of their mines. They tried to use the indigenous peoples as slave labor in these mines but that didn\u2019t work out for several reasons, so they imported African slaves from the Portuguese. None of this is unique to Spain but these circumstances led to all the generational wealth being stripped from these American bound empires and transported to Spain. They did this so quickly that they started loosing wealth after the mines ran dry. \n\nBut the Spanish sent mostly soldiers with very little women and children. So a lot of mixing started and eventually the pope declared that natives could be civilized. This led to a racial hierarchy and eventually the continued exploitation of the Spanish colonies. \n\nNow if we look at French American colonies it\u2019s a bit different. France was sending traders in a relatively small number with soldiers to control trade and bring prestige to the French monarchy. France at this point had very strict rules on which subjects could move to their colonies and in average had a much more productive relationship with indigenous peoples in their colonies. This was because the French were almost always outnumbered by not just natives but other rival Europeans. \n\nThe French were motivated by trade and the Spanish by God / wealth of destroyed empires. The French were just a tad more sustainable. (Not without criticism, all colonialism bad). \n\nBut the real fundamental difference is British colonialism / American imperialism. \n\nEnglish colonel ambitions weren\u2019t really military adventure like with the Spanish or trading opportunists for the French. The English sent people to make claims for the English crown that planned to build a life for themselves in the new world. These people were motivated by their anti-English law religion and viewed themselves as being given a mandate to rule the new world. This was fundamentally different as the goal and purpose of these colonies went much further beyond extracting wealth to make London rich. The English crown wanted self sufficient colonies capable of paying legitimate taxes and contributing manpower and armies to European wars. The English colonist for their part wanted more freedom, less oversight but most importantly\u2026.. to make their colony just like England. At the expense of natives that would eventually be folded into social classes with the Spanish or begrudgingly cooperates with by the French. That would show why the genocide of the indigenous was most pronounced in the former English colonies of North America and through the institutions of Canada and the United States, when their fate was much different in Colombia, Peru and Mexico. \n\nSo here\u2019s how the Spanish ran their colonies.\n- send soldiers, build / occupy mines - send gold back to Madrid. Send supplies back to the most profitable. Eventually stop using native slaves and eventually stop using mines all together. Soldiers are loyal to God and the Spanish crown, some will mingle with natives and stay but most will be rotated out. \n\nHere\u2019s the French\n- send small number of self sufficient traders to trade European goods with natives and build a few forts to protect this trade. The French traders and soldiers may mingle with natives but most will be rotated back to France eventually. Ally with native tribes as we are outnumbered \n\nHere\u2019s the English / British / American \n- send religious fanatics and their families, send people that this empire doesn\u2019t want and will never see again. Send tons of people with the promise of a new life in the colonies. Let them / help them build large cities and towns, keep them self sufficient and productive so they can help us fight / pay us taxes. \n\nAll European colonialism (even Dutch / Portuguese and French) was exploitive and to feed their European bound empires. Just that process and what it meant for that specific empire varied. In terms of severity, Spanish colonialism started out as forced labour of the indigenous in mines across Peru and Mexico. It was bad, the raw resources taken from the ground and shipped to Madrid in treasure fleets with very little being shipped back into colonial infrastructure let to centuries of mismanagement, corruption and travesties that are still felt today.",

Now a days 1 canadian company extracts more gold per year than spain did in 400 years. And that\u2019s just one of many canadian companies working here doing mining.\n\n\nAlso\u2026 english colonization included replacing and exterminating, spanish colonization was philosophically motivated by the expansion of culture and genes, so in those 400 years in mexico we mixed like bunnies. Its a \u201cnew\u201d race called mestizos.\n\nThis may not be the answer you look for but it can give you some context.\n\nRight now the problems in southamerican countries is a combination of corruption and bad use of resources. \n\nId say that USA\u2019s actions with their coup d\u2019etats, wars and interventions is a more significant factor of why things are how they are now a days. \n\nSpanish left their genes, religion, culture and they took gold and plants / vegetables / crops / animals. Of course im not saying this was peaceful but it is something that happened long ago and think the source of the problems is more related to the years 50s until 2020s.\n\nFor mexico specifically it was mostly affectes by the american mexican war which I know is told different on US and on Mexico. We were forced to sell territory in ~1850s \n\nThe number of operations and strategies applied by usa on latinamerican countries is crazy. \n\nPanama, costa rica, mexico, argentina, chile, venezuela, colombia. All central america with the banana republic. Its horrible but if we are recovering from something its from this.",
