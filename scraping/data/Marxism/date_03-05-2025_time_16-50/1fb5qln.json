    "selftext": "Amazon is quite a ruthless and exploitive company. It's is much closer to how Marx explains capitalism as being about \"ruthless exploitation\" than it is about Adam Smith's description of producers working in their self-interest creating an \"invisible hand\" of the market. The original name of Amazon was \"Relentless\" and Bezos was certainly an ambitious and curious reader. He may have found Marx's work in his youth.   \n  \nIf Bezos got some of his ideas from Marx's works then it shows a lot of irony. The reading material that is supposed to held educate the proletariat has been used to further exploit them.  ",

But does it matter?\n\n\nIn fact plenty of capitalists do understand quite a few concepts and important parts of Marx's work because it's in their interest to know how capitalism operates, not to dismantle it like the proletariat but to further their own goals. \n\n\nCapital's analysis of capitalism can be read and understood by anyone, but it won't change their class interest. Any member fo the  bourgeoisie that reads it would have to become a class traitor, and while some number actually do, the vast majority do not.\n\n\n\nSo regardless if he read it or not it doesn't really matter. He still understands how to further his own class interests. That's class consciousness, it's why the workers should read Marx's work, to understand how to further their own class interests against those of the capitalist class.",

Women are discouraged from taking up an interest in politics for example. I'm suspicious that the ruling class absolutely knows Marxism very well and they use this knowledge to stop the working class from rising up. The other theory is that the working class is being tested and taught lessons like a giant open world school.",

It's not about ideas it's about the material conditions. In the old days it would have been large factories where they literally brought thousands of workers together in one place. This makes it easier for the workers to organize against the capitalists. But nowadays it's social media that is exploiting billions of people but it is also bringing those billions of people together. The capitalist class can't exist without the working class and by its very nature also exploits the working class. And by exploiting the working class they are creating the conditions for the workers becoming alienated from the fruits of their labor. This is the main contradiction which says that the working class will eventually rise up to finally obtain all of the fruits of their labor.",

They know on some level they are being exploited and they get angry when someone behaves like bourgeoisie around them yet they get equally angry when someone tries to explain how the economic system works to them. Sometimes people that read enough to develop an understanding of capitalism go on to become capitalists but the system certainly doesn't make this easy.",
