How does he define \"social fascists\"?\n* What does Togliatti say about the Comintern's statement of 1 April 1933 that\n\n> \u201cThe establishment of an open Fascist dictatorship, which destroys all democratic illusions among the masses, and frees them from the influence of the social-democrats, will hasten Germany's progress towards the proletarian revolution.\u201d\n\nThe statement also, according to E.H. Carr, praised the policies of the KPD \"before and at the time of the Hitler coup\" as \"quite correct\", and summoned the party \"to prepare the masses for decisive revolutionary battles, for the overthrow of capitalism and for the overthrow of the Fascist dictatorship by an armed rebellion\"\n\nsee p.90 [**Twilight of the Comintern, 1930-1935 (**Carr, 1982) : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/twilightofcomint00carr)",

Part of the appeal, for me, was that he shies away from repeating big Comintern slogans, and focuses on the specifics of the Italian experience. While mentioning the German experience in passing, he doesn't draw conclusions or use it as a basis for understanding fascism writ large. \n\nPart of what is useful about this is that his examination of the Socialist Party felt much more pertinent in my own context (Canada), where the NDP is electorally significant and significant within the \"official\" labour movement, but has not held power. I think, often, any analysis of German fascism is coloured by the experience of the Weimar Republic and the role of the SPD in crushing the German revolution. Not that we should ignore the significance of that, but it isn't by any means a universally applicable starting point.\n\nAs for Carr's take, I haven't read him, so forgive me if I misunderstand. That said it seems to me that Togliatti argues, to the contrary, that the PCI should work in the fascist trade unions, in the cultural institutions and student groups, and work to bring to the fore the class tensions that fascism falsely claimed to resolve, and that the party should support demands for bourgeois rights where such demands undercut fascism (e.g. demands for democratic factory committees). Looking retrospectively, while the PCI ultimately did organize a significant armed resistance to fascism, I think that the relative strength and popularity of the PCI following the war can in part be attributed to the insight that fascist totalitarianism isn't actually capable of incorporating the working class in the way it claims to, and emphasizing the necessity of maintaining relationships between the party and the working class.\n\nNot that I'm particularly cheerleading for the politics of the PCI, of course, but broken clocks, y'know?",

A clear assessment of why is urgently needed.  I recommend the following as the place to start.\n\n>In all countries the same historic laws operate, the laws of capitalist decline. If the means of production remain in the hands of a small number of capitalists, there is no way out for society. It is condemned to go from crisis to crisis, from need to misery, from bad to worse. In the various countries the decrepitude and disintegration of capitalism are expressed in diverse forms and at unequal rhythms. But the basic features of the process are the same everywhere.\u00a0*The bourgeoisie is leading its society to complete bankruptcy*. It is capable of assuring the people neither bread nor peace.\u00a0*This is precisely why it cannot any longer tolerate the democratic order*. It is forced to smash the workers by the use of physical violence. The discontent of the workers and peasants, however, cannot be brought to an end by the police alone. Moreover, it is often impossible to make the army march against the people. It begins by disintegrating and ends with the passage of a large section of the soldiers over to the people\u2019s side. That is why finance capital is obliged to create special armed bands, trained to fight the workers just as certain breeds of dog are trained to hunt game. **The historic function of Fascism is to smash the working class, destroy its organizations, and stifle political liberties when the capitalists find themselves unable to govern and dominate with the help of democratic machinery.**    \n  \n**\\[emphasis added\\]**  \n[Leon Trotsky: Whither France?

Or on allying with fascist Japan in an enlarged war bringing the u.s. empire into the conflict. Or the Nazi policy of rigidly dismantling all the conservative lay organizations of the Catholic Church (nonpolitical Catholic women who tried to secretly keep meeting ended up in prisons and concentration camps). And so on.\n\nWhy does business have \"fax orders\" or \"dictate Nazi policy\" for them the Germany bourgeoisie to realise Hitler served their interests?

The evidence cannot be dodged. **Nothing suggests that the leaders of German big business were filled with ideological fervour for National Socialism, before or after National Socialism. Nor did Hitler ask Krupp & Co. to sign up to an agenda of violent anti-Semitism or a war of conquest.... But what Hitler and his government did promise was an end to parliamentary democracy and the destruction of the German left, and for this most of German big business was willing to make a substantial down-payment.\u201d  emphasis added.  \\[emphasis added\\]**\n\n>Following the disastrous \u201csocial fascism\u201d policy imposed on the German Communist Party by the Stalinist International, the German working class was divided and robbed of the opportunity of conducting its own struggle against the fascists. In April 1933, Hitler was able to make good on his promises to German big business leaders. The offices of the social democrats, Communists and trade unions were ransacked by Nazi stormtroopers and thousands of leftists consigned to the NS concentration camps.\n\n>The leading German business figures watched this process with approval and in the knowledge that the \u201cdestruction of the German left\u201d opened up unprecedented opportunities for increased profits based on a huge intensification of the exploitation of labour. This was to find its finished form in the massive use of forced labour to realise the military ambitions of the Third Reich.  \n...  \n  \n[Hitler\u2019s \u201cintelligible response\u201d to the contradictions of global capitalism - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/02/book-f08.html)\n\n\\--\n\nGermany big business clearly would rather have not had Hitler since in the July 1932 Reichstag election when the Nazis won 37% of the vote and, for the first time, had a higher vote than the SPD+KPD combined, Hindenburg refused Hitler's demand to be made chancellor.\n\nBut in the November 1932 election the NSDAP vote fell by 2 million to 32 % while the SPD+KPD rose to 37%.  Two months later Hitler was made Chancellor, a terror was unleashed and the leaders of the SPD and KPD did nothing to oppose it. \n\nThe trade union leaders were even worse.
