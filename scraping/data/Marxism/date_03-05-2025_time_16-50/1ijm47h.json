As I\u2019m sure most folks who started out would have described themselves as \u201cLiberal\u201d at one point or another and it was only through -Finding- education on the virtues of Leftist thought that they went further left. \n\nGiven the sudden shift of political climate pulling out the Working Class from the Liberal Donor Class appears to a more doable action on part of Leftist groups right now - in the face of open Fascisim and the anger at the Donor Class of the Democratic Party appearing to be doing very little nothing to push back against Trump. \n\n",

I'm not sure the answer tbh, but I think that's the correct question.\n\n If I were to speculate I would say yes because the conditions are sharpening and it's pretty obvious to most people with eyes and brain cells that the Dems aren't interested in fighting, but I don't have anything to scientifically back that up, just an educated guess.",

That's not to say my personal experience is reflective of the generation as a whole, but I will point out that political polarization and the state of the country has pushed many young people to either end of the political spectrum",

As Phil Ochs sang- always wanting to be patted on the back and reassured.  What a pain.\n\nBut \"the final crisis\" predicted in The International has taken a long time arriving.  The gradations within the bourgeoisie have gotten more complex. Not all of them are rent seeking exploiters. Many members of the working class are now stockholders.\nThe strength of a super-rich reactionary elite grows. Expect increased use of the law and police against the working class movement's ability to organize and make its voice heard. We may be on the verge of a detour into authoritarianism or full-blown  fascism.\n\nProgressive forces need to recruit all the allies they can find to carry the struggle forward. As happened in the 1930's under the Popular Front, it's time for the working class movement to enter a coalition of the willing to defend democracy, human rights, human decency, and the hope for real progress for a future of freedom and justice.",

He was a Republican, pretty conservative, also served as a hatchetman for American imperialism in like a thousand places as a Marine. Oh yeah, and he was a cop too lol.\n\nBut, when they asked him, hey Smedley, wanna do a fascism with us?, he said \u201cnope\u201d and exposed their asses. He also became very reflective about his own role in participating in the \u201crape\u201d of other countries later in life and became a vocal critic of American imperialism.\n\nPeople are complex, I guess is my point, and shouldn\u2019t simply be written off as a lost cause, there should almost always be a path for rehabilitation imo",

He addresses so much of the economy that's not talked about, but you'd have to listen to him for hours to understand  how much of his foundation is based on Marxist economics.  Likewise for inequality.  So many people are against extreme wealth inequality but are so unclear on what could actually address it.",

A lot of liberal voters were willing to back Sanders in the hopes of reform and social services, but as soon as they're given a cut-cloth liberal (Biden), they'll go back and toe the line.  Liberals will never turn socialist out of principle in any large numbers.  They'll need to have the worst of the system thrown right in their faces and have to feel its consequences in a direct way for the lesson to really take.",

Now is the time to present Marxism as the only valid way forward to these people, as the organized direction to face the problems we have head on, and don't hold your breath for liberals still married to electoral politics & \"respectable institutions\"; many of them will be the last to know that there's a revolution on.",

But I think things could shift quickly depending on what happens politically.\n\nThe tenor of things seems to be doubling down on the failed tactics they've used historically such as finger wagging, culture warring, and overwrought Resistance-era scrutiny every time Trump/Musk/etc. do anything. The main message I've seen is \"we told you so.\" This is different from 2016, when it seemed that people were so stunned, they couldn't help but question things. Part of what hurts is that the Trump camp is really leaning into cartoonish culture war stuff. If one side is doing Nazi salutes, it makes it easier to see them as the bad guys and the Center-Left as the good guys. \n\nSome of this depends on how you define things. If you're talking about the average working person, recall that 90 million eligible voters did not vote, and many people who voted Republican or Democrat are not deeply committed to their parties. Those are the people we should target.  \n  \nBy the way, I know plenty of Marxists who had Reaganite parents and identified as right-of-center in their early lives. And lots of people who started as Democrats think radicalism means taking Liberalism and dialing it up to 10000%. Their default will always be to double-down on the Dems when the going gets tough.
