[We've only written critically about Assad](https://kritikpunkt.com/2024/12/08/1-kurdinnen-und-syrien-vor-der-revolution/) and analysed the internal contradictions of Assad's Syria - we're just not fans of the new jihadist-led transitional government in Syria either - because, you know, they're jihadists.   \nIsrael is not \"Jewish\", Israel is a state that houses less than half of the world's Jewish population.   \nMaybe you should actually look at what we publish, reading [this](https://kritikpunkt.com/2024/06/25/israel-bezogener-antisemitismus-und-die-staatsraeson/) and [this](https://kritikpunkt.com/2024/03/28/positiver-antisemitismus/) would help.   \nWhat is a \"neo-orthodox Marxist\"? Weirdos we may be, who isn't, Marxists, sure, but \"neo-orthodox\"?   \nI won't try to argue with you, as I've spent far too much time arguing with anti-Germans, but we are no fans of the genocide in Gaza, nor are many Jewish people.",
