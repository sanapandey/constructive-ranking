    "selftext": "(This is just some context; feel free to skip to the next paragraph): I recently came across the NPM (New Public Management) reforms that were making their rounds globally during the neoliberal upswing in the 80s. I'm still very new to socialist politics and theory, and I've been surrounded by people blaming government regulations and the public sector in my country (Norway) for inflation, rising prices and stagnant wages, and struggle for the past decades. When I began reading more about our history, it surprised me to learn how the labor party (currently in government) has been spearheading liberal and free market reforms steadily since the 80s, implementing the NPM model in areas of society such as healthcare. There hasn't been a total uprooting of the welfare state, obviously, but Norway and the labor party are very different today from what they used to be.\n\nDoes any of you have any reading suggestions on NPM from a Marxist/socialist perspective? Books, articles, videos, anything is fine. If you have any thoughts on the subject as well, I'd be very interested in hearing about it.",

            "body": "A good marxist analysis won't really give you good policy proposals to implement from the top down. That's not what Marx was ever trying to do. Instead it would describe the process by which certain policies become a necessity and the background laws of the economy exerting and re-exerting themselves around whatever regulatory bodies attempt to reign them in. \n\nI'm not aware of any specific analyses on NPM. I would recommend Paul Mattick's Marx and Keynes as a good analysis that compares the economic worldview of the Scandinavian schools of thought with what Marx actually thought.",
