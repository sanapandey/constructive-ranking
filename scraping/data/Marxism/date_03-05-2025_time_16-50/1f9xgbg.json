Do you think capitalism, the basic principle on which the economy is organised, responsible for this at all?\n\nat 20:39 you say \"I would argue Marx was wrong about a lot.  He made a lot of predictions. He said capitalism sewed its own seeds of destruction. He said capitalism will fail.\"  \nBut what did Marx say about the breakdown of capitalism.\n\n>\"Hence the highest development of productive power together with the greatest expansion of existing wealth will coincide with depreciation of capital, degradation of the labourer, and a most straitened exhaustion of his vital powers. These contradictions lead to explosions, cataclysms, crises, in which by momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital the latter is violently reduced to the point where it can go on. These contradictions, of course, lead to explosions, crises, in which momentary suspension of all labour and annihilation of a great part of the capital violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled \\[to go on\\] fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide.

Has he read any Marx?  Your guest is advocating reformism through the capitalist state and capitalist parliament and denying Marx insisted on revolution.  \nLenin famously once said:\n\n>\u201cBourgeois democracy, although a great historical advance in comparison with medievalism, always remains, and under capitalism is bound to remain, restricted, truncated, false and hypocritical, a paradise for the rich and a snare and deception for the exploited and the poor\u201d  \n(V.I.

In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2013 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2013 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.\"\n\n>[Economic Manuscripts: Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (marxists.org)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm)\n\nA PREDICTION BY MARX\n\n=\n\n>\"... The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his, real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\"\n\n>The Communist Manifesto [Bourgeois and Proletarians (wsws.org)](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/library/the-communist-manifesto-karl-marx-friedrich-engels-1848/01.html)\n\nMARX ON REFORMISM IN 1850\n\n=\n\n>... We have seen how the next upsurge will bring the democrats to power and how they will be forced to propose more or less socialistic measures. it will be asked what measures the workers are to propose in reply. At the beginning, of course, the workers cannot propose any directly communist measures. But the following courses of action are possible:  \n>  \n> 1. They can force the democrats to make inroads into as many areas of the existing social order as possible, so as to disturb its regular functioning and so that the petty-bourgeois democrats compromise themselves; furthermore, the workers can force the concentration of as many productive forces as possible \u2013 means of transport, factories, railways, etc. \u2013 in the hands of the state.  \n>\u00a0  \n> 2. They must drive the proposals of the democrats to their logical extreme (the democrats will in any case act in a reformist and not a revolutionary manner) and transform these proposals into direct attacks on private property. If, for instance, the petty bourgeoisie propose the purchase of the railways and factories, the workers must demand that these railways and factories simply be confiscated by the state without compensation as the property of reactionaries. If the democrats propose a proportional tax, then the workers must demand a progressive tax; if the democrats themselves propose a moderate progressive tax, then the workers must insist on a tax whose rates rise so steeply that big capital is ruined by it; if the democrats demand the regulation of the state debt, then the workers must demand national bankruptcy. The demands of the workers will thus have to be adjusted according to the measures and concessions of the democrats.\n\n>[Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League by Marx and Engels (marxists.org)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)",
