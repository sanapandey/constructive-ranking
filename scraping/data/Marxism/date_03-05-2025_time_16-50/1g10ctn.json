    "selftext": "I was in a twitter debate recently about cuts to the police force on the topic of \"Are police workers?\". It's always very controversial but I argued that police do have socially useful functions and that policing is a vital public service much like fire or ambulance. I also argued that they don't get the support and resources they need and many other vital services that would have reduced their workload have been cut.\n\nI gave some examples of the cuts to the U.K. met police (https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/04/police-watchdog-reforms-chief-inspector-constabulary) and said that this would actually make many of the resulting problems of structural violence worse.  \nMy actual tweet said:\n\n\"Police are working class people unlike landlords. The \"abolition of the police\" is a convert campaign of austerity/neglect by the upper classes and actually makes structural violence much worse.\"\n\nThe response I received was:\n\n\"Over a decade into Tory rule in UK, sacking many 1000s of public servants, pillaging water authorities, defunding -all- the functions of State, and you say 'Marx's finger prints are anywhere \\[sic\\]'? You've topped silly, now you're absurd and a waste of time. C ya.\"\n\nI replied with\n\n\"Yes, Karl Marx did say \"the state will wither away.\" This concept is a central tenet of Marxist theory, particularly in relation to the transition from capitalism to communism.\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering\\_away\\_of\\_the\\_state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withering_away_of_the_state)\n\nIt seems that austerity is about \"shrinking the state\":\n\nThe **United Kingdom government austerity programme** was a [fiscal policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy) that was adopted for a period in the early 21st century following the era of the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession). Coalition and Conservative governments in office from 2010 to 2019 used the term, and it was applied again by many observers to describe [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_party_(UK)) policies from 2021 to 2024, during the [cost of living crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%93present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis). With the exception of the [Truss ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss_ministry), the governments in power over the second period did not formally re-adopt the term. The two austerity periods are separated by increased spending during the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom). The first period was one of the most extensive deficit reduction programmes seen in any advanced economy since the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War), with emphasis placed on **shrinking the state**, rather than consolidating fiscally as was more common elsewhere in Europe.[^(\\[2\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_government_austerity_programme#cite_note-:2-2)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\_Kingdom\\_government\\_austerity\\_programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_government_austerity_programme)\n\nSo why are conservative governments trying to \"shrink\" the state when according to Marx and Engels this a precondition to establishing communism?",

They are \u201cclass traitors\u201d, yes their relation to production is one of selling labour, however, they are selling labour to specifically oppress the proletariat and protect the interests of the bourgeois class explicitly. We think that we can police our own communities, or create the material conditions that lessen the causes of \u201ccrime\u201d. \n\nMarx says that the state withers away after the dictatorship of the proletariat is in place. The idea is that class based society is what gives rise to the state as means to oppress other classes. So when class becomes abolished so does the state. In capitalism you inherently have class society and even when they lessen \u201cgovernment functions\u201d or \u201cshrink the state\u201d they are not making the state weaker in anyway, if anything they are reenforcing the power of the bourgeois class. The reforms fought for by the working class are cut away and the power of the police, the army, the mechanisms of oppression are still in place or made stronger. Very quick rundown there are a lot of resources you can check out.",

A society where everyone has enough to survive should (in theory) bring crime rates way down, so you don't need anywhere near as big as a police force as we have today, and if the entire world is post-capitalist, you don't need as big a military to defend against capitalist states. So given enough time and enough development, all of the state functions we think of as necessary today would gradually become less and less so as a socialist society developed. The level of development where you don't need a state at all is \"communism\" - a stateless, classless, moneyless society.",

            "body": "When Marx writes of the State, he is using the term in a very specific technical sense: as the instrument for the ruling class to subjugate, suppress, repress, and oppress other classes. \n\nMarx considers the bureaucracy (state agents untethered from rule of law), standing armies, and especially the police the State machinery that must he smashed (evoking the Luddites who smashed literal machinery in their class struggle against the ruling class). This is separate from what Marx calls in his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ \u201csocial functions [that] remain in existence [within communism] that are analogous to present state functions\u201d. In a letter, Engels proposed the moniker \u201csocialty\u201d to designate this governmental form. Engels prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Karl Kautsky would eventually call it \u201ccommunist Commonwealth\u201d.  The communist Commonwealth, stewards, administers, and acts as the proprietor of the common wealth and other common concerns of the polis (the People generally). The State machinery is entirely smashed. (The State is smashed, in Marx\u2019s language; Engels descriptor of the State withering away refers to the more colloquial use of the term \u2018State\u2019 which Lenin also underscores.)\n\n* direct rule of law or dutiful public servants administer the law, subduing their personal inclinations\n* the standing armies and police are replaced by the universal service Militia and mutual security and proportional defense aid. \n* the \u201cservice\u201d you conceive for the current police might be fulfilled by something like the US Marshall Service, as it was originally conceived, or a genuine investigation service: both serving on the front lines implementing the will of the judiciary, grand juries, and petit juries (not their own sadistic whims with no accountability and broad largely unqualified immunity)\n\nWith that in mind, \u201cconservatives\u201d (really fascists who appropriate the term conservative as a fascist grift) seek to expand the power of the State machinery and to shrink the proper functions of the Commonwealth: shrinking them enough to drown them in a bathtub as they like to say, so that only a token administration of common wealth remains to justify the brutal State machinery they wield as and for the ruling class. \n\nIn opposition, communists seek to eliminate the State (as in the State machinery) and to raise the common wealth proprietorship of the Commonwealth to its necessary level. As Marx writes in his [_Critique of the Gotha Programme_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm):\n\n> Before this [net value] is divided among the individuals, there has to be deducted again, from it: First, the general costs of administration not belonging to production. This part will, from the outset, be very considerably restricted in comparison with present-day society, and it diminishes in proportion as the new society develops. Second, that which is intended for the common satisfaction of needs, such as schools, health services, etc. From the outset, this part grows considerably in comparison with present-day society, and it grows in proportion as the new society develops. Third, funds for those unable to work, etc., in short, for what is included under so-called official poor relief today.\n\nThe first part he is talking about that State machinery. The second and third parts, Marx is talking about the commonwealth functions (the second part growing and the third part based on news).",

In many analyses of the role of police the following example applies \n\n*\\[H\\]owever complex or simplified and part of whatever intellectual faction, the use of force and the police is seen as one of the central mechanisms by which states maintain their domination over society and protect the interests of specific classes and fractions in the short or long run.*^((1))\n\nThe police are an organ of internal state repression, as the armed forces are organs of state protection. The type of state is immaterial to the functions of these organs. Thus, though the lower ranks of the police and armed forces are drawn from the working classes, they are empowered by the state to have dominion over members of all classes of society, except for the ruling government.\n\nAs to \"conservative\" capitalist and mercantilist governments removing funding for state operations and organs, \"conervatives\" have always preached that, since in their view taxes are theft, government is by necessity to be as small as possible, without endangering the privileged classes. This has nothing to do with the concept of the withering of the state; it is a retraction of tax funded services in an existing capitalist state.\n\n*Notes:*\n\n(1) Marenin, Otwin: \"Police Performance and State Rule: Control and Autonomy in the Exercise of Coercion\", *Comparative Politics* October 1985, p. 103.",
