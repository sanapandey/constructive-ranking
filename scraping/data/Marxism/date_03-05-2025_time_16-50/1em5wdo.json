Should people organize around national lines or not? Is it an instrument of the Bourgeoisie/State or a way to unite workers? .. \nI greatly appreciate any recommendation and advice! ",

We cannot take from them what they have not got.\" Basically meaning that because the ruling class holds political power, they therefore get to decide the nation's foreign policy, not the populace. Marx then continues further.\n\n\"In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\" Marx therefore believed that the same capitalist class who exploited the workers in their own country also exploited other nations, and this was therefore what led to warfare. If there was no exploitative class then there would be no more conflicts between nations and world peace would be achieved.\n\nMarx never actually used the phrase *Imperialism*, it was added to Marxist theory later on by writers like Hobson, Kautsky, and then eventually Lenin, they believed that capitalism was what led to the creation of large colonial empires.\n\n*Imperialist* powers, ie, Empires, were interested in increasing their capital,  once the Capitalist economy was set up, these nations then had an advantage over less developed and less powerful nations, they they then competed for international trade and and for colonial territory.\n\nAs Lenin said \"Imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism. Such as definition would include what is most important for on the one hand, finance capital is the bank capital of a few big monopoloist banks, merged with the capital of the monopolist combines of manufacturers; and on the other hand, the division of the world is the transition from a colonial policy whicb has extended without hindrance to territories unoccupied by any capitalist power, to a colonial policy of monopolistic possession of the territory of the world which has been completely divided up.\"\n\nEven when decolonization occured, Soviet and Communist propaganda continued to depict former colonial powers as Imperialist. An African Socialist named Kwame Nkrumah developed his ideas in *Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism*.",

            "body": "I am not necessarily the greatest when it comes to post-modernism, or even \"Neo-Marxism\" (except for maybe Gramsci and linguistics, for which you can read the more obscure prison notebooks, but also Peter ives and Carlucci's works), however the national question is a interesting one. For this you can read some of Lenin's essays regarding the national question, Or Stalin's work, 'Marxism and the national question', or even Luxembourgs one (which is quite well known). To understand the whole discourse, read some of Vladimir Medem's works (he heavily derives his analysis from Austro-Marxists like Otto Bauer and Karl Renner (who ironically would disagree with Medem, since to them \"cultural national\" autonomy, could not be applied to non-existent national, or quasi national structures, like those of the Jews, this is what Otto Bauer argues in the \"question of nationalities and social democracy\"). Regardless, Medem himself is not very well read (since, there is a lack of available writings, and most of his works are untranslated from Yiddish, meaning someone would need a person to actual translate his works, otherwise you can rely on the more imprecise google translate.)\n\nHere are some works of Medem, I would recommend \n\n1) Medem, Vladimir, 'Fun bayn leben'\n\n2) Medem, Vladimir, 'Di natsyonale frage un di sotsyal-demok\u0323rat\u0323ye'\n\n3) A summarized version of Medem's \"cultural national autonomy\", given by Roni-Getchmen [https://www.marxists.org/subject/jewish/medem-nat-question.pdf](https://www.marxists.org/subject/jewish/medem-nat-question.pdf) its barely 24 pages, nonetheless it covers some crucial aspects of \"cultural national autonomy\n\nYou can also read his memoir collections by Portnoy\n\n1) Samuel A. Portnoy, 'the life of a legendary Jewish socialist, the memoirs of Vladimir Medem', this offers a pretty interesting perspective to the Bundist idea of \"cultural national autonomy, to quote\n\n>The Bund was greatly concerned that the name should accurately reflect the multi-ethnic character of the Russian Empire, as well as its own distinctive makeup, anti-assimilationist philosophy, and role within the party. I n his excellent study,\u00a0The Jewish Bund in Russia,\u00a0H enry Tobias observes: \"The Bund delegates advocated using\u00a0Rossiiskaia\u00a0(all-Russian) instead of the nar\u00ad rower ethno-cultural\u00a0Russkaia\u00a0(Russian), in order to distinguish the entire proletariat of the Empire from the Russian-speaking workers alone.\" (p.\u00a078, in the notes)\u00a0The Bund prevailed in its desire for the name\u00a0Rossiiskaia,\u00a0whose Yiddish approximation is\u00a0ruslender.\u00a0Thus, the adjective \"Russian\" in the English translation (as in the \"Rus\u00ad sian Social Democratic Workers Party\") should be understood as synonymous with \"All-Russian\"rather than \"Greater Russian,\" the term denoting the (repressive) rul\u00ading nationality symbolized by the Tsarist regime..... (in response to), the lskrists latching on to the word \"federation,\" and discovering that the word was objectionable and the concept-even more objec\u00adtionable. (At present, the word \"federation\" is to be found even in the name of the Russian Soviet Republic. Now it's permissible!) And a great hue and cry arose about the Bund's aiming at separatism. (Medem's memoirs, p.233)\n\nI think this is interesting, as Lenin calls Medem's proposal a \"Zionist idea\", and akin to the characterization of anti-semites like \"Drumont\", and therefore it is a false nation, erstwhile the Bund calls this a great falsification of their theory of \"cultural national autonomy\", which is anything, but contradictory to the Zionist proposal (note, that the Bundists talk about a state under a national \"aegis\" and not necessarily calling on for a nation state), despite this, the left Zionists like Ber Borochov supported Medem and Kremer to increase their position within the Jewish national bund, now of course, the Bund was more apprehensive to the Zionists then the Zionists were to the Bund (exceptions like Ben Gurion and Jabotinsky do exist, with Jabotinsky writing a detailed pamphlet ridiculing the Bundists idea of a \"proletariat\", and also about how the Bund was a apparent late comer to the \"Jewish movement\" (a exceptionally ironic claim to make)\n\n>The proletariat has never marched, nor is it now able, and for a considerable time to come will still not be able to march, in the forefront of the development of ideas in human society. In order to absorb new ideas, let alone create them, a certain cultural standard is required; this is not to be found among the toiling masses who engage in physical work and are unable to devote much of their time to their enlightenment . . . the proletarian is the last one to join Socialism. This casts no aspersion on him; on the contrary, it is a perfectly natural thing for an oppressed and obscurantist class. (Jabotinsky, Vladimir, 'Zionism and Bundism')\n\nI think, this summary and some basic works are pretty sufficient to understand the national question from all angles, and also to point out said contradictions within these proposals. The Bund's idea especially as Lenin points (or even Otto Bauer), is that it could not be applied using their own principles, and also the fact that cultural national autonomy, was similar to the Tsarist proposal, which was implemented in the Pale of Settlement, that is, the \"Jewish and separate national intuitions\", the main argument is that assimilationism in this sense (of course the Jewish people should not dissolve their whole character, as that is imposed assimilation) would be a organic process, with Jewish institutions only having a nominal character, and will be organized with the explicit goal of assimilating Jews into broader socialist society, and social life.",

Jabotinsky's brown shirt soliders are nothing but a tragicomic representation of H-words soldiers, the only thing missing for them to become the same beasts is some muscle strength, some territory and some political opportunity. In Berlin they have joined the ranks of real brown shirt bandits, and in Palestine too, they have demonstrated that they are not weaklings. **No we are not the chosen people!, our nationalism is just as ugly and harmful, and has the same fascist debauchary of the nationalism of other nations** (Henryk Erlich, \u201cNayn, mir zaynen nisht kayn atoh bekhartonu\u2013folk\u201d \\[No, We Are Not a Chosen People\\], Folkstseitung (May 1933), from\u00a0*Henryk Erlich un Viktor Alter*\u00a0(New York: Unser Tsait, 1951), pp. 269\u201371.)\n\nThis confuses some of Abba Ahimeir's and Yeivin's faction called the 'Lehi' (popular known as the Stern gang named after Avraham Stern), or the absolute utilitarian factions, some of whom, who tried to apply the fuhrerprinzip model on Jabotinsky, and also famously wrote heaps and heaps of praise on literal national \"sOcIaLisTs\", to the point of getting expelled from the general union of revisionist Zionists by Jabotinsky himself (not so surprising as one of their newspaper (Hazit haAm, a newspaper established in 1931 by Yehoshua Lichter, explicitly states that they don't mind H word's anti-communist policies), nonetheless Erlich's critique is spot on. I think, that Jabotinsky's movement aligned more with Mussolini's fascist philosophy, which is not surprising as till 1937, the Betar school was still in operation in Italy, and even later, copied some of the organizational structures of fascist youth movements (which still exist in the form of Betar, the Kahanist movement, and even some aspects of the current day Likud party, which traces its lineage to Menachem Begin, and Jabotinsky).",
