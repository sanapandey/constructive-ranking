In case this is untrue, that would mean that in a scenario where complete automation is not the end goal, rather you still have a small share of variable capital employed, an infinitely variable rate of exploitation could prevent the surplus value from lowering the rate of profit.",

            "body": ">does Marx say that the rate of exploitation must remain fixed\n\nNo. It's essential to understanding class struggle under capitalism that the rate of exploitation is not fixed. If it were fixed, then unions and pro-labor policies would not be able to increase real wages for workers. Contrast this with the neo-classical theory of wages that says that wages rates are uniquely determined over the long-run (by the marginal productivity of labor), and thus unions and pro-labor policies at best interfere with capitalist competition, reducing output and causing unemployment. \n\n>if it cannot exceed a certain rate?\n\nMathematically, the rate of exploitation has no upper bound. This is because the numerator is total profit, which must keep growing for capitalism to reproduce itself, while the denominator is total wages paid, which needn't necessarily grow at the same or faster rate than total profits. So, the ratio between the two can keep going up indefinitely from a purely mathematical perspective.\n\nHowever, total profits and wages aren't just numbers that exist in abstraction from class struggle. As real wages decline, this pressures workers to fight harder to reduce the rate of exploitation and receive higher wages; this is even more likely to be true if real wages decline while total profits rise. So, although mathematically the rate of exploitation has no upper bound, there are real limits to how much it can increase; where the exact limit is though is the product of the historically contingent balance of power between labor and capital. \n\n>In case this is untrue, that would mean that ... an infinitely variable rate of exploitation could prevent the surplus value from lowering the rate of profit.\n\nIf you're reading Volume 3 of Capital and have made it to the falling rate of profit, this issue is discussed in literally the next chapter on counterveiling influences (to the falling rate of profit). In brief, Marx recognizes that capital may respond to the falling rate of profit by increasing the rate of exploitation, and maintaining a stable or even increasing profit rate for some time. But because of the real limits imposed on the ability of capital to increase the rate of exploitation, he doesn't think that this can indefinitely forestall the falling rate of profit. Anwar Shaikh tries to demonstrate this mathematically in Part 2 of his book *Capitalism: Competition, Conflict, Crises*.",

In a nutshell, value creation is impossible without human labour. The reduction in the pool of labour to zero should drive surplus to zero assuming the substitution process continues indefinitely. The robot factory example however, is an extreme case and the way Marx formulates the rate of profit feels uncomfortable given how many assumptions it must abide by.",
