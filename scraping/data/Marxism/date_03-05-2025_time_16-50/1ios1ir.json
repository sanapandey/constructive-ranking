    "selftext": "So marxian economics belongs firmly within the classical school of economics and in many ways can be seen as a logical extension of the economics of Smith and particularly Ricardo.\n\nI find this whole school fascinating and learning about Smith, Ricardo and Marx is very interesting concept to me.\n\nI'm always looking to better my understanding of the nuance and details of the theory behind all this.\n\nAnyways, I recently realized that the Supply and Demand of the classical (and therefore marxian) school is fundamentally different from the neoclassical school.\n\nWithin neoclassical economics the supply curve is basically every quantity wherein MC >= AVC. The demand curve is created by plotting the intersection of the budget line and indifference curves at different commodity prices.\n\nBoth of these rely on marginalist theory to construct these curves. Given that the marginalists came much later than the classicals.... where did supply and demand curves come from in the classical school?\n\nI was trying to find an answer and stumbled across this paper: [https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1305&context=esi\\_working\\_papers](https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1305&context=esi_working_papers)\n\nIt was interesting. Basically their idea is that supply represents the cumulative reservation prices of all sellers in the market, and the demand represents the reservation prices of all buyers in the market.\n\nOk, as I understand it, the intersection of supply and demand represent the market price AT ANY GIVEN TIME. However the thing that interesting the classicals was the concept of value, or as smith called it \"natural price\". The natural price of any given commodity is the price around which market price tends to fluctuate. At any given time market price may be above or below natural price, but the market continually adjusts AROUND natural price. In essence, this is because if the price of a commodity is above natural price, more sellers enter the market, driving down the market price until it reaches the natural price. The reverse happens if the market price is below natural price. Market price is ephemeral, set by the intersection of supply and demand, but that intersection tends to revolve around a fixed point: natural price (or in marxian terms, value).\n\nOk, so, let's apply this logic to wages. This is where I get a bit lost in the details and want some clarification. The \"natural price\" of labor (or in marxian terms, the value of labor-power) is the cost of the means of subsistence. You need to offer workers a sufficient wage in order to sustain living and come back again tomorrow cause if you don't they won't work for you. Wages tend to stick at the cost of the means of subsistence because if wages rise, that draws more people in from the reserve army of labor, increasing labor supply and therefore driving down the price. The reverse happens if wage falls below the cost of the means of subsistence.\n\nSo here's where I get a bit tripped up. The supply curve represents the quantity of labor-power supplied at any given wage right? So if wages rise, that brings more workers from the reserve army of labor into the market, and thereby increases the quantity of labor-power supplied. What I don't get is why this would be the case at all price levels and thereby lead to an overall shift in the supply curve. Wouldn't the quantity supplied simply increase only at wages at or above the current wage because below that wage, workers would simply return to the reserve army of labor? That's what I don't get, why would quantity supplied increase at every price level and thereby lead to a broader shift in the supply curve?\n\nEdit:\n\nPerhaps I am overcomplicating this. Sure workers will leave the market in the long run but in the short run they're still in it while they organize leaving or whatever. You still need to eat while you are trying to organize an exit. So that means that their reservation prices are added to the market supply and therefore you see a shift at every price level? Does that make sense?\n\nSo in essence, the labor market supply represents the reservation price of every laborer trying to sell their labor. If wages fall below subsistence, then this leads to workers to stop selling their labor and instead shift to non-capitalist production (subsistence farming, domestic labor, etc) or whatever (or maybe just starving to death, point is that they are no longer trying to sell their labor), which means that they leave the market and therefore are no longer counted as a seller, thereby leading to their reservation price and the quantity of labor-power supplied at those reservation prices being withdrawn from the market? Is this correct?\n\nSo basically workers cannot immediately leave the market which means that wages below natural price are kept in the labor supply curve. But they do eventually leave leading to the shift leftwards.",

            "body": "In the short run, an increase in wages attracts more workers into the labor force, but these workers don't necessarily instantly withdraw if wages dip slightly. Once workers commit to employment, they must still cover their means of subsistence, so they remain in the labor market at lower wages until they either find something better or are pushed out completely. In the long run, the labor supply adjusts dynamically through demographic effects, immigration, and changes in capital accumulation. For instance, if wages remain high for a sustained period, more people may migrate to take advantage of the demand for labor, increasing supply further. Conversely, if wages stagnate or fall, people exit the workforce, delay family formation, or migrate elsewhere. \n\nWorkers are not perfectly elastic in their response to wage changes because of survival constraints. Even if wages fall slightly below the previous equilibrium, many workers remain in employment out of sheer necessity. Unlike in marginalist models, where workers choose their labor supply based on utility maximization, in Marxian economics, workers sell their labor because they must. They cannot withhold their labor indefinitely like a capitalist might withhold goods from the market to manipulate price.\n\nDuring economic booms, capital expands, absorbing more workers and driving wages up. But as accumulation reaches its limits (overproduction, falling profit rates, etc.), capitalists slow investment, shed workers, and recreate the reserve army, restoring downward pressure on wages. This cycle is what keeps wages tied to subsistence in the long run.",
