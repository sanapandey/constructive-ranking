    "selftext": "So over the holidays my college freshman cousin and I got into a little debate about communism, socialism, fascism, and just terminology in general. I think her and I were basically on the same page, but I had some problems with how she used some of the terms. For instance, she tried to claim that the USSR was fascist. I responded by kinda suggesting that she maybe was not looking at things from a material/historical perspective and was just applying terms ideologically. The USSR I think definitely grew out of a workers movement and in conflict with the global capitalist class. So to me if something is communist it can\u2019t also be fascist which is rooted in supporting the global interests of capital. \n\nHowever, I let the discussion drop because I had the thought that well maybe the term fascism means something different today than it did 10 years ago when I was on Reddit and twitter discussing these things. Maybe the term \u201cfascism\u201d is more about just authoritarianism generally and just carries a strong negative connotation. It\u2019s more a judgement than a description of a movement rooted in history and class struggle. Is that what \u201cfascism\u201d means now? If so I guess it might make sense to describe the USSR as fascist. Is it okay for the word to mean that now? Any thoughts?",

You can explain to your cousin that \"fascism\" in academic circles is used to denote so-and-so concept, and then ask them what they're trying to say. So like if they say the USSR was fascist, instead of debating whether the USSR was fascist ask them what they mean, and if they just mean authoritarian/\"bad\", then you switch the conversation to whether or not the USSR was authoritarian/\"bad\" (or whatever you wanna talk about).",

It comes from Italian\u00a0\"fascismo\", from\u00a0\"fascio\"\u00a0( meaning \u201cfasces\u201d, bundle, or group)\u00a0+\u00a0\u00a0ism,\u00a0with direct reference to Mussolini's\u00a0fasci di combattimento (fight clubs), from\u00a0the Latin fasces, bundles of axes and rods carried before the magistrates of the ancient Roman Republic\u00a0as representative of their power of life and death. You could use this as a way start a discussion about how fascism at its core is about nationalist mythologies driven by authoritarianism and imperialism, which are fundamentally incongruent with the USSR",

Failed liberal analysis might look at high level commonalities, but those could be found in most societies. \n\nFascism also wavers in definition, hence the saying \"Every time fascism pops up, it's waving a new flag\". One must study the historical and material patterns of Fascist societies and analyze their intent, conditions, and actions. Fascism rises from Liberalism and Imperialism, and seeks a \"third way\" that is neither the status quo of capitalism nor the worker led state of communism. It is based on lies, falsehoods, and violence for domination. It is inherently reactionary and anti-labor. It is inherently anti-communist.\n\nCommunism is based on rigid dialectical materialism. It seeks to study the contradicting nature of society and its material conditions. It is the doctrine of the conditions of the liberation of the working class. It ideologically opposes capitalism, and thus Fascism. Socialist experiments (socialist nations) existed under wildly different conditions than the fascist states of the West. It existed in opposition to autocracy, fuedalism, and the economic class distinctions of capitalism. While many failures and tragedies occurred in socialist states, they were not born from the same intents, actions, conditions, and antagonisms seen in the West.\n\nAgain, outside of very high level, cursory commonalities (which again could be found in most nations ever) Communism and Fascism are ideologically opposed and functionally and materially distinct. \n\nI would check out Parenti's Blackshirts and Reds, Finchelstein's A Brief History of Fascist Lies, as well as works by Gamsci and Dimitrov. \n\nThe Nazis first came for the communists.",

But they have things in common: for one, they are masses movements. Fascism had a huge support from the workers and middle classes as a way to defend themselves from other imperialist powers. \n\nBut, they have abysmals differences too: communist's political subject are workers, be them Germans, Italians or Americans. Fascist's political subject is the nation and for the good of it, any other group is disposable especially the \"suspicious minorities\" (jews, immigrants, gay people, etc.)\n\nI would say the recipe for fascism is the following: corporativism, stateism, nationalism and totalitarianism. The USSR and fascist states had in common the stateism and totalitarianism, but the nationalism is matter of debate and the USSR was definitly not corporativist, so not fascist as we understand it. I can elaborate further if you want to in the details of each component.",

Isaac Steinberg criticized the Bolsheviks for having a flawed view of historical materialism, in that they positioned themselves as the sole valid interpreters of the will of history, purportedly meting out justice on the behalf of the people, but inevitably doing so in a way that protects the power of the Party with little consideration for democracy. When you weaponize this kind of framing of history, that only the Party can interpret the will of history, then capital violence is sanctioned a priori, which will, and did in this case, lead to authoritarianism. I would argue that these people aren't true communists, but it does really bother me when I see leftists trying to argue that this isn't true. It makes the left look naive and uncritical.",

Fascism is a strategy the capitalist ruling class deploy to survive in a republic with growing class consciousness. Fascism appeals to the most basal hatreds and bigotries within the masses so that they will assent to the tyranny of the capitalist ruling class. In contrast, the Soviet Union did not appeal so much to hatreds and bigotries but to the hopes of the working class that communism was just around the corner: any day now. Just assent to the authoritarianism now and in the future we will give you heaven on Earth (this strategy was also to protect the capitalist ruling class globally and also the crony / state capitalist ruling class in the USSR). \n\nThat we see a blurring, of specifically fascism with its genus authoritarianism, is a signal of just how advanced fascism has become in the present day.",
