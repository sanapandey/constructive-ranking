    "selftext": "So I was reading an article about this, and there was one quote from the Spanish PM which was \u201cThe West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants\u201d. \n\nAnd somehow, even as a Marxist, that didn\u2019t sit right with me. It seemed to me as though he was co-opting Marxism because xenophobia would be distasteful. To me, it seemed like this action is targetted at non-EU people, when it is just as true that many EU citizens also do the same thing of buying property. \n\nBasically, the PM\u2019s framing of the issue\u2014rich landlords versus poor tenants\u2014does evoke Marxist terminology, as it highlights class conflict. However, where I\u2019m coming from Is Marxism doesn\u2019t reduce such conflicts to questions of nationality. Instead, it critiques the systemic relations of production and ownership that generate class divisions, regardless of the actors\u2019 ethnicity or citizenship. \n\nA Marxist analysis would likely interrogate why private property and speculative real estate markets exist as mechanisms for capital accumulation, rather than simply targeting non-EU individuals as landlords.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being biased because I myself am a non-EU citizen living in this region. Thoughts?",

You don't live in Spain, but the people who come from outside Europe are big money corporations that don't live here....and don't plan to, they just try to speculate. I agree with this measure, and think it would be global, facilitating access to home ownership to the ones that don't have one. \n\nBut Spain's PM also promoted an exception in the IRPF to the ones who rent their apartment, the higher class individuals. So overall it's not even a progresist measure",

This kind of law is mainly to prevent American and Chinese corporations from coming in and buying up all the properties and forcing the Spanish population into becoming tenants from which the wealthy of these foreign nations extract rent. This gives an advantage to the native European bourgeoisie over the foreign bourgeois. The Spanish bourgeoisie want to protect themselves from being outcompeted by the bourgeoisie of other more economically powerful nations.",

But he's not protecting Spanish tenants since most of the properties are being bought by the Spanish bourgeoisie and the European bourgeoisie........so it's basic protectionism. Also, the owners that rent their properties will get 100% discount in their property taxes so... increases the fucking breach.",

His measures have been basically a copy paste of what the neocons have been doing in Madrid for example.\n\nAll the measures are written to protect the owners and try to be friendly with the tenants and whatnot. \n\nHe has been doing this thing for a while of chanting the international in the Party\u2019s convention, talking about taxing the rich and such, but nothing has changed significantly nor is it going to happen. \n\nThe housing minister is herself a landlord with more than 5-6 properties, with major protests erupting in the country that are asking her to resign.\n\nSo, in summary, the guy is complying with the IMF and the European Central Bank allowing the rich people from within to keep plundering the country, but at the same time trying to frame it as the social shield from the oligarchs coming from abroad.",

They buy a bunch of houses, drive up the house price until it is unaffordable and then force everybody to rent under their insane rental prices. A landlord who lives close by and is part of your community isn\u2019t nearly as bad as a landlord who lives on the other side of the planet making bank of destroying your community isn't nearly",

This is unfair and poorly nuanced and as a policy it is likely to discourage real estate construction and dampen the supply of housing for Spanish citizens.  If the US tried to pull the same thing, the Supreme Court would nix it because it would be unconstitutional.  Spain really needs to think of ways to increase the supply of housing without hurting certain classes of people.",
