    "selftext": "If I want to become more familiar with Marxist theory, is it enough to read only the first part or should I read all three/four parts of Capital? An additional question is whether the works addressed by Karl Kautsky should be considered the fourth part of Capital and are they even worth reading? Everyone agrees on one thing, and that is that the first part is a masterpiece. Praise and recognition come regardless of the political stance of the critics. I have noticed that many advise avoiding the second and third parts, because they are not written in such an understandable language as the first part and for many the sequels have spoiled their opinion of Capital in general. As for the fourth part by Karl Kautsky, I have not seen it mentioned when discussing this book. I also know that the USSR published its own edition, because they felt that Kautsky had changed Marx's works too much.",

Then chapter 17, 25, 32.\n\nAfter that, jump directly to book 3, and read from the start, at least the first half of the book. That will give you a very solid overall view of the project. Enough that you could figure out the rest by yourself even.",

I only read volume II and III about three years after I finished volume I. I would still read them, but not as high on the priority list as volume I.\n\nDepending on the secondary literature you read and whether those works deal with concepts from Volume II or III, it may become more urgent. I will say they were not a pleasure to read.\n\n>Praise and recognition come regardless of the political stance of the critics.\n\nThis is not really true. There's plenty of people on the right who think Marx's value theory is just nonsensical twaddle. Cohen basically decouples exploitation and value theory. Different Marxists interpret Marx's theories differently and some use certain concepts more than others. As far as I am aware, David Harvey for example, borrows much more from II than from III. Another recent and positively received secondary work from Beverley Best in turn focuses on Volume III. \n\nI would still recommend reading all of them, but volume I I should be higher in priority.",

Economists *love* the *Theories of Surplus Value*.",

Invest your time in learning the arts of fighting fascists and growing crops. Learn a trade perhaps. Don't waste your time reading Marx, just listen to the top dogs who will more than gladly spend time telling you what you need to believe about what Marx said. Bottom line is: Be there when they need you! Cheers!",
