Is there a book that explains how his world was set up at the time and why it made the Manifesto so influential?\n\nPreferably something available as an audiobook as this is how I consume literature, I know that will limit my options.",

            "body": "Not an audiobook, but I would HIGHLY recommend the podcast series Revolutions by Mike Duncan. Start at season three, the French Revolution, and just listen on as if it were an audiobook. When you get to the Russian revolution series it has some episodes on Marx, Bakunin, and the development of the first international and more of the historical context of Marx's life. If you want you can skip right there but it works so much better in context if you listen to the whole series, because the events of the French revolution and its ripple effects define the rest of the series, as well as the framework Marx was most directly working in, historically speaking.",

What helped me understand it the most was reading Engels' Principles and Marx's Wage Labor pamphlets. Although it was originally published in 1848, the Paris Commune forced Marx and Engels to reconsider the nature of the state and it's role in the transition to communism.\n\nI would highly recommend reading the prefaces to the Manifesto, if you're more into audiobooks, look up Socialism4All on YouTube, he has readings of many socialist works.",

One review however, mentions that for each new person the date of birth and death are also pronounced which interrupts the narrative flow apparently.\n\nAlso Hobsbawm's Age of Revolution and Age of Capital both have audio versions on Amazon. His vocabulary is a bit old fashioned and it helps if you already have a high school level general knowledge of history. Good, but not the most accessible by contemporary standards.",

Marx's point was never to suggest his politics only applied to those circumstances, quite the opposite, and he spent his life applying it to countless international and historic events.\n\nSo you're just a lame anti working class person here to red bait?",
