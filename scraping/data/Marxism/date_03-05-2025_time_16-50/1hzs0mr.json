    "selftext": "Many know that Marx discouraged the 1971 Paris Commune from revolting before the revolution becauss he didnt think it would succeed. Yet he still supported it as a valuable revolutionary act by the proletariat when it happened anyway. Today, however, many leftists seem to reject similar actions that aren't \"perfect\" in favor of more ideologically pure strategies even after they've already been done, unlike Marx. For instance, solo acts like those of Luigi Mangione are often condemned, but Marx himself didn't hold to perfectionism when it came to revolutionary struggle. I even see some socialisra saying this which suprised me which is why I thought I'd ask: Why do you think modern leftists reject imperfect revolutionary actions despite Marx having embraced them?\n",

It doesn't seem so.\n\nThere's nothing to condemn or condone from the perspective of strategy. It was a spontaneous act by an individual who lashed out. That is to be expected and we should continue to expect more in the future.\n\nIf there was a working-class movement in the USA which was sufficiently organized and could take advantage of the moment, then the analysis changes. We would then discuss whether it is strategically in our interests to associate a random act of violence with an organized movement. Likely it wouldn't be.\n\nIt's not about being perfect. No struggle can be perfect, though I understand what you mean about some leftist tendencies being idealist in their formation. The general issue is that a true worker's struggle lasts a very long time and we have to be careful not to take strategies that seem good in the short term but are disastrous in the long term. And, generally, terrorism as a primary tactic is disastrous in the long term. The main reason is because a socialist revolution needs to be a mass revolution. And terrorism divides the working class and allows the state a golden opportunity to turn the masses against a revolution and clinger even more to the state for protection.\n\nIn short, if we were to promote the acts of Mangione and encourage more, we are committing the error of adventurism. And that's assuming we have such a platform that the workers pay attention to in the first place, which we don't yet in the USA.",

As a black person who grew up reading both Black and Western history, some major difference is that Westerners/ Europeans write history starting from the end, while in Black history, it starts from some unknown person. \n\nIf a history book is written about the Civil Rights Movement, for example, a Western writer would start the story with MLK. A Black writer would probably start with Mamie Till. So to you, a revolution starts towards the end, but you erase the history that led to the big event. \n\nAnother difference is that Western literature focuses on happy endings, and a win is seen as a win lose situation.  This might be why they erased the effort of the few who died before the revolution began. \n\nLastly,  Western protagonists have to be seen as pure, thus why you used terminology like terrorist because the idea of a hero being a terrorist is incomprehensible in the West. \n\nIn the 1980s, for example, there was a worldwide understanding that South African apartheid was wrong, but at the same time, Nelson Mandela was seen as a terrorist by the west.  I'm not sure if this is an ethnicity issue or a social control success story. \n\nAnyway, in high school we had to do a short story book where the authors were Muslims or Arabs on different social political issues.  The stories had no happy ending,  but they showed the impact that one person can have on future generations.",

                            "body": "Thank you for bringing out a lot more of this discussion. And appologies for the length of this reply. It's not to defend myself. Rather, it's because I completely agree with you but feel that I have to be more explicit about how it is that I agree.\n\n---\n\nI was being pretty general in my response and I definitely glossed over many things. Among those was the term \"terrorism\".\n\nStrictly speaking, terrorism is simply a specific combat strategy, often employed by the side that has lesser resources available to it (usually the victims of colonialism or emperialism in the modern context). That is, the object isn't to out-right defeat the enemy in a military conflict because that's not possible, but to strike enough fear in the population that the enemy must protect in order to make things difficult politically for the enemy.\n\nTerrorism, in this strict definition, can be effective. The example I tend to use are the suffragettes in England in the late-19th-early-20th century, who bombed public areas, often killing many innocent people, to raise the level of seriousness of the movement. And they won! Women got the right to vote and several other rights. And today people of English think it is \"backwards\" to see women as non-equals in the sight of the law!\n\nAnd there are bunches of other examples.\n\nThere's another, newer, definition of \"terrorism\" now too. It's a definition created by the empiral core (the \"West\") because they desperately need to control the narrative. This definition can't be found in textbooks because it's extemely inconsistent. This definition, practically speaking, is just any military force that goes against the emperialists' wishes. That is, anybody who fights back against oppression.\n\nThe emperialists create underground factions and fund them to do crimes against humanity. It is only when those factions turn on the emperialists and go against their interests that they are, then, given the label \"terrorist organization\". Nothing actually changed in the group's make-up, strategy or even goals. The only thing that changed was whether or not they were useful to the empirialist forces.\n\nIn my answer above, I was not using the emperialist's definition of \"terrorism\". Mostly because that definition is complete nonsense and I couldn't use it seriously even if I wanted to due to its wild inconsistencies.\n\nBut here we have to be careful. Most \"normies\" aren't going to separate the two ideas. Most normies aren't going to have this awareness. Most normies are going to believe that whatever the state calls a \"terrorist organization\" is something that is \"bad\" (even if they can't articulate why). We are dealing with a very high level of propaganda and state-run narratives.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that a strategy that out-right disregards this factor (the state's manipulation of the facts) and goes ahead and does some ugly things anyway because they think they're right anyway is a losing strategy for the formation of a working-class mass movement.\n\nIn the Civil Rights movement, which you've brought up, for example, this was the reason for part of it being non-violent. It wasn't entirely non-violent, of course, but there was a strategic reason for the non-violent component. The movement needed a \"human side\" that white people would actually emphathize with. It needed victims and it needed white people to see those victims oppressed. What that did was force the contradictions of racisms within the white society to heighten, forcing the state to deal with it.\n\nIn the North, you had the terrorism tactic. You had Malcolm X and others. They were clear that if violence was the only language the systems of oppression understood and that they were ready to speak that language. But the Northern part of the Civil Rights movement and the Southern parts of it were not acting non-strategically. They knew what they were doing.\n\nWhite society got squeezed between the two. White society's contradictions got heightened so much so that they had to make a decision. And, importantly, that decision was already spelled out between the North and the South sides of the movement: either give in to the demands of the non-violent part or be ready to go to war with the violent part. It was clear from the very beginning which would be chosen.\n\n---\n\nTo be more clear, a communist movement should not be in the business of moralizing this or that strategy and picking out of that. This is pure idealism and something that is doomed to fail the movement. So I would not advocate that. A communist movement is to always analyze their context through dialectics to understand which contradictions of the state and power would best serve the interests of the working class when illuminated to full brightness. Strictly speaking, that means no strategy is off the table. What is more important is how something fulfills the larger strategy of advancing workers to power.\n\nSo my advice above to not use terrorism comes from my view on the current analysis of the working class within the empiral core. If the idea is to win over folks that are severely under-developed in their class consciousness, terrorism won't do that. It will always backfire. And in many places right now, this is what we're dealing with.\n\nIn some other context, say the exploited periphery of global capitalism (the \"global South\"), my argument likely breaks down. There you have the contradictions laid bare. There you have the enemies clearly outlined and the level of exploitation is great. There you would employ any and all methods that rally the masses together to fight off their oppressors.",

I assumed that anti-bourgeoisie terrorism was benificial as long as it didn't harm the civilian population because it pushed the Overton Window to the left and the bourgeoisie are essentially modern day lords so it doesn't count as a civilian death.\n\n I realize now that terrorism could also strike fear in the majority even it was unintended and hurt collective action rather than normalizing it. \n\nHowever, isn't it possible that the reason the Overton Window in the US has moved to the right is partially related to the fact that the left has been so careful not to be portrayed as \"extremists\" who will cause disorder? Meanwhile, the right is allowed to freely do so without fear. \n\nYou're right, we should avoid short term solutions. But isnt it possible to say that Luigi's solo action could have outbalanced the material he gave to the right to sow fear? Especially considering many companies changed their policies after the murder which showed the public that voting isn't the only option?\n\nIf not that's okay, that would explain why some condemn it.",

Plausibly it's synonymous with the mass line.\n\nWe're not trying to push the masses left or right. We're trying to raise the level of consciousness of the working masses so they are aware of their position inside of the capitalist system. Sometimes that will mean pushing a \"left\" agenda but other times it will mean pushing a \"right\" agenda. That is, the struggle for socialism sometimes looks liberal and sometimes looks conservative. We have to reject these bourgeois concepts (though, confusingly, the terms \"left\" and \"right\" don't always refer to the bourgeois concepts of the terms and it depends on who you are reading ... but here, I really mean the most popular usages of the terms, such as in the overton window concept, which is bourgeois).\n\n>isn't it possible that the reason the Overton Window in the US has moved to the right is partially related to the fact that the left has been so careful not to be portrayed as \"extremists\" who will cause disorder?

But my short summary is that I would blame the leadership of communist/socialist orgs before anything else. If the historical task of a communist party is to lead the workers towards a revolutionary stance against their oppressors, we have to accept the fact that these communist parties have failed to do this. And we have to critically analyze why this was the case and correct it.\n\nThe right in the USA is free because the Democrats fight against any opposition from the left. The Democratic party is what plays defense to allow the Republicans the freedom from genuine opposite nary forces. They work as a team to ensure the fullest suppression of revolutionary forces.",

Luigi is an example of the alienation caused by a rampant capitalist society as he, a very intelligent individual, was reduced to a mere cog in a system. In taking this action, he may have saved some lives, as some healthcare insurance companies said they would make policy changes. However, this will only last while it's on the front pages. \n\nMarx would recognise the pointlessness of the act as a result. We are not ready or capable of Communist revolution right now. The capitalist system has too much control over everything. Therefore, this was a wasted sacrifice. He would probably say that Luigi could have made more of an impact if he had been a politician, activist, or teacher. He could have inspired others. He would not condemn him but would be saddened by the outcome. Luigi could have achieved so much more if he had channelled his rage in a more useful way. \n\nThe thing he would ask is, what did Luigi expect from this? Did he expect or want his act to inspire revolution? Is he a communist? Or was he just a guy who lost a family member because of some AI algorithm that decided they weren't worth saving? \n\nThere are millions, if not billions, of Luigis out there. Who have been ignored and alienated by systems that don't care about them. Marx knew this 180 years ago. He would have tipped his cap to one of the few brave ones that decided to do something about it. Even if it was a pointless act.\n\nEdit: \"Leftists\" are so fragmented right now. We don't know what we are fighting for and spend more time attacking one another than anything else. No wonder we can't decide what a revolutionary act is. I, personally,  don't know if this act was a revolutionary one. Whilst I think he wanted to make a point to the rest of us, I think this was a personal act of revenge.\n\nFurther, most leftists aren't Marxists, as they have been educated to reject Marxism.

It is really difficult to define what a \"leftist\" is these days. I've not kept up with Bernie's stuff recently, so that's disappointing to hear, I was impressed by him. \n\nWell, if you take the time to consider the likelihood of success or failure before acting, then you might lose the opportunity. So, if we knew that Luigi was a Marxist, we'd probably respect him for risking everything without knowing if it'd work out. If we look at historical events, lots of key revolutionary moments were spontaneous and extremely risky. \n\nFor example, Lenin's trip to Russia, from Finland, in 1917 after the February Revolution. He could have been imprisoned, killed, or worse. It nearly stopped the entire movement in its tracks because most people assumed he'd agreed to be a German spy. (The German Government gave him an armoured train.) Even some of his allies didn't trust him. However, he knew he had to take the risk, or it would definitely fail. Further, Lenin gave a speech after the October/November Revolution celebrating the fact that they'd lasted one day longer than the Paris Commune. They were certain that they would be defeated in the ongoing Civil War but kept going anyway. \n\nAttempting to inspire revolution is risky, and you've got to take the opportunities as they arrive, I'm hoping we get to find out what Luigi's motivations were for carrying out the assassination tbh but I don't know if we will.",

I\u2019m not of the mind that one must be strictly proletarian in order to contribute to mass struggle, but this particular individual is not even in the universe of class solidarity. I will agree that his act struck a mass chord which is providing a useful reading on degrees of latent class consciousness, but there has been no new strategic development. It\u2019s merely the latest instance of individualistic violence gesturing to a small part of what the broad spectrum of progressive thought has been saying for decades.\n\n> Why do you think modern leftists reject imperfect revolutionary actions despite Marx having embraced them?\n\nI think you need to keep reading, starting with Lenin in 1901.",

Undoubtedly the number of such acts will increase.\n\nWe Marxists consider the tactic of individual terror inexpedient in the tasks of the liberating struggle of the proletariat as well as oppressed nationalities. A single isolated hero cannot replace the masses. But we understand only too clearly the inevitability of such convulsive acts of despair and vengeance. All our emotions, all our sympathies are with the self-sacrificing avengers even though they have been unable to discover the correct road. \n\nOur sympathy becomes intensified because Grynszpan is not a political militant but an inexperienced youth, almost a boy, whose only counselor was a feeling of indignation. \n\nTo tear Grynszpan out of the hands of capitalist justice, which is capable of chopping off his head to further serve capitalist diplomacy, is the elementary, immediate task of the international working class!\"",
