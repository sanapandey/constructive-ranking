    "selftext": "There\u2019s a quote in volume 1 of Das Kapital where Marx says something similar to \u201cin slavery, slaves are guaranteed their means of sustenance, no matter how wretched it may be. this isn\u2019t true for the proletariat\u201d. I hope to find the actual quote. If not, just a quote which explains the same thing. Thanks!",

Here is the 7th question in Engels' _Principles of Communism_:\n\n> ***In what ways do proletarians differ from slaves?*** \n\n> \"The slave is sold once and for all; the proletarian must sell himself daily and hourly.\n\n>_**The individual slave, property of one master, is assured an existence, however miserable it may be, because of the master\u2019s interest.** The individual proletarian, property as it were of the entire bourgeois class which buys his labor only when someone has need of it, has no secure existence. This existence is assured only to the class as a whole._ \n\n>The slave is outside competition; the proletarian is in it and experiences all its vagaries.\n\n>The slave counts as a thing, not as a member of society. Thus, the slave can have a better existence than the proletarian, while the proletarian belongs to a higher stage of social development and, himself, stands on a higher social level than the slave.\n\n>The slave frees himself when, of all the relations of private property, he abolishes only the relation of slavery and thereby becomes a proletarian; the proletarian can free himself only by abolishing private property in general.\"",

But if I compelled Iv\u00e1n to overwork himself, and did not give him either land or food, the matter would go up to the authorities, and I should have to answer for it.\n\n>But now that men are free, I can compel Iv\u00e1n and Peter and Sidor to do every kind of work; and if they refuse I give them no money to pay taxes, and then they will be flogged till they submit: besides this, I may also make a German, a Frenchman, a Chinaman, and an Indian, work for me by that means, so that, if they do not submit, I shall not give them money to hire land, or to buy bread, because they have neither land nor bread. And if I make them overwork themselves, or kill them with excess of labour, nobody will say a word to me about it; and, moreover, if I have read books on political economy I shall be quite sure that all men are\u00a0free and that money does not create slavery!\n\n>Our peasants have long known that with a ruble one can hurt more than with a stick. It is only political economists who cannot see it.\n\n[https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/38690/pg38690-images.html](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/38690/pg38690-images.html)",

The wage form thus extinguishes every trace of the division of the working-day into necessary labour and surplus-labour, into paid and unpaid labour. All labour appears as paid labour. In the corv\u00e9e, the labour of the worker for himself, and his compulsory labour for his lord, differ in space and time in the clearest possible way. In slave labour, even that part of the working-day in which the slave is only replacing the value of his own means of existence, in which, therefore, in fact, he works for himself alone, appears as labour for his master. All the slave\u2019s labour appears as unpaid labour. In wage labour, on the contrary, even surplus-labour, or unpaid labour, appears as paid. There the property-relation conceals the labour of the slave for himself; here the money-relation conceals the unrequited labour of the wage labourer.",
