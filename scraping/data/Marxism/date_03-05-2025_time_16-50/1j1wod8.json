    "selftext": "I dont know if this is the right place to post this.\n\nSince the oval office release, liberals have come out the woodworks online in support of continuing the war in Ukraine.\n\nI've been censored from one of my favorite subreddits for speaking out against this phenomenon.\n\nNo one seems to be aware of US involvement in the fascist takeover of Ukraine in 2014. No one seems to be aware of NATO encroachment. They have double standards for Russia. I've asked several people what they think would happen if Mexico joined a military alliance with Russia or China, if they think the US wouldn't consider it a national security threat and not launch a military intervention of their own, and they just shut their brains off.\n\nI think the thing thats driving me crazy the most is the idea that these people think everyone supports their crazy bloodlust. Antiwar opinions are being censored, and it feels like people who know their history and want the war in Ukraine to end to spare Ukrainian and Russian lives are being thrown under the rug.\n\nIt definitely feels like there's fed involvement in this operation, manufacturing consent for possible nuclear war to \"own the Ruzzians\".\n\nI take solace in the fact that offline, no one I know in my personal life supports continuing this war, as well as the fact that this seems to be a liberal European and US problem, that the rest of the world sees through this sham.\n\nI'm absolutely disgusted. I feel like I'm living in some dystopian nightmare.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If Ukrainians don\u2019t want to be invaded, they have the right to resist. \n\nLet\u2019s be very clear here: the only reason people on the left oppose supporting Ukraine is because they axiomatically oppose expanding NATO influence.

If one nation invades another with the stated aim of liberating the proletariat, it isn't difficult for the bourgeois of the nation being invaded to convince the proletariat that the invading army is their enemy, not their friend. After all war is hell and these people who claim to represent the workers of the invaded army are bringing war upon them. If you look at the republics that came under Soviet control through invasion by the red army, the general public were far more eager to give up the socialist experiment by the time of perestroika than the people in the republics which had been in the Russian empire before the revolution. This is because in socialism was forced on them from outside as opposed to having been something the workers had chosen themselves and fought for. The idea of socialism was permanently stained by its accociation with these republics loss of national autonomy. And besides, this hypothetical is irrelevant because Russia is not on any level fighting to bring socialism to Ukraine, nor does it claim to be, and yet a lot of western socialists act as though they think it is for some reason. Russia is no more socialist than the US is.\u00a0",

You can be sneaky, you can use economic manipulation, you can have proxy wars, you can trick them into signing a bad treaty, you can do a million other garbage things, but you can't invade. \n\nIf we let Russia have Ukraine, every other superpower has free reign to start chewing up their neighbors. We shouldn't have let Russia keep Crimea, tbh. That is what started this war. China and Taiwan and Hong Kong have their own intensely complicated history that is also feeding into this and I can't fully talk about, being a white American without a history degree. \n\nBut because of where Russia is physically, they need to control Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Poland, because they need the black sea, because they need the Mediterranean sea, because they need the Atlantic. They need better access to warm water ports, to European trade, and the Americas, and Africa. \n\nWe can't just let them roll over Europe, for what I hope are obvious reasons, and we can't throw our military fully behind Ukraine, for the same reasons we can't outright invade someone else. We need to talk Russia into stopping, and we (the world in any state of stability) need Ukraine to be standing at the end of this war.\n\nEdit: please think of this as descriptive, not defensive. They asked why, this is why. Feel free to drop any other ideas as to what the way out of this is! I admit that I don't know",

Russia and the West undoubtedly have hostilities at present, so if one builds a military front next to the other, isn't that going to make the other nervous? It seems like you're claiming that everything Putin says is axiomatically wrong, but I'd rather believe that, as tyrannical as he is, he occasionally says things that are true. This is not automatically \"carrying water for Moscow\", or whatever the latest pro-war liberal phrase is.\n\n(I should say that while I agree with your interlocutor, I am genuinely open to your arguments on this.

And other than that it'd probably just be the same neocolonialism as there's been  so far, just without aid.\n\nThe right's isolationism is really just racism as in \"we shouldn't spend money on those third worlders whom countries we have destroyed\" while maintaining their privileges. \"America First\" is no different from Mussolini's isolationist rhetoric while he was going on colonial wars in Africa.\n\n>He\u2019s also supposedly anti war (hence the professed desire to stop supporting Ukraine in favor of peace).\n\nMy impression is to the contrary. He seems hellbent on making Gaza his colony (and it does seem like he's pushing to end the ceasefire) plus his talks about invading Greenland and Panama. Whether he'll actually act on that is another question.\n\nHis plan for Ukraine isn't a peaceful one. He rather wants to split the plunder with Russia (hence his demand for 500bn dollars in minerals).",

It seems like you've lost sight of the fact that Russia is and always has been the aggressor in this war, Ukraine is a nation defending its sovereignty and is receiving aid from its international allies (everything short of troop involvement that many think would lead to WW3 and everyone wants to avoid). The US interference you referenced is pretty well debunked in the Bulwark article, I suggest you give it a read. Not that the US and international capitalists don't have an interest in supporting international democracy, they absolutely do have a vested interest because democracies are great for exploiting. That's the depressing paradox I see, that by supporting Ukrainian sovereignty on ethical grounds I am unfortunately aligned with international capital, my economic oppressors.\n\nBut you shouldn't mistake my support of Ukrainian sovereignty for pro-war sentiment. I would love for this war to end and for lives to be spared. It was Putin's authoritarian Russia that invaded Ukraine and Ukraine has a right to defend itself. Should Ukraine simply roll over? I'd be interested to hear more about the anti-war options you mentioned. Do any of them include Russia returning occupied Ukrainian land to Ukraine? We up in Canada have been staring down the barrel of a similar situation with veiled and not-so-veiled threats of US takeover. My friend group is largely progressive and non-violent but we are all in agreement that we would go to war to protect Canadian sovereignty from US invasion. Not because we would want to but because we would have to to protect the right of Canadians to self-govern.\n\nI'm part way through Noam Chomsky's \"Pirates and Emperors\", you're absolutely correct that there is a double standard for US international military force. But US imperialism isn't the root of this conflict. The spread of international democracy is still a noble pursuit, even if it aligns with capitalist and US imperialist interests.",

Yeah, I know you're going to talk about Azov--while, of course, ignoring the Interbrigades as well as the general policy of the Putin government over the past 20 years--but I don't think that's really, you know, fair. Ukraine is in a desperate position, with a legitimate fear of impending genocide, and sometimes that means you make deals with the devil; so far, it doesn't seem to have had any substantive impact on policy.
