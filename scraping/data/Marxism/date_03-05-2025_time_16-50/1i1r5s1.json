Because if a company makes a new commodity, which no other company in the world is producing, then there is no market competition for that commodity which goes into determining its price, right? And before it goes onto the market, there is no comparison to go by to set the price, since no one has yet sold anything like it. It doesn't \"exist\" yet. So is the only determining factor the labour behind it? And in fact, is it even \"socially necessary labour time\" in this case, considering its the sole company making it, so there's also no competition for wages either? ",

But a start-up couldn't do that as much. Like they could somewhat set the price to how they want, but as a start-up they also want to realistically make money, otherwise they'd quickly go out of business, so although it'd be a monopoly price, they'd set it to a limit which they could reasonably assume people would be willing to pay. So in that case, how would its price be determined? Would the labour time be a factor at all?",

                            "body": "There are a few parts of your question that I think I can provide some insight on.\n\n(1) Economists, specifically Post-Keynesians, have, sometimes critically, made a point of the fact that Marx assumed a regime of perfect competition, and therefore did not contribute a great deal to how we should think about monopolies. Most of them correctly note that Marx, in volume one of *Capital* and elsewhere, foresaw that firms would tend to consolidate and form monopolies, but he left his analysis in the form of a vague prediction and didn\u2019t provide a comprehensive toolbox for how we ought to understand them. This led Ronald Meek in his well regarded *Studies in the Labor Theory of Value* to ask how the LTV could be carried forward in the modern world where monopolies are the norm and competition is the exception, and to ultimately wonder whether it\u2019s quantitative aspects really did matter in the modern world. Paul Sweezy and Paul Baran set out to answer this question in their book *Monopoly Capital*, and, in my opinion, provided a really good qualitative basis to think through the problem.\n\n(2) Where Marx failed to provide a toolbox, other economists succeeded. Joan Robinson wrote this landmark book in the 30s called the *Economics of Imperfect Competition* which established the foundation for a lot of the analytical tools still used to analyze monopoly and, especially, monopsony. I don\u2019t have it with me, but I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a chart in that book which deals specifically with your hypothetical, and what actions the monopolist would take. She was coming out of the tradition of Marshall and Pigou at the time, so the way you frame your question\u2014as a calculation by the monopolist where they attempt to optimize the number of consumers while attaining the highest possible margins\u2014was very much in her wheelhouse. Overall, that\u2019s pretty much all I can tell you: it\u2019s an optimization equation which attempts to achieve the highest possible profit. Whether the demand for this new invention is elastic or inelastjc, whether the problem is considered statically or in the long-run, the degree of monopsony, etc., are all contributing factors. So, unfortunately, I can\u2019t give you much more than that.\n\n(3) Michael Kalecki, a Polish Marxist economist, made use of a simple way to think through monopolies at a macroeconomic level through the concept of the \u201cdegree of monopoly\u201d from economist Abba Lerner. The degree of monopoly is the proportion of the difference between a product\u2019s price and its marginal cost. In algebraic terms,\n\n(P - C)/P\n\nwhere P is price and C is marginal cost. Thus, if a commodity is priced at 100 dollars, and it takes 80 dollars to make one unit of it, then the degree of monopoly is 20%. In classical economics, as in Marx\u2019s, it was tacitly assumed that the degree of monopoly tended to be low due to high competition. Today, in established industries that are not in periods of heightened competition (American fast food companies are, for instance, currently in a pricing war, but only two years ago were running margins well into the hundreds percent), it\u2019s safe to assume that the degree of monopoly is quite high.\n\nTo me, much of the above does to some extent undermine the quantitative side of the LTV. That doesn\u2019t mean it was wrong in general when Marx was alive. He was dealing with the English economy and developing capitalist economies in France and Germany\u2014firms rose and fell and prices changed dramatically practically every day. It made sense for he and all his predecessors to assume a high degree of competition\u2014not to mention the fact that he surpassed all of them in predicted an uncompetitive economy. In addition, while socially-necessary labor-time is a little pas\u00e9 in, say, American smartphones, with essentially two players, there are still highly competitive industries where nearly everything Marx said applies. And as a final thought, the qualitative side of the labor theory of value is as strong as it ever was. Economies exist because of labor; countries which do not work, do not exist.",

Academic condescension is a plague on the Marxist left, and a product of our unhappy time in which the majority of the theoretical work conducted in the name of Marxism takes place in the academy rather than in political parties. Consequently, it is not at all rare to encounter individuals whose knowledge of postmarxist literature is broad, but who have not assimilated some of Marx's most basic concepts.\n\nSecond, even if your condescension were justified and I were unfamiliar with Meek, Robinson, Kalecki, one can work from first principles and quickly see your mistake here. It is completely untrue, as you suggest in your summary of Meek, to claim that in the modern world competition is the exception, which implies monopoly supplants competition rather than being an intensification of it. There is no branch of production, there is no sector of the modern economy, in which monopoly has abolished competition. Rather, as Marx recognised and Lenin further insisted, monopoly is an intensification of competition and only ever a partial negation of it: \"competition implies Monopoly, and monopoly implies competition.\" (Marx)\n\nA basic familiarity with the workings of any of the leading monopolies in any branch of production from pharmaceuticals and automotive to energy and financial services would demonstrate this.\n\nIf monopoly entirely removes the labour theory of value from any determinant role in pricing, then the OP is absolutely right to ask the question: what then is determining it? Robinson and Kaleci's characteristic attempts to fuse Marxian concepts with discredited notions of vulgar economics only creates an incoherent mess. Of course marginal cost impacts on pricing models, but what underlying value is being modified?\n\nIt is true that Marx's model of values being determined by socially necessary labour time only holds at a very high level of abstraction, deliberately leaving out as it does differentials driven by unevenness in rates of labour productivity. Once we factor those in as Marx does with his concept of the prices of production, we arrive at cost price plus the average rate of profit. Monopoly, to whatever degree it operates, enables the distribution of a greater or a lesser share of the aggregate profit to a given enterprise whether through higher prices or increased labour productivity through the introduction of technology at scale . There is no logical or practical reason why the operation of monopoly should be regarded as eliminating the law of value as a determinant price. \n\nI am not a huge fan of Paul Mattick's work, but he is absolutely right here when, quoting Marx from Vol 3 of Capital, he explains:\n\n\"Competition and monopoly have something to do with the distribution of profits. Competition \"cannot balance anything but inequalities in the rate of profit.\"It may bring about \"a price of commodities by which every capital yields the same profit in proportion to its magnitude; ... the only thing it tells us is that the rate of profit must have a certain figure.\" The dominance of monopolies may interfere with the distribution of profits according to the size of capital invested in different branches of production and within each single branch. For shorter or longer periods the monopolists secure for themselves extra-profits which reduce the profitability of non-monopolistic business. By preventing the free movement of capital within a sphere of production and from one sphere to another, by monopolizing a certain product or a number of products, by political means and by all sorts of controls and devices that hinder competition by outsiders the monopolists reduce the profits of non-monopolistic enterprisers below the average that may be obtained under more perfect competitive conditions.\"",

There are also many people who have knee jerk reactions to superficial descriptions of things. Hence the myriad criticisms of the labor theory of value that could be debunked by its critics reading two sentences out of *Capital*. If you came out with more than \"You're wrong,\" I might have assumed and responded with more.\n\n(2) I'm curious what you mean by Kalecki's attempt to \"fuse Marxian concepts with discredited notions of vulgar economics.\" Robinson, I think, would wear that description as a badge of pride. But Kalecki explicitly rejected equilibrium from the get go, and based his most well known pieces directly off the business cycle model in volume 2. Just off first impressions, I think that description is unfair.\n\n(3) You could continue to assume a general rate of profit brought about by competition (although a major point of Sweezy's and Baran's is precisely the fact that monopolies/oligopolies are more risk averse than small firms, and hence do not approach a general rate of profit in the same fashion), but then the question shapes up into the way Meek put it: can it be said that profit continues to derive solely from surplus value in the production process? Amazon's margins are, oftentimes, very low, or negative - they nonetheless are successful because of numerous debt instruments. In that case, the better part of profit is brought about in a pseudo-mercantilist \"profit on alienation\" way, not through surplus-value. You could say volume 3 still applies as, in your argument, a lower threshold, but volume 1 seems to lose its luster. Surplus value /= profit.\n\nFor the record:\n\n>One must be careful, however, not to exaggerate the extent to which the coming of monopoly capitalism has invalidated the traditional analyses based on the assumption of free competition. Monopoly does not mean the end of competition, and may even at times (e.g., during periods of price war) mean an intensification of competition.\n\nRonald Meek, *Studies in the Labor Theory of Value*\n\n>One further qualification: while price competition is normally taboo in oligopolistic situations, this does not mean that it is totally excluded or that it never plays an important role. Any company or group of companies that believes it can permanently benefit from aggressive price tactics will not hesitate to use them.\n\nPaul Sweezy and Paul Baran, *Monopoly Capital*",

The whole \u201cqualitative\u201d aspects thing. But if you take volume 1\u2019s analysis at face value, the point is that aggregate surplus value today differs dramatically from aggregate profit. You seem to be suggesting that you could add a coefficient to the calculation of value which would eliminate price\u2019s divergence, but I frankly don\u2019t know what real meaning could be given to that coefficient. The degree of monopoly doesn\u2019t work, because, as we\u2019ve established, some highly concentrated industries are very competitive, and in some periods are not generating profit. Not to mention the fact that an oligopoly like the automotive industry has totally different degrees across the board (Ford vs. Ferrari, for instance), but the company that attracts the most investment is far and away Tesla, whose margins lie somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe amount of investment in a single corporation depends on so many factors\u2014some which I would argue are entirely qualitative (history, cultural values and taboos, psychology, etc.)\u2014that I think you could only create that coefficient in hindsight, i.e. by adding the level of investment to profit. To me, it seems like a macroeconomic question you\u2019re forcing yourself to answer before you start with microeconomics. To the extent that it\u2019s a macroeconomic question, I again refer you to Kalecki, Sweezy, and Baran, the former of whom *did* add aggregate investment to aggregate profit and came up with many interesting insights on both and other items in a capitalist economy because of it. I\u2019d also say the labor theory of value can still be given meaning here, where labor is still the cause and motor of the economy. To the extent that it\u2019s a microeconomic question, I\u2019m just unconvinced that there\u2019s a way out which doesn\u2019t involve *ex post facto* contrivance. If you start with socially-necessary labor-time, you have to adjust the value of socially-necessary labor-time by multiplying it by a coefficient whose value can only be discovered in hindsight, to then circumvent the suppression of competition by monopolies in the transformation problem, and to then relegate prices of production to a subordinate role as merely a lower boundary in the determination of monopoly-price. Moreover, if that\u2019s what you want to do, you can just start with prices of production and move on from there (which is what Sraffa, Robinson, Steedman, etc. sought to do).\n\nOr you could do what I did and say that Marx\u2019s political-economic system cannot be applied mechanically to the modern day, but his fundamental insight, that the source of profit under capitalism is the exploitation of labor, is still true.",
