            "body": "Think about where you are in your life and what you could pitch in with. Are you a tenant? If so, try to find out if there are any folks organising around housing issues. Are you a worker? If so, try to find out if any of your colleagues are a member of a union, and if they're active. If not then try to speak with your coworkers about common issues you might be facing. Focus on the low hanging fruit at first, anything small is a good organising issue to start off with. It could even be that the water cooler is always broken and you could collectively demand that it's replaced with a new one. Something that will show your colleagues that when you act collectively then you can make positive improvements in your workplace. Chances are once you start doing this you'll have more bonds with your colleagues, and talk about the problems you're facing at work. This can lead to more conversations about joining a union etc etc. \n\n\n\nI could go into it more, but I understand your \"want and feel the need to connect with other like-minded people\" - but I think that can often be activism rather than organising. In organising you work together with people who hold all kinds of views on specific issues which affect them and get the goods. Doesn't matter which party they vote for, their gender, sexuality or anything - just that you have the same class interests. Check out this from Jane McAlevey on deep organising: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6P\\_2jt\\_Vs&ab\\_channel=Jacobin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl6P_2jt_Vs&ab_channel=Jacobin) \n\nIf you're wanting to do activism or helping the world be a better place more broadly - I'd say that migrants and refugees need a hell of a lot of support and charities/activist orgs etc need volunteers. See if there's anything in your area! Or Palestine - do I need to say more than that.",

Activists want to \"make the world a better place\". They're a priviledged stratum doing what amounts to solidary charity: sacrificing their timenergy for others.\n\n\n\nMutualistic organizing consists of pooling resources for one's own benefit. They can have great expansive potential once they get off the ground. Sadly, it can be hard to find a niche for new ones and even harder to actually build the organization. Imo activists should primaripy be concerned with starting up mutualistic organizations.",
