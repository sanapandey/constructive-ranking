But sometimes a monarchy was better than oligarchy in that the monarch already has \"ultimate\" power/wealth whereas oligarchs generally want to get richer and more powerful at the expense of everyone else.  Of course there can be awful kings too.\n\nIf you're curious about history and economics, including that of the church, I recommend Michael Hudson.",

There were often servile wars if the peasants were treated too harshly, so there was some limited mechanism of labor power. The church was sometimes a mediating force between the other two estates. In particular, religious laws against usuary protected people somewhat from forms of debt and slavery that were more common in antiquity. It's a nuanced topic. The shift from monoarchical feudalism to \"democratic\" capitalism helped some and worsened things for others.",

They aren't powerful enough to exploit anymore and have been replaced as the systemic oppressors by the capitalist classes. \n\nHowever, if we go all the way back to their foundation point then, yes they were exploitative. They maintained a feudal state that ensured people remained in their economic \"class\" regardless of ability or intelligence. They then profited from a mercantile class that brought riches from overseas and expanded their imperial territory and control. This led to the current Bourgeois era, where they fulfil no real purpose but still profit off the backs of the workers and underclasses. So, even now they are indirectly exploitative. \n\nThe Catholic Church benefitted from, and promoted, monarchies. They were an advocate for the expansion of European empires in an effort to control (through Catholic monarchies) more people and land. The Church earned insane amounts of money through taxation from these Catholic monarchs. Therefore, challenging monarchies would be self-defeating. Besides, it is effectively a monarchy in itself, the Pope is effectively a King. \n\nHis domain isn't territorial (anymore, they used to rule much of Southern Europe as the \"Papal States\", and got a cut from almost every transaction between Europe and the Middle and Far East as they controlled Venice which was a vital part of the \"Silk Road\") but in the mind. In feudal and mercantile times, the Catholic Church profiteered from their subjects in a similar way to other monarchies. By taking land, theft, taxation and (effective or actual) slavery. Now, they still act like any monarchy of the modern day. Abuse their ceremonial position to extract money.",

Ultimately they\u2019re both structures which oppress the proletariat. Monarchy and religion exploit mutual nodes of oppression and each enhances the oppressive potential of the other \n\nThe Catholic Church supported the Nazis and child rapists, it\u2019s odd to expect them to decry monarchism unless it directly benefits them to do so (benefits to a catholic might mean increased revenue for the church, increased anti-semitism, increased queer suicides etc etc.)",

It\u2019s just another form of class stratification and oppression via the usage of authoritarian power. Monarchies, clergy and aristocracies extracted a portion of produced goods via a tax levied on serfs, which directly benefited those in power (the monarchy and aristocracy supporting them). \n\nIn return, they offered \u201cprotection,\u201d and \u201cblessings from the lord.\u201d So, it was just a form of extortion by a thug ruling class, no better than a mafia. At least the capitalist provides the raw materials and space for production to take place. The monarch just robs you at the edge of a sword.",
