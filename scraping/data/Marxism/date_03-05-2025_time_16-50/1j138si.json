    "selftext": "Hello I should start with saying a few years back I started a leftist activist organization and got burned out on organizing from that. Too many immature people who were constantly tearing people down for the job they were doing without offering any constructive feedback.\n\nI'm extremely burned out from organizing because of that. On top of that I'm also extremely busy as a self employed person and am struggling a lot with my mental health right now (ADHD/AUTISM/DEPRESSION/ANXIETY). But despite all of that I want to fight back right now...There's so much work we need to do, the rising tide of fascism is threatening to drown all of us, and we have a world to win!\n\nSo I'm hoping to get some ideas for praxis given my limited bandwidth....I appreciate any help you can offer comrades!",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Marxism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "I may not have the answer for what I'm sure is a difficult place to be right now. Still, I feel that revolutionary activities that don't require as much interaction with people may be the right route. for example, you could leave fliers with information on them about the place to raise awareness. Additionally, carefully managing the kinds of people you interact with and setting appropriate boundaries can be very helpful for that kind of social burnout. Try to make your resistance a more wholesome and fun activity as anybody not just people who struggle with mental health can find the politics very taxing when you take them super seriously 100% of the time.",
