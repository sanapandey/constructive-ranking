Hell, for months the nationalists largely ignored the Japanese in order to fight the communists. Any alliance with the bourgeois was untenable, extremely short-lived, and the lives of many revolutionaries were wasted trying to unify with enemies of the workers and peasants in China.\n\nThe collaboration of bourgeois and petty bourgeois members of oppressed peoples with the oppressors is a major obstacle for national liberation struggles. An obstacle that must be overcome rather than being ignored if the effort is to be successful.",

The Israeli security apparatus is also known to blackmail gay Palestinians to weaponize them and the bigotry they face. These are real issues for liberation.\n\nI will admit that neither of these are smoking guns but they are ways in which the oppressor can manipulate elements of a national resistance movement which are not built on a proletarian base to weaken the movement.\n\nMy larger point is that the political character of movements is always important and not a question to be left until after the struggle is won. It can be a question of if the struggle can be won and to what degree.\n\nThe example I have had in mind through this discussion is the Irish Republican movement which was fractured by an offer of a small partial victory and where the working class factions were defeated when the Irish bourgeois faction accepted a half measure.\n\nI worry a great deal about the betrayal of Palestinian liberation because of this (and other similar) history.",

The turning point in the war against Japan was once Chiang Kai Shek was forced to end the civil war after patriotic elements of the KMT had risen above him and demanded peace.

No other historian apart from the niche ideology you subscribe to agrees with you that the KMT-CPC pact was a waste of time. Maybe spend more time listening to the communists that came before you rather than spouting drivel on the internet.",

The defeat of the Japanese imperialists was only possible because of the united front.\u00a0\n\n\u00ab\u00a0The desperate situation of the red army in the 1930s is a lesson against working with the bourgeoisie. \u00bb\n\nWhat hurdles have you jumped to come to this conclusion? The Japanese invaders were defeated and the Chinese revolution succeeded soon after when the consciousness of the masses realised only the CPC could carry forward the Chinese revolution. Revolution requires sacrifice and any revolutionary should be ready to put their life in the line if they truly believe in their praxis. Revolution is not pretty and lives lost should be minimised. However the lives lost up until the alliance and subsequent defeat of the Japanese imperialists saved countless lives from death and slavery.

Like with the battle in Hebei between the red army and KMT militia and the ignoring of direct orders from KMT superiors by red army officers. These decisions were key to advancing the red army and the bourgeois were correctly treated as enemies throughout the united front.\n\nWhere the CPC failed they failed by giving deference and control to the KMT and where they succeeded they treated the KMT as hostile and pursued their own goals outside of the united front. This is because the bourgeois are enemies of the working class and the peasantry and alliances with them are dangerous, short-lived, and will collapse into one side winning over the other.",

The organizations in that tendency/family have \\*traditionally\\* supported the two state solution because the 'Israeli settlers also have a right to national self determination'. Following similar logic,  Ted Grant organizations (in this case the Committee for a Workers International and the International Socialist Alternative) \"respected\" the rights of British settlers in the Malvinas even though those islands were colonial possessions of Britain that should have been Argentina. For how they began as a British organization, they had a pretty cringe-y position on Ireland too.\n\nSo the poster ACAFWD  is correct about the history. Here are some details: [https://s92d78bb733e1903e.jimcontent.com/download/version/1674941135/module/14374552527/name/RevCom\\_NS%2384%20%28Grantites%29\\_WEB.pdf](https://s92d78bb733e1903e.jimcontent.com/download/version/1674941135/module/14374552527/name/RevCom_NS%2384%20%28Grantites%29_WEB.pdf)\n\nHOWEVER, like DSA itself, the people who are in Reform and Revolution are mostly new folks who shouldn't be shouldered with the detritus of moldy theories from dead dudes.",

To do otherwise is insulting to these people and a departure from actual politics. \n\n2. This isn\u2019t always a plus. You need to have a more radical position for your own group to push the movement in a more radical position. \n\n3. The one state solution is the only solution. It\u2019s not the immediate concern now with the genocide going on but currently any time the two state solution is mentioned in any capacity we have to contest that. \n\n4. Fuck off with this liberal nonsense of needing to fall behind the democrats again. They\u2019re literally perpetrating a genocide right now, I would\u2019ve thought that would give some clarity on the lesser evilism arguments that constantly is brought out for democrat lichlords like Biden. Communists don\u2019t take a position because it is popular because nebulous \u201cblacks, women\u201d take that position (as if communists can\u2019t be black or women), we take a principled position. That means not forming an electoral front with a right wing capitalist party that\u2019s responsible for imperialism and genocide. Our power is not with bs electoral machinations, it\u2019s leading a mass movement forward. This means being oppositional to the democrats and any of their opportunists like AOC. Otherwise we will lead the movement forward into a place that goes nowhere - supporting the democrats. Radical politics will never actually build unless we stake them out independently. We aren\u2019t populists, we don\u2019t just do what the masses want, we do what takes the mass movement forwards. \n\nThis is so aggressively liberal it hurts",
