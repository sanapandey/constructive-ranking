            "body": "I would recommend E P Thompson's The Poverty of Theory. I haven't read it in years so cannot remember which of Althusser's readings he covers but the book as a whole is a fantastic critique of Althusser. You may or may not agree with Thompson's conclusions but it is a very astute response to Althusser from a fellow Marxist. In short, Thompson is far more empirically based in general and takes Althusser to task for basing his theories overly in theoretical discourse rather than in the material conditions of the working class. For fun and a really in depth and long read, I'd also read The Making of the English Working Class by Thompson.",
