    "selftext": "So I'm having a bit of an issue dealing with the endogenity of various variables in different models.\n\nOne of the things I'm struggling with is the wage rate in classical models. Namely, the wage rate is given as an exogenous variable most of the time.\n\nBut why exactly is that the case? The wage rate is set at the minimum needed to get a worker to come back to work tomorrow right? So like basic necessities they need to survive and live and stuff, food, water, housing, etc.\n\nBut here's what I don't understand. The price of the means of subsistence (the bundle of commodities that the worker buys with the wage rate) is determined endogenously, as the commodities that make it up are... commodities right? And the whole point of the price system is to describe their price.\n\nSo if the price of the means of subsistence is determined endogenously, how exactly is the wage rate exogenous to the price system? After all the wage rate is just the price of the means of subsistence right?\n\nI guess the actual bundle of commodities isn't endogenous, but then how can we treat the wage rate as a price if the actual exogenous thing is the actual bundle of commodities and not their price and thereby the wage rate?\n\nCan I get some help clarifying?\n\n  \n",
