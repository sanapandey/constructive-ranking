I think it was an effective symbol during the 19th and early 20th century but, at least coming from a global north perspective, it feels a little outdated.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, it also has a bad wrap (at least in the US). Do y\u2019all think it\u2019s still an effective symbol or are there better ones out there?",

Maybe in the very top of capitalist societies the peasentry doesn't exist or in a very small number but the proletariat does in a huge number for sure. \n\nSo no I personally don't find a need to replace the classic symbol, but I do argee with experimenting with newer stuff in our arts.",

At least in the US, classical peasants (I.e. those who work on farms and survive off subsistence living) don\u2019t really exist anymore as far as I know. Obviously there are arguments to be made about modern peasantry.\n\nI agree that Marxist will always be vilified, but I think for a lot of regular folks the classic symbol gives an immediate emotional response which may make them disregard the movement immediately, if that makes sense",

The hammer and sickle, even if created by USSR, to most people is synonymous with a very specific thing, communism. Sure they'll still ask you about Stalin, but that would've been the case whether using the symbol or saying you're a communist.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nTo me it signifies the idea itself, first and foremost, I don't necessarily associate it with the Soviets. I would also be fine with any other symbol replacing it, if it was as good at signifying communism.\u00a0",

The peasantry doesn't exist in the West and hasn't existed as a relevant political group since 1900 at the latest.\nThe necessary class alliance in the West would be industrial workers, service workers, and pensioners. I'm partly joking here but a better symbol for a western Communist project would be some combination of a computer mouse, a hammer, and a walking stick.",

The thing is that many countries outside the GN do still have a peasantry, and communism is, after all, a global movement, one which has historically been lead by countries outside the GN.\n\n\nI could see a more customized hamsic being adopted (like the gdr and dprk ones) but I'm not sure i can see a rejection of the hamsic altogether. From a strategic level i don't imagine that trying to distance ourselves from 20th century communism will be compelling to people who think they hate communism",

I think in the GS it makes a lot of sense and probably has less of a negative connotation there.\n\nI\u2019m curious about your last point- why do you believe that? On the right, it\u2019s been quite obvious that many people are completely okay with the ideals of fascism if it doesn\u2019t have a swastika attached. I think symbols and names have a lot more power than you\u2019d think",

Unlike fascists, communists want to elevate the consciousness of the masses, bring them to class consciousness. Otherwise their \"support\" would be fickle and unlikely to yield mass participation.\n\n2. People have already more-or-less tried this. Like the whole game of the DSA is to try and separate themselves from 20th century communism, and have you seen how that works out? the most ardent anti-communists (rightly, in my estimation) just accuse them of being shame-faced crypto-communists. How compelling is that, to support an ideology whose history youre trying to distance yourself from? On the other hand, wouldnt it impress on people more to hear that they've been lied to by the capitalist press and schools about communist history?\n\n3. The people we want to reach most at this moment, the people who are most likely to become ardent revolutionaries, are probably not the people who are going to be turned away by symbols. The ardent anti-communists are probably the last group of people you'd focus on in any revolutionary strategy, and even then it's a toss up whether you'd be able to get them any closer to you than \"not actively hostile.\" Or in other words, whether you'd be able to win them over or only to isolate them (see [Mao](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-3/mswv3_13.htm#:~:text=The%20masses%20in,the%20backward%20elements))\n\nHaving said that, I agree to the extent that if I were trying to persuade someone I would first discuss in broad strokes without bringing up symbols, ideologies, jargon, etc. The question is more-so, once you have someone (a friend, a coworker, a neighbor, etc) interested in learning more, in what direction are you sending them?",

I agree with this- I was more referring to the messaging rather than the actual ideology (I.e. instead of saying \u201cabolish private property\u201d, which a lot of average folks take to mean \u201cwe are taking your house away\u201d, you could say \u201cbusinesses should be owned by their workers\u201d (obviously I\u2019m sure there are better ways to phrase it but you understand my meaning.\n2. I pretty much agree with this too- I don\u2019t think the ideology should be hidden at all. What I mean is it should be sold better to the average worker, as the methods education we are using are often decades or even centuries old.\n3. I actually disagree with this. If you talk to the average American they have absolutely no idea what Marxism is. It\u2019s not that they are fervently anti communist, they just genuinely think it\u2019s as bad as Nazism because that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been taught all their life.",

Communism has always made people feel uncomfortable, it's not the symbols we use that they fear tho, the bourgeoisie *should* feel uncomfortable, this is expected. It's not by \"rebranding\" communism that we'll make progress, this is not something we can \"sell\" to people by using a new fancy logo. \n\nThe peasantry (at least in the way it existed in 1917 Russia) might be less relevant nowadays, but there's definitely a reason why the hammer and sickle stuck, it has a strong historical value and it gets the point across. It is provocative, but that's a good thing.\n\n> The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.\n\n([The Communists Manifesto, chapter 4](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch04.htm))",

For example, even using basic terms like proletarian outside of academic circles can alienate folks who have no idea what that means. \n\nIt\u2019s just the general strategy of appealing to people rather than trying to stay as ideologically pure as possible I guess",

I agree in some contexts it's justified to use a more adaptive language, for example if someone just hear you say \"communism\" or \"Marxism\" and they don't want to hear anything anymore because of their preconceived ideas of it. But I think it's better to clarify it as soon as possible if they seem to agree with the content (but not the format). \n\nI also agree that for surface level or introductory stuff, an overly technical jargon can make some people feel uninterested, it makes the learning process less smooth, in a way. But again I think if they want to learn anything deeper... they'll have to learn the complicated words eventually too.\n\nIn my opinion, the symbols (or words) we use aren't really something we can just decide on as some sort of marketing strategy tho. For example the hammer and sickle stuck because it's rooted in history, it resonated with people because it reflected past struggle and victory, and still today it reminds people of the revolutionary history we're building on. Attempting to just adopt new symbols, quite frankly, sounds meaningless and like a distraction to me, especially if they aren't tied to concrete change and collective action, they'd exist in a vacuum and would never stick, they would be empty designs.",

Even if we (on an individual level) decide to use different symbols, it doesn't matter if society doesn't relate to them and doesn't decide to adopt them on a broader level, and symbols gain meaning and influence because they represent our own societal experience. As I said the hammer and sickle is a good example because of its strong historical background, same with the red flag and its historical ties to the Paris commune (tho it was used prior to this too). We (as society) adopt symbols because they reflect our reality, a symbol that's adopted for strategical purposes, as a marketing tool, without any ties to such strong events (which is what I mean by concrete change and collective action) won't stick with the people the same way.",
