    "selftext": "First of all in this context opiates means to numb the discomfort of lower income manual labor lifestyle. When the democratic party doesnt promote enough ideas related to easing the burden of being a lower income person, it creates a situation where people will prefer to use metaphysical beliefs to escape the discomfort. In some way the competition is between the metaphysical approach to dealing with discomfort vs the material approach. When people believe the material approach is not attainable theyll turn towards beliefs that give them emotional strength. It doesnt have to be a particular religion, but rather some sort of belief that gives people emotional willpower. Trump, fascism and general right wing ideology is foundationed upon beliefs that make people feel strong. ",

Gnostic analysis of an Abrahamic god (and I'm paraphrasing/simplifying) casts it as the \"demiurge,\" a selfish and false god who created religion to serve itself, and holds that the only divinity is the one-ness of the universe, and the path to enlightenment is to seek personal knowledge of the divine through transcendent experience.

And because there is a large oral tradition among indigenous religions, there was a flexibility in the transmission of those traditions rather than a rigid dogma. Cultures were more willing to accept new rituals depending on the community.\n\nIn contrast, Abrahamic religions require a strict dogma. Considering Islam, proximity to trade routes allowed for the ideas and religious beliefs to spread through North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Similarly, Christianity spread through Roman trade networks. The reason that Abrahamic religions require strict dogma is because they require the unification of very different populations and cultures and they need to adhere to specific principles in order to legitimize the political stability necessary to maintain the trade and economic networks that allowed them to spread in the first place. Monotheism allows a cohesive moral worldview that can unify peoples from across multiple continents.\n\nSimilarly, Trump offers a cohesive moral worldview that unifies through different ethnic groups with simple solutions.",

There was not always a singular Jewish people. There were a myriad of tribes that served as minorities under various empires like the Babylonians and Roman Empires. It wasn\u2019t until polytheistic religions began to subside that a unified Jewish people became to serve as an identity. But there were many tribes until that.\n\nVedic religions reinforced existing political orders. They reinforced a hierarchical social order through its emphasis on ritual purity and caste duties - much like Christianity/Islam require adherence to the political and social order to be legitimate.\n\nBuddhism fostered transnational networks through pilgrimage routes, trade connections, and monastic exchanges across Asia. It provided an alternative to the hierarchy Vedic religions, again relying on universal principles and morals. Buddhism is also very flexible - like American indigenous cultures - and were able to include local cultures while maintaining core teachings.\n\nThe trade comment only existed to justify how religions spread so rapidly. The fact that Judaism is not widespread supports what I said.",

That being said, I'm not certain the \"material\" approach of the Democrats really has the ability to ease the discomfort. It's a stopgap against making things much worse in the short term (truly better than the Republicans) while not in any way altering the ultimate dynamics of power or providing more meaningful and lasting empowerment (metaphysical or material). I like your analogy but suspect it gives the Democratic Party too much credit.",

An uncontrolled nationalist style religion is truly a drug that blinds people's natural moral and ethical compass, evaporating class consciousness and any compassion for those \"below them\" in the set system. idk this is just my take, the evaporation of any semblance of class consciousness today compared to say the 1970s is concerning for anyone that wants Marxist led progress.",

Rational economic appeals to the mind never hit as hard as appeals to emotion. The Democrats are also outrageously arrogant, demanding that the working class vote for them, while at the same time disdaining them for being backwards and insufficiently socially enlightened. If your party disdains the traditional belief systems of the majority of the country, you cant\u2019t expect them to win.\nI voted for Kamala, because I think the Republican party is openly anti-democratic and fascist now, but think the Democratic party has a losing platform in presidential elections for the foreseeable future. It\u2019s beliefs are minority principles endorsed by an elite, for whom equality is mostly a parlor game to show off their expensive educations. It\u2019s the party of condescending rich coastal elites now",
