Would rejecting definitions then mean asserting that one cannot holistically reveal the undergirding processes and contradictions within something through a simple sentence or two?",

In Goethe\u2019s thinking the very same concept of productivity that is central in Spinoza as well as in Hegel and Marx, was a cornerstone. \u201cThe divine,\u201d he says, \u201cis effective in that which is alive, but not in that which is dead. It is in that which is becoming and evolving, but not in that which is completed and rigid. That is why reason, in its tendency toward the divine, deals only with that which is becoming, and which is alive, while the intellect deals with that which is completed and rigid, in order to use it.\u201d [61]\nWe find similar criticisms in Schiller and Fichte, and then in Hegel and in Marx, who makes a general criticism that in his time \u201ctruth is without passion, and passion is without truth.\u201d [62]\u201d\n\nI find a similar dislike for a definition in Ilyenkov when writing about dialectical logic.\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/essays/essayint.htm\n\u201cThe concept \u2018concept\u2019 itself is also very closely allied with the concept of thought. To give a \u2018definition\u2019 of it here would be easy, but would it be of any use? If we, adhering to a certain tradition in Logic, tend to understand by \u2018concept\u2019 neither \u2018sign\u2019 nor \u2018term defined through other terms\u2019, and not simply a \u2018reflection of the essential or intrinsic attributes of things\u2019 (because here the meaning of the insidious words \u2018essential\u2019 and \u2018intrinsic\u2019 come to the fore), but the gist of the matter, then it would be more correct, it seems to us, to limit ourselves in relation to definition rather to what has been said, and to start to consider \u2018the gist of the matter\u2019, to begin with abstract, simple definitions accepted as far as possible by everyone. In order to arrive at the \u2018concrete\u2019, or in this case at a Marxist-Leninist understanding of the essence of Logic and its concretely developed \u2018concept\u2019.\nEverything we have said determines the design and plan of our book. At first glance it may seem that it is, if not wholly, then to a considerable degree, a study in the history of philosophy. But the \u2018historical\u2019 collisions of realising the \u2018matter of Logic\u2019 is not an end-in-itself for us, but only the factual material through which the clear outlines of the \u2018logic of Matter\u2019 gradually show through [See Marx\u2019s Contribution to the Critique of Hegel\u2019s Philosophy of Right], those very general outlines of dialectics as Logic which, critically corrected and materialistically rethought by Marx, Engels and Lenin, also characterise our understanding of this science.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a working through the material rather than proposing the framework before a task as if concepts are independent of analysis and may be selected arbitrarily.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/pilling/works/capital/geoff2.htm\n\u201cEngels characterises this method \u2013 this starting with so-called \u2018principles\u2019 or \u2018laws\u2019 which are tested against \u2018the facts\u2019 as ideological \u2013 as a method which inverts the true process by which knowledge develops.\nThe general results of the investigation of the world are obtained at the end of this investigation, hence are not principles, points of departure, but results, conclusions. To construct the latter in one\u2019s head is ideology, an ideology which tainted every species of materialism hitherto existing. (Engels, Anti-Duhring)\nAnd Engels immediately points out the roots of this ideology: it rested on a lack of understanding of the origin of thought in definite historical-social conditions. \u2018While in nature the relationship of thinking to being was certainly to some extent clear to materialism in history it was not, nor did materialism realise the dependence of all thought upon the historical material conditions obtaining at the particular time.\u2019\nThis method of starting from principles (instead of abstracting them in the course of theoretical work) was essentially the same as starting from abstract definitions, into which the facts are then \u2018fitted\u2019.\u201d",

For example, in chapter 10 his entire analysis of the working day in this section assumes A-B (value of labour power) to be constant throughout. Marx of course acknowledges this, for in chapter 12 he then assumes  that A-B is variable. Marx's tendency to abstract then seems to constantly get us closer to this unified whole at the end. I guess the difference here is that he does not stop at this static abstraction, but utilizes it to eventually synthesize processes in constant motion.",

Indeed its only in volume 3 things get more dynamic but with the equation of value and exchange value Marx is able to illustrate concepts unnoticed in political economy.\n\nIt\u2019s not a science of some operationalized definition an experiment and then conclusion of how the data fits the hypothesis. Rather he spent 25 years doing empirical research which he then presented in a sort of logical form which also reflects in some degree the historical development of capitalism not in specific facts but in its essential qualities, stripped of their actual history in large degree.\n\nI guess having an abstract definition may be useful in the beginning of learning a thing but knowing that Marx defines class based on a relationship to production while a great insight is different from reading capital and see how he develops the existence of class later on. He doesn\u2019t presume class like Ricardo but shows its necessity within production. This for example would help shift focus from seeing everything as originating in class but that class conflict originates within the relations of production itself and is a more essential relation to keep in mind.",

                    "body": "And to emphasize an issue with definitions without to regard to their origins, Marx notes categories of how money is used in order to discuss how it reflects the changes in production relations. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/pilling/works/capital/ch05.htm#5.1\n\u201cFor Marx, money fulfils the following functions:\n1 Measure of value\n2 Medium of commodity circulation\n3 Means of accumulation (hoarding)\n4 Means of payment\n5 World money\n\nRight from the start we should be careful to realize that Marx is not \u2018defining\u2019 money in any abstract sense. \u2018It is not a question here of definitions which things must be made to fit. We are dealing here with definite functions which must be expressed in definite categories\u2019 (11, p. 230). This point, which has considerable importance for \n\nMarx\u2019s method as a whole, applies entirely to his notion of money. Marx, in his treatment of the functions of money, is actually pointing to the role which money, appearing as a thing, plays in the organization of the social relations of capitalist production. As with all his categories, the functions of money express production relations and the various functions represent the changes taking place in the production relations which the development of capitalism brings. This is stressed by Marx when he says,\n\nThe particular functions of money which it performs, either as the mere equivalent of commodities, or as a means of circulation or means of payment, as hoard, or as universal money, point, according to the extent or relative preponderance of the one function or another, to very different stages in the process of social production. (I, p. 170; author\u2019s italics)\n\nHere once more is expressed the great gap separating Marx from vulgar political economy. Conventional economic thought contents itself with enumerating various types of money systems, some of which exist in reality, others merely in the imagination. Marx used to remark ironically how proud the economists were with the discovery that money was a commodity. But vulgar economy has forgotten even this discovery of its predecessors. For economic theory, especially since the collapse of the Gold Standard in the 1930s, the commodity is only one of a number of possible money-forms. On this view we seem to be offered a choice, as if we were able to select the most suitable money-type after considering all the advantages and disadvantages of the various possible alternatives. Needless to say, all such \u2018theories\u2019 are quite devoid of any historical sense. Neither money, nor any of the various functions it fills, are the result of \u2018discoveries\u2019; the various money systems did not arise because people consciously weighed their comparative advantages. They have all emerged out of definite social relations, or, more specifically, out of the contradictions of commodity production and circulation. For Marx, money reflects definite social relations, a point emphasized by Rubin when, in his discussion of the nature of fetishism, he deals with the various functions of money in the following way:\n\n1 If the transfer of goods from sellers to buyers and the inverse transfer are carried out simultaneously, then money assumes the function, acts as, a \u2018medium of circulation\u2019.\n\n2 if the transfer of goods precedes the transfer of money, and the relation between sellers and buyers is transformed into a relation between debtor and creditor, then money has now assumed the form of a \u2018means of payment\u2019.\n\n3 If the seller keeps the money which he receives from his sale, postponing the moment when he enters a new relationship as a purchaser, then money has acquired the function-form of a \u2018hoard\u2019.\n\n4 Once the emergence of capitalism takes place and a relationship between a commodity owner (capitalist) and a commodity owner (the worker selling his labour power) is established through the transfer of money, then money has become transformed into capital. The money which directly connects the capitalist with the worker plays the role, or takes the form of \u2018variable capital\u2019. But to establish the necessary relationship with the worker, the capitalist must of necessity possess means of production, or money with which to buy the means of production. In this form money plays the role of \u2018constant capital\u2019.\n\nHere are expressed the various \u2018sides\u2019 or \u2018aspects\u2019 of money, as they have actually come into being. Marx\u2019s task (as with all the reified forms of bourgeois economy) was to grasp the historical character of the various functional forms of money, or its \u2018conceptually determined forms of existence\u2019, as the Grundrisse puts it. So the various functions of money cannot be reduced to a series of formal definitions, akin to those encountered in conventional textbooks of economics. The functions dealt with in Capital were the ones which money has actually played (and continues to play) in the evolution of bourgeois economy. The properties of money were abstracted from history. \u201d",

It is a movement, a circuit-describing process going through various stages, which itself comprises three different forms of circuit-describing process. Therefore it can be understood only as a motion, not as a thing at rest. Those who regard the gaining by value of independent existence as a mere abstraction forget that the movement of industrial capital is this abstraction in actu.\u201d\nCapital: Volume Two\n\nFor Marx, the capitalist mode of production is an expression of a social relation: capital exploiting wage labor. This understanding of capitalism cuts against the grain of our common conceptions and how we use ordinary language. For instance, in his critique of political economy, Marx calls the commodity a social relation, value a social relation, money a social relation, and capital a social relation. We typically think of these things as being nothing but static things, material objects; or, in the case of value, we think of it as a thing-like substance that somehow inheres in material objects (commodities). Marx was highly critical of this thing-like manner of thinking. He called it fetishism. And he believed the organization of capitalist society, its social relations, encouraged individuals to think in fetishistic ways\u2026",

The same thing can be expressed in another way, as follows: the form of the external. thing involved in the labour process is \u2018sublated\u2019 in the subjective form of objective activity (action on objects); the latter is objectively registered in the subject in the form of the mechanisms of higher nervous activity; and then there is the reverse sequence of these metamorphoses, namely the verbally expressed idea is transformed into a deed, and through the deed into the form of an external, sensuously perceived thing, into a thing. These two contrary series of metamorphoses form a closed cycle: thing\u2014deed\u2014word\u2014deed\u2014thing.

Ilyenkov compares the ideal to \u201cthe form of a jar growing under the hands of a potter.\u201d This ideal is situated neither in the piece of clay nor the body of the potter. It arises from the activity of transforming the clay into a jar. Thinking does not occur \u201cinside the head\u201d\u2014but through the interrelations of the hands, the clay, and the tools. Ilyenkov\u2019s conception of transindividual thinking breaks up the divide between material and social.\n\nAccordingly, we do not see through our eyes but with a thinking body that is the totality of social activity. Ideals are \u201ctransplanted\u201d into our bodies not through our senses but our interrelations.\u201d\n\nIt was Ilyenkov (and Andy Blunden) that really helped me understand how objective ideality is because its not individual perception, but collective activity and relations that maintain the ideality of money and such.",

They stand above and against him as objects, even though they may be objects of his own creation. Alienation is essentially experiencing the world and oneself passively, receptively, as the subject separated from the object.\n\nThe whole concept of alienation found its first expression in Western thought in the Old Testament concept of idolatry.[59] The essence of what the prophets call \u201cidolatry\u201d is not that man worships many gods instead of only one. It is that the idols are the work of man\u2019s own hands \u2014 they are things, and man bows down and worships things; worships that which he has created himself. In doing so he transforms himself into a thing. He transfers to the things of his creation the attributes of his own life, and instead of experiencing himself as the creating person, he is in touch with himself only by the worship of the idol. \n\nHe has become estranged from his own life forces, from the wealth of his own potentialties, and is in touch with himself only in the indirect way of submission to life frozen in the idols. [60] The deadness and emptiness of the idol is expressed in the Old Testament: \u201cEyes they have and they do not see, ears they have and they do not hear,\u201d etc. The more man transfers his own powers to the idols, the poorer he himself becomes, and the more dependent on the idols, so that they permit him to redeem a small part of what was originally his. The idols can be a godlike figure, the state, the church, a person, possessions. Idolatry changes its objects; it is by no means to be found only in those forms in which the idol has a socalled religious meaning. Idolatry is always the worship of something into which man has put his own creative powers, and to which he now submits, instead of experiencing himself in his creative act. Among the many forms of alienation, the most frequent one is alienation in language. If I express a feeling with a word, let us say, if I say \u201cI love you,\u201d the word is meant to be an indication of the reality which exists within myself, the power of my loving. \n\nThe word \u201clove\u201d is meant to be a symbol of the fact love, but as soon as it is spoken it tends to assume a life of its own, it becomes a reality. I am under the illusion that the saying of the word is the equivalent of the experience, and soon I say the word and feel nothing, except the thought of love which the word expresses. The alienation of language shows the whole complexity of alienation. Language is one of the most precious human achievements; to avoid alienation by not speaking would be foolish \u2014 yet one must be always aware of the danger of the spoken word, that it threatens to substitute itself for the living experience. The same holds true for all other achievements of man; ideas, art, any kind of man-made objects. They are man\u2019s creations; they are valuable aids for life, yet each one of them is also a trap, a temptation to confuse life with things, experience with artifacts, feeling with surrender and submission.\u201d\n\nWe must speak but be aware that words describe things and isn\u2019t reality itself.",

This mode of analysis can be compared with a chemical analysis of water in which water is decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen. The essential feature of this form of analysis is that its products are of a different nature than the whole from which they were derived. The elements lack the characteristics inherent in the whole and they possess properties that it did not possess. When one approaches the problem of thinking and speech by decomposing it into its elements, one adopts the strategy of the man who resorts to the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen in his search for a scientific explanation of the characteristics of water, its capacity to extinguish fire or its conformity to Archimedes law for example. This man will discover, to his chagrin, that hydrogen burns and oxygen sustains combustion. He will never succeed in explaining the characteristics of the whole by analysing the characteristics of its elements. Similarly, a psychology that decomposes verbal thinking into its elements in an attempt to explain its characteristics will search in vain for the unity that is characteristic of the whole. These characteristics are inherent in the phenomenon only as a unified whole. When the whole is analysed into its elements, these characteristics evaporate. In his attempt to reconstruct these characteristics, the investigator is left with no alternative but to search for external, mechanical forms of interaction between the elements.\nSince it results in products that have lost the characteristics of the whole, this process is not a form of analysis in the true sense of that word. At any rate, it is not \u201canalysis\u201d vis \u00e0 vis the problem to which it was meant to he applied. In fact, with some justification, it can be considered the antithesis of true analysis. The chemical formula for water has a consistent relationship to all the characteristics of water. It applies to water in all its forms. It helps us to understand the characteristics of water as manifested in the great oceans or as manifested in a drop of rain. The decomposition of water into its elements cannot lead to an explanation of these characteristics.\u201d\n\nOnce one begins from this concept, then one can build all the necessary relations that govern a thing rather than having a one sided abstraction that excludes some essential quality. One builds up a system of concepts and properly discerns the limits of those relationships.\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/1930/psychological-systems.htm\n\u201cOn the contrary, each attempt to solve the task consists of the formation of connections, and our knowledge of the object is enriched by the fact that we study it in connection with other objects.\n\nI will give an example. Let us compare the direct image of a nine, for example, the figures on playing cards, and the number 9. The group of nine on playing cards is richer and more concrete than our concept \u201c9,\u201d but the concept \u201c9\u201d involves a number of judgments which are not in the nine on the playing card; \u201c9\u201d is not divisible by even numbers, is divisible by 3, is 32, and the square root of 81; we connect \u201c9\u201d with the series of whole numbers, etc. Hence it is clear that psychologically speaking the process of concept formation resides in the discovery of the connections of the given object with a number of others, in finding the real whole. That is why a mature concept involves the whole totality of its relations, its place in the world, so to speak. \u201c9\u201d is a specific point in the whole theory of numbers with the possibility of infinite development and infinite combination which are always subject to a general law. Two aspects draw our attention: first, the concept is not a collective photograph. It does not develop by rubbing out individual traits of the object. It is the knowledge of the object in its relations, in its connections. Second, the object in the concept is not a modified image but, as contemporary psychological investigations demonstrate, a predisposition for quite a number of judgments. \u201cWhen a person says \u2018mammal,\u2019 asks one of the psychologists, what does it mean psychologically speaking?\u201d It means that the person can develop an idea and in the final analysis that he has a world view, for to determine the place of a mammal in the animal world and the place of the animal world in nature means to have an integral world view.\n\nWe see that the concept is a system of judgments brought into a certain lawful connection: the whole essence is that when we operate with each separate concept, we arc operating with the system as a whole.\u201d\n\nSo I agree that the whole is the truth, it\u2019s the journey in understanding each part of a thing in relation to everything else. To abstract a thing from those relations is part of the fetishism in political economy and modern economics. They confuse social relations with the material things because they don\u2019t understand the development and relation of things due to one sided abstractions that preclude the objective relations that are a prerequisite for things to occur as they do in capitalism.",

That is to say, to see the very complex relationships involved in order to give a nuanced critique of capitalism. \n\nThe social outcomes are part of a complex dynamical system of variables. You never go to market with just utility in hand to produce one sort of outcome. Market values are not just something that is determined by a transaction in a market. The definitions are not that simple. The definitions imply complexity and require a systems analysis.\n\nThink in terms simple linear relationship in a two variable equation vs complex relationships where multiple variables feed back into each other. For example, The way we have to interact with monopolies is not the same as the way two people barter in a market in order to get to a market valuation. The definition of market value is not a simple concept.\n\nWith this approach Marx was able to suggest that the accumulation of capital changes the dynamic negatively as well as positively. \n\nI think this is why Marx was cognizant that capitalism can get you part of the way towards what you want as a societal outcome and the workings of it eventually lead to the system cannibalizing itself.",
