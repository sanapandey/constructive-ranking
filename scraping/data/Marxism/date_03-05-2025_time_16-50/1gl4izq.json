Trump isn\u2019t necessarily himself conservative, he just appeals to that base who have been disenfranchised and frustrated with liberals. I understand 100% why he got elected. Nagging and lecturing proletarians over identity politics, while doing much of nothing to truly serve their interests, isn\u2019t a great platform. \n\nDo I expect him to fix anything? No. Why would a capitalist shoot them selves in the foot?",

Can you show me a time the Biden admin, or the Harris campaign 'lectured proletarians'?   and, while I absolutely don't think they did enough as the world is burning, the Biden admin, and thus the Harris camp, did more to build things for 'regular' America than any admin since Johnson or Roosevelt.   Did they advertise that? no.  But I thought this sub was for people who could see clearly.",

Harris was much the same, just having democrat supporters associated with her, who were heavily messaging the narrative of identity politics all over social media, damaged her ability to win as well.\n\nThis whole dynamic was furthered by the biased news media, who fed into the cultural war that keeps the proletariat from uniting. This I believe, is by design.\n\nI also won\u2019t deny Biden did things, and I would argue what he did was largely irrelevant, while refusing to stand up to literal genocide taking place in the Middle East. Now if Biden stood on a platform of taking money out of politics, nationalizing multiple industries and changing fundamental things at a constitutional level that would restore the way this democracy works, I would be more impressed. But just like other every other politician, he is bought off by corporate money.",

I don't believe \\*anyone\\* with any sort of slightly official tie to the Democratic party or Biden or Harris did so.     and please don't bring up the Biden 'garbage' comment, as it's not what he said, nor meant.\n\nI agree with you and would want those things you wish Biden had done. But he didn't run as a leftist, or a 'Social Democrat' or better, a socialist, or a communist... which is really where 'nationalizing industries' is at. (which, again, is where \\*I'm\\* at too) \n\nand unfortunately, a majority of Americans not only don't agree with those ideas, they have actively chosen the opposite.  If you/we think that some politician could actually win talking about these marxist ideas, we should run that person for office.  Otherwise, take what you can get. \n\nI certainly agree that the corporate media has a huge amount of blame here.",

His pitch to congress was that we needed to assist in overthrowing the Marxist rebels that effectively took over the country. Ronald Reagan is one of the capitalist Hall of Famers in my opinion, Trump is nowhere close.",

With Reagan, he was a neoliberal POS who ignored AIDS, but at least he could be funny and he did help stimulate the economy using ineffective trickle down crap. Trump isn't like them, he's a literal insane plutocrat slimeball who has hundreds of mindless worshippers who foam at the mouth and fight like children for his attention, and people willing to break all the rules in the constitution that they spent decades defending just so he can so things to help sidestep democracy (the same checks and balances the founding fathers created to prevent tyranny) and his legacy forever, to become the very thing the Founding Fathers dreaded. Nixon was a crook, Reagan was a liar, Trump is an enigma, a really terrifying one. He is George Washingtons nightmare made flesh.",

Nixon was a just as much a POS as Reagan, EPA and OSHA were  good calls, otherwise his foreign policy was dog shit I only say this as a reminder that the American foreign policy establishment has survived the neocon shift and overseas antics were never justified",

            "body": "Both Nixon and Reagan were nursed during the McCarthy Era, at the height of the Red Scare.  Both of them were terrified of both Marxism and Socialism, especially Reagan.  It is why he deregulated Capitalism so completely to economically defeat Communism, and it worked completely, before he left office Russia fell.  It took another several decades, but China is now a Capitalist Empire as well in disguise.  Although even Reagan wasn't foolish enough to get rid of the Glass-Seagal's Act, which kept the Banks from bankrupting and sending America into a decades long recession that was Bill Clinton's fault. Nixon destruction of the American economy  came about from the bill he got passed allowing HMO's to thrive and handing the Health Insurance Industry free rein over are Medical Care Industry to Insurance companies and the AMA and the ADA, fifty years later, those industries are well on its way to bankrupting our country.\n\nWhat people don't seem to understand or forget.  Is in 1972 the year I graduated High School I got a job paying the federal minimum wage, which at the time $1.95 an hour.  I was able to get an apartment, buy a truck, pay my bills and eat and go to the doctor if I needed, I wasn't rich by any means but I was starving.  I could but eight loaves of bread for an hours pay.  It is not that wheat was cheap, as it is the exact same price today.  It was about the fact that the businesses that made our economy great, had a Conscience, they didn't operate on the POP economic notion of **(Profit Over People)**.  Today's economy is all about **Capitalism without a Conscience**, which is the very definition of Pop Culture, whether it is about the Music, Clothing or Computer, or MainStream News Industry.  POP culture is now about the Commodification of all knowledge and information of all things in order to made the rich, richer,  It's about Intellectual Property Rights, over Human Rights.\n\nThe Main difference between Nixon and Reagan is they would be just as disgusted by the lack of the overall Self-Awareness and the Conscience of Business Communities, Wall Street and Politicians that America Capitalism now promotes and supports. as I am.  An Economy that leaves 70% of its population to struggle as the top 30% party.  As they say, **We Aren't the Greatest Country in the World Anymore**.\n\nSo to answer your question, I think both Nixon and Reagan would say, **What the Fu\\*k Did I Do to America**.",
