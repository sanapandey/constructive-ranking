    "selftext": "Who decides when the State can be abolished? \n\nMy Thoughts: \n\nThe centrality of the \"withering away of the state\" to Marx's framework is not based on the arbitrary will or edict of an individual or centralized body nor reliant on it. It arises organically from the material conditions of society evolving and the contradictions of class society resolving.\n\nThis transitional stage in the social revolution (*the dictatorship of the proletariat*) acts as a knife to the neck, decapitating the old bourgeois order and liberating the seeds of a classless society. Such a state is fundamentally different from the capitalist state\u2014it is but a transitional structure aimed at repressing the residual bourgeois resistance in the Community and reorganizing society on communal lines. It is not an end in itself, but rather a means to an end of the working class.\n\nWhen the state will wither away depends upon the progress of the necessary organisation, at some point, the need for a coercive apparatus to mediate class antagonism will fade. (A process that is dialectical: in abolishing itself as a class, the proletariat establishes a classless society, while on its side, the temporary state, which exists only as an effect of class antagonisms, becomes emptied of purpose and, eventually, disbands.)\n\nSo it\u2019s not that you have a leader or a committee that decides, but rather the material conditions of the society in transition which give rise to that decision. This process is directed by the collective consciousness and practice of the working masses. The functions of the state become obsolescent as the communal networks and cooperative mechanisms mature and the self-organization of society spreads, rendering the state as unnecessary in the same way that the self-organization of society renders the state obsolescent.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that this withering process is not automatic or guaranteed. If the transitional state hardens or becomes a ruling bureaucracy, it threatens to reproduce the systems of hierarchy it sought to abolish. That is why the alertness of the proletariat and its participation in the revolutionary process are the keys. Fading into obsolescence of stateness entails more than just a passive abandonment of the mechanisms of power it carries; it means actively (partaking in) dismantling them.\n\nIn short, the state will not wither away by way of edict, but by virtue of the proletariat\u2019s own revolutionary activity, the abolition of class distinctions, and the establishment of a social order grounded in the free association of producers. The working class, mobilized as it is with the same objective of its emancipation, remains the sole power that decides on this transition.\n\nDid I get it right?\n\nNote: I am an Anarcho-Communist (for more info: read Peter Kropotkin's Works such as \"The Conquest of Bread\") so I may have less knowledge on the Marxist View on this topic than others in this Subreddit ",

            "body": "Yes for the most part this is about right. We know that the various states that have existed have arisen due to the material conditions of the time, specifically due to class. And the given state at any given time or places serves different purposes depending on the dominant class. Today states like to pretend that they are impartial observers who make policy that is best for the \u201ccountry\u201d without any mention of class, but we can see how they reinforce the conditions for the bourgeois to thrive. This is not only in specific policies, but the very foundation of law and property reflects bourgeois interests, despite the attempts to make them seem neutral and rational.\n\nThe idea is that since proletarians own no property and their class interest lies in the abolition of property, and class. This means that the state during a dictatorship of the proletariat is self abolishing in the sense that it creates the conditions of it own abolition, through self-organization and the abolition of class and property . Since you\u2019re an anarchist you might conceptualize it as self-abolishing hierarchies such as teacher-student. \n\nYes we reject the great man of history theory. That one person single-handedly changes history through their decisions or actions. No we realize that the material conditions give rise to certain events, world war 2 isn\u2019t avoided with the death of hitler like many liberals like to claim. And so one person or committee won\u2019t just decide to abolish the state randomly, it will be when the state has no real function left, there is no distinction in class and therefore no basis for a state. Just as you stated. \n\nYes the proletariat must be \u201cvigilant\u201d but the goal is that the masses themselves will be embedded within the revolutionary process and the transition state. They are both apart of the vanguard, as in workers must be a part of the party it cannot be led by another class, and they must also help guide the party dialectically through the mass line.",

            "body": "Engels and Lenin address this very issue on Anti during and State and Revolution, respectively. For example: \n\n\"The proletariat seizes from state power and turns the means of production into state property to begin with. But thereby it abolishes itself as the proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, and abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, operating amid class antagonisms, needed the state, that is, an organization of the particular exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited class in the conditions of oppression determined by the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom or bondage, wage-labor).\"\n\n\"As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection, as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon the present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from this struggle, are removed, nothing more remains to be held in subjection \u2014 nothing necessitating a special coercive force, a state.\"\n\n\"...the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society \u2014 is also its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies down of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not \u2019abolished\u2019. It withers away.\"",

            "body": "I think this is correct. The big problem with talking about \"the state\" is that its many definitions are conflated all the time.\n\n\nThe state defined functionally as \"one class subjugating another\" will per definition cease to exist as classes do.\n\n\nThe really existing apparatus of (collective decision making, public services/infrastructure and) managed violence can continue to exist and may constitute a state in the anarchist or structuralist sense of being its own self-reproducing class system, rather than the mere instrument of another.\n\n\nPersonally, I see the risk of \"degeneration\" primarily in elected representation, the classically oligarchic and bourgois form of government. I'm much in favor of randomized representaion, the classically democratic form of government.\n\"I mean, for example, that it is thought to be democratic for the offices to be assigned by lot, for them to be elected oligarchic\" - Aristotle, Politics, Book 4, section 1294b\n\n\n\nThe police or \"monopolies on the legitimate use of violence\" I see less critically, at least in the short term, since formal inequalities can help combat informal ones, e.g. moderated discussions having more equal speech distributions than unmoderated ones.",
