Is it due to the fact that I find myself not having enough time to study it? Or maybe because I\u2019m just plain stupid? \n\nI believe dialectical materialism is an integral part in learning, not just Marxism, but in general. It is vital for it to exist in everyday thought and it important for developing critical thought. \n\nMy question is, how could I apply dialectical materialism in practice? Say I read a piece of news, how could I apply it there? Or say I learn a new piece of information, how do I apply it there?",

Once that is established, what is the material outcome of what is being attempted here? Does focusing on \"looting\" over people's lives and livelihood obfuscate the failure of our social systems, and how does this failure materially benefit the ruling class and thus generate the initial statement.\n\nMy only word of caution is that it's important to remain actually aware of material conditions and the contexts they exist in. This can very easily spin into conspiritorial, reactionary, thought if not grounded in like something more than gut impulses.",

            "body": "Your question highlights an important and often challenging aspect of Marxist praxis: translating the theoretical insights of dialectical materialism into practical, everyday thought. This is not a matter of intellectual inadequacy but rather reflects the inherently demanding nature of a method that requires ongoing critical engagement with the world.\n\nDialectical materialism is not merely a theoretical framework for interpreting history or economics; it is a tool for analyzing and understanding the processes and contradictions that drive change in all aspects of life. It insists that we move beyond surface appearances to uncover the deeper structures and relationships that shape reality. This is not a passive intellectual exercise but an active, transformative approach to learning and engaging with the world.\n\nWhen reading a piece of news, for example, applying dialectical materialism means looking beyond the immediate narrative to analyze the broader socio-economic and historical context. Consider the contradictions at play, whether between labor and capital, states and markets, or technological innovation and social stagnation. Ask how the event fits into a historical trajectory and what material conditions have produced it. Examine the roles and interests of different social classes and institutions involved, and consider whose interests are being served. This deeper analysis reveals the dynamics of power and change that the news itself might obscure.\n\nSimilarly, when learning new information, dialectical materialism encourages integrating that knowledge into a dynamic and evolving understanding of the world. Rather than treating facts as static, consider their historical and social conditions. If you are studying technological advancements, for instance, think about their effects on productive forces and social relations. Do they exacerbate existing inequalities, or do they create opportunities for collective empowerment? This kind of thinking avoids reductive explanations and instead recognizes the interconnected, contradictory processes that shape reality.\n\nPracticing dialectical materialism effectively requires engagement with the material world, reflection on your immediate conditions, and ongoing dialogue with others. Theory and practice are inseparable; understanding grows through participation in struggles, whether in workplaces, communities, or broader political movements. By observing and analyzing contradictions firsthand, you refine your ability to think dialectically and apply those insights to broader contexts.\n\nMarx himself emphasized the transformative nature of this approach, reminding us that the goal is not only to interpret the world but to change it. The process of applying dialectical materialism may feel imperfect or incomplete at first, but this very struggle is a reflection of its method\u2014a continuous process of learning, reflection, and action that deepens your understanding over time.",

Dialectics is a process by which a theory or variable, and a counterpoint to it, creates a synthesis.\n\nMaterialism you are probably plenty familiar with. It basically says that material reality is primary and ideas come from it, not the other way around aka Idealism aka Ideology.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHcFwtLn6Xg&list=PLuzqoNvqVKydyRAMjDAHDikbVY9BDLC7V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHcFwtLn6Xg&list=PLuzqoNvqVKydyRAMjDAHDikbVY9BDLC7V)\n\nSo as you go about your day, you will come across lots of Ideology. Ideology makes arbitrary value judgements. \"This is good, this is bad. Why? Because that's what I think so it must be true. My lived experience has informed me that it must be so.\"\n\nDoing Dialectical Materialism is basically doing the science of politics.",

In my experience, it's something rather to be practiced than taught. \n\nI became more conscious of my use of dialectics when reading about it's history of thought, how dialectics evolved from Greek philosophy and German idealism of Kant or Hegel. Once I understood them better, I was able to see their heritage in Marxian thought. \n\nAnd this is ironically what Marxian dialectics tends to do (at least how I understand it): it puts the object of interest (the entity) in it's social (historical and spatial) context - i.e. the totality, then tries to understand how the entity is defined through it's relations to the totality. Once you have an idea about how the system works, you can see it's totality in the entity, similarly to how Marx extrapolates the contradiction of use value and exchange value in the commodity from the contradictions of capital and labor in society.",

            "body": "Honest question. Why would you specifically need to apply dialectical materialism, in order for instance to  interprate a media coverage?\n\nI'm not saying that it is a process with no value. It will not harm you to do so. However, you do not neccecary need to follow strictly the dialectics structure in order to understand the news coverage.\n\nAsk simple questions. You read, for instance, about lowering taxes, which might sound good superficially.\n\nAsk for whom are the taxes lowered? You might find that they get lowered for the super rich but not for the general population for whom they increase. You can find here then a class warfare.\n\nAsk  questions about the source of reporting. Since the reporting industry is a company, which is subject of control of bigger companies, which are being controlled by corporate oligarchs, then could they frame the news in a specific way, which is favorable to the interests of their owners?\n\nLook up events in the real world. What is the background that triggered this behavior?  You might find a record that proves that the oligarchs lobby the government and so the government  as a result reduces their tax rates. \n\nAsk critical questions. Use critical thought.\n Who said what, in what platform, to what audience, with what possible motives?  You can reach similar results.\n\nThere is not a specific method of thinking about these things.",

So excuse the lack of nuance.\n\n\n\nThe more you complete your homework and study, the better your grades become (quantity to quality), and the better you understand the topics, the easier it is to study (quality benefits quantity). The contradiction here is balancing procrastination/free time with actually studying. There is an inherent conflict between work and your personal desires. If you focus on one, the quantity is either positive or negative. So you either do improve your knowledge with studying, or you don't study and therefore your grades drop. Seeing that progress moves both ways. \n\nNow, the negation of the negation is, \"Let's say you improve your grades, and you leave basic maths with an A.\" Now you are in to advanced maths at say a C+. You have negated your previous understanding and moved to a new layer, but your previous knowledge still benefits you, and skills or topics you have learned are still relevant. Therefore, you aren't starting at a D. \n\n\nThis is an incredibly simplified way of thinking about it, but an incredibly effective way of getting your heads around how what is essentially a systems theory interacts with different contexts. You can apply this basic understanding to personal relationships, labour movements, education, sports/athletics, nutrition/diet, evolutions, anthropology, etc, etc",

                    "body": "i would add that knowledge about the system you are thinking about is important. Always assume that you can be wrong. Your conclusions can change drastically upon finding new evidence.\n\nThe procrastination example is actually a really good one to illustrate that. It can be very self destructive with the wrong psychological theory in mind. People can develop strong self hatred for being lazy. IT can be shamefull or full of guilt for being lazy or for always falling back to this pattern again. It can cause people to use brute force to simply work. This tends to ignore the other needs you have and can end in burn out etc.\n\nYou have to know what constitutes \"lazyness\" so that you can see that its not an attribute that people have but a simple symptom of lacking resources & regulation skills or simple an attention problem (many people with ADHD improved quikly upon discovering that they are not lazy but simply different. They needed a different tool to manage their attention in a usefull way. So The environment can heavily influence this and your condition makes it fluctuate on a daily AND monthly basis; So a setback is not bad, its to be expected. Also its usefull to know what alienation is and to know about its symptoms as it can influence your perception on a fundamental basis. After that certain theories of motivation come to mind (for example self determination theory) and several theories of emotion regulation, but usually people already have an intuitive feeling about those last 2 things.\n\nBut to break it down The important things for ppl is\n\n1. that lazyness is not something you \"are\" or something that you \"have\", its something that happens to you because of material conditions. So there is no need to punish you. Instead work on identifying the cause  of lazyness.\n2. That alienation is a thing that can crush peoples souls. Seek connection.\n3. That procrastination is very often about emotion regulation.\n4. Change takes time and cant be accelerated. Capitalism teaches us to go faster and faster but some things can't go faster anymore.\n\nI hope you can see how everything (dialectically) works together to create those more simplified things we see on the surface.",
