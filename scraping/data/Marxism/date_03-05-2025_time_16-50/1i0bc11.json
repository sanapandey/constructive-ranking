What on the surface looks like a swing to the right in a lot of countries will eventually turn into its opposite and people will start looking for a left alternative. And I don't mean Bernie Sanders \"left\", who have already discredited themselves. I mean a genuine, revolutionary, \"let's tear capitalism down\" left. Marxists need to start preparing for this. We are living in an epoch of wars, revolutions, and counter-revolutions. Don't be surprised if seemingly mighty capitalist monoliths like the USA or Germany experience revolutionary turmoil and  social explosions.",

The class balance of forces are not there.\n\nWhenever fascism triumphs, it is always after a failed socialist revolution. Never when the working class is not demoralised and weak.\n\nEdit: That's not to say we should be complacent. The far right and fascists are a threat to people. But they are relatively small. Every time there's a fascist protest, they are always outnumbered by anti-fascist protesters. Also, when the fascists go on a rampage like in the UK last summer, it is ordinary people and the working class which comes out and fights back. And that terrifies the ruling class. *That* is why they are (for the time being) against the fascists: because of the mass mobilisation against them it causes. The last thing the bourgeoisie wants is the working class on the streets, en masse, and organised. Therefore, for now, they do not support fascism because of the reaction it provokes from the working masses. Liberal democracy remains their \"safest\" form of government. For now.",

Yes, modern day fascism is considered absurd by those not inculcated with the ideology, but the prevailing opinions of prior ages are generally poorly recorded, at least if they are recorded you have to go looking in places I have not, so it is hard to say whether figures like Hitler, Franco, or Mussolini were viewed with derision by the masses or not, especially given the social repression inherent in these regimes. I would guess there was an unmasking of antifascist opinion in formerly fascist countries post fall similar to the current unmasking of reactionary opinion in America post Trumps reelection",

Again.\n\nRight now, systems of social capital in the developed world are extremely low. People are more isolated from each other than they were 60, 89, 100 years ago. I think passive entertainment in the home has a lot to do with this. People just don't spend social time in third places the way they used to.\n\nIn the absence of social capital, I think that we're going to see fascism again. The new fascism will have all the benefits of a modern surveillance state combined with all of the systems of techno feudalism to directly target propaganda on an individualized basis while also excluding nonconforming people from any benefits form those systems.\n\nSee Musk wanting to make X into the USA version of WeChat.
