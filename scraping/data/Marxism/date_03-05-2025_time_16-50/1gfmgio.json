His family is large, including many children, and both of his parents need urgent surgery. \n\nIn the link, you can read more about him and his family, but if you can, please consider donating or sharing. Anything helps, no matter how small. \n\nThey are getting so close to reaching their goal and being able to get to Egypt for safety!! His parents will be able to get the surgery they desperately need. He also has many young nieces and nephews struggling to find food and medicine to treat the illnesses that are rampant in Gaza. One of his nephews, an absolutely precious little boy named Khaled, was born during the war and has never known peace. Thank you to all who read this and consider helping \u2764\ufe0f [Gofundme](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-yamen-undergo-surgery-in-gaza)",
