    "selftext": "Are there no socialist/communist/marxist covering courses that don't explicitely bash it? Masters would be preferable but anything Bachelor would suffice as well.\nIf you turn on any news it sounds like they're handling out Karl manifesto at every corner and to each uni student but in reality they're so liberal and neoclassical, insane. \nMy grandparents, one got a masters philology and one has a doctorate in chemistry, while having additional marx teachings. How come it's impossibile to find now? Would I have more like self studying? Any textbooks/papers you would recommend? I only read two by lenin as a teen and recently started Capital as those are the only we got at home.",

This is based at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. \n\nIt offers, effectively, a run through of the ISO Aotearoa - New Zealand\u2019s politics. I think a lot of the resources would probably be available online, otherwise sending an email to Brian Roper directly or check out the blog that has some of the lecture content and readings.\n\n[Brian\u2019s Blog](https://briansroper.blogspot.com/2023/02/pols-323-marxism-classical-and.html?m=1)",

Maybe they indulge too much in the Frankfurt School\u00a0than I would personally prefer, or mix in too much Deleuze, Derrida, Zizek, etc. for my tastes, but you might find a fair bit of sympathy for Marxist perspectives in such programs.",
