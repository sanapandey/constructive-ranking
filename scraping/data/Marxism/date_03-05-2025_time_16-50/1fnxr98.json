I'm preparing a class on marxist analysis and historical materialism, and him predicting the revolution would happen in the industrialized west is taken as a given everywhere I see, but I've so far been unable to find a quote of him saying that. Admittedly I've only been skimming books like the capital tomes or the economic and philosophic manuscripts, but since his works are so extensive I'd like not to have to go through all of it. So yeah, is there an actual quote of him writing that or is it just assumed from his theories?",

But in Russia we find, face to face with the rapidly developing capitalist swindle and bourgeois landed property, just beginning to  develop, more than half the land owned in common by the peasants. Now the question is: Can the Russian *obschin*a \\[...\\], though greatly undermined, yet a form of the primeval common ownership pf land, pass directly to the higher form of communist ownership? Or, on the contrary, must it first pass through the process of dissolution as constitutes the historical evolution of the West? \n\nThe only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian Revolution becomes the signal for proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may serve as a starting-point for a communist development.\"\n\n*Communist Manifesto*, Preface to the Russian Edition, 1882, italics original.",

This led to the establishment of the Soviet Union, a development that was later analyzed by Marxist theorists like Lenin, who adapted Marxist theory to account for the conditions of underdeveloped capitalist nations.",
