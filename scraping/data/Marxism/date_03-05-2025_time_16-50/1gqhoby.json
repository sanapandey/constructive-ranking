    "selftext": "If you look at the factors: illegal immigrants will be removed, tariffs will lead to American workers having more value, general demoralized Nation with nothing to lose, offers nothing to workers in terms of rights, people are not having children so they have less to lose. \n\nIf you compare China/ Russia they actually have better workers rights in many ways than we do. I think the situation is arising where people genuinely don't even care anymore and have nothing to lose. At this point I believe many Americans have the attitude of give me better circumstances or give me death. If you are being paid poverty wages to do a full time job then you will have nothing to lose in a general strike. ",

Would you have been doing that under harris? I in any situation that's what we need. We also need independent political organizing. Not\u00a0working within what the billionaires and their two parties deem acceptable.\n\n\n\nAlso the point about Russia and China is...not accurate. And anti immigrant sentiment has no place in a socialist's mouth btw.",

I mean, Russia forcefully conscripts civilians into the war in Ukraine, I don't think theyre exactly great on workers rights.\n\nAs for China, they're better than Russia but they have very rigid corporate structures more akin to Japan. Insane work hours and mistreatment are pretty common stuff there (I have relatives there who work 12-14 hour days regularly, it's pretty nuts).",

Congress funds the government so if a president want to double the size of ICE Congress can limit that. \n\nSo maybe you see everything Trump wants start happen in the first year, by the second year if stuff isn\u2019t looking good you start to see that shrink because on the third year there\u2019s an election. On top of that that snitch ass cabinet reports back to whoever and if they don\u2019t like what they\u2019re seeing they\u2019ll talk to the Speaker or the Senate president or just call the head of whatever department they need to to slow things down. \n\nTrump can go in there with however many fascists and white nationalists he wants, in the end America is a business. If fruit prices triple and workers are on strike all over the country and the economy is shrinking there\u2019s ways to stop that. \n\nNixon is a good example of what happens when you try to circumvent all those guard rails put in place by the capitalist class. Everything he did was for capital, but the capitalist class doesn\u2019t like being cut out.",

Mass protests, hopefully backed by some kind of possibility of labor or worker initiated work stoppages.",

The deportations make immigrants more desperate and thus more easily exploited. The new fascist administration merely wants to eliminate any official aid for immigrants. That will make them more desperate to accept even more exploitative working conditions. As they do, the degraded conditions will bleed over into the domestic labor-force. \n\nFor tariffs, there is not any advantage for workers. We rely too much on imports and this will only make imports more costly, decreasing the real wage. More exploitation will be required of workers to keep their heads above water. This might potentially lead to more domestic production and a dramatic decline in import dependency, but it will be intensely burdensome on the working class for years or decades until nation-state self-sufficiency is achieved.\n\nPerhaps this can motivate a rise in proletarian class consciousness, but otherwise the arc of moral Justice is certainly not going to bend itself.",

Assuming Trump is an idiot who goes on with the crazy tariffs (and assuming the party doesn't stop him), it's possible that workers will begin organizing as their buying power diminishes even further.",
