    "selftext": "I'm currently studying historical laws where ideas of marxism actually passed as a form of reform. I just learned that in the 30's, the US had a leftist party in Congress that was successful in passing the minimum wage law. This is a contradiction of the capital needs, which is to lower wages to achieve surplus labor. Having said that, in the present day, if we were to organize a political labor party and one of the ideas is to propose a bill that will tax the rich, what are your ideas for this bill that will actually pass Congress?",

            "body": "Minimum wage laws indirectly contribute to capital needs though. The bourgeoisie doesn't want the proletariat to have a revolution, they need to make some concessions and pacify them, but those still technically increase the economic instabilities. Minimum wage laws cause industries to move production to less developed countries, and even if you manage to keep the employment rate the same, it still weakens the domestic petite bourgeoisie, which technically means more proletariat in the long run.\n\nNo political labour party will be able to achieve socialism through reforms like taxing the rich, they'd end up having to compromise with the bourgeois state and electoral system, rich people won't let you do anything substantial through the structures that were created to benefit them, so you'll just end up with some sort of class collaboration project.",

They might give the workers one reform one day and take it away the next. Marxists therefore need an independent class position.\n\nTo me, it is weak and pathetic grovelling as marxists to ask the rich to simply pay their taxes. As marxists, as *revolutionaries*, we should say \"No, don't tax the rich. Expropriate the rich. Nationalise their companies and capital *without compensation* (i.e., seize their assets, don't buy them off of them) and place them under democratic workers control.\"\n\n\"Tax the rich\" is for closet pro-capitalists like AOC.\n\nAs Marxists we may support it as a means to raise class consciousness, but we should never think that is the end goal and that taxing the rich will fundamentally change anything. It won't. They will just find ways to dodge the tax anyway with loopholes.\n\nThey deserve nothing less than their complete ruination and expropriation of their wealth. Not a pathetic \"tax\".",

Without a significant shift in how wealth is redistributed and public resources are allocated, taxing the rich risks becoming little more than a transfer of power to the liberal core of elites. The funds generated from higher taxes, rather than addressing systemic inequality or empowering marginalized communities, could easily be funneled into existing priorities like corporate subsidies, military expansion, or inefficient bureaucratic programs. This would only reinforce elite control rather than challenge the broader dynamics of wealth and power. Without structural reforms, such as redirecting spending toward universal public goods, curbing corporate influence, and ensuring participatory decision-making, \u201ctax the rich\u201d remains susceptible to co-option by neoliberal politicians. These actors often use progressive slogans to rebrand themselves while perpetuating the same systemic inequities. Unless paired with transformative economic changes, taxing the rich risks becoming performative, placating calls for justice while maintaining the underlying structures of inequality.",

            "body": "IMO the most effective way to tax the rich is through estate/inheritance taxes. When the rich die, their children have to list their entire inheritance as taxable income. Honestly this isn\u2019t even a Marxist idea, it\u2019s just income tax.\n\nThe problem is that the ultra-rich have found ways of utilizing shell companies and trusts, which claim to be international/foreign institutions, to hide the actual ownership of their wealth. Thus, when wealth transfers to the younger generation it is not appropriately taxed. Actions need to be taken to make the rich people actually pay the taxes our system says they are supposed to. You don\u2019t really need Marxism at all for this.\n\nSome efforts have been taken to pursue this undertaking already, such as legally requiring all trusts and corporations to name their \u201cultimate beneficiaries\u201d - the individuals at the end of the stream who their money goes to.\n\nThere has also been some success in restructuring tax law to require taxes be paid based off of the physical location of the underlying assets, or the physical location of where the economic activities took place. This prevents corporations from claiming they are based in a tax haven country when all their business is done in the United States. It also prevents rich people from pretending to be citizens of the Cayman Islands when literally all of their wealth comes from U.S. or European assets.\n\nAgain, you don\u2019t really even need Marxism at all for these policies. IMO with how anti-Marx modern politics is, it would be better to avoid using Marxist rhetoric or philosophy when trying to push these ideas. They\u2019re just good ideas, regardless of which underlying philosophy you use to generate them. Rich people are simply cheating on their taxes, and it needs to be stopped.",
