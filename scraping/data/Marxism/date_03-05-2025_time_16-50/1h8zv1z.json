I don't know If I am asking it right but wanted to know. \n\nWe should have commune thoughts but we can't be commune in every sense. Then there is this Individualistic taught everywhere when there should be communal thought. Bit finding it hard to understand on the whole. \n\nSuggest some books. ",

However, the conflict you express here is merely a strawman construction of Marxism from the dogmatic capitalist ruling class subterfuge. What communist/socialist living requires is a healthy and robust civic sphere. \n\nIn that sense, the individual pursues their individual interest in all things. However, part of that individual interest pursuit, involves common resources\u2014common wealth (common assets) and other common concerns (common liabilities). The way the individual pursues their own common interest in these common resources is through a vigorous civic advocacy for what is required for their needs and desires (along with the needs and desires of any collective associations they form) from the communist Commonwealth (in the community) or broader socialist Commonwealth (region, continent, Globe). \n\nThe socialist or communist Commonwealth then faithfully endeavors  to meet the diverse and plural needs and desires expressed by all in the fine-grained stewardship, administration, and proprietorship of our common resources. The Commonwealth must also endeavor to moderate and mediate the diverse conflicting demands upon the scarce natural and other common resources, in a manner that secure the rights of all involved and maximizes the social welfare of the relevant collective.",

It's just that he's often strawmanned or misconstrued because he argued that freedom can only be achieved through collective struggle\n\n\"Above all we must avoid postulating \u201csociety\u201d again as an abstraction vis-\u00e0-vis the individual.

I think people sometimes forget how Marx is concerned with overcoming alienation in the first place, with true freedom and emancipation, I guess because the liberal idea of \"freedom\" is antithetical to communism, and I think because he's usually more concerned about *how* to do this rather than discussing abstract ideals. \n\nMarx isn't against personal freedom tho the goal is literally a society where both the broader society and the individuals' interests would match together, where people do things (labour) in order to fulfill both their individual and the collective needs *at the same time*, it's not an either/or situation anymore where one limits the other. \n\n> In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\n\n(*The Communist Manifesto*, Chapter 2)\n\nAnd this can only happen in a classless society, through the abolition of private property (because that's where alienation originates from) and through the broader collective action of the working class (because change in isolation is ineffective).",

But I think it's not really fair to see it as purely oppositional concepts where you have to pick between individualism and collectivism or find a balance between the two. Under communism both of those concepts would elevate and support each other instead, the individuals can only thrive under a collective framework, the collective framework depends upon individuals to exist as well, they are interdependent. \n\nIf you hear people criticising individualism from a communist perspective it's either because of a focus on individualism in isolation (ignoring the broader social context), or specifically individualism as it exists under capitalism (mostly competition).\n\nedit: I guess [this part](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm#d1) of the German ideology might be helpful tho?",
