    "selftext": "Hello Comrades, we've just published a new article regarding the influence of Memes on the rise of the new fascist movements across the world. \n\n  \nA little excerpt:   \n\"On 4Chan **Swastika\u2019s, SS-emblems, Fasces** and other Fascist symbolism were normalised, but most people would not find these so palatable, so what could they do to reach the average person?\n\nThe answer laid in \u201c**Pepe the Frog**\u201d. (...)\n\nThe Alt-Right created their own Pepe\u2019s featuring the frog dressed as SS Officer or as \u201cThe Happy Merchant\u201d an anti-Semitic political cartoon from Nazi Germany.\n\nThese depictions where just absurd enough for them to not be taken seriously by the general public but they signalled to someone with the inside knowledge that **they had allies.**\n\nThe Alt-Right were worming their way into the mainstream by exploiting **the absurd and the ironic**.\n\nOf course there were people who rightly pointed this out as hateful content, however the Alt-right were successfully able to hid behind a veil of irony reinforcing the idea that critics where just irrational **\u201eSJWs\u201c (Social Justice Warriors)** trying to ruin everyone\u2019s good time.\n\nAs Pepe was popular amongst the mainstream, this made it very difficult to discern who was a Nazi, who was a troll and who was simply an average internet user taking part in their favourite joke.\n\nThe absurdity of this discourse was not lost on the Alt-Right and they took this opportunity to further capitalise on their foothold in the mainstream. (...)\n\nIf this all seems ridiculous, that is because it is and it was always meant to be.\n\nThe **Absurd is the only realm in which the irrational can become the sensible** and it is in this environment that Fascists thrive.\n\nIf you still have your doubts consider the following fact:\n\nPepe the Frog is now **recognised as a hate symbol** by the Southern Poverty Law centre and human rights advocacy groups around the world.\u201d\n\n# [Read the article here.](https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/02/11/from-troll-to-fascist-english/)\n\n# If you enjoy what we do, [support us by following us on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kritik_punkt/).",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was a fairly popular account back then with thousands of subscribers posting political memes etc, but from an explicitly anti fascist perspective - although not yet a marxist one. And to see the demographic of fascist sympathizers just grow rapidly week over week always blew my mind. It was even crazier because I was good friends with one of the heads of the nationalist \"movement\" on that app. He was a good dude, just young and stupid. He isn't like that today and realizes the insane amount of damage he actually did to so many of these young, impressionable children - It's just way too late. I started to get death threats and stuff later on and just left cold turkey one day. I can't even imagine what it's like today if the app even still exists. It got like, *violently* catholic around that time.",

Additionally, its harder to read in general.\n\nAside, I know this is pedantic, but memes have been important to fascism since the start. Iconography seems very important to disarming people,to the illogical, and appealing to latent chauvinism. Such is the Feces and the Zeig Heil. Alleged remnants from \"our\" past, which spread, and carry along with it, fascist views. Such is Pepe. Pepe is, less of a mythical past, but an absurdist present, but disarms people to fascist talking points. This is the the paradigm memes were originally intended to analyze. Not that I really endorse memology, because it seems stepped in reactionary thought .",

As if Italy, Greece, France, Germany Communist parties held power in post WW2 Europe...\nThus Conservatives had to adapt many far right policies to stay relevant in elections and same Democratic Socialists too. \nSimilarly to how Democrats in America tried to follow war mongering politics to prevent Republicans from getting elected.",

How would you explain from the standpoint of historical formations of production relations that both socialist Soviet regime and capitalist Western states at some point decided that fascism is something inherently bad? Fascist Germany was capitalist and US and UK which fought fascist Germany were also capitalist. What's the difference.\n\nNow the article states that today we get normalization of fascism to some extent. Again the question is why. Why now, not 20 or 40 years before? I don't see how even the modern Marxist studies of capitalism could explain this. Some media theories probably could - the rise of social media etc. But for Marxism there's even no differentiation between the \"old media\" and the social media we have now - Marxist theory simply doesn't allow for such nuance which is not nuance at all but a huge difference.\n\nAnd we could ask these sort of questions about all sorts of things: why France oscillated so long between republican and autocratic states in 19th century? Why Soviet Communist party lost its popularity so quickly in 1980s? Why European countries have much more state regulation of all sorts of things compared to US? Why do Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore have much better state financed healthcare than US? The list can go on and on. No answers from Marxist theory. A university student of humanities who just got some generic basic knowledge of social philosophy would probably give more convincing answers to such questions than a longtime Marxist scholar.",
