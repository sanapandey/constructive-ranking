In other places, Marx says that the worker sells his labour power for its correct price just like any other commodity. How can both of these things be true?",

As you\u2019ve discovered, it seems in the first instance that labor\u2019s value is then 4 hours, corresponding to that part of the working day which is considered necessary. As we know, however, labor creates all value, thus its value is not 4 hours, but the whole working day and its product contained in 8 hours. So, how is it that labor is bought as though its value is 4 hours but acts with the value of 8 hours?\n\nWhat Marx argued is that laborers are not paid based on their labor\u2014for if they were, the capitalists could not wring out a profit\u2014instead, they\u2019re paid based on their labor power, or what they need to sustain their life and working condition while recouping the cost of their education. In other words, I\u2019m paying you to live as a steel worker, and your seeking payment for the same\u2014not, in either case, to work on steel.",

This is because the other employer costs, power, rent, machines etc. will average out and at a minimum point, no more savings can be made.",

            "body": "Labor-power sells for a certain exchange-value on the market. This is a fair and equivalent exchange (hypothetically. it obviously CAN be very unfair). But labor-power has the peculiar quality of producing more value (unlike other commodities). As a result, labor-power will often produce more value than the exchange-value it was sold for. Marx conceptualizes the hours worked after the worker has produced the exchange-value of their labor as surplus-value. This is partially to draw a parallel between serfs who had to work a certain number of days for their lord.\n\nMarx's point is not that workers are being stolen from and have a moral right to the value of their labor. His value theory is much more social and all-encompassing of the capitalist system than that. I can get into my take on it if you want but it's a lot more satisfying to discover it yourself IMO.",

If somehow wages were lower than what was necessary for workers to reproduce themselves, then obviously there would be no more workers to sell their labor power to the capitalist. \n\nThe difference between labor and other commodities in production, of course, is that labor also produces a surplus value for the capitalist which is over and above the cost of its own reproduction \u2014 so the worker has to first produce the value which represents the workers wage and then also produce more value on top of that for the capitalist.",
