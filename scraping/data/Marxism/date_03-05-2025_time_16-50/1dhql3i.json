    "selftext": "Hi comrades , I was born and raised in a country that has been through colonialism, revolutions.. from monarchy to \u201cdemocracy\u201d, I lived there some of my life and from then till now in Western Europe. Never found answers to the political dilemma of my identity!, I started reading about Marxism and I feel it resonates more with me but there is a lot of books and resources out there I am seeking help where to start!? Podcasts, books and philosophers to follow would be highly appreciated !\n",
