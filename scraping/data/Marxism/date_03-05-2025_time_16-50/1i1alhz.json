To me theses ideas are intrinsically linked. \n\nCrisis of production, oversimplified, happens when in the search for profit over time less and less money is given to the labor force, who in turn can't afford to buy the produced goods.  This is delayed through debt and other globalization factors like a ponzi scheme, but it is still a cancer at the heart of the system, and are a main reason wars of imperialism are created, to inject more capital and demand into an unstable system.  Destroying infrastructure and rebuilding it is a significant demand, for example.\n\nSo I agree with other commentators that late stage capitalism began with the birth of neo liberalism and has evolved since then.",

No expansion of the population, then no expansion of markets. I think this is self explanatory. And while buyt itself it would not be an issue, with the other two it will be more fuel to the fire.\n\n\\- Environment: Tech growth can perhaps be kept up with inventions we are not yet aware, and population by itself doent matter that much, but the environment has specific limits. Water, climate, natural resources etc etc have clear limits that we cannot surpass, only perhaps postpone.   \n  \nThat is a wall that when we hit, we will hit it very hard...",

The contradictions of the capitalist economy, which repeatedly emerge in unemployment, crises, wars, class struggles, repeatedly determine the will to revolution of the proletariat. Socialism comes not because capitalism collapses economically and men, workers and others, are forced by necessity to create a new organisation, but because capitalism, as it lives and grows, becomes more and more unbearable for the workers and repeatedly pushes them to struggle until the will and strength to overthrow the domination of capitalism and establish a new organisation grows in them, and then capitalism collapses. The working class is not pushed to act because the unbearableness of capitalism is demonstrated to them from the outside, but because they feel it generated within them. Marx\u2019s theory, as economics, shows how the above phenomena irresistibly reappear with greater and greater force and, as historical materialism, how they necessarily give rise to the revolutionary will and the revolutionary act.\n\n- Anton Pannekoek, 1934",

Just as Lenin was only able to develop his account of imperialism on the basis of Capital, as confirmation of the general laws governing the whole course of the capitalist mode of production discovered by Marx, so today we can only attempt to provide a Marxist analysis of late capitalism on the basis of Lenin's study of Imperialism. The era of late capitalism is not a new epoch of capitalist development. It is merely a further development of the imperialist, monopoly-capitalist epoch. By implication, the characteristics of the imperialist epoch enumerated by Lenin thus remain fully valid for late capitalism.\"",

This era has seen an embrace of classical liberal politics (hence, neo-liberal) such as austerity, deregulation, and free trade, and is especially characterized by increased globalization.

The term was coined by Werner Sombart to describe specifically the period after World War 1, with the year 1800 up to WWI being the \"heyday\" of free market, competitive capitalism and WWI collapsing that into modern capitalist relations. His formulation is a bit lacking in my opinion, but WWI being the first major inter-imperialist conflict of that scale does rather imply a distinction from previous relations. Of course, Lenin says it better in [Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism ](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/)and gives a more thorough account of what has actually changed regarding capitalist relations, and marks the global economic depression of the 1870's as the more significant turning point, rather than when the changing relations' contradictions resolve into WWI.

For us, capitalism becomes more dystopian each year and it seems more difficult to fight against the capitalist machine. In my personal opinion it was some time in the 80s when the Soviet Union fell officially and America was virtually unthreatened on the world stage and (white) Americans were able to enjoy the luxury of a booming, unrivaled economy. I think that's why a lot of Gen X and late-Boomers are so reactionary and straight up fascist today because they grew up in such an easy time allowing them to endorse the Iraq War for example. Now that capitalism is inevitably declining from its peak in the US, the people are becoming less content and trying to find political alternatives (aka Trump's clown fascism). While this is happening, technology has had a unique effect on us, making us both angry, afraid but politically apathetic at the same time\u2013 that goes for everyone right or left. American capitalism is in an obvious decline yet it has never had a stronger grip on the working class. Over the next 50-70 years we will see the state have to deal with decline either by loosening the grip on the workers to slow it or tighten the grip, increase imperialism and accelerate the decline.",
