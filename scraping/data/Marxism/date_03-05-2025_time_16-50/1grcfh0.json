Israel v. Hamas is not actually about conflict between these two groups but that Israel is creating Hamas terrorists by having these contradictions in its society and national consciousness, and Hamas is the response of people struggling with the contradictions. Massive oversimplification I\u2019m sure, but here\u2019s my question:\n\nWhat about American Christian evangelicals in government making policy? (Some) evangelicals believe that the existence of the nation of Israel is one of the requirements for the Rapture and the apocalypse. There are evangelicals who are in government and make pro-Israel policy based on their religious beliefs. But now, material reality is being impacted by these people\u2019s supernatural beliefs: beliefs that are not based in material reality. They are changing the conditions of the people in reality by using their ideas? \n\nThis is not an attempt on my part to say: \u201cnyeheheh materialism disproven!\u201d I know someone must have come up with this before and I\u2019m just missing some element of the situation. What am I missing that makes it so we can analyze this situation using materialism?",

They can ignore those things because their lives allow them to ignore those things. \n\nWhat I mean by that is that believing that there is a person in the sky who controls everything is easy to do because half the world agrees with that belief to some extent. \n\nTheir belief in Christ is easy to believe because 2.4 billion people agree with them. \n\nTheir belief in an afterlife is easy to believe because the vast majority of humans at any point in human history have believed in an afterlife. \n\nBecause an afterlife is by definition impossible to disprove this belief continues. \n\nBut let\u2019s say they believed that Christians can shoot lasers from their eyes, would that belief spread and survive? Obviously not. \n\nReligious ideology survives because it exists in the gaps of human knowledge, it makes claims that don\u2019t rub up against reality too much or that are adaptable enough to new conditions. The religions that cannot adapt to those conditions disappear. \n\nThe Shakers were a Christian group that no longer exists because they believed all sex was immoral no matter what. They don\u2019t exist anymore because the material reality is that people don\u2019t like religions that practice total abstinence and because they didn\u2019t have children they couldn\u2019t pass their religion on to.",

Why do the Christian nationalists, so eagerly seeking the end of the World their God created, want to end the World, when what makes the World so horrible and in need of ending is their overwhelming and all consuming hatred? What makes them think their hatred won\u2019t poison any post apocalyptic afterlife as well?\n\nNow even other Christians produce ideas that an allegedly loving God, that also demands _love_ from God\u2019s followers. That hypothetical would also need explanation about the material conditions producing that idea. However, the with current condition of a loving God that is hateful or that demands hate from God\u2019s followers\u2014that presents contradictions that make the ideas more palpable. It\u2019s the same as Freud who said that we must understand not only the conditions that produce homosexuality but the conditions that produce heterosexuality as well. We must understand the material conditions that produce the prevailing idea of a loving God that demands hate, just as much as we require an understanding of the material conditions that produce the dissident view of a loving God that demands love.",

Because essentialism tends to draw incorrect conclusions ex: cold = getting sick.\nIt is widely accepted as a property of being cold, yet you only get sick when exposed to a virus. You won't get sick if you're in a cold room that has been sanitized (you will have health problems yeah, not a \"cold\" (not an infection))\n\nAnother exemple, black people/migrants = crime. A worryingly high number of people think crime is a property that \"has more chance to appear in black people/migrants\". When in reality it's just that they are made artificially poorer by a large set of discriminations\n\nRich people are superior/smarter because they are more educated on average, do better in school, etc... \n\nThe third world is poor because it's \"less developped\" and not because it's getting constantly pillaged by unfair trade agreements,\n\nAnd a lot more nasty assumptions.\n\nMaterialism means looking at what things are actually made of\n\nAnd dialectics means looking at everything that isnt the thing to know what system the thing belongs to and what it's place within it is:\n(Why does the apple exists just to be eaten ?

            "body": "Yes people's ideas affect material reality, but ideas don't just spring up out of nowhere, they are in turn the result of material reality. \n\nChristian nationalism has its roots in Constantine's attempt to hold together a Roman empire that was fracturing as the slave economy reached its natural limits. Monotheism is uniquely suited for consolidating political and cultural power due to its centralized structure, so as Rome declined several monotheistic cults sprang up, Christianity happened to be the one that was successfully implemented.\n\nEventually (after a ton of important history I unfortunately have to skip over) Christianity was adapted not as a tool for holding an empire together, but for building colonial empires.  It was used in many colonies, including the US, to wipe out indigenous identities and to keep the identity of colonies strongly tied to the imperial core. \n\nWhat we see today is the remnant of this colonial Christian nationalism going through yet another transformation. The empire is straining under the limits of the capitalist system, and so certain elements of the ruling class are turning again to Christian nationalism to hold the empire together and to justify and shore up support for imperialist actions in Israel.\n\nThis follows a very clear dialectical materialist pattern of negation of the negation, where an idea is changed by a change in material conditions and then when the material conditions change again so does the idea, and we get progressively evolved ideas affecting material reality which in turn affects those ideas.",
