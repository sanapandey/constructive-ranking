    "selftext": "One of my friends jokingly asked if Marx predicted government cheese (aka the US maintaining dairy prices by buying stupid amounts of cheese to maintain the price of dairy, and all the spin offs of that) and now I'm genuinely curious if Marx predicted something like that. \n\nUnfortunately, I do not have the time to read all of Marx's work to see for myself, so I look to you, dear redditors, to see if any of you remember him talking about it. \n\nOf course, I'm not expecting him to have discussed literal cheese caves, rather, I'm looking for discussion of the economic policies which led to the cheese caves. IE, mass purchasing dairy to keep the industry stable, can't stop because it'll crash the market, commodity check-off program, dairy promotion program, the entire conspiracy about milk propaganda, etc. \n\nSo I humble ask, did Marx predict the Cheese Caves?",

The mixed economy didn't really come into being as we know it until Keynes's theories were put into practice, and we never got a fleshed out theory of the State from Marx (which he did plan in the Grundrisse I believe).",

I guess you could take it when he talked about the dominant class (and possibly by extension the govt) controlling the economy for their own ends.",

                    "body": "Then you haven't read the text Critique of the Gotha Program with these quotes about socialist society:\n\n>Let us take, first of all, the words \"proceeds of labor\" in the sense of the product of labor; then the co-operative proceeds of labor are the total social product.\n\n>From this must now be deducted: First, cover for replacement of the means of production used up. Second, additional portion for expansion of production. Third, reserve or insurance funds to provide against accidents, dislocations caused by natural calamities, etc.\n\n>These deductions from the \"undiminished\" proceeds of labor are an economic necessity, and their magnitude is to be determined according to available means and forces, and partly by computation of probabilities, but they are in no way calculable by equity.\n\n>There remains the other part of the total product, intended to serve as means of consumption.\n\n>Before this is divided among the individuals, there has to be deducted again, from it: First, the general costs of administration not belonging to production. This part will, from the outset, be very considerably restricted in comparison with present-day society, and it diminishes in proportion as the new society develops. Second, that which is intended for the common satisfaction of needs, such as schools, health services, etc. From the outset, this part grows considerably in comparison with present-day society, and it grows in proportion as the new society develops. Third, funds for those unable to work, etc., in short, for what is included under so-called official poor relief today.\n\n>Only now do we come to the \"distribution\" which the program, under Lassallean influence, alone has in view in its narrow fashion \u2013 namely, to that part of the means of consumption which is divided among the individual producers of the co-operative society.\n\n>The \"undiminished\" proceeds of labor have already unnoticeably become converted into the \"diminished\" proceeds, although what the producer is deprived of in his capacity as a private individual benefits him directly or indirectly in his capacity as a member of society.\n\n>Just as the phrase of the \"undiminished\" proceeds of labor has disappeared, so now does the phrase of the \"proceeds of labor\" disappear altogether.\n\n>Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor. The phrase \"proceeds of labor\", objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all meaning.\n\n>What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges. Accordingly, the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.  \n(...)  \nBut these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged after prolonged birth pangs from capitalist society. Right can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.\n\n>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly \u2013 only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\n\n>Karl Marx, Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875)\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm)",
