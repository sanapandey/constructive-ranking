    "selftext": "Hello Comrades, we've written a new article about the AfD, here's a little excerpt:   \n\"\u201cThe development of right-wing extremism in the East is presented in a **vulgarly idealistic** way by bourgeois political scientists as a personal problem of the East, since the people there are \u2018partly socialised by dictatorship in such a way that they have not arrived in democracy even after 30 years\u2019 (Marco Wanderwitz, former Commissioner for the East)\n\nWithout asking; **what has this democracy brought the people in the East?** (...)\n\nWouldn't the term \u2018Treuhand-socialised\u2019 East Germans then be more correct?\n\nThe East German tendency towards nationalism is therefore a **consequence of the material subordination** that the East has experienced since reunification. (...)\n\nIssues that were popular throughout Germany, such as migration policy concerns, \u2018security\u2019 and the \u2018German identity\u2019, helped the AfD to make its big breakthrough in West Germany too. (...)\n\nThe alienation and unhappiness in this system, especially in the East, makes the **AfD appear to many as the only alternative to this system** \\- although it structurally wants the same thing as the FRG has exemplified since 1949.\n\nThe reason for this is the aversion of the masses to a **different material basis**, which is taboo as a result of the remnants of **National Socialism, McCarthy-era anti-communism and postmodern Marxist alienation\u201d.**\"  \n  \nYou can read the article here: [https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/03/02/alle-waehlen-afd-warum-eigentlich/](https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/03/02/alle-waehlen-afd-warum-eigentlich/)  \nOr follow us on Instagram here.

How is that going to work?\n\nThis sounds like what the Comintern said on 1 April 1933 (in their first statement on Germany after the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor on 30 January 1933)\n\n>\"...

The fight against layoffs and wage cuts must be connected to a political mobilization against war and fascism. Only in this way can workers defend democratic rights and oppose the capitalist oligarchy.\n\n>This requires overcoming the paralyzing influence of the trade union apparatus and organizations of the pseudo-left, including the Left Party in Germany. It is necessary to build an independent movement of workers and youth directed against the root cause of barbarism: capitalism. They must oppose the growth of nationalism and war with the international unity of the workers.\n\n>The Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei (Socialist Equality Party, SGP), the German section of the International Committee of the Fourth International, is fighting for this program. In our\u00a0[election manifesto](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/01/18/vtwi-j18.html)\u00a0for the federal election, we wrote:\n\n>*The international working class is a formidable social force, comprising 3.5 billion people\u201455 percent more than in 1991.

It looks like cheap rhetoric which adapts to the claims of the AfD to represent everyone.  \n\nBecause of the crisis in the United States we are seeing many references now to the period 1923-1933.  The myth of the Nazis is the Hitler represented the popular Germany will.   It doesn't with stand scrutiny but it serves a purpose.  This myth has been repeated, in different forms, by Stalinists and social-democrats (to excuse their passivity), by their acolytes, by conservatives, liberals, monarchists, anarchists, leftists, post-modernists, ... in fact almost everyone except the Trotskyists. \n\nMUST READ: [The Myth of \u201cOrdinary Germans\u201d: A Review of Daniel Goldhagen\u2019s \"Hitler\u2019s Willing Executioners\"](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/library/russian-revolution-unfinished-twentieth-century/15.html)\n\n# But WHY is the Left Party no longer perceived as anti-establishment? \n\nYou say\n\n>[The Left Party, with its various government participations, could](https://kritikpunkt.com/2025/01/29/artikelkritik-die-linke-trotz-allem-bloss-ein-wegbereiter-des-bestehenden/)\u00a0no longer be perceived by many as\u00a0*an \"anti-establishment*\" \n\nBut why?  Because workers and others correctly perceive they and the SPD are **part of the establishment**?  The problem is the alternative they have replaced them with.

Marx and Engels had a different view.  Nationalism was essential for the bourgeoisie but, as I'm sure you know \"The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got.\"   \n  \nThis also shows the Greens are a left-wing capitalist party who were adapting to the normal effect of the dominance of bourgeois ideology on the working class and the temporary restablisation of capitalism in the post-WWII boom.  \n\nSEE: [Thirty years of the German Green Party - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2010/01/pers-j13.html)\n\n#",

I can't find the quote.)\n\n# ... the alternative ... Trotsky \n\nCompare Gramsci above with Trotsky in September 1932\n\n>In the epoch of the rise, the growth, and the bloom of capitalism, the petty bourgeoisie, despite acute outbreaks of discontent, generally marched obediently in the capitalist harness. Nor could it do anything else. But under the conditions of capitalist disintegration, and of the impasse in the economic situation, the petty bourgeoisie strives, seeks, attempts to tear itself loose from the fetters of the old masters and rulers of society. It is quite capable of linking up its fates with that of the proletariat. For that, only one thing is needed: the petty bourgeoisie must acquired faith in the ability of the proletariat to lead society onto a new road. The proletariat can inspire this faith only by its strength, by the firmness of its actions, by a skillful offensive against the enemy, by the success of its revolutionary policy.\n\n>But, woe, if the revolutionary party does not measure up to the height of the situation! The daily struggle of the proletariat sharpens the instability of bourgeois society. The strikes and the political disturbances aggravated the economic situation of the country. The petty bourgeoisie could reconcile itself temporarily to the growing privations, if it arrived by experience at the conviction that the proletariat is in a position to lead it onto a new road. But if the revolutionary party, in spite of a class struggle becoming incessantly more accentuated, proves time and again to be incapable of uniting the working class about it, if it vacillates, becomes confused, contradicts itself, then the petty bourgeoisie loses patience and begins to look upon the revolutionary workers as those responsible for its own misery. All the bourgeois parties, including the social democracy, turn its thoughts in this very direction. When the social crisis takes on an intolerable acuteness, a particular party appears on the scene with the direct aim of agitating the petty bourgeoisie to a white heat and of directing its hatred and its despair against the proletariat. In Germany, this historical function is fulfilled by national Socialism (Nazism), a broad current whose ideology is composed of all the putrid vapors of disintegrating bourgeois society.  \n  \n[BOURGEOISIE, PETTY BOURGEOISIE, AND PROLETARIAT, From The Only Road for Germany written (Leon Trotsky, September 1932)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm#p6)\n\n# \"Fascism is the punishment for the workers when they fail to take power.\"\n\n>... We know that the mentality of every class of society is determined by the objective conditions, by the productive forces, by the economic state of the country, but this determination is not immediately reflected. The mentality is in general backward, delayed, in relation to the economic development. This delay can be short or long. In normal times when the development is slow, in a long line, this delay cannot produce catastrophic results. To a great extent this delay signifies that the workers are not equal to the tasks put before them by objective conditions; but in times of crisis this delay may be catastrophic. In Europe, for example, it took the form of fascism. **Fascism is the punishment for the workers when they fail to take power.**   \n[The Political Backwardness of American Workers (Leon Trotsky, 1938)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1940/05/backwardness.htm)\n\nAlso: \n\n* [What is fascism? with Trotskyist David North, Socialist Equality Party (8 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCSodSijB_o)",

Outside of that, many Marxist parties are still quite small and divided in the West as well. This is due to the historical conditions of the West, where left reformism had its height in popularity in the latter half of the 20th century when capitalism was \"doing well\" for the West. Since that is no longer the case, new right-wing parties have been able to capture this electoral vacuum.\n\nIn the near future, things will change. Inevitably, once even this right-wing populism fails the working class, people's interest in Marxism will be revitalized once again.",
