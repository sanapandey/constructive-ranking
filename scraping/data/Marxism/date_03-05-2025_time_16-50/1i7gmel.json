I'm looking for something like Nairn and Anderson's work on Britain, or Malcolm Harris's \"Palo Alto\" - something that places Australia within a world historical system. It's been a while since I've looked at this literature and I know there are some decent left liberal historians (Henry Reynolds? Manning Clark who supposedly received the Order of Lenin?) but I'm not sure they're quite what I'm looking for.",
