It is a term used often in the work I do as well, (community outreach for a grant-funded research project pertaining to LGBTQ+ youth). I would like to know more about how Marxist theory and intersectionality theory are related, or not related at all. I have stumbled across this book by Ashly J Bohrer: Marxism and Intersectionality: Race, Gender, Class and Sexuality under Contemporary Capitalism. I have not read it yet. Has anyone here read it? Thoughts on the book or how Marxists view intersectionality theory. ",

In contrast, these authors argue that it is possible to embrace social reproduction theory without discarding the strengths of intersectionality thinking, especially its ability to develop nuanced descriptive and historical accounts of various \u201ccategories of social difference.\u201d This strikes me as a promising direction in which to go.\n\n>In the long run, however, I think we must jettison two dearly-held assumptions. First, the assumption that the various dimensions of difference\u2014for example, race, class, and gender\u2014are comparable. Second, the implication that the various categories are equal in causal weight. Willy-nilly, these two assumptions lead to an interest in identifying parallels and similarities among the categories of difference, and a downplaying of their particularities. With these assumptions gone, we can break out of the tight little circle of supposedly similar categories. Our theoretical task would then be to focus on the specificities of each dimension and to develop an understanding of how it all fits\u2014or does not fit\u2014together. Out of this process could come a lens, or perhaps several lenses, with which to analyze empirical data.\"",

There are similar, though distinct precedents (such as Claudia Jones's \"triple oppression\") but they are materialist analyses that ofc want the total destruction of the status quo, not a more nuanced understanding of how we can include more people in it.",

The basic assumption is that there\u2019s social phenomena which all have differing origins and then \u2018intersect\u2019 as forms of oppression expressed within the sphere of individual identity. Historical materialism is fundamentally different in that it starts from the historical process which moves from one economic mode to another as a result of class conflict, with each new society creating the contradictions from which a new antagonistic class will emerge. So for Marxists it\u2019s absurd to think of oppression as something which can have a variety of independent origins, which is only expressed in the form of oppression and marginalisation by categorising people into a bunch of Overton windows or something. Instead these forms of oppression have their origin in the same historical process and what appears as distinct forms of oppression are actually just differing perspectives on the same social whole.",

That said, you can coaxe them into the fold, not by asserting the primacy of capitalism as an explanatory force, but suggesting that all the \"identities\" (including class which they see as an \"identity\") are symptomatic expressions of a single system that attempts to rationalize social hierarchies for the gain of some folk over others.  At least it's a first rhetorical step to move them away from \"identity.\" Now whether they're worth your time or not, that's a matter of the circumstances you're under.",

We're not proposing a moral hierarchy of issues, we're talking about the mechanism thru which humanity can unite and overthrow *all* the old oppression which all have their origins in the same historical development and are reproduced by the same material social relationships. Overcoming oppressive hierarchies within the working class is partly a necessary precondition for solidarity and partly a product of that solidarity which is cemented in the common interests of the world proletariat, it is a dialectical process. So it's not a matter of putting aside all questions of oppression until 'after the revolution' its a matter of understanding how the process of revolutionary change is what creates the basis for overcoming all division, war and oppression.",

            "body": "In recent years, the concept of \\*\\*intersectionality\\*\\* has gained significant prominence, particularly in the fields of \\*\\*social justice\\*\\* and \\*\\*identity politics\\*\\*. Developed by \\*\\*Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw\\*\\* in 1989, intersectionality offers a framework for understanding how various axes of oppression\u2014such as \\*\\*race\\*\\*, \\*\\*gender\\*\\*, \\*\\*class\\*\\*, and \\*\\*sexuality\\*\\*\u2014intersect and shape the lived experiences of marginalized individuals. While this theory has provided valuable insights, especially in highlighting the unique forms of oppression faced by \\*\\*women of color\\*\\* and other historically marginalized groups, its relationship to \\*\\*Marxist theory\\*\\* remains a topic of debate. Can \\*\\*intersectionality\\*\\* and \\*\\*Marxism\\*\\* be reconciled, or are they fundamentally at odds? Moreover, how do we approach the \\*\\*dialectical nature\\*\\* of identity and oppression within the context of material conditions?\n\nLet us explore the potential for a \\*\\*dialectical synthesis\\*\\* between \\*\\*Marxism\\*\\* and \\*\\*intersectionality\\*\\*, addressing both the complementary aspects of these frameworks and the tensions that exist between them. By doing so, we aim to provide a robust Marxist analysis of \\*\\*oppression\\*\\* that takes into account the complexities of \\*\\*race\\*\\*, \\*\\*gender\\*\\*, \\*\\*sexuality\\*\\*, and \\*\\*class\\*\\* under contemporary \\*\\*capitalism\\*\\*. Through this lens, we will show that while \\*\\*intersectionality\\*\\* offers important tools for understanding the \\*\\*multiplicity of oppressions\\*\\*, only \\*\\*Marxism\\*\\* can provide the materialist analysis necessary for a \\*\\*revolutionary transformation\\*\\* of society.\n\n\\*\\*Intersectionality\\*\\* emerged out of the Black feminist critique of \\*\\*second-wave feminism\\*\\*, which was criticized for its failure to account for the specific struggles faced by \\*\\*women of color\\*\\*. Feminist movements led primarily by white, middle-class women had, at times, ignored the ways in which \\*\\*race\\*\\* and \\*\\*class\\*\\* shaped the experiences of working-class women and women of color. In response, theorists like \\*\\*Crenshaw\\*\\* argued that the experiences of marginalized individuals could not be reduced to a \\*\\*single axis\\*\\* of oppression. Instead, people often experience \\*\\*multiple, overlapping systems of domination\\*\\*.\n\nIntersectionality posits that \\*\\*racism\\*\\*, \\*\\*sexism\\*\\*, \\*\\*classism\\*\\*, \\*\\*homophobia\\*\\*, and other forms of discrimination are not separate and discrete but rather \\*\\*interconnected\\*\\* and \\*\\*mutually reinforcing\\*\\*. For example, a \\*\\*Black working-class woman\\*\\* experiences not just sexism and racism independently, but a \\*\\*specific kind of oppression\\*\\* that emerges from the intersection of these factors. Similarly, an \\*\\*LGBTQ+ person of color\\*\\* experiences homophobia and racism in ways that are deeply intertwined.\n\nThis framework has been particularly valuable in understanding the unique forms of oppression that \\*\\*marginalized communities\\*\\* face, especially those whose experiences have been overlooked by more traditional movements focused solely on race or gender. However, while intersectionality highlights the \\*\\*interconnections of oppression\\*\\*, it often lacks a materialist analysis of the \\*\\*underlying structures\\*\\* that produce these oppressions. This is where Marxism, with its focus on \\*\\*class struggle\\*\\* and the \\*\\*material conditions\\*\\* of society, becomes essential.\n\n\\*\\*Marxism\\*\\* offers a different but complementary framework for understanding oppression, rooted in \\*\\*historical materialism\\*\\* and the analysis of \\*\\*class relations\\*\\*. For Marxists, the \\*\\*fundamental contradiction\\*\\* in society is the struggle between the \\*\\*bourgeoisie\\*\\* (the capitalist class) and the \\*\\*proletariat\\*\\* (the working class). It is through the \\*\\*exploitation of labor\\*\\* that the capitalist class extracts \\*\\*surplus value\\*\\*, creating the material basis for \\*\\*economic inequality\\*\\* and the \\*\\*social structures\\*\\* that reinforce it.\n\nFrom a Marxist perspective, forms of oppression such as \\*\\*racism\\*\\*, \\*\\*sexism\\*\\*, and \\*\\*homophobia\\*\\* are not independent systems but are deeply tied to the \\*\\*capitalist mode of production\\*\\*. These forms of \\*\\*superstructural oppression\\*\\* serve to \\*\\*reinforce class relations\\*\\* by dividing the working class and ensuring the continued dominance of the capitalist class. For example:\n\n\\*\\*Racism\\*\\* can be understood as a tool used by capitalists to \\*\\*divide the working class\\*\\* along racial lines, preventing workers from uniting against their true enemy: the bourgeoisie. By fostering \\*\\*racial divisions\\*\\*, capitalism weakens the potential for class solidarity.\n\n\\*\\*Sexism\\*\\* serves the interests of capital by regulating \\*\\*women\u2019s reproductive labor\\*\\* and ensuring that women\u2019s unpaid work in the household (raising children, maintaining the home) subsidizes the reproduction of the labor force. At the same time, women\u2019s paid labor is often devalued, reinforcing patriarchal control over the workplace and the family.\n\n\\*\\*Homophobia\\*\\* reinforces \\*\\*heteronormative family structures\\*\\*, which serve to reproduce the labor force and maintain the stability of capitalist society. LGBTQ+ individuals often face heightened exploitation and marginalization, as they do not conform to the reproductive and familial norms that capitalism relies on.\n\n1/3\n\n\\*\\*Edited to change the number order of responses\\*\\*",

Rather, it recognizes that \\*\\*race\\*\\*, \\*\\*gender\\*\\*, and \\*\\*sexuality\\*\\* are \\*\\*integral\\*\\* to the functioning of capitalism, which relies on these divisions to perpetuate \\*\\*exploitation\\*\\*. While \\*\\*class struggle\\*\\* remains the \\*\\*primary contradiction\\*\\*, Marxism also seeks to understand how these other forms of oppression are \\*\\*materially rooted\\*\\* in the capitalist system.\n\nTo fully grasp the relationship between \\*\\*Marxism\\*\\* and \\*\\*intersectionality\\*\\*, we must employ the tool of \\*\\*dialectical materialism\\*\\*\u2014the method by which we analyze the \\*\\*interrelationship of contradictory forces\\*\\* and how they develop through struggle. Just as we apply the dialectical method to understand how \\*\\*value\\*\\* in a commodity is a social relation that arises through labor, we must also apply it to \\*\\*gender\\*\\*, \\*\\*race\\*\\*, and \\*\\*identity\\*\\*.\n\nFrom a \\*\\*dialectical perspective\\*\\*, \\*\\*identity\\*\\* is not a fixed or purely subjective phenomenon. Rather, it is shaped by \\*\\*material conditions\\*\\* and the \\*\\*social relations\\*\\* of a given society. For instance, the categories of \\*\\*gender\\*\\* and \\*\\*race\\*\\* do not exist in a vacuum; they are historically and socially constructed in relation to the \\*\\*material needs\\*\\* of society\u2014particularly its \\*\\*economic base\\*\\*.\n\nHowever, while \\*\\*gender\\*\\* and \\*\\*race\\*\\* are socially constructed, they are not \\*\\*illusory\\*\\* or without material basis. Much like the value of a commodity, which is both \\*\\*real\\*\\* and \\*\\*socially determined\\*\\*, gender and race are \\*\\*real lived experiences\\*\\* that arise from \\*\\*historically specific conditions\\*\\*. For example, under capitalism, the construction of \\*\\*gender roles\\*\\* serves the material interests of the ruling class by assigning women the role of \\*\\*unpaid reproductive labor\\*\\* in the household, while also devaluing their labor in the marketplace.\n\nAt the same time, individuals are not merely passive recipients of these social constructs. \\*\\*Identity\\*\\* is shaped not only by material conditions but also by \\*\\*agency\\*\\*\u2014the ability of individuals to resist, challenge, and reshape the conditions of their existence. The \\*\\*struggles\\*\\* of \\*\\*LGBTQ+ individuals\\*\\*, \\*\\*women\\*\\*, and \\*\\*people of color\\*\\* to assert their identities in the face of oppression demonstrate that identity is not static but \\*\\*dialectically evolving\\*\\*. Just as workers can rise up to \\*\\*overthrow capitalist exploitation\\*\\*, so too can marginalized groups resist the \\*\\*social constructions\\*\\* that oppress them.\n\nIn this way, we see that \\*\\*identity\\*\\*\u2014like all social phenomena\u2014is a \\*\\*dialectical unity\\*\\* of both \\*\\*individual subjectivity\\*\\* and \\*\\*material conditions\\*\\*.

The \\*\\*struggles for racial justice\\*\\*, \\*\\*gender equality\\*\\*, and \\*\\*LGBTQ+ rights\\*\\* are not secondary to the class struggle\u2014they are \\*\\*integral\\*\\* to it.

It does try to communicate that different people are oppressed in fundamentally different ways.\n\nFor instance, a Black woman is not oppressed in the same way as a Black man or a white woman. You don't add race + gender together like that. Rather, the intersection of \"Black\" and \"woman\" creates something new that has its own manifestation that has elements not related to either of the above. Like two walls make a corner, two oppressions create something novel.\n\nOn a practical level, it means you can't have a panel on race and gender and have just white women and Black men, you need Black women. Extending it, if you have a trans panel you can't have just trans men and cis women, you need trans women (and vice versa). \n\nThis is an important insight that is also true on a fundamental level and one that makes me very suspicious when people want to ignore it. They either don't understand it and are dismissing it without knowledge, or they do understand it and they find it threatening.\n\nIt's not a theory designed to explain everything, nor is it meant to individualise everyone, but to explain how variation in experiences fits into a whole. It is absolutely not meant to position some people as \"more oppressed\". It specifically points against simply adding up marginalisations to get a final \"score\" as some people seem prone to do.\n\nLiberal use of intersectionality will typically ignore class, naturally. That's no barrier to using intersectionality to talk about the differences and similarities experienced by, say, working class and elite Black women.\n\nI see absolutely nothing in intersectionality - practiced with care and understanding, not used as a cudgel - from being compatible with socialist analysis.",

The similarities to socialism are superficial, it's a bourgeois outlook which takes society's current divisions as natural and eternal, which aims for them to be mediated by democratic inclusion.\n\nThe argument that intersectionality represents a useful addition to Marxism, which has supposedly engaged in class reductionism and nothing more, is a gross misrepresentation.",

Most inclusion of this is an adaptation of the original theory. As, although Marx did recognise that systemic oppression along gender, sexuality, and racial lines occurred, he didn't really discuss it. I don't think he saw it as something that needed solving, at least not until after the revolution, and saw attempting to before a communist revolution as a pointless effort. It could only be dealt with when the classes were abolished. As, in his view, these other divisions only existed to further divide us and distract us from the true forces of oppression. I think he assumed that, after the false class consciousness was removed like scales from our eyes then we'd see each other as equals automatically. It's a beautiful, utopian, idea but sadly not backed up by reality. \n\nI'd point you towards the work of 'cultural' or sociological Marxists. Louis Althusser, Antonio Gramsci etc. They studied how the system is developed to oppress us, in both subtle and unsubtle ways. Their work is a little older but gives an excellent impression on how they viewed oppression by the ruling classes and their work is effectively the authority on mid-to-late 20th century Marxist cultural theory.

If Irish workers have specific demands are they being divisive against proletarian cohesion?\n\nWorkers are not homogeneous imo, it\u2019s one of the defining things of our class. We are a Frankenstein creation. Capitalists use those existing divisions or create new ones in order to shape their class rule. Imo we can\u2019t build solidarity around or above existing divisions, we have to deal with them to create organic solidarity.",

In 1867, Marx wrote \"On the Irish Question\" explaining the oppression of the Irish and repeating the same formula that British emancipation would require first Irish emancipation.  \nEngels also settled an issue in the International between the British and Irish delegations. Most delegations were by language, not nationality. So the British delegation claimed that they were the proper representatives for the English language section. Engels replied that it would be insulting the Irish to submit to the British delegation, that if there were to be only one English delegation, it would be one that was in favor of national independence of Ireland.\n\nDifference WITHIN the class was definitely seen as a political subject for Marx and Engels, even if they did not use the same terminology as today.",
