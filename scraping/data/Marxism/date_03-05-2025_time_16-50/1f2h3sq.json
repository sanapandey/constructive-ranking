    "selftext": "Hey guys, *very* new to leftist theory and decided to start with Engels' *Principles of Communism*. Just got to the part about the sale of labour by the proletariat when I come across this line: \"the price of a commodity is, on the average, always equal to its cost of production\".\n\nI'm a little bit confused by this, because isn't the price almost always higher than the cost of production? Otherwise there would be no profit, making the establishment of a firm basically pointless right?",

Their wages are on average the minimum amount a capitalist can pay its worker in order for that worker to cover their needs to continue working.\n\nBut a worker, once they have produced enough value in order to cover their wages doesn't say \"Right, that's me done for today. See ya!\" No. They keep working (now essentially for free) until their contracted hours are done.\n\nThat extra \"free\" labour is the source of the capitalist's profit.\n\nThis is why Marx said that profit is the unpaid wages of the working class.",

                            "body": "Yes, companies can and do sell their commodities for above their actual cost of production. But the crucial point here is that, in the long term, given a competitive free market, any other company can beat their competitors by selling at the cost of production (say, $5 instead of $6, as per your example). This would attract more customers and eventually force the other companies to reduce their prices or lose sales.\n\nWhen Marx and Engels talk about a commodity being sold at the cost of production, they *have* to assume a functioning competitive free market, where the tendency, by its own competitive logic, will necessarily be the reduction of prices to their cost of production. Therefore, the most consistent way of achieving a profit is through the extraction of surplus value produced by the workers. If a capitalist increases his profit by selling above the cost of production too, then good for him, but in the long run these prices will be forced down by competition. And as such, when we look at profits as a whole, the free competitive market means they will largely come from the work of the labourers.\n\nThe replies below trying to rectify this with mysterious posterior works by Engels have completely missed the point.",

To be sure, Marx and Engels are fully aware that's not the case, but the point in Marx is to show how the logic of capitalism (production of commodities for the market), in itself, devolves into its opposite: monopoly.\u00a0\u00a0 So taking a healthy, competitive free market as a starting point is useful to show how the system, in itself, becomes what it is today, without the need of any corruption, greed or any other external manipulations or forces. The problem is already baked into the logic of the system. So, to answer your question, yes, you can generally assume that's what they have posited. But this by no means excludes the fact that capitalism is often (if not mostly) not a free competition. But that's what so great about Marx's analysis: he shows how *even when we assume that everything is in order*, that everything in the system works fine and there's no pre-existing hierarchy or corruption, even in its best condition, capitalism *still* results in monopolies, poverty, perpetual crises, etc. The fact that we mostly find capitalism in a worst state than the one posited by Marx only makes his case stronger. Hope this made sense.",

Suppose, further, the value of labour to be three shillings or the produce of six hours' labour. If, then, in the raw material, machinery, and so forth, used up in a commodity, twenty-four hours of average labour were realized, its value would amount to twelve shillings. If, moreover, the workman employed by the capitalist added twelve hours of labour to those means of production, these twelve hours would be realized in an additional value of six shillings. The\u00a0*total value of the product*\u00a0would, therefore, amount to thirty-six hours of realized labour, and be equal to eighteen shillings. But as the value of labour, or the wages paid to the workman, would be three shillings only, no equivalent would have been paid by the capitalist for the six hours of surplus labour worked by the workman, and realized in the value of the commodity. By selling this commodity at its value for eighteen shillings, the capitalist would, therefore, realize a value of three shillings, for which had paid no equivalent. These three shillings would constitute the surplus value or profit pocketed by him. The capitalist would consequently realize the profit of three shillings, not by selling his commodity at a price\u00a0*over and above*\u00a0its value, but by selling it\u00a0*at its real value*.\n\nThe value of a commodity is determined by the\u00a0*total quantity of labour*\u00a0contained in it. But part of that quantity of labour is realized in a value for which and equivalent has been paid in the form of wages; part of it is realized in a value for which NO equivalent has been paid. Part of the labour contained in the commodity is\u00a0*paid*\u00a0labour; part is\u00a0*unpaid*\u00a0labour. By selling, therefore, the commodity\u00a0*at its value*, that is, as the crystallization of the\u00a0*total quantity of labour*\u00a0bestowed upon it, the capitalist must necessarily sell it at a profit. He sells not only what has cost him an equivalent, but he sells also what has cost him nothing, although it has cost his workman labour. The cost of the commodity to the capitalist and its real cost are different things.\n\nI repeat, therefore, that normal and average profits are made by selling commodities not\u00a0*above*, but\u00a0*at their real values*.\"\n\nThis is one of the first texts where Marx introduces its theory of surplus value. i hope this answers your question.\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/value-price-profit/)",

(though he works 12 hours, he is only paid 3 shillings/6hours of labor because that is what is needed to sustain himself)\n\n* Material Costs:\n\nRaw materials, machinery, etc., embody 24 hours of labor, so their value = 12 shillings.\n\n* Production:\n\nThe worker adds (works) 12 hours of labor to the materials, which results in an additional value of 6 shillings.\n \n* Total Value of the Commodity:\n\nMaterial Costs: 12 shillings (24 hours of labor)\n\nLabor Added by Worker: 6 shillings (12 hours of labor)\n\nTotal Value: 12 shillings + 6 shillings = 18 shillings (36 hours of labor)\n\n* Wage and Profit Analysis:\n\nThe capitalist pays the worker 3 shillings, which covers only 6 hours of labor.\n\nHowever, the worker contributes 12 hours of labor, which is worth 6 shillings.\n\n* Surplus Value:\n\nThe surplus value (or profit) is derived from the unpaid labor.\n\nThe worker is paid for 6 hours of labor (3 shillings), but actually works 12 hours, contributing an additional 6 hours of unpaid labor.\n\nThis unpaid labor generates a surplus value of 3 shillings.\n\n* Profit Calculation:\n\nThe capitalist sells the commodity for its full value: 18 shillings.\n\nCosts: 12 shillings (materials) + 3 shillings (wages) = 15 shillings.\n\nProfit: 18 shillings (selling price) - 15 shillings (costs) = 3 shillings.

In this sense, the real profit is made in the short to medium run. Perfectly competitive markets don't exist, but that's a whole nother rabbit hole.\n\n\nBut as a couple others pointed out, the real meat of Marxist conception of profit comes from evaluating value as opposed to price. Ideally, they are equal, but they are different. Read more to go into more detail. The only commodity that can actually generate value is labor power, or one's capacity for work. After an owner pays a worker the base value of your labor power, they pocket or reinvest that extra value your labor power creates.
