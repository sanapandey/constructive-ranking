    "selftext": "Ukraine is front and center in the news this week. For obvious reasons [1, gift article].\n\nI haven't done super deep research so please do forgive my naivety for those of you with deep knowledge on the conflict.\n\nI don't understand when leftists are soft on Russia in terms of the Russo-Ukrainian War, especially the last several years of it (2021-). I know leftists are no monolith, but I am curious for people's opinions on the current state of the war, especially the recent happenings this week, and what a level-headed leftist response to all this noise would be?\n\nFrom where I am sitting, I don't see any reason to be soft on Russia's recent strategy of militaristic territorial aggrandizement. I certainly side with critiques of NATO's actions over the course of 2000-Present, in terms of their encroachment upon Russia's borders via Ukraine and other bordering states. And with critiques of the general red scare tactics Western nations use against Russia.\n\nBut at the same time, Russia today is no socialist state (see: imprisonment of opposition, capitulation to capital and global financialization, oligarchy, lack of workers democracy in productive industries). So I don't feel inclined to give them victimhood credit in terms of this violent invasion of Ukraine.\n\nI have tried to escape the US-based propaganda around this war which has seemingly failed to accurately report the state of the war. And IIUC, Ukraine is in a losing position and has been for some time. The idea that they come out of this with pre-2021 borders is but a faint memory (or have I succumbed to other propaganda to be spouting this opinion?).\n\nI guess I have gotten the sense from some leftist spaces that Russia has a clear conscious in this invasion, and I can't see how that's the case. And now we have US Opportuno-Fascists (see: Trump) _aggressively_ siding with Russia (IMO probably for unscrupulous, opportunistic, business dealings for him and his family more so than any sort of idealogical or principled position), which is a total 180 in US foreign policy.\n\nUltimately, I'm looking to read more leftist analysis of this conflict from everyday folks.\n\n- To understand if, from a leftist, historically-informed perspective, you can condemn Russia for the bloody invasion in spite of anti-Russia policy and NATO encroachment of Western states.\n\n- How best to understand this reversal of US foreign policy on Russia via Trump.\n\n- Whether or not Zelenskyy's demands are reasonable (from what I understand he is only looking for security guarantees to avoid further aggrandizement once a ceasefire is reached? and not necessarily a return to pre-2021 borders).\n\n- To what extent a Western European or American leftist should support military aid from their state to Ukraine's defense.\n\n[1] [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/03/us/trump-news-congress?unlocked_article_code=1.1U4.9BWQ.hmdZKdafcWkk&smid=url-share](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/03/us/trump-news-congress?unlocked_article_code=1.1U4.9BWQ.hmdZKdafcWkk&smid=url-share)",

A lot of what you said reminds me of the explanations pro-war social democrats in Germany held up as reasons to support the inter-imperialist slaughter. The Russian Empire was certainly backwards and oppressive in comparison to the German metropole (setting aside German atrocities in Africa), same as how the Russian Federation compares poorly to the EU supporting Ukraine. So, to the pro-war SPD, conducting the war against Russia was progressive. \n\nAnd still, Luxemburg, Liebknecht, and others opposed them. I think we all agree they were correct.

Russia has had several neighbors as part of NATO for nearly 20 years between the baltic and Poland (Belarus is a Russian vassal state at this point given last I checked there's often more Russian military forces in belarus than Belarusian.) further Finland joined NATO as a result of the war and Russia frankly barely said anything about it. \n\nI think something important is to watch Russian state TV about this issue. It's honestly horrifying some of the things they say on one of their most popular talk programs. It's almost always some variation of \"we must save the poor Ukrainians from themselves as they are simply confused Russians and are not their own separate culture, the West is forcing liberal values like homosexuality on them blah blah\". I think it's important to watch for western imperialism but I also think it's important to not assume any country, especially one that CLEARLY does not want it given how hard they've fought against 5 to 1 odds, would prefer being in the Russian sphere rather  than a European sphere that is increasingly splitting off from the United States given recent events.",

It is a return to justifying blatant resource and land grabs not with \"morality\" like we saw with the War in Iraq where the west was nebulously fighting for \"freedom\" but a more brutal might makes right thought process that says resistance is inherently wrong because world powers have a right to your resources if they want them.\n\nI know some people are fixtated on the idea that Ukrainans are (somehow) ontologically nazis or western puppets or w/e but it is the prelude to imperialism reaching new heights very soon.

Then, use that to fracture the state.\n\nIt's backfired, and by the looks of things, Europe could inadvertently fall into the same trap that NATO tried to spring for Russia.

The latter strand - the one you're describing - isn't true either. I could cite a hundred articles from the beginning of the war saying the same thing that you just did and predicting an imminent collapse. The exact opposite happened instead. They were vastly underestimated.\n\n(there are also articles saying that Russia will conquer Europe next...)\n\nThe truth is that Russia is certainly powerful enough to subjugate Ukraine and threaten the rest of Europe, but isn't powerful enough to subjugate or invade NATO. Nor does it wish to. It is reluctant to even conquer Ukrainian cities (preferring a peace deal, I think), but that doesn't mean it won't move on Zaporizhia, Kharkiv, etc. if it can't get the peace deal it wants with the west and Ukraine.\n\nThe military goal it is following (and this is clearly evident if you analyze battlefield moves) is that while it's not averse to conquering land, the overriding goal since March 2022 is to whittle down Ukraine's military to a position of impotence. This matches its diplomatic posture which has always been intransigent on military build ups and NATO membership but which, at least until mid 2023, has been pretty flexible about territory.",

No Ukrainians are being death marched to the front who don't want to be. It is the policy in kyiv especially to not put boys on the front who are conflict averse. They don't need that. They don't treat their soldiers at meat waves and this is why the ratio of death is 1 ukrainian per 4 russians and the average age is 40, because the vast majority of soldiers are volunteers not conscripted boys.\n\nIm asking you again, show me any concrete evidence of a Ukrainian being sent to the front who doesn't want to be.

It treats invasions, colonialism, resource extraction and the like as if they're natural disasters that can only be reacted to. Instead of telling Russia \"no\" it's easier to scrutinize Ukraine because the entire point is that you're not supposed to stand up to power lol.

These aren't the options faced by Gazans. They had the choice of fight, be exterminated or feel the ever increasing yoke of oppression.\n\nIf busification is a hard requirement for continuing a war it's not actually a war of resistance any more. This is doubly evident in Ukraine when a US puppet who won an election on a platform of peace with Russia **turned down** a peace deal where it kept all of its territory and pledged non-alignment with western imperialist powers.

The USSR deployed nuclear forces off the coast of Florida and the USA said \"STOP OR WE WILL INVADE\".\n\nThat makes Russia look even worse tho. Cuba had nuclear missile silos less then 800km away from main land US while NATO never deployed missiles in post Warsaw pact countries, despite those countries wanting it (wonder why). \nThe US demanded that Cuba dismantled their nuclear facilities while Russia demands that their neighbors are \"neutral\" that means invadable. The US did try an 1 week invasion and when that failed they resorted to a forever blockade, wich I disagree with, yet WAY better way than launching the bloodiest conflict since WW2. It's not even comparable.\n\n>In the case of Ukraine, Putin actually tried diplomacy and was stonewalled.\n\nWhat was the diplomacy? Ukraine wasn't closer to joining NATO in 2014 then it was in 1994, if that was the concern why all of this? All of this diplomacy while arming militias in the east of Ukraine. How would Russia feel if Europe was arming the Chechens?\n\n>Have you tried being even more sanctimonious\n\nI don't need to be... It's pretty clear why neighbours of Russia are afraid of Russia, but you going to find a way to say that actually it was the west fault",

Yanukovich was not the last democratically elected president of Ukraine (this is the most blatant lie) and he received much of his vote promising to build stronger ties with europe, there are a lot of public opinion surveys done before 2014, the country was not split in a 50/50 as you said, the majority wanted stronger relationships with the western block. Also can we stop with the coup bullshit? There was no coup, yanukovich lost all of his political and civil support because of his action, flew the country after his promise to implement the agreement he signed on the 21 of February. Please explain to me how the west organized a coup in ukraine, majority of the protestor didn\u2019t flood the street in response to the failure of the eu agreement, or because the were brainwashed by some US NGO into having a \u201cwestern mentality\u201d, they were upset because of the absolute brutality the police had in repressing the early protesters. This is what sparked the uproar, which then led to what we all know. Tell me how someone being presented with all the possible evidence regarding ukraine between the end of 2013 and early 2014 can make a logical and sound reasoning that concludes that it was a us backed coup. Should we then talk about crimea? Prior to his annexation no public survey suggested that the sentiment of the population towards becoming part of russia was prevalent among crimeans. The pro russia party of crimea  received 4% of the vote some years earlier, there was no sign or spread common sentiment in the population, even after the month of russian tv propaganda about the nazis taking over ukraine majority of the people much preferred an autonomous administrative status within ukraine.",

            "body": "Many comments so i will try to give you something short to read.\n\n1. You cannot understand this without grasping that this is bourgeois great power politics. As all states involved are bourgeois, the victor invokes one bourgeoisie asserting themselves over another, in this case, the Russian Bourgeoisie, the American Bourgeoisie, as well as the Ukrainian bourgeoisie. \n2. The American bourgeoisie reached their zenith as the world hegemon after the collapse of the USSR. It's task therefor, is to maintain its hegemony. It cannot let the Russian bourgeoisie grow if it conflicts with the American bourgeoisie's interests. The inverse is true for Russia, it seeks grow as all capitalists do\n3. Therefor, it is Russia's task to expand and cleave spheres of influence from the US, in order to further its imperial ambitions and comparatively infant finance capital exports; it is to secure markets and resources to increase the wealth of the Russian bourgeoisie. It had done this in Syria, and has more recently done this in Africa with the bourgeois revolutions against France. \n4. After the so-called \"Ukrainian revolution\" in 2014, Ukraine moved outside of Russia's sphere of influence and into the US's, starting the Russia-Ukraine war.\n5. From then onward, until 2022 a low intensity battle occurred between Russia and Ukraine. And in 2022, it was decided that the time was right to invade Ukraine. It would be a short campaign that would be over in a few weeks, but it didn't turn out to be so. \n6. The latest development is very prescient. The US's extensive aid to Ukraine has been three sided \n  - To maintain US hegemony in Ukraine and to dissuade other countries from trying to rip away US subjects\n  - To beat down and  exhaust Russia as a foe, economically and militarily, to better subject Russia to hegemony as it had been immediately after 1991\n  - As geopolitical leverage over Ukraine. Although its not finance capital, it can still be contextualized as such if the need be.It is in effect, a debt trap. If Ukraine has no military, it has no means to reject US directives. If it rejects US directives, it has no military to fight off Russia, and maintain is desired position in US hegemony, whom the Ukrainian Bourgeoisie see as preferable. \n7. This has become vital now, as Trump seeks to impose extensive war reparations on Ukraine. **Which puts the US and the Ukrainian Bourgeoisie directly in conflict**. Prior to this, it seemed the Ukrainian bourgeoisie proffered to be in the US sphere of influence over the Russian, It is important to keep track of this for future developments.\n\nUkraine is to be thought of within the historical context of a no-longer-ascendant US empire, weakening from its 20 years of global unipolar hegemony, and the ascendant imperialist powers of Russia and China. China having been recovering from its century of humiliation, and Russia recovering from the fall of the USSR and western domination. And this is very important, because it is inter-imperialist conflict which drives World Wars, as they compete to divvy up the world. \n\nDo not be fooled by so-called Marxists who praise Russia and China as anti-imperialist, when, they themselves are only seeking to further their own imperialism. It is like claiming that the US was anti-imperialist in the late 1800s, going to war with Spain.",

It's very much a \"whoops we accidentally spoke the quiet part out loud\" thing when it does slip out or when somebody like Lindsey Graham talks about how great an \"investment\" Ukraine was or the rand corporation paper that just happens to line up with current US actions exactly.\n\n>Yes those think tanks are quite closely related to bureaucratic circles forming international policy\n\nSo, it would be germane to bring them up if, for instance, the actions descibed within the paper started being taken - as was the case. Think tanks are usually the genesis of most strategies followed in Washington.\n\nThe fact that the public messaging does not match the actual strategy is not of consequence. Empires lie and propagandize and hide their true intentions - it's one of their defining features.\n\nOne of the key reasons why I am sure that this strategy was followed was that I followed some USAID/NED propaganda meant for Russia. This is distinct to the stuff which is meant for American or European consumption which you would routinely come across and has different messaging strategies. That megaphone was indeed consistently pumping out the message that Russia would be better off broken up.\n\n>As for sacrificing for \"the imperial system\" I'm not sure it's a very Marxist thing to say as imperialism is an abstraction\n\nAs I've mentioned before I consider Marxism to be something akin to newtonian physics. It is a good model of reality, but the model does break under a some sets of conditions which Marx just didn't think about very hard. Model != reality.\n\nThis is identical to Chomsky's position on Marxism. If you think he shouldn't belong here because he doesn't have a **fundamentalist** view of Marxism then... well, that's an opinion. I'd encourage you to start a thread on it if it's what you really think. I personally don't hold much truck with that view.\n\n>there's no such \"thing\" or group of interests or social/political institution called \"imperialism\" \n\nThis is flatly wrong. There is an imperial center housed in Washington DC. The institutions include the White House, Congress, The World Bank, the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies and the IMF (to name a few). They interact and cooperate with various capitalist power centers (which I could also name) but they are not strictly beholden to them nor do they always act in their interests.\n\n(the IMF is actually more of a hybrid of capitalist and imperial power centers, but the others are strictly imperial, meanwhile the banks on wall street or the various economic-right lobby groups that tend to get their way more often than not are more strictly capitalist power centers).\n\n>while Western capital is a group of interests\n\nWestern capital is a group of interests, but capital and the imperial center are distinct entities that interact, compromise, collaborate, sacrifice for each other and sometimes feud. It does not make sense to treat them as one big mass because they are distinct entities.",

It really looks like a continuation of Soviet/NATO competition for territory now being waged on softer terms through strategic alliances all the while still trying to expand territories of influence with the express purpose of getting up in one another's face. This is how wars begin. To be sure, in this case NATO did not outright provoke a war and Russia did. Both sides played a role in escalating tensions. Would Russia still have tried to take Crimea regardless? There's a good chance. Would they have continued to try to take the remained of Ukraine? It's impossible to know. Was Ukraine justifiably concerned for its continued existence after losing Crimea and was it reasonable to want the protection of NATO membership? Sure. I agree that Russia is no doubt the worse player here by far but strategically speaking, NATO doesn't really need to expand and can just stay put and only expand further when Russia demonstrates its intent to expand, which they now have and I wouldn't blame NATO for wanting to push further though I question what the long term consequences might be outside the spheres of right and wrong. Ultimately, fuck Russia AND we have other international organizations that can be strengthened without continuing to fight the Cold War now recast as a standoff between multiple capitalist power blocs.",

Russia and Ukraine have had gas disputes since the break up of the Soviet Union, as a large portion of Ukraine's economy is propped up by gas transit fees, because pipes were laid through the country, there are also accusations that Ukraine took gas without paying for it. Access to the Black Sea is strategically advantageous to Russia, so it looks like it's leveraging Ukraine's debt to improve its access to the Black Sea. With the annexation of Crimea it's got more ports for trade.\n\nWestern Europe is massively dependent Russia for gas, and we need to diversify our energy supply, but if we turned off oil and coal, we would desperately need to maintain our gas supplies. Without consumption coming down, there is no way sustainable energy can be developed, manufactured and built at scale across Europe without at least one of the fossil fuels. Since the cold war, America has been trying to drive a wedge between Europe and Russia and it has gas to sell. However both Biden and Trump have done this 'Make America Great Again' policy by limiting exports, tariffs and subsidizing the Rust Belt, so Washington seems to be not as interested as they once were, or weapons exports and the amount of assets owned by BlackRock are enough to give Washington confidence that they don't need to exert hard power in Europe, like the once did.\n\nThere is an opportunity for the incoming German Chancellor to start the operation of Nordstream II, allow Russia to not have to pay the gas transit fees in Eastern Europe, Russia could walk away from Donbas, as long as they get Crimea and then Ukraine under the IMF and because of assets stripping suffers austerity worst than the Greeks did in 2010 and even western Ukrainians start voting for Pro-Russian parties in 10 years time.\n\nWatch Hypernormalisation, Adam Curtis documentary, free on YouTube, explores how politics became a theatre of the absurd to maintain a broken system via propaganda.",

Any leftist should be able to recognize that this conflict has been ongoing for many years now. Some say right after Russia turned socialists, the US started going after Russia that far back. And we know conflict with Europe goes back even further. \n\nWe were allies in WW2, fighting a common enemy. But what did we do right after? That's right, the Cold War. The Red Scare and McCarthyism was the response. Nato gets built during this time and is an anti Russia organization meant to be very hostile towards the USSR. The conflict reaches its Zenith with the Cuban missle crises where the world barely avoids extinction. Things do calm down, and eventually, the USSR collapses. During this time, deals were getting made. I'm sure you heard of the saying, not 1 inch further than Germany. This has been a Russian concern for the longest time. To ignore this would be a poor analysis imo. You or other people might not view Nato as a hostile entity. But it does not take Russias' view into account. \n\nNow, let's go to 2014 when the US backed right-wing group overthrew the democratically elected Ukrainian president.  This event triggered the invasion of Crimea. This is Russia responding to clear US aggression and not as imperialist.  Access to the Black Sea is very crucial for Russia. Soon after, a ceasefire was reached. But the new Coup government kept  breaking the ceasefire and attacking Ukranians in the east. Also, add that Ukraine kept talking about joining Nato, and amassing weapons and troops right on the Russian border. And this is after years of Putin in raising concern about these aggressions. \n\nI see this not as a war between Russia and Ukraine, but Russia and the United States. Ukraine democracy was already overthrown by the US in 2014. All the moves done by Ukraine since then have been against the interests of its people. The US and Europe goaded them into this war. The war was never about democracy or sovereignty.  But it's just a proxy war waged against Russia by the leading hegemon.",

On this treaty and the following memoranda and agreements, the United States and the ussr agreed to guarantee the border integrity of the former Soviet states including Ukraine. In the treaty and further agreements, Ukraine, Belarus and a few other former Soviet states agreed to surrender their nuclear weapons and to not start a nuclear program. Everything was agreed and things were control under the agreements until Russia began their posturing and annexing. The United States has a choice - to keep their word or break it. Keeping it meant making a proxy war. Breaking it means informing the world that we will not guarantee our signatures on nuclear disarmament treaties. So if we do not support Ukraine here, what will that signal to Kazakhstan? Or Spain? Or Poland? Or Germany? Or Mongolia? These are countries that could have nuclear weapons or a more robust program. I think ultimately having less nuclear weapons and less countries with these weapons makes for a safer world.\n\nNow I know people will respond with \"our world really doesn't mean much anyway.\" You are free to believe that, and I do think our word has degraded over the years, but I think the western world still values the word of the USA and we should do our best to keep it, even if only for the purposes of nuclear disarmament.",

This is orchestrated by the Bourgeoisie, but generally when the Bourgeoisie is weak they need to build power with the help of the middle classes.\n\nThis is exactly what Russia is going through. Putin allied himself with the oligarchy, which are small but powerful sections of the Bourgeoisie. They need to seize Ukraine for the purpose of colonizing the land and resources which in turn they will use to placate the middle classes. Once this alliance between the Bourgeoisie and middle classes is solidified, they can regiment the workers and establish Fascism.\n\nPutin's own goal is the rehabilitation of Tsarism and the establishment of a new Tsarist state. This again fits into the Marxist interpretation that he's trying to rebuild Feudalism, which always means Fascism.\n\nWe are beginning to see something similar in the US. Trump regards himself as a king and plans to rebuild the state into something that he can wield against all social classes. The primary goal is the destruction and regimentation of the working classes. Project 2025 outlines all of this pretty clearly and openly declares that labor unions should be illegal.",

This is why Donbass rose up against Ukraine.\n\nFor nearly eight years after the Euromaidan coup, Russia actually attempted to preserve Ukraine\u2019s borders by trying to end the rebellion in the Donbass regions and persuading their militias to sign a settlement with the Ukrainian government and reintegrate into Ukraine. When that effort stalled, Russia pivoted towards depriving Ukraine of the Donbass region and attempting a swift regime change with the SMO, similar to Operation Danube performed against the Czechoslovakian government in 1968, in order to end the conflict and restore the pre-Maidan status quo. Obviously, that did not work out",

I'm very influenced by Marxist thought especially economically and hope the world order can change, but I do listen to some realpolitik voices because that's the world we're in.  I wish we were in a world where might doesn't make right, but that's where we are now.  \n\nFor a more realpolitik view, I can recommend Scott Horton and Jacques Baud (ex NATO officer).  Neither are leftist but I'd call them anti imperialists and can give an history that includes the Russian viewpoint.  \n\nA very VERY quick summary is that the West promised NATO wasn't going to expand \"one inch\" to the east and all through the formation of Ukraine, from its constitution to the agreement to remove nukes, the assumption was that Ukraine would be neutral.  Ukraine was always ethnically divided which showed up in election results, but after the coup persecution of ethnic Russians grew greatly, and there was a lot of internal pressure in Russia to do something.   Technically Russia invoked article 51 of the UN Charter, the duty to protect, and have since said their intervention was thus legal.  Not arguing that, only mentioning their perspective which is not widely known.  But Russia gave decades of warnings about its red lines and made sincere efforts to collectively address its security concerns, including in 2021 before the invasion. \n\nI don't consider Russia the good guys here, but I do think the US wanted Russia to invade and deliberately provoked them.  As a leftist, I hate the war but realize that shifts in world governments and order often comes after a war and hope it can be used for good.  Certainly the rise of BRICS may lead to American financial colonialism having less power.   I've read inside Russia that to drum up popular support the government has had to bring back some communist memories and policies which may have some positive effect long term, who knows.\n\nThat said, like any war, it absolutely sucks for the average person, especially on the Ukrainian side.  Last poll I read showed 76% of Ukrainians in Ukraine wanted the war to end even if it ceded territory, but 70% of Ukrainians who fled to the west want the east to continue until the end.  People who cheerlead one side in a war rarely know about the horrors of war.  \n\nI also think this is an opportunity to educate people on why the elites wanted a war - economics of war are almost never talked about even in history, but they're a prime reason why wars start.  We're in a crisis of overproduction and the capitalist system needed more countries to loot.",

We need only look to the examples of Afghanistan, the Kurds, and the Vietnamese to understand what it means to be an American \u2018ally\u2019. To call the American imperialists fair-weather friends would be flattering them. Trump has never concealed his utter contempt for Zelensky during a mutual war of words between the two. \u00a0Trump has called him a dictator and blamed him, as well as former POTUS Biden, for a conflict he referred to as a \u201closer war\u201d. To this end he organised peace talks with Russia that excluded Ukraine, talks that will prove far more successful than the peace conference organised by Biden that excluded Russia. Biden provided Ukraine with tens of billions worth of military aid attempting to neutralise Russia\u2019s attempt to expand its interests and sphere of influence by imposing on Russia a long drawn out war of attrition. But Trump feels the cost to America of this policy is too expensive for far too little strategic gain. He has made it clear that the US will no longer send aid to Ukraine without the US getting\u00a0 access to Ukraine\u2019s mineral riches in exchange. Zelensky and the Ukrainian capitalists are obviously horrified at this prospect. They knew that they would have to share these assets, but to have to surrender participation in their exploitation completely is too much for them to agree to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://thestruggle.home.blog/2025/03/03/the-struggle-to-make-sense-of-the-row-between-trump-and-zelensky/",
