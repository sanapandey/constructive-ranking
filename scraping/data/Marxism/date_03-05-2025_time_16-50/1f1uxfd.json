    "selftext": "Hi comrades,\n\nI'm currently reading the first volume of Das Kapital, but I haven't finished it yet. I have a question about the determination of wages that I hope you can help with.\n\nFrom what I understand so far, Marx seems to suggest that wages are determined by the value of what workers consume to produce the labor power they sell. However, in my country (and in many underdeveloped countries), wages often don't even cover the basic cost of living.\n\nI know that Das Kapital is not just a study of capitalism during the industrial revolution but rather an analysis of capitalism \"in a vacuum,\" independent of its stage of development. My question is: How do we reconcile this theory with the reality that wages in underdeveloped countries often fall short of covering the cost of reproducing labor power?\n\nI want to understand this better to help my coworkers develop class consciousness. I promote Marxist ideas among them, and I've made some progress, but this issue with wages not covering the cost of reproducing labor power complicates my efforts.\n\nAny insights or explanations would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

There's one seemingly obvious thing to me here. \n\n>wages in underdeveloped countries often fall short of covering the cost of reproducing labor power\n\nThey do and they don't though. Production is still going right? If labor power wasn't being reproduced, production would stop (or at least take a serious hit) because the labor power necessary for production hasn't been adequately reproduced. \n\nCapitalists don't really care about the quality of life of their workers as long as they can technically work. And advanced manufacturing technology can mean that the complexity/demand of work is less, which can mean less healthy workers are still and to fulfill the task. \n\n>wages often don't even cover the basic cost of living\n\nThat really depends on how you measure \"basic cost of living\". That could be measured by assuming one person has their own 1 bedroom apartment, which isn't a bad goal, but the reality is that people often will have roommates or live with family. The capitalist has no reason to pay people enough for that 1 bedroom apartment if people are desperate and will make their lives less comfortable for the sake of having any job at all.",

I dont know if it covers all the possible explanations but it works.\n\nIts not about giving you enough for renting an apartment, its about giving you enough to keep you breathing. Quality of life isnt included. You can still live with your parents and if you can not, there is still a reserve army of labour. Unemployed professionals make your living posibilities a matter of none importance.\n\nIn Milei's Argentina people reduced consume, enterprises reduced their sales, but at the same time some monopolies got more profit, why? Because they keep wages as low as they can",

So there will likely be protests and strikes, but these will be seen as partisan and likely will not result in material improvements for the laborers. This is the view from expats outside of Argentina, so take it with a grain of salt",

Do you think there will be mass extinction of your country's working class?\n\nWages should be considered based on a \"family\" as a whole so, for instance, in 1800s Europe it might be typical for one man's wage to cover himself, his wife and his children (the bourgeois family institution). In another situation it might be expected that a married couple *and* their children above the age of 10 *all* labour while grandparents contribute domestic labour or other support to *collectively* earn enough to survive.",
