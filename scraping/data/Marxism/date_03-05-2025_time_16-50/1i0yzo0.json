It is for this reason, I am a huge fan of Manga, indie-music, art movies, web comics, small youtube producers, and the odd-original television series.\n\nI sometimes watch shows like Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and while I don't believe its of a proletarian perspective, it seems counter to the bourgeois form. It is, either petite bourgeois, or something else entirely.\n\nI think its certainly possible for these bourgeois producers like Adult Swim to make petite-bougeois aligned media. \n\nBut when I watch shows like the aforementioned  [Aqua Teen Hunger Force]( make an episode about [colonialism](https://aqua-teen-hunger-force.fandom.com/wiki/Storage_Zeebles). Where the content of the piece is, \"Pacifism in the face of colonialism leads to destruction of your way of life\". Wherein, a native people are colonized, and their lands are exploited and they are left with nothing. Because they chose not to resist colonialism from the start, hoping to make peace. After all their natural resources were exhausted,  it was turned into a venue for weddings, which is a commentary of capitalist land use patterns. \n\nI look at this episode, and I wonder, how could this be produced by an American company, and shown to settlers?",

Kirk Douglas was quite left wing, and financed the production of the film himself because Holywood didn't want to (because of its revolutionary message).\n\nEdit: Another point about *Spartacus* which I think is important regarding this question: Douglas didn't just produce an historical drama about Spartacus. He adapted the film specifically from the 1951 novel *Spartacus* by Howard Frank, a communist who was blacklisted under McCarthyism and who consequently had to self-publish *Spartacus*, which faced suppression when it was published (libraries would refuse to stock it, for example). That to me says a lot first of all about Douglas' own politics, and secondly about *why* he wanted to produce such a film. He certainly would have known the revolutionary message behind Frank's work, and was apparently enthused enough by that to make a film of it.",

Sometimes scripts slip through with, maybe not a revolutionary message but a rebellious one that raises class consciousness and can be anti-war and anti-imperialist. Andor is a good example.",

Rebellious ideas might help people connect the dots to explain injustices and see some aspects of capitalist exploitation.\u00a0 There might be passive consumption of these ideas, and individual actions.\n\nRevolutionary ideas are what motivate people into taking action to oppose exploitation, while pointing out how exploitation is baked into the capitalist system. Revolutionary ideas can move the class struggle forward when masses of people take them up.",

I suppose it's *possible* that certain bits of media might \"fall through the cracks,\" so to speak, if the producers take a hands-off approach and let the artists write what they want with little supervision, particularly with small-scale and independent productions. But taken broadly, bourgeois media is capable of being anti-capitalist, of criticizing the present state of things, only so long as it doesn't promote a positive vision of change and as long as it turns a profit. Squid games and other popular south korean media, for example, are well known for depicting the horrors of capitalism, but few if any would actually say, \"thats why the proletariat needs to unite to overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish socialism\" or something along those lines. One doesn't need to love the system, they only need to think theres no better alternative.",

It is not the socialists' fault that ownership of the printing means of production in bourgeois countries is almost entirely bourgeois.\n\nSo it is both possible and does exist in reality.\n\nIn fact, a change in socio-economic formations is impossible without people who strive for a more progressive formation taking advantage, to some extent, of what is provided by the existing formation.\n\nThe reality of the capitalist formation is that the printing and film production means are in the hands of the bourgeoisie. And the representatives of the creative intelligentsia of socialist views are forced to take this into account.",

The world of media and art is about engagement which is driven by giving people what they want. \n\nProducers and showrunners will develop and promote anything that people will pay (or sit through multiple ads) to watch. If that means making a show or movie espousing anti-capitalism, then sure, they'll do it, even if it's hypocritical.\n\nHowever, since we live in a neoliberal world order where most people have given in to false consciousness, the demand for revolutionary content is simply not there. Best we get nowadays are independent creators making YouTube videos.\n\nMoreover, with the media constantly on the crosshair of political polarization, production companies are becoming increasingly afraid of taking risks when it comes to messaging.",

Silo is also good but I've only gotten about halfway through the first season.\n\nBut imho, most modern \"anti-capitalist\" media feel a little defanged and non-revolutionary. The problem is that they acknowledge the flaws of capitalism but seem to depict them as outlier issues rather than symptoms of the system. \n\nThey might criticize bad working conditions and exploitation (like Severance), but never quite indict capitalism itself. More often than not, the solution is to shut down the bad guy and magically, all is well. Or worse, replace the bad guy but keep the system running (Ready Player One's ending was really mid imho).\n\nBut, it is true that people are beginning to rekindle their revolutionary spirit, however, I think it's matter of disillusionment than it is the media. The system is getting worse at a rapid rate so it's natural people wanna seek out a better alternative. If anything, the media has yet to catch up to this sentiment, still retaining the moderate liberal narrative.",

He gets so popular that he gets invited into a cozy upperclass live. He keeps doing his broadcast and keeps imitating his revolutionary past so that he can sustain his upperclass life. Point is: Capitalism already profits from capitalism critic. Just look what black mirror has become. It prophesized its own downfall. It became a bland imitation of its own past. Tons of movies feature capitalism critic and it became just another genre. An outlet for those who would like to be revolutionary but lack the will to act on it. They find satisfaction in consuming capitalism critic instead of acting like a post capitalist or advocating for it. Just look at squid game for a popular example.\n\nSo we must seriously ask ourself: What even is revolutionary art at this point? It seems that either revolutionary art is impossible to integrate into something that is consumed by many OR capitalism critic and dystopia genres are not enough.",

V assassinates the fascist government and causes a popular uprising, and then the film ends, and probably the army takes over or something.",

Its been subsumed. the average person watches it and goes \"IM MAD AS HELL TOO! I WANNA YELL OUT MY WINDOW!\", instead of seeing the obvious sarcastic revolutionary message. That, yelling out your window alone isn't enough, yelling as individuals, then going back to TV isn't doing anything..\n\nIts why I asked the question, can bourgeois art actually be revolutionary. If its funding is principally from bourgeois constituents, how can i express something truly revolutionary in its content or form.\n\nIt would be metaphysical to say its impossible, I feel. But, I think its almost impossible, and never has been possible. Mass media in a bourgeois society,  is by its own inception, in opposition to revolutionary content that cannot be easily subsumed into it.\n\nTruth is, I think all of the anti-capitalist things in the media are for fascist audiences.",
