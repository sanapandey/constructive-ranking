    "selftext": "So basically my understanding of overaccumulation is that competition drives capitalists to invest in machinery, which lowers the value of a commodity and increases the volume of production. Since commodity values fall, so does the SNLT for labor power, meaning lower wages.\n\nSo at the sane time commodity output is expanding, worker consumption is falling.\n\nNow, a portion of surplus value must be reinvested to stay competitive. What I don't understand is why the consumption of the rich cannot fully absorb the excess production. \n\nThey own the surplus right? So why not spend it on consumption? I can see ot being a problem if capital accumulation happens faster than they can spend their income, but that's not a necessary condition in theory right?\n\nI guess my question would be, if demands are unlimited like is assumed in classical econ, why is the consumption of the rich insufficient for prevention of a recession due to overaccumulation?",

It\u2019s a numbers game, once you reach a crisis of over production there\u2019s no way for say 10% of population to buy the amount of stuff the rest of the population buys. One rich person can only buy so much food before it goes bad. There\u2019s only so many TVs one person is going to buy, so profits fall and that means they stop investing their money too which makes the crisis worse. \n\nThere maybe some explanation as to why, but the fact of the matter is that they don\u2019t, they have never been able to make up for drop in consumer spending in any of the many crises we\u2019ve seen.",

So the extra surplus has to be invested into capital goods, which produce both consumer and capital goods. If we just produce capital goods producing other capital goods, then we end up in a vicious cycle of producing goods that are useless. As they're not being used for the consumption of the masses.",

Fear of crisis also makes them save (IIRC Marx uses 'hoard'). Recessions and crises don't affect all capitalists equally and the capitalists who haven't invested in the latest technology, or haven't built up capital reserves, are the ones most likely to go bankrupt when a crisis hits.",

If the company is non-profit, then all that occurs is [4] goes out where [4] came in. This will vary from commodity to commodity across the market, but ultimately you will never have more than breaking even when capitalism has no non-capitalist markets to absorb, ie no new money into the capitalist global market that was not there before. At worst, the parasitism of an economy where shareholders and such squirrel away wealth means billions are being taken out of the economy every year. Probably trillions, I don't have the exact figure.\n\nYou will only ever have recession now there is not a single non capitalist market.",

The rich are forever consuming a larger percentage of the total value created by a society.\n\nI don't really understand the business cycle that well, but I would think recessions would still happen because structural adjustments toward this inevitable new state are delayed. Businesses need to reach the breaking point and go out of business, and new businesses then emerge that service the rich.",
