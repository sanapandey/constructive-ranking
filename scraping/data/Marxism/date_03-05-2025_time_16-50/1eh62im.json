Or like the Christian Paladin and the Saracen Sultan, who, before they draw their sparkling sabers, introduce themselves in a loud voice, challenge each other with the list of their ancestors and victorious tournaments and swear death to each other.\n\nThat\u2019s just what was missing! On the one hand, the highest leader of the world\u2019s largest state and the \u201ccommunist\u201d world proletariat, and on the other hand, a nobody, a nothing.\n\nIn reality, the facts and material forces acting in the substructure deterministically take up the discussion among themselves; and those who then dictate the text or hack into the keys are, like those who give the lecture, mere mechanisms, loudspeakers that passively convert the waves into voices; and it is not said that a loudspeaker with a power of 2000 watts doesn\u2019t just produce the greatest nonsense.\n\nIt is therefore the same questions that emerge with regard to the importance of both social conditions in today\u2019s Russia and international relations at the economic, political and military levels; they impose themselves just as much up there as they do down here, and they can only be clarified if they are juxtaposed with the theory that grasps what has already happened and is known, and if these questions are juxtaposed with the history of this theory, which a very long time ago \u2013 which remains indelible \u2013 was a common one.\n\nSo we know very well that Stalin\u2019s answer from the upper Kremlin stories does not respond to our words and is not addressed to us. In order to continue the debate, it is not even necessary for him to know our theoretical organs\\[5\\]. The things and forces \u2013 whether large or small, past, present or future \u2013 remain the same, despite the whims of symbolism. When ancient philosophy wrote \u201csunt nomina rerum\u201d (literally: the names belong to things), it wanted to say that things do not belong to the name. Translated into our language, this means: the thing determines the name, not the other way round. You can continue to dedicate 99% of your work to the name, portraits, epithets, lives and graves of Great Men: we will continue in the shadows, knowing that soon the generation will come who will only smile at you, you famous men of the great and very small calibre.\n\nBut the things between the lines in Stalin\u2019s writing are too important for us to deny him the dialogue. For this reason, and not from a \u201c\u00e1 tout seigneur tout honneur\u201d, we answer and expect the new appeal \u2013 even if it takes another two years, because we don\u2019t have a hurry (isn\u2019t it true, ex-Marxist?).\n\n\u2026\n\n**Commodities and Socialism**\n\nHe recalls the first elements of economic doctrine to discuss the \u201csystem of commodity production under the socialist regime\u201d. We have in various texts (which, of course, in turn, were careful not to say anything new) argued that any system of production of commodities is a non-socialist system, and we are going to reiterate this: but Stalin (Stalin, Stalin; we are dealing with an article that could also be attributed to a committee that \u2013 \u201cin a hundred years\u2019 time\u201d \u2013 surrogates a deceased or incapacitated Stalin: however, the symbolism with its notations, within the conventional limits of a practice of convenience, also serves us) could have written about a system of commodity production after the proletarian conquest of power. Such a statement wouldn\u2019t be stepping into the realms of blasphemy.\n\nEvidently some \u201ccomrades\u201d in Russia have stated \u2013 referring to Engels \u2013 that preserving, after the nationalisation of the means of production, the system of commodity production, i.e. the character of commodities to products, means having preserved the capitalist economic system. In theory there is no Stalin who can prove them wrong. When, and if, they say that, being able to abolish commodity production, they have neglected or forgotten to do so, then they are certainly wrong!\n\nBut Stalin wants to prove that in a \u201csocialist country\u201d \u2013 a dubious term \u2013 the production of commodities can exist, and he refers to Marx\u2019s definitions and their clear synthesis \u2013 perhaps not entirely beyond reproach \u2013 in a little propaganda booklet by Vladimir\\[8\\].\n\nWe have dealt several times with this subject, i.e. commodity production, its emergence and rule, its clearly capitalist character.\\[9\\]\n\nAccording to Joseph Stalin, it is possible to stay in a mercantile environment and dictate safe plans, without the terrible maelstrom pulling the reckless pilot into the centre of the whirlpool and swallowing the abyss of capitalism. But his article reveals, to those who read as Marxists, that the turns tighten and accelerate \u2013 as the theory has established.\n\nAs Lenin reminds us, the commodity is an object with two characteristics: that of being useful to man \u2013 that of being able to be exchanged for another object. But the lines preceding the passage, quoted from above, are simply these:\n\n\u201cIn capitalist society, the production of commodities is predominant, and Marx\u2019s analysis therefore begin with an analysis of commodity.\u201c\n\nAnd so the commodity has those two prerogatives, and it only becomes a commodity when the second is juxtaposed with the first.\n\nThis, the use value, is completely comprehensible even to a materialistic dish like us, even to a child, is organoleptic; we lick sugar once, and then stretch out our hand for another little piece. Long is the way, and Marx flies down it in that extraordinary paragraph, before this sugar takes on an exchange value and is given a wheat-cotton equivalence that he did not expect! Only then can the delicate problem raised by Stalin arise.\n\nWe know very well, like Marx, Lenin and Stalin, what a devilry is released as soon as the exchange value is born. So says Vladimir. Where bourgeois economists saw relationships between things, Marx discovered relationships between men! And what do the three tomes of Marx and the 77 pages of Lenin prove? An easy thing. Where the current economy sees the perfect equivalence of an exchange, we no longer see exchange of the two objects, but men in social motion, and we no longer see equivalence, but swindle. Karl Marx speaks of a little demon who gives the commodity that miraculous and at first sight incomprehensible character. Lenin, like any other Marxist, would have been horrified to hear that it is possible to produce and exchange commodities while at the same time expelling that little demon with exorcisms: does Stalin believe it? Or does he just want to tell us that the little demon is stronger than him?\n\nJust as the ghosts of the medieval knights took revenge for Cromwell\u2019s revolution by infesting English castles, bourgeoisly surrendered to the landlords, so too the goblin-fetish of the commodity runs unstoppable through the halls of the Kremlin and sneers at the millions of words pouring from loudspeakers of the 19th Congress\\[10\\].\n\nWanting to establish that mercantilism and capitalism are not absolutely identical, Stalin once again employs our method. He goes back over the centuries, and with Marx recalls that \u201cunder certain regimes (slavery, feudalism, etc.), commodity production existed without leading to capitalism\u201d. Indeed, this is what Marx said in a passage from his vigorous historical overview, but to a far different end and with far more development. The bourgeois economist asserts that there can never be any other mechanism than exchange to link production to consumption, for he knows well that as long as that mechanism is in force, capital will remain the master of the world. Marx replied: we shall now go and see the historical trend of tomorrow; for now I compel you to look at the data of the past: mercantilism has not always brought the result of labour to those who needed to consume it. He cites the example of primitive economies based on gathering and immediate consumption, the ancient types of families and clans, the closed islands of the feudal system with direct internal consumption without the products taking the form of commodities. With the development and complication of technology and needs, sectors are being created that are fuelled first by barter and then by trade itself, but (in the same way that has served us with regard to private property) it remains proven that the mercantile system is not \u201cnatural\u201d, i.e. as the bourgeois claims to be permanent and eternal. Now this late appearance of mercantilism (or system of commodity production as Stalin says), its coexistence on the margins of other systems, serves precisely to show how, having become a universal system as soon as the capitalist system of production spreads, it must together die with it.\n\nTo cite passages from Marx against Proudhon, Lassalle, Rodbertus and a hundred others, which are solely devoted to denouncing the attempt to reconcile mercantilism and the socialist emancipation of the proletariat, would be too long.\n\nFor Lenin, this is the cornerstone of Marxism, with which it is difficult to square the current thesis of Stalin\u2019s assertion:\n\n\u201cWhy then, one asks, cannot commodity production similarly serve our socialist society for a certain period\u201d, and \u201ccommodity production leads to capitalism only if there is private owner-ship of the means of production, if labour power appears in the market as a commodity which can be bought by the capitalist and exploited in the process of production \u201c.\n\nThe hypothesis is obviously absurd, because in the Marxist analysis, each time a mass of commodities appears, it is precisely because the proletarians deprived of all reserves have had to sell their labour power. When in the past there were those (limited) sectors of commodity production, it was because labour power was not sold spontaneously as it is today, but was extorted by force from enslaved prisoners or serfs bound by relationships of personal dependence.\n\nDo we have to reprint the first couple of lines of Capital again? \u201cThe wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as \u2018an immense accumulation of commodities\u2019\u201d.\n\n**The Russian Economy**\n\nAfter showing, with varying degrees of skill, an ostentatious respect for doctrinal sources, the text addresses the question of the current Russian economy. It is intended to silence people who have apparently claimed that a system of commodity production inevitably leads to the restoration of capitalism, or we who say more clearly: the system of commodity production survives because we are in full capitalism.\n\nOn the Russian economy there are the following admissions in the remarkable text. If the large industrial factories have been expropriated, however, small and medium-sized industries are not expropriated, indeed doing so would have been a \u201ccriminal\u201d act. According to the author, they should be oriented towards production cooperatives.\n\nThere are two sectors of commodity production in Russia: the first is the state production which is national. In state enterprises the means of production and the production itself, i.e. the products, are national property. in Italy, for example, the tobacconists and thus the cigarettes, which it sells, are State-owned. But is this enough to give us the right to say that we are in the phase of \u201cliquidation of wage labour\u201d and that the worker \u201cis not forced to sell his labour power\u201d? No, certainly not.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to the other sector, that of agriculture: in the kolkhozes, says the brochure, even though the land and machinery are state property, the products of labour belong not to the state, but to the kolkhoz itself. The kolkhoz does not dispose of them other than as commodities and exchanges them for the goods it needs. There are no links between kolkhozes and cities other than this exchange. \u201cBecause of this,\u201d Stalin says, \u201ccommodity production and trade are as much a necessity with us today as they were, say, thirty years ago\u201d.\n\nLet us leave aside, for the time being, the argument that the possibility exists, albeit a very distant one, of overcoming this situation, but let us note that it is no longer a question of saying, as Lenin did in 1922: we have political power in our hands: militarily we hold on, but in the economic field we must return to purely capitalist mercantile forms. The corollary of such an observation was: let us suspend for the time being the construction of the socialist economy, we will come back to it after the European revolution. What is being said today is quite different and even the opposite.\n\nOne no longer even tries to establish a thesis such as the following: in the transition from capitalism to socialism, however, for some time, a certain section of production takes place in the form of commodities.\n\nHere it is said: everything is a commodity; and there is no other economic framework than mercantile exchange, and, consequently, the purchase of labour power, even in large state-owned enterprises. And, indeed, the means of subsistence, where does the factory worker find them? The kolkhoz sells them to him through the intermediary of private merchants or transfers them to the state, from which it buys tools, fertilisers and so on. The worker goes to the state shops to buy supplies and pays in cash. Can the state distribute the products it owns directly to its workers? Certainly not, since the (mostly Russian) worker does not consume tractors, cars, locomotives and even less\u2026 cannons and machine guns. Clothes and furniture are of course produced by these small and medium-sized enterprises, which have not been touched by the state.\n\nThe state cannot therefore do otherwise than to give a salary in money to those who depend on it and who, with this money, buy what they want (bourgeois formula which means: the little they can). The fact that the boss who distributes the wages is a state which, \u201cideally\u201d or \u201clegally\u201d, represents the workers themselves, changes nothing until that state becomes able to start distributing in numerically appreciable numbers outside the mercantile mechanism.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt was demonstrated that to get out of capitalism, it is necessary to destroy, together with the mercantile production system, the social division of labour, and \u2013 Stalin reminds us \u2013 the very technical division by enterprises which leads to the brutalisation of the worker and on which rests the despotism of the factory. In Stalin, we still see an effort to fight against the former but he says nothing about the latter.\n\nNothing in today\u2019s Russia moves in the direction of these conquests, both those evoked today and those left in the shadows.\n\nState factory and kolkhoz are separated by a barrier that only comes up when they are doing business against each other: under these conditions, there is no chance that it will be shot down tomorrow rather than today! Who, then, will reduce the social division of labour between worker and peasant? What will free the former from the need to sell too many hours of labour for too little money and food, and will therefore allow him to contend with the capitalist tradition for the monopoly of science and culture?\n\nNot only are we not in the first phase of socialism, but we have not even reached full state capitalism, an economy in which all production is composed of commodities circulating by means of money, in which each commodity is at the disposal of the state, so that the state can centrally fix all relations of equivalence, including that of labour power and wages. Such a state would function at the service of capital, which has become anonymous and subterranean, and the working class could neither control it economically and politically nor conquer it. However, Russia is a long way from this system, and we only have a state industrialism\\[11\\]. This system, which arose after the anti-feudal revolution, is valid for developing and spreading industry and capitalism at a blazing pace, with state investments in public works, including colossal ones, and for accelerating a bourgeois transformation of the economy and agrarian legal relations. The \u201ccollective\u201d agricultural enterprises are neither state-owned nor, it is clear, socialist. We are at the level of the cooperatives that arose in the Po Valley at the time of Baldini and Prampolini, who managed agricultural production by renting, if not buying lands, and also state land such as floodplains and others, which date back to the old dukedoms. What cannot reach Stalin in the Kremlin is that in the kolkhoz they undoubtedly steal a hundred times more than in those dull but honest cooperatives.\n\nSo the industrial state, which has to bargain to buy food in the countryside on the terrain of the \u201cfree market\u201d, maintains the remuneration of labour power and labour time at the same level as private capitalist industry. It can even be said that, from the point of view of economic development, America, for example, is closer than Russia to full state capitalism. After all, while the Russian worker spends perhaps three fifths of his wages on agricultural products, the American worker spends them on industrial products, and the food itself is often delivered to him by industry in the form of cans (the poor man!).\n\n**State and Retreat**\n\nHere another big question arises: Stalin admits that he does not foresee any intervention in the system of relations between agriculture and industry in order to bring them closer together \u2013 which would not be socialism, but more statism \u2013 even though, after the great industrial development in Russia, these relations are still completely of the bourgeois type.\n\nEven this retreat is skilfully covered by a doctrinal screen. What can we do about it? Expropriate the kolkhoz brutally? And then Stalin starts to call for the future abolition of the state, which he wanted to do away with on another occasion, whereas he back then put a mask on, as if he wanted to say: \u201cYou\u2019re only kidding, right guys?\u201d.\n\nObviously, the thesis that the workers\u2019 state must disarm at a time when the entire agricultural sector is still organised on the basis of mercantile forms of private property cannot be defended; for even if one were to accept, for a moment, the thesis discussed above that the production of commodities can survive in the age of socialism, it would still be inseparable from that other thesis: as long as mercantilism is not eliminated everywhere, we cannot speak of the disappearance of the state.\n\nHaving established this, there remains only one thing to conclude. In Russia the solution of the fundamental relationship between town and country (which, in the course of a dramatic evolution, has lost its thousand-year-old Asian and feudal characteristics) presents itself exactly as in the capitalist regime, and Stalin formulates it in the classical terms that the bourgeois countries have always given him: to try to regulate the exchange between the products of industry and those of the earth.\n\n\u201cThis system will therefore require a significant increase in industrial production.\u201d Here we are! If you leave the state out of it for a moment, it\u2019s even a \u201cliberal\u201d solution!\n\nThey confess to a position of complete powerlessness, in regards to solution of the question of the relationship between agriculture and industry. Their only proposition is to industrialise and increase production: this solution is therefore to the detriment of the workers. This takes us to another great question: the relationship between state and firm, and the relationship between firms.\n\nThe question arose before Stalin in the form: does the law of value which applies in capitalist production also exist in Russia? Does it also apply for the state owned, large scale industry? This law determines that commodity exchange always follows equivalents: the appearance of \u201cfreedom, equality and Bentham\u201d\\[12\\], a deceptive facade that Marx destroyed, when he showed that capitalism doesn\u2019t produce for the product, but for profit. Between the jaws of this vice, between necessity and the domination of economic laws, Stalin\u2019s manifesto moves in such a way, which confirms our thesis: in its most powerful form, capital subjects the state to itself, even when the state appears as the judicial sole owner of all businesses.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Certainties and uncertainties**\n\nLet\u2019s first remark: To meet the objections of Russian economists, that invoke Engels to clarify that one can only leave capitalism if one leaves commodity production, that capitalism is only overcome where commodity production is overcome, Stalin only tries to read something different out of a single paragraph in \u201cAnti-D\u00fchring\u201d than what is written there, whereas in the entire section \u201cSocialism: Theoretical \u2013 Production \u2013 Distribution\u201d Engels develops the addressed thesis \u2013 and very well-tailored for the Stalinist D\u00fchring as well.\n\nThe paragraph reads: \u201cWith the seizing of the means of production by society production of commodities is done away with, and, simultaneously, the mastery of the product over the producer.\u201d.\n\nEngels, remarks Stalin, didn\u2019t specify whether this concerns \u201call\u201d or only \u201ca part\u201d of the means of production. The distinction might, or might not, seem very smart to one, from a theoretical point of view however, it is wrong. Only, so Stalin further, the social seizing of \u201call\u201d means of production (Small and large scale industry, agriculture) allows to \u201cget rid\u201d of the system of commodity production. Caramba!\n\nIn 1919 we bestirred ourselves together with Lenin (and Stalin) until exhaustion, to force down the stubborn social democrats\u2019 and anarchists\u2019 throats, that the means of production cannot be conquered on a single day and by coup, and that precisely because of this \u2013 and only because of this \u2013 the terror, the dictatorship, is necessary. And today, new textbooks on political economy shall be published, that the absurdity, that all products lose their character as commodities on the day on which a functionary ascended to the Kremlin presents some Stalin with a decree for signature, which expropriates the last chicken of the last member of the last kolkhoz, is accepted.\n\nIn another paragraph, Engels talks about the seizing of all means of production, which is why we now need to hear that the above cited \u201cformula of Engels cannot be described as entirely clear and exact\u201d \\[Stalin, p. 11\\].\n\nBy the beard of the prophet Abraham, that\u2019s strong stuff! Friedrich Engels, of all people, the contemplative, calm, sharply defining, crystal clear Friedrich, master of the patience to get a holed ship going again and to straighten the historical doctrine; whose modesty and prowess are unreachable (behind the impetuous Marx, who occasionally might seem difficult to understand because of his far sight and excellent language, and because of this strength maybe \u2013 maybe \u2013 might be easier to distort); Engels, whose language is so fluid, and who by talent and because of scientific discipline doesn\u2019t omit a necessary word, nor adds an unnecessary one: of all people, one accuses him of a lack of precision and clarity!\n\n\u2026\n\nWe of course here cannot recite for Stalin all the chapters, but as usual we cite the essential, because clear and unequivocal paragraphs, which we accept without restrictions and not say cum grano salis \\[with a grain of salt\\]. We know by old experience, how such grains of salt have turned into mountains.\n\nEngels: \u201cThe \u2018exchange of labour for labour on the principle of equal valuation\u2019, in so far as it has any meaning, that is to say, the mutual exchangeability of products of equal social labour, hence the law of value, is the fundamental law of precisely commodity production, hence also of its highest form, capitalist production.\u201d. It follows the famous passage in which D\u00fchring is reproached for, just as Proudhon, imagining the future society as a market economy and not seeing, how he is thus describing a capitalist economy. An \u201cimaginary society\u201d, Engels says. At least Stalin in his not to be despised scripture describes an actually existing capitalist economy.\n\nMarx: \u201cLet us now picture to ourselves, by way of change, a community of free individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in common, in which the labour power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour power of the community.\u201d. This sentence alone is a revolutionary programme. With the future achievement of this form of social organisation, succinctly labelled as communism, one returns to the Robinson with which one started. What does that mean? Robinson\u2019s product was no commodity, but an object of use, because there was \u2013 of course \u2013 no exchange. With eagle wings we fly over the entire history of humanity: \u201cAll the characteristics of Robinson\u2019s labour are here \\[\u201chere\u201d means: in the communist association\\] repeated, but with this difference, that they are social, instead of individual.\u201d. The only necessary textbook to learn to read is the primer! And one reads: The product of labour ceases to be a commodity, when society is socialist. Then Marx arrives at the juxtaposition of this \u201cstate of things\u201d (of socialism) with commodity production, and shows, that one is the dialectical, utter, relentless and irreconcilable opposite of the other.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Socialism and Communism**\n\nWe will conclude the economic argument with a synthesis of the stages of the future society \u2013 a topic, in which the whole of Stalin\u2019s \u201cdocument\u201d (we were looking for that word the entire time) is causing confusion. \u201cFrance Press\u201d accused Stalin of plagiarising the scripture of Nikolai Bukharin about the economic laws of the transition period. Stalin however mentions the texts several times and even draws upon a critique authored by Lenin\\[20\\]. Commissioned with the preparation of the programme of the Comintern (which stayed a draft), Bukharin deserves the great credit of emphasising the commodity-negating postulate of the socialist revolution as an issue of primary importance. He also followed Lenin in the analysis of the transformation period \u201cin Russia\u201d and the assessment, that during the dictatorship of the proletariat, forms of commodity production were to be tolerated.\n\nEverything becomes clear, if one bears in mind, that these investigations of Lenin and Bukharin didn\u2019t concern themselves with the two stages of communist society, of which Marx talks and which Lenin in a wonderful passage of \u201cState and Revolution\u201d outlines, but with a phase, which precedes both those stages.\n\nThe following scheme can serve as a summary of the certainly not easy topic of today\u2019s \u201cdialogue\u201d.\n\nTransition stage: The proletariat has conquered political power and renders all non-proletarian classes politically powerless, precisely because it cannot \u201cget rid\u201d of those classes in an instant. This means, the proletarian state controls an economy, in which partly, even if in decreasing amount, both a market-based distribution as well as forms of private disposal of products and means of production exist (these be fragmented or concentrated). The economy is not yet socialist, it\u2019s a transition economy.\n\nLower stage of communism, or if you want, socialism: society disposes already generally of products, which are allocated to members of society by quotas. This function doesn\u2019t require commodity exchange or money anymore \u2013 one cannot let Stalin\u2019s statement pass, according to which the simple exchange without money, but still based on the law of value, should bring us closer to communism: rather it is about a kind of regression to bartering. The allocation of products on the contrary follows from the center, without return of an equivalent. Example: If a malaria epidemic breaks out, in the affected region quinine is distributed for free, but solely one tubule per person.\n\nIn this phase, not only compulsory work is necessary, but also the recording of the performed labour time and its certificate \u2013 the famous \u201clabour voucher\u201d, so much discussed in the last century. The peculiarity of this certificate is, that it cannot be kept in reserve, so that any try to accumulate it leads to the loss of the performed labour quantum without compensation. The law of value is buried.\n\nEngels: \u201cHence, on the assumptions we made above, society will not assign values to products\u201d.\n\nHigher stage of communism, which can be unhesitatingly called integral socialism: the productivity of labour is in such a way, that, apart from pathological cases, neither coercion nor rationing are necessary, to exclude the squandering of products and human energy. Free consumption for all. Example: The pharmacies are distributing quinine free and without constraints. And if one would take ten tubules to poison himself? He would obviously be just as stupid as the people, which confuse a rotten bourgeois society with socialism.\n\nIn which stage does Stalin find himself? In none of the three. He is in a transition period, not away from capitalism, but towards capitalism. It\u2019s almost honorable and certainly not self poisoning.",

The USSR, he says, supports its sister countries through economic aid, which accelerates their industrialisation. Does that also apply for Czechoslovakia as well as China, that is, for an already capitalist country, as well as for a country in which the capitalist mode of production is still in the early stages and only constitutes a fraction of aggregate production? Let\u2019s see. \u201cIt may be confidently said that, with this pace of industrial development, it will soon come to pass that these countries will not only be in no need of imports from capitalist countries, but will themselves feel the necessity of finding an outside market for their surplus products.\u201d \\[Stalin, p.32\\]. Which again brings up the question: if production (and export) is done for the west, then those are commodities; and if it is done for Russia, what are they then?\n\nThe point about this return to the system of commodity production, consummated with flying colours, which is identical with the capitalist system in form and character (if one does not fall for the economic make-up), is that it is founded on the imperative: export to produce more! Effectively it is the same imperative which also pertains within the supposed \u201csocialist country\u201d: the relations between town and country, between the famous \u201cassociated classes\u201d, are about an import-export business, because here also, as already mentioned, the law of geometric progression applies, which says: more production! More production!\n\nWhat remains of Marxism? Barely anything! Since \u201cthe working class, \\[is\\] now in power\u201d, it is \u201cnecessary\u201d to \u201cabandon\u201d the offensive formulas which distinguish between necessary labour and surplus labour, paid and unpaid labour \\[Stalin, p.18/19\\]. While the law of surplus value (which here according to Stalin\u2019s criteria is a theory and not a law), first somewhat was spared, from today the following applies: \u201cIt is said that the law of the average rate of profit is the basic economic law of modern capitalism. That is not true. Modern capitalism, monopoly capitalism\u201c (there you go: what did you know, poor Marx?) \u201ccannot content it-self with the average profit, which moreover has a tendency to decline, in view of the increasing organic composition of capital. It is not the average profit, but the maximum profit that modern monopoly capitalism demands\u201d. While the subordinate clause (\u201cwhich it needs\u2026\u201c) seems to bring the extinguished Marxian law into being for a moment, the new law is decreed after all: The demand for maximum profit \u201cwill be the basic economic law of modern capitalism\u201d \\[Stalin, p.39\\].\n\nIf the flamethrower in the library isn\u2019t halted, not even his moustache is going to be spared.\n\nThose twisted counter-theses, which try to secure themselves against any objection, are unbearable. First, it is stated that the economic laws of monopoly capitalism would entirely differ from the capitalism \u201cof Marx\u201d. And then the same counter-theses assert that the economic laws of socialism could very well be the same as those of capitalism. Fresh air, quick!\n\nLet\u2019s heroically return to the ABC. One here has to remind of the distinction between the mass of profit and the mass of surplus value, between rate of profit and rate of surplus value, and of the meaning of the Marxian law of the tendency of the average rate of profit to fall, which is stated in detail at the beginning of the third \u201cCapital\u201d volume. Reading \u2013 understanding! It is not the capitalist that tends to decrease profit. It is not profit (the mass of profit) that decreases, but the rate of profit! Not the rate of any profit, but the average rate of social profit. Not any week or in any issue of the \u201cFinancial Times\u201d, but historically, in the development predestined by Marx towards the \u201csocial monopoly of the means of production\u201d in the grip of capital, whose definition, genesis, life and death are written.\n\nHe who understands this, can see that the effort, not of the single capitalist (a minor figure in Marx), but of the historical machine of capital (this \u201censouled corpus\u201d talented with \u201cvis vitalis\u201d), to escape the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall is futile; and precisely this law let\u2019s us conclude the following, classical theses (to which Stalin, confusing the west, again confesses):\n\nFirst: Inevitability of war between the capitalist countries.\n\nSecond: Inevitability of the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, wheresoever.\n\nIt is a giant effort that the capitalist system deploys in fight against its own collapse, and which expresses itself in the slogan: evermore production! Not only no stagnation, but achieving the maximisation of the maximisation at any time. In mathematics: geometrical progression; in music: \u201ccrescendo \u00e1 la Rossini\u201d. And for that purpose (once the entire motherland is mechanised): export. And to memorise the doctrine of the last five centuries well: \u201cTrade follows the flag\u201d.\n\nBut that, Jughashvili, is their doctrine!",

In the 13. chapter of the third volume of \u201cCapital\u201d, Marx reminds: \u201cWe intentionally present this law before going on to the division of profit\u201d (\u201cProfit is for us, for the time being, only another name for or another category of surplus value\u201d) \u201cinto different independent categories.\u201d This \u201cshows from the outset that this law is, in its entirety, independent of this division\u201d. And so it also applies if the state behaves as owner, banker and entrepreneur.\n\nThe law is based on the general historical process \u2013 denied by no one, apologised for by everyone \u2013 of the incessant development of productivity due to the application of ever more complicated instruments, tools, machines, ever more diverse technical processes and of scientific achievements on manual labour. For a given mass of products, fewer and fewer workers are needed. The capital advanced that needed to be invested to get hands on this mass of products continuously changes what Marx calls the organic composition: ever more substance-based capital, ever less wage capital. Few workers suffice to bestow an enormous \u201cincrease in value\u201d on the to be processed material, because they can process a lot more of it in comparison to the past. In this too one agrees. And further? Even assumed that capital exacerbates exploitation and increases the rate of surplus value by paying the workers less (even though this often happens, it only has the character of a law from the point of view of lounge revolutionaries), the squeezed out surplus value, respectively profit, will indeed increase, in face of the much stronger increase of the mass of purchased raw materials, with equal number of labour powers, the profit rate will continue to fall: Precisely because the rate expresses the relation of the slightly bigger profit (profit mass) to the enormously increased total advance in wages and material.\n\nCapital demands the \u201cmaximum profit\u201d? For sure, it demands it and it finds it as well, but it cannot prevent that meanwhile the profit rate falls. The mass of profit increases, because the population and still more the proletariat grows, the processed material becomes evermore impressive and the mass of products increases. In infancy: small capitals, divided between many and invested at a good rate; in old age: giant capitals, divided on few (consequence of concentration which develops in parallel to accumulation), admittedly invested at a low rate, however with the result of the exorbitant, vertigo-inducing increase of social capital, of social profit, of average business capital and profit.\n\nThere is no contradiction with the Marxian law of the fall in the rate of profit, which could only be detained by the reduction of labour productivity, by \u201cdegeneration\u201d of the organic composition of capital; an issue against which Stalin at the moment hauls out the big guns, a terrain on which he desperately tries to subdue his enemies.",

Let\u2019s assume the American working class assumes power in a situation as in that of 1929; let\u2019s repeat the numbers: 14.480 raw materials, 362 labour powers, 638 profit, meaning 15.480 total product.\n\nAnd then the workers read Marx and use \u201cthe increased productive power of capital for the saving of living labour as such\u201d. A decree of the revolutionary committee pushes down production to 10.000 (where it is pushed down we will see; remind yourselves that there won\u2019t be any presidential elections or similar events anymore). The workers will first settle for not adding the entire profit (which is burdened with dues and general expenses) to their wage of 362, but much less, so they arrive at, let\u2019s say 500. For the functioning of public facilities and state-run administrative bodies we deduce even more than the 638 of the now removed capitalists, let\u2019s say 700. According to our calculation there are only 8.800 of to be processed raw materials instead of 14.480; if the number of workers stays constant, the working day of each is reduced by 40%: from 8 to less than 5 hours. As a first step, that\u2019s neat. If we now calculate the hourly wage, we would see that it increased by about 132 percent: from a bit, more of 44 to about 103.\n\nThis would not be socialism. But while Stalin assumes to have discovered a new law of socialism, which is in truth a law of capitalism (with the increase of labour productivity production grows), we confront him with the opposite law: the increase of productivity leads to the decrease of human labour effort, where the extent of production either stays constant or later, after the poison dripping and blood sucking branches of the capitalist trunk has been removed, begins to increase in a smooth curve and in a way adequate for humanity.\n\nAs long as the call resounds to increase production by mobilisation of all powers, that just means to desperately resist against the Marxian law of the fall of the rate of profit. Because the rate of profit decreases, even though the mass of surplus value and profit do not decrease, progress rhetoric and hurries will shout at a scampered humanity ever more loudly: work more, produce more! And when the local workers faced with their frugal compensation cannot buy the surplus product, one needs to find means to conquer markets in foreign countries to ensure consumption. That is the vicious cycle of imperialism, which inevitably has found its solution in war \u2013 and a temporary escape from the final crisis in the reconstruction of the destroyed works of humanity, created in centuries.\n\nReconstruction of the destroyed, then construction of capitalist production facilities in vast areas, and today the race for markets: Those are all rails which Stalin is following; and this train, undertaken by whoever, knows only two changing points: low costs of production or war.\n\nWe will finish the depiction of this fundamental law with another wording about capitalism, which Marx adds in the fifteenth chapter of the third volume. As always, it simultaneously stands for the programme of communist society.\n\n\u201cThree cardinal facts of capitalist production:\n\n1. Concentration of means of production in few hands, whereby they cease to appear as the property of the immediate labourers and turn into social production capacities. Even if initially they are the private property of capitalists. These are the trustees of bourgeois society, but they pocket all the proceeds of this trusteeship.\n2. Organisation of labour itself into social labour: through co-operation, division of labour, and the uniting of labour with the natural sciences. In these two senses, the capitalist mode of production abolishes private property and private labour, even though in contradictory forms.\n3. Creation of the world-market.\u201d",

But apart from that, we have got the proof precisely out of the \u201claw of the planned development of the national economy in geometrical progression\u201d confirmed by Stalin, that the capitalist law of the fall in the rate of profit is in effect. If a five year plan purports an increase in production by 20%, meaning from 100 to 120, and the following plan again purports a growth of 20%, then this means that production should not grow from 120 to 140, but from 120 to 144 (20% increase of the new cycle, which now starts with 120). He who is a bit familiar with numbers knows that the difference at the start seems marginal, later however assumes gigantic magnitudes. Do you remember the story of the creator of chess, who wanted to make a present to the emperor of China? He asked for one corn on the first square, two on the second, four on the third\u2026 all corn chambers of the heavenly empire wouldn\u2019t have sufficed to fill the 64 squares.\n\nNow, his law is de facto nothing else than the categorical imperative: produce evermore!\u00a0 This imperative belongs solely to capitalism and the following chain of causes is at its foundation: Increase of labour productivity \u2013 increase of constant capital in relation to variable capital, thus the organic composition \u2013 fall in the rate of profit \u2013 necessity to compensate the fall with the rampant increase of capital investments and production of commodities.\n\nIf we had really started to build up the socialist economy in a rudimentary way, we would have noticed that the economic imperative had changed, and that it would have turned out to be ours: since the power of human labour is multiplied by technical achievements: with steady production, work less! And where the conditions of a revolutionary power of the proletariat really do exist, that is to say, in those countries which are already over-equipped with facilities: produce less and work even less!\n\nThe mere fact that Russia has to issue the slogan of \u201cincreasing product mass\u201d confirms our thesis. It is finally confirmed by the fact that a significant proportion of the products of major state-owned industry are sold on foreign markets, and here Stalin openly states that the relationship is not only for accounting purposes, but by the very nature of things a commodity relation.\n\nBasically, this includes the confession that \u201cbuilding socialism in one country\u201d is not possible, even if it were only because of worldwide competition (which is always prepared to shoot with cannons and atomic bombs instead of the artillery of low prices). Only in the absurd hypothesis that the \u201csocialist country\u201d could close itself off behind a real iron curtain would it be possible for the country to take the first steps in one direction (planning \u201cby society in the interest of society\u201d), which, thanks to the labour productivity achieved by technical achievements, would lead to a reduction in labour efforts and exploitation of the worker. And only within such a hypothesis could the plan be, after the insane geometric curve of capitalist madness has been abandoned: Let us determine a certain standard of consumption for all residents, set by the plan; once we have reached that level, we will stop production and resist the criminal temptation to push it further, just to see where we get rid of it again, who we can force it on.\n\nHowever, the Kremlin\u2019s full attention, both ideologically and practically, is focused on the world market.",
