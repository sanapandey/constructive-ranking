    "selftext": "So, I'm a computer science major which is something I pursued because it felt like a compromise as a very artistic minded person. You can use programming to make all kinds of creative projects, and it is a lucrative skill career-wise. However I always hated and white knuckled my way through the mathematical part of it, and the math/Gen science classes you have to take in that degree path. However, studying marxism for the last few years and gaining an in-depth understanding of dialectical materialism and the Marxist theory of knowledge more broadly has completely changed the way I view the world. At first I found it philosophically interesting, and when I read Socialism Utopian and Scientific for the first time it felt sort of like when I read Buddhist, taoist and hindu texts as a teenager. My mind was blown at this new way of seeing the world, although now it is based in materialism and scientific rigor.\n\nI retook calculus recently, a year after dropping it, and my mind was blown. Mathematically proving quantitative to qualitative change in physical systems made so much more sense after learning the laws of motion of productive society and history for the last few years. and was so much more conceptually interesting. Part of me felt regret in the beginning of my academic journey choosing a STEM field over a humanities field considering I liked the humanities more. However, now I feel the complete opposite. I'm bored with the liberal, non-rigorous curriculum in the humanities electives I take and actually find my math and science classes much more in line with my studies of Marxism. I always thought I hated math. It turns out I just needed a more comprehensive understanding of the world and to grow a bit.\n\nThis is kind of just a rant, I just wanted to express how cool it is that Marxism has helped me understand the reality I live in in more ways than just understanding class society and production. It has given me a new appreciation for the natural world and its processes and made my academic journey much more enriching and exciting. My only complaint is that as a student of Marxism I'm now extremely disgusted with the tech world and the culture within my comp sci cohort in school, but thats another story.",

He's not a Marxist but expounds on how our interaction in society and nature led to the origin and development of mathematics. This is a fundamentally materialist viewpoint. \n\nThe dialectical mode of thinking really helps understand mathematics as a body of knowledge, which is ultimately a subset of overall human knowledge and human communication.",

            "body": "Anecdotal experience here, but most of the Marxists I knew in college were typically more often STEM majors, while people of other socialist tendencies, especially those opposed to Marxists, were often majors in the humanities or social sciences. I think there is a reason for that, although my opinion is of course overshadowed by the fact that I don't personally have a social science/humanities degree to compare my experience in STEM to.\n\nLet me explain a theory of mine. STEM majors require that you examine the underlying rules of the universe in order to be a productive science understanding worker. However, you do not need to understand the underlying laws of capitalism in order to be a productive worker who has a social science/humanities knowledge. In fact, to teach the underlying rules of capitalism would produce the opposite of what bosses want; it would create class consciousness workers who can organize against the boss, or the capitalist system entirely. Therefore, liberal social sciences and humanities have to gloss over the fundamental mechanisms of capitalist society, and instead push ideology which effectively *combats* the possibility of coming to those realizations (of course every professor and school may vary, I'm speaking very generally). Meanwhile, in STEM classes, there typically is no need to form a narrative to explain why things happen in social contexts, because we're not looking at social contexts, we are usually thinking like we're in a laboratory.\n\nAnother way to look at it; people who are more inclined to social justice are likely more inclined to social studies/humanities, and are more likely to be political activists. In order to pacify this type of person, you teach them liberal logic(s) so that they always find themselves inadvertently supporting the status quo. I'm not saying this is an intentional plan or conspiracy laid out by somebody or anything.",

At least in my country, if you go to STEM you have had an upbringing that in the majority of the cases could be classified as \u201ccomfortable\u201d where politics don\u2019t play an important role (or they tend to be more conservatives). The people who take the social sciences path, tend to come from families more involved in the socialist spectrum. \n\nMoreover, if I\u2019m understanding you correctly, given how in the STEM areas people are just being fed the system as it is (in 7 years I took quite a few lessons in finance but not a single one mentioned any other possibility than turbocapitalism and production over everything), whilst in the humanities, you get the broad view? Again, I might not be understanding you, so sorry in advance haha.",

But yes I think that is absolutely true. I mean, after WW2 there was a very intentional move in universities to platform post-modern curriculum and intellectuals. The \"new left\" was so focused on language and idealistic power structures that an entire generation of western leftists were taught not only to forget about class, imperialist capitalism as the primary contradiction in society, but actively reject the notion. What do we get from that? A bunch of HR people, non-profits which are just bureaucratic charity, politicians, and bourgeois intellectuals. \n\nMarxism is a science, as it demystifies the world by providing natural explanations for natural phenomena, as is the goal of all science. So taking a STEM route in college if you're a Marxist just makes a lot of sense. Like you said, there isn't much reason for those departments to ideologically combat something that is irrelevant to their fields. Also, not to be LARPy sounding but if we're being far-sighted we can see that those skills will be very valuable during a revolution since brain drain has always been an issue in socialist societies.",

I think that generally on a small scale the individual differences matter much more, but we would have a hard time talking to engineers (or commerce students).",
