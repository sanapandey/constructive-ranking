    "selftext": "As the title states, I\u2019m looking for recommendations on books that analyze the military history of the conflicts in the Middle East involving the US (Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, etc.) from a Marxist perspective. \n\nI\u2019m particularly interested in works that explore how these wars fit into the global capitalist system and the imperialist dynamics at play. \n\nAny suggestions? Thanks in advance!\n",

            "body": "Samir Amin is a must imo. Tho he is an economic historian, he is certainly thinking about militarization and global policy. There is *The Law of Worldwide Value* (1978) which takes a Marxian approach to understand the role of Imperialism as it relates to capitalist accumulation.\u00a0He expands the terrain for thinking about reproduction with what he calls \"imperialist rent.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Also *Eurocentrism* (1988) which offers a Marxist redress to Said's view of empire. I think it's just good to read alongside Said in general though.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nThere is also *The Reawakening of the Arab World:\u00a0Challenge and Change in the Aftermath of the Arab Spring* (2016) which is a revised edition of his earlier 2012 book.\u00a0\n\n\nI find Amin engaging because he earnestly tries to consider well what do we do with new ideas of value dependent upon 20th century globalization and imperialist-capitalist economic policies, but with an eye toward both the Middle East and Africa.\u00a0",

It's focused more on national liberation for Palestinians and Arabs though, and light on the global capitalist system. It wont go into detail about how Israel functions as the US's imperialist fortress to destabilize the Middle-East",
