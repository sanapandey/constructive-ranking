    "selftext": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents a profound challenge to Marxists in 2024, demanding a nuanced and principled stance rooted in revolutionary theory and practice. The unrelenting invasion and genocide in Gaza by Israel necessitates a clear and uncompromising response from anyone who considers themselves a Marxist. The question of supporting Hamas, a bourgeois and reactionary organization, requires careful consideration within the framework of national liberation and class struggle. \n\nMarxists must unequivocally support the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and their resistance against Israeli occupation. However, supporting Hamas, which is not aligned with the working class and lacks a genuine socialist agenda, contradicts Marxist principles. Hamas, despite its role in resisting Israeli aggression, is fundamentally a bourgeois nationalist movement that does not prioritize the emancipation of the working class. Marxists must distinguish between supporting the just cause of Palestinian liberation and uncritically endorsing the leadership of Hamas.\n\nNational liberation remains historically progressive when it serves the interests of the working class and leads towards socialism. The Palestinian struggle is indeed a national liberation struggle against Zionist settler-colonialism and imperialism. However, it is not an inter-imperialist war; it is a struggle of an oppressed nation against a colonial oppressor backed by imperialist powers. Revolutionary defeatism, in this context, means opposing both Israeli and Hamas leaderships while supporting the Palestinian people's legitimate fight against oppression.\n\nThe question of advocating for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a supposedly Marxist militant group, also requires scrutiny. While the PFLP claims Marxist credentials, its effectiveness and commitment to proletarian internationalism must be critically assessed. Marxists should support those elements within the Palestinian resistance that genuinely strive towards socialism and the emancipation of the working class.\n\nRegarding the one-state solution, Marxists should advocate for a secular, democratic, and socialist state where Jews and Palestinians can coexist. This aligns with the broader goal of international socialism and the abolition of borders. The struggle for a Palestinian state must be part of a global fight against imperialism and capitalism. Communists should build alliances that transcend national barriers, emphasizing that no worker is free until all workers are free. This means fostering solidarity among workers globally and mobilizing support through demonstrations, boycotts, and direct action aimed at pressuring imperialist powers and the Israeli state.\n\nEducation and mobilization are crucial. The working class must be educated about the imperialist nature of the Israeli occupation and the broader context of the conflict. Mobilizing support through direct action can pressure the powers that sustain the occupation. This internationalist perspective is rooted in Marxist theory, particularly the emphasis on international solidarity found in \"The Communist Manifesto\" and the analysis of imperialism in works like \"Capital\" and Lenin's \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.\" \n\nOur stance as Marxists must be clear: we support the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, provide critical support to progressive elements within the resistance, oppose imperialist support for Israel, foster international working-class solidarity, and advocate for a socialist one-state solution. This approach aligns with our revolutionary goals and contributes to a just and lasting resolution to the conflict. The fight for Palestine is part of the global struggle for socialism, and our commitment must reflect the depth and seriousness of this endeavor. \n\n   \"The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.\" (Chapter 2: Proletarians and Communists. From \"The Communist Manifesto\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels)\n\n   \"In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things. In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.\" (Chapter 4: Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties. From \"The Communist \n\n\n\"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\"\n\n\"Modern bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule.\"\n\n\"In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed\u2014a class of labourers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These labourers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.\"\n(The Communist Manifesto\nBy Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels\nChapter 1: Bourgeois and Proletarians)\n\n\"The greater the social wealth, the functioning capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and, therefore, also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour, the greater is the industrial reserve army. The same causes which develop the expansive power of capital, develop also the labour-power at its disposal. The relative mass of the industrial reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth. But the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour-army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus-population, whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour. The more extensive, finally, the Lazarus-layers of the working-class, and the industrial reserve army, the greater is official pauperism. This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation.\"\n\n\"Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital.\"\n\n\"This law of capitalist accumulation, metamorphosed by economists into pretended laws of Nature, reveals the truth of capital\u2019s relationship with the working class. In reality, it is but a result of the limited view which the capitalist takes of the conditions of the production process, as seen only from his own standpoint, and not as it really exists.\" \n(Capital By Karl Marx. Volume 1, Chapter 25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation)\n\n\n\n\"Imperialism emerged as the development and direct continuation of the fundamental characteristics of capitalism in general. But capitalism only became capitalist imperialism at a definite and very high stage of its development, when certain of its fundamental characteristics began to change into their opposites, when the features of the epoch of transition from capitalism to a higher social and economic system had taken shape and revealed themselves all along the line.\"\n\n\n   \"Imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism. We have to define imperialism as capitalism in that stage of development in which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun, in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.\" (Chapter VII: Imperialism as a Special Stage of Capitalism. From \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" by Vladimir Lenin)\n\n   \"The proletariat of the oppressor nations cannot but be vitally interested in the profound upheavals which the national liberation movement is bringing about in every sphere of social and political life. And the broader and more powerful this movement becomes, the more inevitable it is that the proletariat will take part in it, give it a democratic content, and strive to ensure the development of political democracy and, above all, to make it the basis for Socialist transformations.\" (Chapter IX: Critique of Imperialism. From \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\" by Vladimir Lenin)",

                    "body": "Comrades,\n\nIt is essential to address the misconceptions surrounding Hamas, a group mistakenly heralded by some as a beacon of resistance against imperialist oppression. Let us be unequivocal in our critique: Hamas is, in fact, a bourgeois nationalist entity. To view them as anything but bourgeois is to fall into a grievous error. This analysis is not an exercise in rhetoric but a necessary dissection based on their economic relationships, historical actions, and ideological foundations.\n\nWhen Hamas emerged from the 2006 elections as the dominant party in Palestine, they were perceived as a more honest and resistance-oriented alternative to the corrupt Fatah and PLO. However, their subsequent actions reveal a rapid degeneration into practices characteristic of bourgeois nationalism. The leadership of Hamas has accumulated immense wealth through various capitalist ventures. They maintain significant investment portfolios in real estate, Islamic finance, and have a notorious history of siphoning off international aid intended for Gaza. Such accumulation of wealth by a few, while the masses suffer, is a hallmark of bourgeoisie behavior.\n\nTheir economic operations extend to partnerships with capitalists across the Muslim world, leveraging these relationships to bypass sanctions, open diplomatic channels, and secure donations. Hamas's tunnel network, a symbol of resistance, is run as a public-private partnership that extracts revenue through taxes and bribes, benefiting wealthy Palestinians at the expense of the general population. This nexus of wealth and power starkly contrasts with the impoverished conditions of millions in Gaza, further cementing Hamas's bourgeois character.\n\nThe fundamental ideological stance of Hamas reflects classic bourgeois nationalism. Despite its origins among impoverished refugees and low-ranking clerics, the organization has evolved into a pro-capitalist and pro-market entity. This evolution is evident in their governance, where the party prioritizes trade and private property, principles aligned with the broader Muslim Brotherhood's ideology.\n\nTheir political moderation over time, including the acceptance of a two-state solution and negotiations with Israel, underscores their departure from revolutionary principles. Hamas's 2017 charter, while maintaining a nominal opposition to Israel's foundation, positions the group as a potential partner in government within a reconstituted PLO, accepting the two-state solution as a \"formula of national consensus.\" Such positions betray the revolutionary cause and mirror the capitulation of the PLO during the Oslo Accords.\n\nHamas's governance in Gaza is marked by authoritarianism and suppression of dissent. The party's response to opposition, such as the 2019 protests against high unemployment and increased taxes, was brutally repressive. Over 1,000 people were arrested, including journalists and human rights observers, with cases referred to military courts. Such actions are reminiscent of bourgeois regimes that prioritize maintaining power over addressing the needs of the people.\n\nFurthermore, Hamas's cultural policies reveal a reactionary bent, with efforts to enforce conservative religious practices and suppress social freedoms, particularly those of women and LGBTQ individuals. These policies align with the reactionary tendencies of the bourgeoisie, seeking to control and manipulate cultural and social norms to maintain their dominance.\n\nSubstitutionalism, where a small group substitutes its actions for the broader mass struggle, is fundamentally flawed. Marxism teaches us that the liberation of the proletariat must be the act of the proletariat itself. Hamas's reliance on isolated guerrilla operations and vanguard tactics without genuine mass mobilization undermines this principle. History has shown that such approaches lead to the decimation of revolutionary vanguards without achieving true liberation. The Palestinian struggle requires mass participation and proletarian leadership, not the isolated actions of a bourgeois nationalist faction.\n\nTo those who mistakenly believe Hamas represents the working class, understand this: Hamas is a bourgeois entity, driven by nationalist and capitalist motivations. Their wealth accumulation, ideological moderation, authoritarian practices, and reactionary policies are antithetical to the principles of proletarian internationalism and revolutionary socialism. The true path to liberation for Palestine lies in the hands of the working masses, organized and united in a class struggle that transcends national borders.",

It is essential to maintain a clear focus on the fundamental principles of Marxism, especially in the face of identity-based arguments that detract from rigorous class analysis.\n\nAs Lenin stated in \"The State and Revolution\" (1917):\n\"Marxism is a revolutionary theory that does not rely on the authority of any person or any text, but on the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat itself.\"\n\nAnd as Marx emphasized in \"Critique of the Gotha Programme\" (1875):\n\"Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\n\nYour awareness that class analysis should remain at the forefront of our discourse is crucial. We must ensure our focus stays on uniting the working class against the capitalist oppressors, rather than being sidetracked by divisive identity politics. Keep up the good fight!\n\nSolidarity!",

                    "body": "Comrades,\n\nThe ongoing struggle in Palestine against Israeli imperialism demands our most rigorous analysis and a principled stance. As Marxists, we must navigate the complexities of supporting liberation movements while remaining steadfast to our core principles of proletarian internationalism and revolutionary praxis. The recent discourse surrounding the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) warrants a thorough examination.\n\nFirst, let us address the argument that we should defer to the PFLP and DFLP because they are \"principled Marxists\" operating in the region. This perspective, while seemingly respectful, borders on social chauvinism. It suggests an uncritical acceptance of their strategies and alliances simply because of their geographical and situational proximity to the conflict. Marxism teaches us to evaluate movements and actions based on their adherence to proletarian principles and their effectiveness in advancing the cause of socialism. It is not enough to display a hammer and sickle; the content of one's actions and alliances must align with the revolutionary goals of dismantling capitalism and imperialism.\n\nHistorical evidence and recent analysis reveal significant issues with the strategies employed by the PFLP and DFLP. The critique highlighting the pitfalls of substitutionalism is particularly salient. The tactic of guerrilla warfare, when isolated from the mass movement, has proven insufficient and ultimately detrimental. While the sacrifices and valor of the PFLP militants are undeniable, their approach of operating as a vanguard separate from the working masses undermines the essential Marxist principle that liberation must be the act of the masses themselves. Substitutionalism, the concept where a small group attempts to substitute its actions for the broader mass struggle, contradicts the foundational Marxist idea that the working class must be the agent of its own emancipation. This tactic, seen in the PFLP's reliance on isolated guerrilla operations, has historically led to the decimation of the revolutionary vanguard without achieving the fundamental goal of liberating Palestine. The lesson here is clear: without mass mobilization and the active participation of the proletariat, revolutionary movements cannot succeed.\n\nMoreover, the alliances formed by the PFLP and DFLP with groups like the AQ Brigades of Hamas, Saraya al-Quds of the PIJ, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades present a significant ideological contradiction. These groups, while resisting Israeli aggression, do not share a commitment to the working-class struggle or the broader goals of socialism. Aligning with such groups risks diluting the revolutionary potential and compromising the movement's integrity. The collaboration with sectarian and bourgeois nationalist groups like Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq further complicates their revolutionary credentials, given these groups' sectarian and often reactionary agendas.\n\nThe call for a one-state solution where Jews and Palestinians coexist in a secular, democratic, and socialist state aligns with the broader Marxist vision of international socialism and the abolition of borders. However, this solution cannot be the end goal. The struggle for socialism cannot be confined within the borders of Palestine; it must extend to an international stage. Capitalism and imperialism are global systems of exploitation, and the fight against them must be equally global. The revolution must persist beyond the borders of Palestine, forging alliances with the working class worldwide to dismantle the entire capitalist system.\n\nIn addressing the practical steps we should take, it is paramount to understand that the focus must be on overthrowing the bourgeoisie in our own nations. The reality on the ground is that without significant international pressure and revolutionary change within imperialist countries, the struggle in Palestine remains isolated. Organizing labor to boycott, engage in direct action, arrange strikes, and educate the masses is essential. This is not about \"purity\" but about the effectiveness of our tactics and the soundness of our Marxist theory.\n\nRevolutionary optimism is crucial. Building a revolutionary movement within our own borders, emphasizing international solidarity, and transcending national barriers is absolutely critical. Change is possible through collective action and solidarity. The forces of labor, both in Palestine and globally, will ultimately determine the outcome of the struggle.\n\nMarx argued that the side with the greatest productive capabilities will ultimately prevail. In \"Capital,\" Marx explains how the economic base influences the superstructure, shaping societal outcomes. Lenin, in \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,\" also emphasizes the role of economic power in determining political and military outcomes. These insights underscore the need for a united working-class movement capable of leveraging its productive power to effect change.\n\nIn the spirit of revolutionary optimism, we must ignite the flames of hope and determination within our ranks. The path to liberation is fraught with challenges, but it is through the unwavering collective action and unbreakable solidarity of the global working class that we shall triumph. Let it be known to any who doubt or waver that the forces of labor, united in purpose and resolve, possess the power to dismantle the oppressive structures of capitalism and imperialism. The struggle in Palestine, and indeed the struggle of all oppressed peoples, will be decided not by the whims of isolated militants or the empty rhetoric of armchair revolutionaries, but by the organized might of the proletariat, wielding its economic and political strength as a weapon of true emancipation. The victory of the working class is inevitable, for it is grounded in the material reality of our collective power. Let the timid and the doubters be damned \u2013 history is on our side, and we shall forge a new world from the ashes of the old!",

                    "body": "Your commendable effort to balance the fight against capitalist nationalists with a critical view of nationalism and isolationism reflects a nuanced understanding of Marxist principles. However, let us address why this comment might have received backlash and why your stance remains fundamentally correct within the framework of Marxist analysis.\n\nFirstly, nationalism, even in the guise of anti-capitalist struggle, must be scrutinized through the lens of Marxist theory. Lenin, in his writings on national liberation, emphasized that the goal is not to create new isolated nationalisms but to foster international solidarity among the working class. National struggles must always be subordinate to the overarching aim of proletarian revolution and the establishment of socialism.\n\nIn the case of Catalonia, while the independence movement may present itself as a fight against the Spanish capitalist state, it is essential to examine whether this movement genuinely advances the cause of the working class. Lenin was clear that Marxists support the right of nations to self-determination but always within the context of promoting proletarian unity and the struggle against global capitalism.\n\nLenin wrote in \"The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination\" (1916):\n\n\u201cThe aim of socialism is not only to abolish the present division of mankind into small states and all national isolation; not only to bring the nations closer to each other, but also to merge them. And in order to achieve this aim, we must, on the one hand, explain to the masses the reactionary nature of the ideas of Renner and Otto Bauer concerning   so-called \u201ccultural national autonomy\u201d[7] and, on the other hand, demand the liberation of the oppressed nations, not only in general, nebulous phrases, not in empty declamations, not by \u201cpostponing\u201d the question until socialism is established, but in a clearly and precisely formulated political programme which shall particularly take into account the hypocrisy and cowardice of the Socialists in the oppressing nations. Just as mankind can achieve the abolition of classes only by passing through the transition period of the dictatorship of the oppressed class, so mankind can achieve the inevitable merging of nations only by passing through the transition period of complete liberation of all the oppressed nations, i.e., their freedom to secede.\u201d\n\nThus, while supporting the right of Catalonia to self-determination, Marxists must remain critical of any tendencies towards isolationism and nationalism that detract from the broader international struggle. The ultimate objective is to unite the working class across all nations to overthrow capitalism and establish socialism.\n\nTo the commenter who drew parallels with the Catalonian independence vote, your instinct to question excessive nationalism and isolationism is indeed in line with Marxist principles. However, the backlash might stem from a perceived undermining of the immediate struggles against capitalist oppression. In such contexts, it is crucial to articulate clearly that support for self-determination is not an endorsement of nationalism for its own sake but a tactical step towards a broader, internationalist socialist revolution.\n\nLenin would likely respond to this discussion by reiterating that the support for national struggles must always be critically examined and aligned with the internationalist goals of socialism. He would commend your critical stance against blind nationalism while urging a deeper understanding of how such movements fit into the global struggle against capitalism.\n\nIn conclusion, your balanced view is indeed principled. It reflects a critical engagement with the complexities of national liberation movements within the Marxist framework. It is vital to continue this nuanced analysis, always aligning with the ultimate goal of international proletarian unity and the overthrow of global capitalism.",
