Direct democratic, confederalist, classless.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the EZLN? Do you consider it a good example of socialism, or misguided?",

So judging it based on how successful it is as an anarchist or communist project is misguided since they are not trying to do either. They are doing their own thing and assert that message in multiple statements they've made.",

They bullied Oaxaca into adopting consensus decision making in the middle of an insurrection, which is idi0tic, and then they pressured Oaxaca into disarming, which is doubly idi0tic.\n\nThe EZLN could have helped Oaxaca defend itself, they are literally next door. Instead the EZLN disarmed Oaxaca and prepared them for the slaughter, which came a few weeks later.\n\nhttps://marxist.com/mexico-revolution-step-forward241106.htm",

It was a demand made by Zapata stemming from the fact that peasants had been getting their land taken away for centuries by rich landowners. That's my point dude, you are trying to judge zapatistas through a lens they themselves don't use.\n\nEdit: btw I just realize own might not be the right word for the translation.  It's more like \"land is for those who work in it\".",
