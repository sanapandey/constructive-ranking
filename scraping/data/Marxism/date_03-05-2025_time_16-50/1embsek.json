Coincidentally, I'm also a Phil student and I'm about to write my last paper of the course. It's definitely going to be a Marxist paper, that I know. Specifically, I'd love to write on the Marxist perspective on refugee rights and (un)freedoms.\n\nI'm not asking anyone to do my homework, but I'd very much appreciate some literature recommendations, since that could save me hours of searching. It's a philosophy paper, so I'm not looking that much for economic analysis but rather for more theoretical texts, maybe bordering on the ethical (yes, the difference betweeen the two in Marxism doesn't necessarily stand). I'm at very early stages of the research so anything helps.\n\nI'd very much appreciate some help here.\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Bourgeois democracy has all this interest in \"international law\" and abstract \"rights\" but the question is: whose job is it to enforce those rights? The United Nations say we [have a right to (affordable) food](https://www.ohchr.org/en/food), but people starve to death. What useless posturing.\n\nIn the long term Marxists believe in a stateless, classless society with free movement. In the short term I would argue we must also be for [open borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTC3mYEVi8A) and against [patriotism in all forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPrIUYBT-AA).\n\nBut really I am much more interested in why millions of people flee their homes, and how we can make their homes livable. This touches on many issues, rooted in Marxist economics. Lenin's *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism* is a key text on how and why it is necessary for the imperial core to create and maintain a superexploited class of labourers, as well as to use war as a tool to maintain its foreign interests. War and poverty are two key factors in migration.\n\nRooted in these analyses, you hear slogans on demos like this:\n\n*No borders, no nations, stop deportations*\n\n*Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here*\n\n*Welcome every refugee, throw the bosses in the sea*\n\n*Unemployment and inflation are not caused by immigration, stop it, come off it, the enemy is profit*",

In Capital seems to see settler-colonial immigration to Australia as both a worker\u2019s solution to the the Labour Reserve Army method of controlling the working class, but also as a means of primitive accumulation on the part of capital.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of nationalism vs internationalism (ie, when workers/unions oppose immigration, they are basically propping up their own working class at the expense of the same class in another community - solely in order to preserve its bargaining power with capitalists). Marx was solidly in the internationalist camp, but I don\u2019t think he ever conceived of a world where the working class would be mobile across international boundaries (except in the case of British settler colonialism, which was an oddity). Marxists from state-socialist countries did tend to see a lot more value in nationalism and the state control of movements or workers and people, but there\u2019s a lot of debate about whether this was just an example of communist ideology being derailed by the need to preserve a nation state.\u00a0",

                    "body": "This isn't true at all. I'd argue the issue you have here is the terminology used. Marx and Engels were both, in effect if not in law, political refugees from the German states (Engels not so much as son of capitalist). As the heads of the 1st international they actively organised support for Poles escaping the partition between Prussia /Russia/Austria and for the Communards escaping Paris. \n\nHis comments on Ireland and Irish workers in England encapsulate extremely well the situation we have today with immigration/refugees. It is a very similar phenomenon put to effectively the same ends.\n\n*\"But the English bourgeoisie has also much more important interests in the present economy of Ireland. Owing to the constantly increasing concentration of leaseholds, Ireland constantly sends her own surplus to the English labour market, and thus forces down wages and lowers the material and moral position of the English working class.*\n\n*And most important of all! Every industrial and commercial centre in England now possesses a working class divided into two\u00a0hostile\u00a0camps, English proletarians and Irish proletarians. The ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who lowers his standard of life. In relation to the Irish worker he regards himself as a member of the\u00a0ruling\u00a0nation and consequently he becomes a tool of the English aristocrats and capitalists against Ireland, thus strengthening their domination\u00a0over himself. He cherishes religious, social, and national prejudices against the Irish worker. His attitude towards him is much the same as that of the \u201cpoor whites\u201d to the Negroes in the former slave states of the U.S.A.. The Irishman pays him back with interest in his own money. He sees in the English worker both the accomplice and the stupid tool of the\u00a0English rulers in\u00a0Ireland.*\n\n*This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short, by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes.\u00a0This antagonism\u00a0is the secret of the\u00a0impotence of the English working class, despite its organisation. It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power. And the latter is quite aware of this.\"*\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1870/letters/70\\_04\\_09.htm](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1870/letters/70_04_09.htm)",

However, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call it a consistent program, particularly in light of some of his writings on nationalism. \n\nNotably, Marx\u2019s \u2018on the Jewish Question\u2019 (which I\u2019d call his analysis which has aged the worst), calls for cultural minorities (which can include migrants) to work harder to culturally assimilate with the national working classes of the countries they find themselves in because only a culturally homogeneous working class can successfully vie for state power - thus cultural minorities should blame themselves for any bigotry or calls for exclusion they may face from the dominant culture. The same essay states that certain ethic groups can be identified with the pursuit of money and a lack of loyalty to the national, and can be excluded from working class politics on this ground. \n\n(I should note that there are a lot of conflicting interpretations of this essay - I haven\u2019t delved into some of its context in Young Hegelian debates, I tend to take it at face value, which I hear can make it look worse than it would have in context - in the same way that I\u2019ve heard philosophers tell me that in context Nietzsche was actually way less antisemitic than he sounds)\n\nSo basically, for Marxists, if you immigrated to escape poverty then you are good for the proletariat, but if you immigrated to get a better life you are bad for the proletariat. You can see where this began to cause some problems when figures like Stalin had to come up with a policy on when to allow or restrict the movement of peoples.",
