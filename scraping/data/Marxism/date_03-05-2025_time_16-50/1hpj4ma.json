    "selftext": "Jimmy Carter might be celebrated in the West for his so-called commitment to human rights, but for us Afghan/Pashtuns, his legacy is one of devastation. It was his administration that funded Afghan Jihad, created Mujahedeen, and turned our lands into battlegrounds for his Cold War games. We bore the brunt of it. Our homes were destroyed. Thousands of our people were killed. Millions were displaced. We were turned into pawns, sacrificed for his anti-Soviet ambitions.\n\nOur culture, once rooted in love, poetry, and hospitality, was overshadowed by the extremism he unleashed. Today, we are seen as savages, our identity reduced to the violence his policies brought to our doorstep.\n\nWe were left with guns, warlords, and a never-ending cycle of suffering. While the world praises him as a champion of human rights, we live every day with the consequences of his decisions. His war wasn\u2019t fought in Washington or Moscow, it was fought on our soil, with our blood, and we\u2019re still paying the price.",

I'm American. I have zero interest in the suffering of Afghani people. I don't have much money in the first place, but even if I did, I would rather have less, financially, than bring violence on people I've never met. Money isn't real. Our actions are real. Actions matter.\n\nU.S. \"business interests\" is a euphemism. These \"interests\" are usually very wealthy individuals\u2014\"neoliberal slugpeople\" is the correct term. The U.S. and 99 percent of the people in it would have been, and would be, just fine without the monstrous amount of violence inflicted by our foreign-policy arm to impose capitalism on the world. We gained absolutely nothing but a couple of holes in buildings in 2001, which our ruling elite quickly used as a pretext to strip away our freedoms as well as accelerate the managed decline of our own living standards.",

I'm talking about the president of the United States.

A President's moral principles don't mean shit to me if they can't, at the very least, admit to the murderous crimes for which they are responsible, and that applies to every one of them from Washington to Trump.

He wasn't just goaded by Brzezinski into Afghanistan though. I think he did judge that the Soviets were fighting a war of aggression in support of a puppet regime and arming the mujahideen was somehow what a liberal humanitarian should do. Certainly he agreed with restrictive trade measures. Advisors like Brzezenski were much more cynical and giddy at the opportunity to sabotage rapprochement with the Soviets.

I think power-seeking starts out slow and mundane\u2014people realize that things they need come easier if they have the ability to demand, rather than suggest. \n\nAt first, it does make a better life\u2014existing among humans while powerless is a terrible experience, because most humans simply refuse to do the right thing unless the power to confer some benefit or cause harm exists. I suspect that getting a bit of real power unlocks an \"Ah, this is what human life was supposed to be,\" sensation in the brain that most of us daywalkers will never feel. Some people get pushed back or even killed; other people's power-seeking ventures are rewarded with, well, power.\n\nThe thing about power is that it's always an illusion. The most powerful thing in the world is surprise\u2014very easy to cause harm with it, very hard to really win anything with it\u2014but the power most people crave is the opposite of surprise\u2014other people doing what they want, because of some context full of vague but credible threats. It always rests on a chain of if-thens; even medieval monarchs knew that if they stopped being able to attain (mine or steal\u2014usually, steal) a useless yellow metal, they'd be slain by their own guards. A lot of these people want to be loved, but Machiavelli told the truth on that one\u2014it's far more effective to be feared.\n\nAt some point, a small number of people become heads of state, and now there are random people they've never met\u2014not many, but enough for constant concern\u2014who want to kill them. This isn't the worst of it, though. The worst part isn't the five or ten weirdos plotting coups or assassinations\u2014it's the moral compromise that is required, in a world where power really doesn't exist except in the context of unwanted surprise, to achieve anything. Sadly, I think this goes beyond economic systems\u2014an advanced socialist or communist system can reduce the damage, but not change it fundamentally... not until we have AI-planned communism, which is probably the ideal if the AI is well-aligned.",

The Soviets, along with the PDPA installed Khan back in power, overthrowing the king. They wanted him in power because he had launched several military incursions against Pakistan, and destabilizing Pakistan was a key regional Soviet goal. Pakistan made common cause with Islamist elements in Afghanistan. At the same time, Daoud Khan (with Soviet funding) was supporting anti-Pakistan militants both in Pakistan and in Afghanistan.\n\nThere was a rebellion in 1975 by Islamic militants in Afghanistan which was unsuccessful, but triggered a change in policy with Khan trying to thaw relations with Pakistan. All this meddling and instability led to factional infighting, culminating in the Saur Revolution, the execution of Daoud and much of his cabinet, etc... etc...\n\nThe idea that \"things were fine, then Carter sent Islamists $700k and everything fell apart\" is extreme revisionism, to put it mildly.",

All over Africa, Asia and South America there are messed up countries thanks to US \"aid\".\n\nIt's very weird how you phrase this in personal terms as if Afghanistan is just some slacker college dropout that refuses to accept responsibility for itself. \n\nI mean really if it didn't want to be invaded by two world powers one after the other maybe it shouldn't show so much shoulder?",
