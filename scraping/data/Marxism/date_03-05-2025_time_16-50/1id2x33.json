    "selftext": "I'm reading Renegade Kautsky. I've read already the Manifesto and Origins of Family and State. \n\nIt says\n\n>Marx and Engels analyzed the Paris Commune in a most detailed manner and showed that its merit lies in its attempt to smash, to break up the \u201cready-made state machinery.\u201d Marx and Engels considered this condition to be so important that this was the only amendment they introduced in 1872 in the \u201cobsolete\u201d (in parts) program of the Communist Manifesto. \n\n>Marx and Engels showed that the Paris Commune had abolished the army and the bureaucracy, had abolished parliamentarism, had destroyed \u201cthat parasitic excrescence, the state,\u201d etc.; but the sage Kautsky, donning his nightcap, repeats the fairy tale about \u201cpure democracy,\u201d which has been told a thousand times by liberal professors\n\nNow, I'd like to know in which book I can find M+E notes on the Commune. \n\nIf I recall correctly from Manifesto, is that the French Revolution was liberal. I noticed that they (the nobles turned revolutionaries) did not extend rights to enslaved people or women, and only wanted to seize the power from the Conservatives/Royalists. That there was tension between the former-noble Liberals and the Proletariat sans-culotte and this tension halted the Revolution and gave time to Napoleon, whom reversed all revolutionary advance. \n\nIn this light, Freedom-Equality-Fraternity fell short on its ambition. At the start was truly revolutionary but as Liberals steered the movement to their particular purposes away from common folk, *compromising* with Royalists/conservatives, it spoiled the whole experiment. \n\nAm I close to what M+E said? Where I can read more of this topic specifically",

Just the manifesto isn't going to be adequate grounding for disputes between Kautsky and Lenin.",

Without historical context and knowledge of the programmatic works where people lay out their ideas as completely as possible, these response pamphlets can often give a very misleading impression. \n\nBut that is a good list you have planned. \n\nAlso, don't be shy about Capital vol. 1. To understand Marx fully, you'll need to read it eventually. After finishing that list would be a good point to start",
