    "selftext": "What about autonomous marxism? Actually I don't really know what it's tenets are. I have it in my profile description, because the only thing I know about it is that it acknowledges the fact that the proletariat is not a passive puppet that is constantly manipulated by the bourgeoisie and the state. The proletariat has its own agency, independent of even unions, especially of the union bosses. ",

            "body": "They're basically anarchists with some marxist influence. They usually reject revolutionary parties and focus too much on localism/decentralisation.\n\nThis causes fragmentation and fail to internationally unify the workers as a whole class. The working class does need to seek political autonomy from other economic classes, but as a whole unified group and with the goal of abolishing all classes.\n\nThey can't form \"autonomous\" groups between themselves to try and address local conditions in an isolated manner and expect actual change, this doesn't make sense because society is an interconnected whole and no group can operate independently from it. The only way to dismantle capitalism is to actually unify the whole international working class under the same banner and abolish classes and private property. This does mean centralisations, but not as an external entity, and course violence amongst workers is to be rejected too. \n\nThis doesn't mean that the workers are reduced to passive puppets tho, they are the main agents of the revolution and only they can emancipate the whole of humanity, no party or state can impose it on them or do it for them, their goal is to elevate and facilitate the political power of the workers, not replace it.",

Here in Seattle there are like 6 different \"revolutionary parties\" that seem to be basically competing with each other like capitalist businesses or churches.\n\n In the 60s there were real revolutionary parties, but COINTELPRO addressed that pretty quickly.",

Those fragmented \"revolutionary parties\" you're talking about just aren't it either tho. This doesn't mean we should abandon party-building tho, we need a clear political program rooted in revolutionary theory and class struggle, not informal groups that lack unity and coordination.",

All they do is participate in the reactionary system through reformist policies, adventurism, or both. They aren't doing anything to break away from capitalism. All \"praxis\" that's detached from the whole activity of the class does not lead to any substantial change, all attempts to influence bourgeois politics through electoralism is a compromise for the workers and a distraction, all attempts to \"build class consciousness\" is not going to work either because class consciousness isn't something we can magically build by trying to sell communism to people, all acts of individual violence are only a reflection of the influence from petit-bourgeois on the \"movement\" of the proletariat. All these things are completely alien to the working class.\n\nWhen there's repression and no mass action then communists are left in a position of retreat, but this doesn't mean let's abandon the idea of a party altogether. Communist should still maintain a coherent framework in preparation for a future revolution and criticise all reformist and other opportunist/counter-revolutionary ideologies that try to influence and mislead the workers, and the party should provide a clear and uncompromising revolutionary alternative.",

But since then, the capitalist ruling class has perfected its techniques with which it turns the proletariat into a passive puppet: obsequious to the capitalist ruling class and the capitalist State. Twentieth century Marxists such as Gramsci, Luk\u00e0cs, and Fromm struggled to understand why the agent with an obvious interest in ending class distinctions, and class antagonisms, has not yet found and mustered its own agency.",
