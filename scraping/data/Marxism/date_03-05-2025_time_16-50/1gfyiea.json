I'm interested in PolySci as my main passion is reading political history and theory, and I wanted to be able to enhance that knowledge through a degree so that I could use it towards my home state of Mississippi. I want to find out what its problems are and help solve them with my passion, in other words. I thought I'd ask here to get the a unique perspective.\n\nPS: I don't have a degree, I'm still in High School, so please excuse any of my ignorance on the subject lol.\n\nThanks!",

            "body": "I think, if you wish to use a Humanities/Politics degree to \"help people\" then you'd likely want to focus on Social Policy (and go into Politics or civil service), Social Work (and go into the legal side of Social Work), or a joint Education and Politics degree (to be a teacher). These will likely give you all of the qualifications, experience and connections to enter a job in your field almost immediately but will not involve much theoretical study.\n\nOr, if you require theory in your formal studies, focus on political science, history and/or philosophy and find a way to narrow down how you'll help people after (post-grad degree/certificate, job training, apprenticeship etc). \n\nA less specialised/specific degree should get your foot in the door in the field you want as well but you will likely enter at a lower-level than if you completed a degree specific to that area you've chosen. The upside to this is you get more time to choose, and specialise, later on if you want to AND you've got more options if that particular avenue doesn't pan out. \n\nGood luck!",

Journalism and academic analysis for a Marxist publication. Party activism. Of course you won\u2019t be getting paid enough to live on until you at least have enough people who can financially contribute enough (no you\u2019re not a leech for having a full time party position paid for by members of the party, people should be compensated for their work if it\u2019s possible and you\u2019re fighting the good fight - unless you\u2019re a sell out). \n\nOr teach political economy/industrial relations. Or history. \n\nOr become a youtuber I guess but I think being uneducated, useless to the movement and full of shit is a prerequisite to be a YouTuber. \n\nThat\u2019s basically it for Marxists. You can\u2019t be a union bureaucrat, you\u2019d be in a position of constantly selling out of workers. You can\u2019t join a mainstream bourgeoise party, that\u2019s a betrayal of socialist principles and antithetical to building a Marxist independent working class party. It\u2019s difficult to be a mainstream academic as you\u2019re under constant pressure to justify your employment and research. It\u2019s difficult to be a journalist, right wing press hires right wingers and liberal press hires liberals - they will gag you on stuff like Palestine or working class activism.",

One of the things that really stood out to me was the fact that brain drain is a real issue when it comes to possibly transitioning to a socialist state. Many Marxists, socialists, leftists, etc. are people that are relatively educated in fields like poli sci, philosophy, journalism, etc. but you'll find very few Marxist engineers, doctors, lawyers, and so on.\n\nI personally think your job and education can serve the movement better if you contribute a different set of skills than most others, but obviously still have the theoretical background and party activism. But you said poli sci is your main passion, and I think following your passion is also important.",

You /can/ work for a non profit but you will have to be an intern, and probably will need an advanced degree for any leadership role. \n\nGoing into international relations or American politics is more doable but at that point you can\u2019t be an open Marxist. Professional academia was also an interesting option and I met a lot of professors who were genuinely interested in sociology from a Marxist perspective. The problem is sociology is continually under attack here in the states and that aforementioned professor was tenured and even told me not to waste my life on trying to write sanitized sociology for a bourgeoise institution who tries to minimize your department at any chance. The sad reality is that American universities want liberal political science professors, not radical sociology professors.",

Courses in theory and history may be found in sociology, philosophy, history, or even english departments. It ultimately depends on the university.\n\nPS will educate you in the standard US neoliberal tradition, with an emphasis on statistics. The latter is great, the former will require you to \u201cstay vigilant\u201d. Many radical thinkers have been educated in neoliberal PS and have benefitted from getting a better understanding of that ideology, which continues to dominate. Maybe you can major in PS with a minor in a more theory oriented department.\n\nIn any case, you should read a lot. I recommend reading Michael Parenti first. I also recommend researching PS departments of schools you might want to go to.\n\nTo answer your bigger question, yes. You can use these skills to help or harm. I think the main thing to focus on\u2014since you\u2019re so young\u2014is getting your education, deciding what\u2019s important to you, and READING WIDELY. Read, read, read. Inside and especially outside of school.\n\nAgain, I\u2019d just recommend going through all of Parenti\u2019s books first and then diving deeper.",

Right now, I'm reading a trilogy on Nazi Germany that is quite enjoyable (by Richard J. Evans).",

Love Engels.\n\nParenti offers a counter-current to mainstream anti-Stalinism, which is the default perspective in the US. I don\u2019t think he glosses over it. Stalin wasn\u2019t perfect, but the US imagination regarding Stalin is also deeply flawed. He was enemy number 1 to the US and so it\u2019s no surprise that he would be so severely demonized and that this would influence the mainstream culture for decades.\n\nApproach with an open mind and the knowledge that what you\u2019ve heard so far about Stalin might not be a full picture of the man. I certainly don\u2019t believe that it is, and getting into it would be a much deeper and lengthier discussion.\n\nAlso, RevolutionaryLeft Radio is a good podcast to get into. It\u2019s covered a lot of ground.",

To be more specific, I started reading capital a month or two ago and dropped it at commodity fetishism. The concepts and overall structure was really neat, but the wording was dense and the detail seemed abit extreme. Marx, too me, seemed to write that chapter in a way that was philosophically-exhaustive, or in other words, wrote it to cover all his bases. However, this caused the reading to be brutalizing at times (with the brutality peaking at commodity fetishism's gobbley-goop insanity, specifically the first two pages of that section iirc). \n\nThe other issue is application of the theory in order to validate it with our reality. I'm a big history nerd, but I am sorely uninformed with regards to current issues. This is mainly due to my lack of trust in all major media (which is a predjudice of mine, admittedly). Because of this, its difficult to even know that bad stuff is happening in the first place because said supposed bad stuff gets politicized out the wazoo. All I really know is that a tenth of the US population is below the poverty line (according to the government). But beyond that, I got nothing. All that means is that I can't really know if Marxism is even true or not as I don't even know the current issues. Thats a part of my hope for PolySci, that my instructors would give me proper research skills and a theoretical base to understand the issues I would want to help solve (if they exist, that is).",
