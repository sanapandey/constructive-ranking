I\u2019m currently writing an lesson about neoliberalism and pinkwashing for my sections of the youth wing for the Swedish left party, and am currently discussing the racist tendencies on leftists of the global north, so called left anti-communists to critique revolutions in the global south for not following their idealistic view of a revolution. I\u2019d like to also show that Marx was wrong in his theory, as he stated that the revolution would start in the industrialised world, however it started in the non-industrialised and agricultural world instead (when these revolutions have later fallen to revisionism is a discussion for another day). And I was wondering if anyone knew in what work Marx wrote this statement.\n\nEdit: In discussion with my fellow comrades in the comments, It\u2019s become apparent that I\u2019ve understood Marx wrong. My point still stands that a lot of the critique wester leftist have against socialist experiments in the global south are often not educated enough and partially based in unconscious racism, but my understanding of Marx was faulty.\n\nSo thank you comrades for educating me on this!",

You can see that letter [here](http://www.leftcom.org/en/articles/2024-05-28/marx-s-newly-unearthed-letter-reaffirms-the-necessity-of-internationalism-and) but to be completely honest I think your whole point is quite vague. What is racist about criticising a revolution? During Lenin\u2019s time communists in Germany, the Netherlands and Great Britain criticised his actions. It\u2019s natural that for something like a revolution which is of global interest communists will want the best outcome for that revolution and if they feel mistakes are being made they should voice them so the revolutionaries can defend their actions like Lenin did in \"Left-Wing\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder",

I don\u2019t think at all that the spartacists or other contemporary communist organisations were racist in their critiques of the Bolsheviks.\n\nMy problem is with the modern liberal lefts tendency to critique our contemporary recent or current socialist experiments such as China, (though if their socialist now is debatable) Cuba, Libya or Yemen. Most of these anticommunist still haven\u2019t achieved full class conciousness and therefore are desperatly holding onto the global norths liberal bourgeois demoratic ideals.\n\nThis often materialises in critique of a revolution being \u201cauthoritarian\u201d or not socially progressive enough, often comparing revolutions such as the Cuban one to the standards of liberal democracies in the global north, failing to see the dramatic difference in material conditions.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything else that is unclear with my reasoning, please let me know, as I\u2019m positive this has been a product of me not being clear enough.",

You\u2019re actually a liberal if you think there\u2019s a debate on modern China being socialist, they have billionaires and a stock market for christs sake. \n\nNone of these countries are socialist. Socialism in one country is a departure from internationalism. Workers do not have political control in these countries. The socially progressive point is also fucking weird, Cuba put lgbt people in camps. China has the Uighurs in camps and has occupied Tibet. It also brutally suppressed protestors in Hong Kong. Yemen and Libya are not socially progressive.\n\nProletarian Revolution by its nature challenges reactionary ideas. There\u2019s a reason revolutionary Russia more than 100 years ago decriminalised homosexuality, gave women equal rights, divorce rights and voting rights, provided gender affirming trans healthcare, enshrined minority cultural and religious practice as protected in law and freed all of the Russian territories. You actually can\u2019t have a successful proletarian socialist revolution without fundamentally challenging the reactionary \u201cmuck of ages\u201d that workers may adopt due to the capitalist system. Because working class revolution is built on solidarity and united struggle. If these ideas aren\u2019t challenged then the workers movement is basically not matured enough and class consciousness has not reached a high enough level.",

I agree with the idea of socialism in one country being a departure from the internationalist ideals of socialism. Where I don\u2019t agree with you is the notion that China has camps for Ughyurs, or Cuba the same with queer people. The accusations of genocide has been disproven, and the Cuban revolution has recently adopted a new and much more progressive law for queer people. Now is the Chinese occupation of Tibet completely justified? No, but what preceded it was a feudal theocracy, so there wasn\u2019t some glorious freedom before.\n\nYemen and Libya were both progressive when compared to other arab nations. The problem I\u2019m identifying in your definition of a proletarian revolution is that different revolutions have different material conditions. A lot of the countries in the global south have had reactionary ideas such as homophobia and racism imposed on them by the global norths colonial powers, and still have these backwards ideals today.\n\nOf course total queer liberation is what should be the goal for everyone, but you have to analyse where a revolution started, so as to not hold it to unrealistic standards.",

It\u2019s not a genocide in the holocaust sense, just mass internment of a minority group to bully them into submission much like the colonial powers in America or Australia did (and still do). \n\nCuba also had camps for queers. It does not now. Castro famously said it was one of his biggest regrets and mistakes. It still happened. \n\nThey aren\u2019t progressive compared to revolutionary Russia from 1917. Russia in which most of the country was a peasant or was a recently proletarianised new urban migrant. Russia, an extremely religious country where most people were part of Orthodox Church, one of the most patriarchal, sexist and reactionary churches even to this day. Russia in which workers only 12 years earlier held demonstrations with portraits of the tsar chanting his name. Russia in which had only recently transformed into a capitalist nation from feudalism. Russia in which pogroms of Jews were the nastiest and most vile in Europe. \n\nRussia was one of the most backwards capitalist countries in the world.\n\nRevolutionary Russia challenged all of that in the span of a few short years. Most capitalist countries have \u201cprogressed\u201d considerably since then in terms of their material conditions developing. I don\u2019t buy the excuses that their material conditions are different and that\u2019s why their supposed socialist states should be excused for not challenging reactionary ideas. Russia\u2019s material conditions were objectively worse. A workers revolution by necessity challenges these things. A very easy litmus test for class consciousness is seeing what they have to say about these things - are the oppressed working majority fighting for the oppressed minority? It\u2019s because it\u2019s a litmus test for solidarity and how workers understand solidarity. These ideas do not survive a socialist workers revolution in any organised capacity.",

The movements in the preindustrialized world are premature attempts at Marxism, IMO, spurred by Marxist ideology and class division rather than the materialist dialectic. I'd argue that we are seeing the beginning of Marx's final stage of capitalism in the industrialized world in the rise of AI. AI and robotics represent the ultimate capitalist technology, offering the promise of fully eliminating functional work, and therefore fully eliminating labor. Surprisingly, this elimination is starting with educated workers, and elites are now talking about basic income. \n\nThese are just the first steps. For AI to eliminate all labor, we'll need to solve the resource problem, and that will require space mining and advanced energy technology. With AI-driven robots surveying, mining and generating goods and services, we will have an almost complete replacement of functional labor, the cost of goods and services will plummet (like it did with salt and other basic goods). Either we achieve a true laborless version of the economy, or humans discover they can do something machines can't and exchange will be on that basis and that will form the base of the new economy. Since all cost comes from labor and no labor will be required for industrially produced material goods, capitalists will enjoy 100% profit, but conversely, since the cost of the means of production for everything (including the means of production) falls to zero, anyone, in theory, could own their own means of production. \n\nTL;DR the AI revolution is what Marx's theory predicted.",

If I\u2019m understanding this correctly, material dialectic analysis of the progression of capitalism and AI/robotics would lead to manual labor being superseded by the more cost effective robotic labor.

Along the way, we'd expect prices to fall so low that such services could be provided by many market participants, reducing the cost to some negligible amount. At that stage, I'd expect humans would provide services that only humans (and not even very advanced robots could). What those are I won't say here, because that's an even crazier discussion.

Maybe it's not necessary to have the attention of many people in such a new world because dominance itself has no economic value. It is hard for me to extrapolate to that because that becomes a question of what happens to our values in that post-(economic)-singularity world.

            "body": "The way I understand Marx\u2019s view that proletarian and socialist revolutions will come to the developed capitalist States first is largely due to the conditions created in those bourgeois revolutions (in England first in the 1600s, and then in the US, and in France). By establishing capitalist modes of production and distribution, they created the material conditions for a proletariat to become not merely a class in itself, but also a class for itself. Those revolutions also established legislatures where the working class, upon becoming a class for itself, could make use of those legislatures to expropriate the capitalist ruing class expropriators and dismantle the State machinery (the bureaucracies, police, and standing armies).\n\nHowever, Marx\u2019s analysis did not fall on deaf ears for the bourgeoisie. The counterrevolution reactions of Napoleon in France and President Jackson in the US had already sullied the best values and principles of the bourgeoisie. However, the brutal response to socialism and communism led to bourgeois attempts to fortify the State machinery and make the legislatures mere token gestures fully under the boot of the capitalist ruling class. Marx\u2019s intervention of historical materialism analysis thus altered the course of history (like the Hawthorne Effect, a.k.a. observer effect,  in sociology with Marx as the observer). What we needed after this tectonic alteration of history was a new approach to revolution that combined bourgeois and proletarian revolutionary moments into one event (rather than relying in them to occur in succession). It is important to underscore in this regard that even in the bourgeois revolutions, it was typically the working class and commoners who did most of the fighting, killing, and dying to bring about the bourgeois victory. Such fighting, killing, and dying is never condemned when it is for the bourgeoisie: only when it is for the working class itself (the libertine sin).\n\nThe Revolutions in less developed and less capitalist regions of the World occurred because the masses were understandably gripped by Marxian analysis, and more importantly, in desperate need to escape their pre-capitalist or nascent capitalist suppressive, oppressive, and repressive conditions. These were not historically ready for a proletarian revolution because the proletariat had not yet developed to a sufficient degree to be a class in itself, let alone a class for itself. While these revolutions made some meager steps toward socialism, the more important task was to end the oppressive conditions imposed by pre-capitalist ruling classes in each of these nation-states.\n\nMeanwhile, in the most developed capitalist nation-states the brutal repression of socialist and communist movements were so thoroughgoing that the proletariat came to see it as a taboo and selfish to become a class for itself. To be for oneself (and not for the brutal repressive capitalist ruling class) became a libertine sin. There is also the issue of a labor aristocracy, but it is the perceived sinfulness of socialism and communism that secured the brutal rule of the capitalist ruling class (along side the sinfulness of intoxicating liquors, other intoxicants, race mixing, feminism, \u2018deviant\u2019 individual expression, and so forth).\n\nSo these revolutions embraced Marx in name, but failed to achieve communism (ruminating endlessly on a perpetual quasi-proletarian State period). Marx would not be surprised by these unsuccessful attempts to achieve communism from pre-capitalist conditions (though most of these regions have since developed their proletariat sufficiently to achieve a proletarian revolution presently). Marx would be disappointed with the backsliding of full fledged capitalist States that abandoned the original principles of the bourgeoisie that reintroduced totalitarian and absolutist rule (Czarism, Kaiserism, Bonapartism, Emperorism) to supplant legislative power, while maintaining mere pantomime fa\u00e7ades from the legislatures. \n\nThis was Marx\u2019s frustration with his birthplace of Germany already evident in 1875 when Marx penned his _Critique of the Gotha Programme_. This backsliding is what we would eventually call \u201cfascism\u201d: the demoralization and debasement of the working class so that they lose all hope and accept that only the demeaning of a fabricated out group or groups\u2014they had been conditioned to hate\u2014would need to suffice for their personal fulfillment (any hope of genuine fulfillment extinguished by the fascist capitalist reaction to the proletariat). The formulation from Kautsky and Luxemburg that our choice is \u201ceither socialism or barbarism\u201d (foreignism) already involved a seeping fascism (brandishing a connotation against foreigners), though the term \u201cfascism\u201d had not yet been coined. Now we can understand the proper formulation of our social choice is fascism (seething hatred and demeaning of out groups) or socialism (agap\u0113 as a universal love undergirding golden rule based universal social Justice). The proletariat (the 99%ers) are the revolutionary agent who can bring about that socialism and vanquish fascism once and for all.\n\nAfter Marx, this feigning of republic while solidifying absolutism became the obsession of the capitalist ruling class.",

            "body": "By my reading of Marx, a necesary precondition for the establishment of communism are conditions of highly developed productive forces. To understand this, we have to look at Marx's idea of freedom. For marx, all matter has certain \"powers\", that is to say, it can interact with other matter in a set of particular ways. It also has certain \"needs\", what is required for it's own self-reproduction or autopoeisis. Humans, being a particular formation of matter, also have a set of \"powers\" and \"needs\". These powers and needs are not static, they are historically contingent. As time goes on, human powers develop, and the needs develop along side them. As an example, an early human might simply need to eat food so as not to die, and she has the power to hunt a gazelle. But a modern human might need not just the bare sustinence, but also food that is well prepared, well seasoned etc. , and in turn her powers of more advanced food production develop. Both needs and powers develop together at the same time inseperably from each other. Freedom for marx is the ability to exercise one's powers to meet your needs to their fullest extent. \n\nNow maybe you can begin to see why productive powers would have to develop to a certain point before needs can develop contingently, but I'll keep going to be more precise.\n\nCommunism requires the abolition of surplus labour time. Under capitalism, the worker works some set of hours in order to produce enough value to pay their own wage (their wage represents their own cost of living, as well as the cost of renumourating their education). But they do not stop working there, once their needs have been met. Instead, they keep working and the value produced by that surplus labour, surplus value, is extracted by the capitalist in the form of profit. In communism, workers only work for the amount of time required to produce what they and society need, not the extra time required to produce profit for a capitalist. \n\nImagine now that set of circumstances taking place in a historical moment where the forces of production are not very developed. Say, a commune of subsistence farmers. In this situation, although the workers don't have to produce profit for a capitalist, their powers are not developed. Each worker has to work a long time to produce very little, and is only left at the end of the day with the minimum food required to survive. In other words, while they might be \"free\" to do as they please, they're not actually free because they need to spend all day working the land in order to meet their needs. \n\nIn a society where the forces of production are highly developed, each individual worker is much more productive. Now if they no longer have to work for a capitalist, they are much more free, since only a small portion of the day is taken up by working and for the rest of the time they can do whatever they want. \n\nMarx thinks communism will develop from highly developed capitalist production because they capitalist is also incentivised to develop the productive forces. The more productive each worker is, the fewer workers he has to hire, and the faster each worker completes the labour to produce enough value to pay their wage, meaning the more time left over for the capitalist to extract as profit. However it is this very development of productive forces which will give the workers the tools needed to produce everything society needs for as little labour time spent as possible. The workers can seize on the opportunities provided by the developed productive forces in order to demand a reduction in labour time. The further surplus labour time is reduced, the less profits for the capitalist, the less power the capitalist has, until eventually the balance of power tips in favour of the workers and capitalism is overthrown.",
