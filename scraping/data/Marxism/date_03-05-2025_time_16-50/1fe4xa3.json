    "selftext": "Here is my understanding of surplus-value under capitalism: the cost of an employer hiring you is your wage (or salary). For the act of hiring you to be profitable for an employer, you need to produce more value per a certain unit of time that you get through your wage. For example, if I work for $20 an hour, then it means that (on average) I bring a value to the firm that is greater than $20 per hour: in other words, the employer gains more than $20 per hour through the act of hiring me. If they didn't gain more by the act of hiring me, then they wouldn't have had any reason to hire me in the first place. This difference between the value that I bring to the firm and the value that the employer pays me is called surplus-value.\n\nConsidering that the state does not necessarily run by the profit-motive, does surplus-value extraction happen to government-employed workers? If not, then why are they part of the proletariat? Shouldn't we consider them to be an entirely different class?",

During the Great Miners Strike of 1984-85, the miners were fighting their employer, the National Coal Board, a state-owned enterprise. They were obviously still proletarian.\n\nState enterprises may not run entirely for profit, but make profit they do nevertheless.",

            "body": "What you are describing here relates to Marx's distinction in volume 3 of Capital between [productive and unproductive labor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40324865#:~:text=As%20Marx%20put%20it%2C%20the,Marx%20to%20be%20unproductive%20labor). Only the former is involved in surplus value creation.\n\nThe proletariat are people who survive by selling their labor power. (That includes unproductive labor.) A capitalist society needs a proletarian class because capitalist profit occurs by getting (many of) these workers to work surplus labor time. So the understanding that labor must be disciplined in a certain way (that the employment contract must require surplus labor time) is simply part of life in a capitalist society. However, even if all workers in a capitalist society are expected to work surplus labor time, they are not all engaged in the creation of surplus value. Only commodities are value, so a worker who is not engaged in the production of commodities is not directly part of the process of the creation of surplus value. Nevertheless, their lives are still disciplined in the interest of capital because they live in a capitalist society.",

The state being a big employer basically fulfils the role of the capitalist and has value created for it by labour for the purposes of meeting market needs. \n\nIt may shock you to realise lots of companies don\u2019t actually operate on immediate profit per se but on more abstract things, future goals or expectations of profit. Their function is still to get profit as is the government\u2019s service provision, to keep the capitalist economy running.",

Maersk relies on weather reports from NOAA/NASA. Pfizer and Moderna sell drugs developed by the NIH. The defense and intelligence sectors exist first and foremost to protect American economic interests. Private companies in the US receive an asymmetrical benefit from the work of government employees and keep the profit for themselves.\n\nedit: Maersk is a Danish company but still you get the point",

This includes workers, infrastructure, machinery and everything. It is the leftover which can be expended on luxuries, expanding the means of production or state aparatuses (like the police or military).\n\n\nWorkers in government departments like education are not exactly paid from surplus, as their work goes into replenishing the means of production (skilled workers). Or it could be that they are in healthcare, or civil engineering.\n\n\n\nIn either case, the surplus extracted from them is still equal to the value they produce (work done on the MOP) - the value of their wages. Who their employer is does not matter, because surplus value extraction is more fundamental than capitalism, existing before and after.",
