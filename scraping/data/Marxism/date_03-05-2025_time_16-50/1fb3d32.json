    "selftext": "After reading *Left wing communism* by Lenin it is clear he supports participating in bourgeois elections and parlaments as its important to the working class\n\nHowever, reading about the October Revolution and the previous years, he opposed this tactic in particular moments. It happened several times under zarist rule and in september-october 1917 he opposed participating in the anteparlament as it was a tool the capitalist class would use to relegate the soviets to a secondary paper, and participating would mean confusing the working class about the true intentions of this institution. Thats the argument Stalin gives in *Trotskyism or leninism*. However, he does not go in depth and such an argument can be fabricated to justify not participating in basically all parlaments. So, is there any texts that go more in depth about when we shouldn't participate in elections and Parlaments? For example, by Lenin in cases he supported boicotting as a tactic?",

But, to make it abundantly clear, participation should not be done by joining bourgeois parties (riding the coat tails of the bourgeoisie) - instead, by the creation of a separate, proletarian class party",

As soon as the new governments have established themselves, their struggle against the workers will begin. If the workers are to be able to forcibly oppose the democratic petty bourgeois it is essential above all for them to be independently organized and centralized in clubs. At the soonest possible moment after the overthrow of the present governments, the Central Committee will come to Germany and will immediately convene a Congress, submitting to it the necessary proposals for the centralization of the workers\u2019 clubs under a directorate established at the movement\u2019s center of operations. The speedy organization of at least provincial connections between the workers\u2019 clubs is one of the prime requirements for the strengthening and development of the workers\u2019 party; the immediate result of the overthrow of the existing governments will be the election of a national representative body. Here the proletariat must take care: 1) that by sharp practices local authorities and government commissioners do not, under any pretext whatsoever, exclude any section of workers; 2) that workers\u2019 candidates are nominated everywhere in opposition to bourgeois-democratic candidates. As far as possible they should be League members and their election should be pursued by all possible means. Even where there is no prospect of achieving their election the workers must put up their own candidates to preserve their independence, to gauge their own strength and to bring their revolutionary position and party standpoint to public attention. They must not be led astray by the empty phrases of the democrats, who will maintain that the workers\u2019 candidates will split the democratic party and offer the forces of reaction the chance of victory. All such talk means, in the final analysis, that the proletariat is to be swindled. The progress which the proletarian party will make by operating independently in this way is infinitely more important than the disadvantages resulting from the presence of a few reactionaries in the representative body. If the forces of democracy take decisive, terroristic action against the reaction from the very beginning, the reactionary influence in the election will already have been destroyed.  \n> [Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League by Marx and Engels (marxists.org)](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm)\n\n---\n\nThe question I have about bourgeois elections:  \n- In 1931, why did the German Communist Party (KPD) support the NSDAP (Nazi) referendum to bring down the Social Democratic government of Prussia?   What Marx, Engels or Lenin ever support a right-wing or fascist initiative to overthrow a social-democrat?  Did Stalin support this?  \n  \n> \"In August 1931, to capitalise on their growing popularity, the Nazi Party launched a referendum to overthrow the Social Democratic government of Prussia. At first the KPD correctly attacked it. Then, three weeks before the vote, under orders from Stalin's Comintern, they joined forces with the fascists to bring down the main enemy, the Social Democrats. They changed the name of the plebiscite to a 'Red Referendum' and referred to the fascists and the members of the SA as 'working people's comrades'!\" \u00a0  \n> Rob Sewell,\u00a0*Germany: From Revolution to Counter-Revolution*, Fortress Books (1988),\u00a0[ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN_(identifier))\u00a0[1-870958-04-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/1-870958-04-7),\u00a0[Chapter 7](http://www.marxist.com/germany/chapter7.html).   \n> available online here: [https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Germany\\_From\\_Revolution\\_to\\_Counter\\_Revol/y259DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Germany%3A%20From%20Revolution%20to%20Counter-Revolution%20sewell&pg=PT90&printsec=frontcover](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Germany_From_Revolution_to_Counter_Revol/y259DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Germany%3A%20From%20Revolution%20to%20Counter-Revolution%20sewell&pg=PT90&printsec=frontcover)",

So it is not a bad idea overall, just likely pointless in many countries which would not let anarchists in/they would not be voted for.\n\nIn my country some socialists are voted in, we even had four communists (now three) in Parliament.

It's a shame though, they should be represented.\n\nEdit: \n\nFor anyone who didn't know, Lenin lost to the Socialist Revolutionary Party by 7 million votes and overturned the result.

Communists do not simply change their platform and rhetoric to reflect the masses, they instead argue to the masses their radical platform to win them over. Losing an election is meaningless, revolutionary communists expect to lose every election up until basically before insurrection. \n\nLenin was never under any illusion that the Bolsheviks would be voted in. Bourgeoise democracy is not a democracy and will never result in revolutionary socialists winning. The elections are done to gauge the communists support, to use as a launching point for their rhetoric and as a political tool. This is explicitly stated in the bolsheviks theoretical debates on participating in elections - many didn\u2019t even want to due to being completely undemocratic tools of the bourgeoisie to neuter the working class, which is true but misses the reasons why we should participate - hence Lenin weighing in on the debate in 1920. \n\nThe constituent assembly deserved to be dissolved as it was a pale comparison to the mass workers democracy of the soviets. It had really nothing to do with the Bolsheviks winning or losing in it. It was a tool of class warfare used to mislead workers into maintaining illusions with bourgeoise democracy. Entirely unrepresentative. The Bolsheviks weren\u2019t even a majority in the soviets until after the kornilov coup. Once the soviets had voted for majority in favour of insurrection is basically the signifier that they had fully turned to revolutionary politics led by the Bolsheviks. Then we turn to the dictatorship of the proletariat with the soviets as the new democratic building block and the party as the leadership. \n\nCommunists are basically meant to argue to workers to take a revolutionary communist position and not water themselves down on questions of important substance even if it would win you an election or get you more seats - that\u2019s opportunism. That\u2019s what separates revolutionaries from reformists ultimately. It\u2019s fine to meet workers where they are at as long as you don\u2019t compromise on the fundamental questions. It\u2019s fine to lose an election, elections don\u2019t mean the same things to us as to bourgeoise and reformist parties. Our strength is mass politics. \n\nLenin always saw the soviets as vital for democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat.",

The dictatorship of the proletariat, the period of transition to communism, will for the first time create democracy for the people, for the majority, along with the necessary suppression of the exploiters, of the minority. **Communism alone is capable of providing really complete democracy, and the more complete it is, the sooner it will become unnecessary and wither away of its own accord.**\n\nParagraph 2\n\n>**Democracy is a form of the state**, it represents, on the one hand, the organized, systematic use of force against persons; but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of equality of citizens, the equal right of all to determine the structure of, and to administer, the state. This, in turn, results in the fact that, at a certain stage in the development of democracy, it first welds together the class that wages a revolutionary struggle against capitalism--the proletariat, and enables it to crush, smash to atoms, wipe off the face of the earth the bourgeois, even the republican-bourgeois, state machine, the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy and to substitute for them a more democratic state machine, but a state machine nevertheless, in the shape of armed workers who proceed to form a militia involving the entire population.\n\nParagraph 3\n\n>From the moment all members of society, or at least the vast majority, have learned to administer the state themselves, have taken this work into their own hands, have organized control over the insignificant capitalist minority, over the gentry who wish to preserve their capitalist habits and over the workers who have been thoroughly corrupted by capitalism--from this moment the need for government of any kind begins to disappear altogether. **The more complete the democracy, the nearer the moment when it becomes unnecessary. The more democratic the \u201cstate\u201d which consists of the armed workers, and which is \"no longer a state in the proper sense of the word\", the more rapidly every form of state begins to wither away.**\n\nParagraph 4\n\n>Democracy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.e., exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters and oppressors of the people--this is the change democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism.\n\n>Only in communist society, when the resistance of the capitalists have disappeared, when there are no classes (i.e., when there is no distinction between the members of society as regards their relation to the social means of production), only then \"the state... ceases to exist\", and \"it becomes possible to speak of freedom\". **Only then will a truly complete democracy become possible and be realized, a democracy without any exceptions whatever. And only then will democracy begin to wither away, owing to the simple fact that, freed from capitalist slavery, from the untold horrors, savagery, absurdities, and infamies of capitalist exploitation, people will gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of social intercourse that have been known for centuries and repeated for thousands of years in all copy-book maxims. They will become accustomed to observing them without force, without coercion, without subordination, without the special apparatus for coercion called the state.**\n\nJust read [The State and Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/). Seriously. Democracy withers away with the state. It is not a principle. It is not an \"end goal\". Downvote away, I do not care. This is the correct stance.",
