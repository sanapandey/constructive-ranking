            "body": "Well, as the author indicates, Marx's dialectical method (or description?) is employed most masterfully and obviously in Capital. As for works in which Marx addresses dialectics itself as a subject, there kinda isn't? There's a couple works in The German Ideology that goes over idealism and materialism, that expounds what would be better called historical materialism, and that rejects the mechanistic or vulgar materialism of feuerbach, but most of what could be called dialectics is implicit in his work AFAIK. I suppose dialectics does come up as a subject in Marx's criticism of Proudhon (both in Poverty of Philosophy and some letters), though.\n\nEngels, for one, did directly address the subject of dialectical materialism in Anti-Duhring/Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, but I gather that most people who disagree with Mao's understanding of dialectics also think Engels misunderstood.",

            "body": "It is important to note that, for Marx, dialectics never received formalistic or ontological \"lawlike\" character. Instead, they were usually upheld as a methodological epistemology, a way of constructing knowledge by uncovering contradictions within social phenomena. Marx didn't prioritize his work on dialectics, because his method is pervasive throughout the body of his work. Indeed, the dialectic of concrete and abstract, as Ilyenkov observes, remains the core of Marx's method in the entirety of \"*The Capital\"*, which is a perfectly clear demonstration of the Marxist dialectic. \n\nRegarding what other Marxists theorize on the Marxist dialectic, I'd strongly recommend getting into Ilyenkov's theoretical project, which is articulated in \"*Dialectics of the Abstract & the Concrete in Marx\u2019s Capital\".* Additionally, Althusser's texts on dialectics and the split between the Hegelian and the Marxist dialectic (in \"*For Marx\"* and \"*Philosophy for Non-philosophers\"*) are worth looking into.",

But if you really want to understand Dialectical Thinking, don't read Marx but go back to the source - Hegel. Start with the Science of Logic, maybe up to the Concept of Infinity. Then switch to another work by Hegel (I read Philosophy of History) to get some application of the method. And I think at that point you can go back to any marxist text and see for yourself where it falls short.",
