    "selftext": "As the title says, I am wondering how Marxists, and especially Marxist-Leninists, view the work of Nicos Poulantzas. I am referring to his notion of *the state as the condensation of class relations*, and not to the reformist line Poulantzas drew from his theory. Is the *relational Marxism* theorised by Poulantzas congruent with the works of Marx and Lenin?  \nSince I want to know more about this way of viewing Marxism I want to look into different Marxist thinkers who have advanced the understanding of the relational aspect. I already know some things about Antonio Gramsci, and am not particularly interested in the *Western Marxist/post-Marxist* or *structuralist* accounts.",

            "body": "Poulantzas was thought-provoking as a theoretician; he uncovered issues with how modern Marxists view the state and came to doubt the instrumentalist conception of power (the elite model) that still is prevalent amongst many leftists. Indeed, his position that corruption or nepotism within the government or, generally, the influence the bourgeoisie has on policymaking and other state functions, should not be viewed as the reason why the state acts in favour of the ruling class; on contrary, the relations between the bourgeoisie and the state (with the first almost always being represented in the government in some way or another) are a result of the bourgeois nature of the state in capitalist society. Even if there were no capitalists in the government, the state would function in favour of the capitalist class, due to its in-built structure of being a bourgeois state.\n\nIn my view and reading of Poulantzas, this position is far from the reformism he demonstrated later in his life. In fact, I would suggest that the 'democratic road to socialism' is completely antithetical to the claim that, put simply, no matter who gets elected, the state remains bourgeois due to its structure. All in all, you may read Poulantzas and find use in his writing, but a critique is to be made in many of his tactical position, especially his democratic socialism.",

Having read both Classes in Contemporary Capitalism and State, Power, Socialism, his reformist position comes as a bit of a mystery to me considering -like you also mention- that seeing the state inherently as a bourgeois state implies the impossibility of reforming it. \n\nWould you happen to know other thinkers who have conceptualised the state and class struggle in a similar way?",

                            "body": "Exactly! I resonate a lot with the general 'structuralist' approach of Poulantzas, especially as articulated in the debate between him and Miliband about the role and structure of the bourgeois state. However, most comrades here in Greece that claim inspiration from Poulantzas, unfortunately, adopt a reformist road. \n\nAs for suggestions, I can't refrain from recommending Althusser. Admittedly, his interest in the state is not as focused as it is the case with Poulantzas, but he makes an attempt to enhance the Leninist position on the state with his theory of ideology. Althusser's use is not to be limited to his text on the ideological state apparatuses, as he makes a broader analysis regarding social practice(s), which receive great importance in his, IMO, greatest work, *\"Philosophy for Non-philosophers\"*. As for thinkers that may show some similarities with Poulantzas, one that comes to mind is Balibar, who put forward a fierce critique of the instrumentalist view of the state, as well as the reformist tendencies of his time and his own party, reminding us of the importance of the dictatorship of the proletariat within a 'structuralist' framework.",

            "body": "Let's contrast the concept that the state is the condensation of class relations with the theory advanced by Engels and recapitulated by Lenin in his book State and Revolution that the state is the \"product of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms\".\n\nWhat is condensation? It is when matter that has been heated to a point at which it becomes a gas or a vapour suddenly encounters a cooling agent - steam on a window or a mirror \u2013 which causes the motion of the gas to reduce so that it assumes a more orderly structure as a liquid.\n\nThe Poulantzean metaphor therefore leads us to the conclusion that class antagonisms can be presented in a more orderly and less chaotic fashion within the structures of the state. The class struggle therefore can take place within the state in which the array of class relations is contained.\n\nThe Engels-Lenin notion is more partisan. The state arises precisely because the antagonism between the classes  <i>cannot</i>  be reconciled. The state is not a place where those antagonisms are reconciled, but an instrument of one class suppressing another. It is a tool of class struggle, it is the extra-economic coercive instrument required to maintain the existing production relations. It is an instrument of a ruling class against subject classes. \n\nIt is unlikely to be an accident that one of those theories was advanced by someone who argued in favour of reformism, whilst the other leads directly to the conclusion that the proletariat must smash the bourgeois state through revolutionary force.",
