    "selftext": "So, I've been involved in a couple orgs over the last few years and something I've noticed is a strong tendency towards forming cliques, particularly a 'leadership clique'. It seems, again just from what I've seen, like the handful of people willing to put the work in actually steering the group - understandably - end up forming stronger bonds with eachother than the people who just show up to stuff. But this tendency seems to turn in on itself over time and ends up passively excluding those on the \"outside\" who want to contribute more. Again from my experience (I doubt, or at least hope it's not a universal thing), I have a more focused area of interest (environment, public health, and the economic forces behind their enshittification) and have been offering to run events, discussions, presentations etc for the better part of the year and have been met with silence in each and every case - proposals not finding their way to the agenda, requests for feedback ignored or \"we'll get to it later\" for months until I give up on following up, etc. Not even a \"no.\" And the question of \"what can I do?\" Is always answered with \"just keep coming to stuff\" while leadership makes it sound like they're drowning in the workload. As you can imagine, it's quite frustrating.\n\nI'm not just here to complain, though. I have to go back home soon (I'm from a different country) and my hometown has no real orgs to speak of, so I'm planning on starting my own education-focused org. I want to avoid this clique-ism at all costs - it's demotivating, counterproductive, and contributes to burnout among the usual suspects - but am at a loss for active measures to take against. Any thoughts?",

            "body": "This is an unfortunate position you have found yourself in. But it is difficult to answer this question without knowing quite a bit more. Such as what org, what rules you use for meetings, how big your local branch is, what exactly are they saying about your offers, how many others in your local agree with your feelings about being shut down, what has the branch already decided to use its limited resources on and how you are generally perceived in the branch. Obviously I can't expect you to answer these questions but I will give you advice from someone who has been in a minority faction in a demcent org.\n\nThis is only applicable to full voting members of the local so if you aren't then the only thing you can do is \"just keep going to stuff\" and becoming a member. But since you mentioned trying to get proposals on the agenda I will assume you are a full member.\n\nFirstly take stock of your local.\n\nwhat does capacity look like? A single person can't run events by themselves no matter what. so if everyone is already occupied by the current plan there might not be any room for your ideas. How do others feel about the current leadership style? If there are no complaints and you are alone in feeling this way then your probably out of luck. Is there an informal minority faction already? If there is then the next steps will be much easier since you should work with them on your plans. What rules are used to run meetings and run the local? This is critical for maneuvering in meetings so learn and understand them. \n\nThis is not even close to a full list of things to account for when examining your local org but those are some of the most important. Only you can understand you local conditions best and how to approach effecting change there. \n\nThen next would be to privately discuss your feelings with a member of your leadership. You need to be very blunt about this. Not in a angry way but I'm a matter of fact way. If you have already done this then you don't have to do this again. The goal here is to see how your leadership feels about your efforts which can inform your next steps.\n\nNext up is to use your knowledge of your meeting's rules of order to discuss your plans. An org I've been apart of used Roberts rules of order to run meetings. Roberts rules allows voting members to make motions to add things to a meetings agenda. I don't know what rules of order your org uses but it should have some mechanism to add an item to a meeting. Usually requiring a vote to be added which hopefully would go in your favor. Once it's on the agenda the following discussion will be on record which will could be very useful in the future. God help you if you have no rules of order for your meetings.\n\nFollowing the discussion if it it goes well there will be a clear path to getting your event off the ground, although it may take more meetings to discuss and vote about it. If at the end of the discussion you have a no from both rank-and-file and leadership then you'll have to come back with a different event. Otherwise results may vary wildly and you'll have to use your own judgement and work with those who supported your idea to get it done. \n\nIf you do these things it will give you a solid understanding of why you have been getting rejected and what you can do about it. But be aware that there might nothing you can do about it. At that point your only recourse is to be a good soldier and then later through hard work demand your opportunity to do your idea.",

                    "body": "Ah, we're not affiliated with the major orgs. More of a book club that expanded and started taking on mutual aid stuff, events, etc. Proper membership stuff has only been brought up and considered recently. Voting, until recently, was just a matter of who showed up to the meeting, though the meetings had very low turnout. One was cancelled a couple months back because no one was coming and after that, they stopped being either held or mentioned. It's also possible that I'm not perceived well. I don't think that's the case, and if it is, I don't know why except maybe the different areas of focus, but I get along with everyone. Regardless, it's possible.\n\nIt's difficult to gauge how others feel about leadership. I think it would do more harm than good to the group as a whole to go around asking. I suspect, largely because of the low turnout to the meetings where decisions were actually made, that it's a matter of disinterest among membership rather than any kind of effort from leadership.\n\nThat said, though, I did bring it up with one person in leadership, was told sorry and asked what steps they could take, and then I got no response to my answer.\n\n>God help you if you have no rules of order for your meetings.\n\n...Yeah, about that. The process now is to send a proposal to someone in leadership and it will, ideally, find its way to the agenda.\n\nAt this point, though, it's less about getting my event off the ground. I have to leave soon due to family issues so the bigger project I was proposing is non-viable at this point anyways. I'm more concerned with not reproducing all this when I give it my own shot, you know?",

            "body": "There's not likely much you can do for the outfit you're with at present, but when you start your own group you can implement things like, say, term limits or rotating chair positions or the like. Involve group members in the leadership  process by having each 'central committee' member having an understudy learning the job, and move positions every six months to get a feel for what each CC member does. Have every group member participate in this so that there will always be a cadre of members familiar with the group's functions in case of illness or resignation or what have you. If you do this as well as have term limits or set post rotations, you prevent the 'clique' from forming, as well as keeping everyone busy. \n\nWhatever size group you're looking in the end, make sure you have a well-defined plan and a solid set of by-laws for the administration of the group. It may be nothing more than 'me Tarzan you Jane' but that's a starting point.",
