    "selftext": "Karl Marx described the \"slave economies\" of Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece as one specific historical mode of production, preceded by Neolithic economies and succeeded by feudalism. However, slaves existed in other modes of production as well, such as in capitalism. For example, in America in the 1800's it was legal to own slaves, even though the economic system they lived in was capitalism.\n\nGiven this, what is the difference between a slave economy and a capitalist or feudalist economy in which people also hold slaves?",

            "body": "this is about the difference between a mode of production and a specific labor relation. Generally, modes of productions will have a certain type of labor relation associated with them. Ancient society has slavery as the general labor relation, feudalism has serfdom as the general labor relation, and capitalism has wage labor. \n\nHowever, different labor relations can exist and even thrive in different modes of production. As an example, wage labor was very common during periods in ancient greece for seasonal agricultural work. The labor relations alone are not what make up a mode of production. This is a mistake that people who get really into co-ops often make. \n\nInstead, a mode of production is defined by the labor relations (vertical and horizontal), the property relations, and (in the case of capitalism) the law of value. \n\nSo the difference between the ancient mode of production and the slave economies of Brazil and the US South would be\n\n1. in the US and Brazil, property is private and saleable while in ancient greece and rome, it is generally personal inhereted estates.\n\n2. in the US and Brazil, slaves are used to farm cash crops for sale on the market while in ancient greece and rome, they are used for more personal tasks. There is not, in ancient greece and rome, a largescale social need to make more profit to then reinvest and grow a business",

                            "body": "A common mistake people make is to assume that Marx's main problem with capitalism is that workers have surplus value stolen from them and that this is morally wrong. Co-ops would indeed solve this problem since the surplus would be directed by the workers themselves. But Marx doesn't actually think this at all. We can see this in Chapter 10 (The Working Day) of Capital Vol. 1 where he says:\n\n>\"We see then, that, apart from extremely elastic bounds, the nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working day, no limit to surplus labour. The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides.\"\n\nFor Marx, both the capitalist and the laborer have a valid claim to surplus-value. The fight over surplus value is just the battlefield on which the structural problems of Capitalism manifest themselves. Co-ops are treating a symptom and not the disease. \n\nFor Marx, the root problem of capitalism is the profit motive and its inability to account for externalities like the environment and its tendency to evade all attempts to limit it by government or convention. An example of this in my own life: I'm a bus driver and pretty regularly work 13-14 hour days. I've even worked a few 15-16 hour days. This is illegal and probably unsafe. But I need the OT money. So do all my coworkers. So we all do it. And we are a unionized workplace that pays decently well. Labor law cannot easily limit the pressure of the market. If the job were a co-op, this problem would still exist. \n\nMarx's rival and co-founder of the SPD, Ferdinand Lassalle, pushed a program of co-ops. Lassalle thought that if workers fought for wage increases, the market would just raise prices and real wages would remain the same. Instead, he wanted to elect officials to office who would fight to make legislation favorable to creating co-ops. Marx vehemently opposed this because he believed the fight for higher wages was necessary for workers developing class consciousness and that the state organizing or subsidizing co-ops would rob them of any class conscioisness.",

Because I can definitely see the pros and cons of both sides here, but I think there are plenty of avenues of instilling class consciousness that still work synergetically with using the state (even though I am anti-statist) to create more favorable conditions for cooperatives. Especially if the cooperatives were con/federated and creating circular economies and coordinating with mutual aid and community organizing groups.",

The Lord of the Lands rides by to collect his share of your harvest, despite the fact that you alone tilled, sowed, and reaped the crop. His sole claim to your wheat stems from his \"ownership\" of the land on which it grew\u2014a entirely passive relationship.\n\nNow, fast-forward to the present day and picture a factory worker manufacturing car parts. While the boss doesn't directly seize a percentage of the finished products, he does pay the worker a wage. This wage, however, represents only a fraction of the worker's total productivity for the day. Although the worker spends their entire shift producing car parts, the boss feels entitled to a substantial portion of that productivity because he \"owns\" the machinery.\n\nUpon closer examination, these two scenarios bear striking similarities:\n\n1. In both cases, the laborer (serf or factory worker) performs all the actual work.\n2. The authority figure (lord or boss) claims a significant portion of the output based solely on ownership of the means of production (land or machinery).\n3. The laborer is left with just enough to survive: the serf retains barely enough wheat to avoid starvation, while the worker receives a wage that covers basic living expenses.\n\nThis comparison illustrates how modern wage labor, despite its apparent differences, shares fundamental characteristics with feudal economic structures. In both systems, those who control the means of production extract value from the labor of others, while providing only the minimum necessary for the workers' survival and continued productivity.\n\n  \ntldr; we are all living in advanced serfdom.",
