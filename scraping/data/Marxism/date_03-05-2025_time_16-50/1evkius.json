    "selftext": "Hello. In an attempt to fully understand the world of Marx, I have done a deep dive into his work and theories. Recently I have been researching Marx\u2019s famous Alienation Theory. In this, Marx uses the Hegelian idea of the \u2018species-being\u2019. This can be translated as \u2018essence\u2019. He goes on to say that the \u2018essence of humans\u2019 is work, and the \u2018essence of animals\u2019 basic survival. \n\nThe ideas of essence and species-being seem awfully superstitious and quasi-religious. It seems contradictory with claims that Marxist concepts, like historical materialism, are grounded is science.\n\nWhat is the current Marxist viewpoint on this? Are there alternative perspectives or interpretations on what Marx said? Was he really talking about \u2018animal essence\u2019? Are there any Marxists who believe in \u2018essence\u2019?\n\nThank you for your time \ud83d\udc4d",

            "body": "Marx abandoned the idea of the \u201cspecies-being\u201d later in life, and his constructions of alienation in, for example, *Capital* are totally different in tone from those in the *Paris Manuscripts*. That shift is itself an aspect of a broader shift undergone by Marx from the materialist-idealism of Feuerbach to the developed historical-materialism of his later days. You can read about that as something significant to his epistemology in the \u201cTheses on Feuerbach\u201d and the manuscripts nowadays known as the *German Ideology*.",

            "body": "I always interpreted it as Marx saying that someone's work was essentially their lives worth in the capitalist system, I the same way we view animals as workers like Greyhounds racing or horses puling carts. Additionally, they had no way to enjoy the fruits of their labour, since the product would be sold off. The capitalist system dehumanizes people to the level of work animals without control of what they are actually producing as workers.",

            "body": "The concept of \u201cessence\u201d has a very particular and technical meaning for Marx, as well as for Hegelian and German philosophy generally, and it has nothing to do with anything like a soul or other religious concepts. (I\u2019m probably about to anger a bunch of Hegelians but) in simple terms, the \u201cessence\u201d of something is basically what it proves to be beyond any of its particular appearances. \n\nSay, for example, you meet a cat for the first time and the cat is orange, skinny, and friendly and so you conclude that that\u2019s what a \u201ccat\u201d is \u2014 small, orange, skinny, and friendly. But then you meet a second cat and this particular one is black, chubby, and it bites your finger \u2014 so now your idea of \u201ccat\u201d has to change. Then you meet a third cat, a fourth cat, etc and you start to develop a more and more nuanced understanding of what a cat is \u2014 being a cat has nothing to do with most of the apparent properties we experience when we meet a particular cat (like orange ones, fat ones, etc). The essence is something beyond mere appearances \u2014 you could turn an orange cat into a black cat or a fat cat into a skinny cat and it\u2019s still a cat. That thing behind the appearances of the thing is essence.",

            "body": "That's how Hannah Arendt interpreted Marx's species-being. I suggest you look into other secondary readings about it. I've read one of those interpretations claiming that it's not necessarily \"work\" that makes humans a species-being, rather it's his consciousness that allows him to choose his own function that makes him a species distinct to others. I also suggest reading about the metabolic drift of Foster and Saito discussing how alienation disintegrated humans from being a species-being into atomized beings.",
