Is this correct? \n\nOne article - [Part 2: Lenin in a double pack](https://kritikpunkt.com/2023/11/24/teil-2-lenin-im-doppelpack/) \\- has a number of questionable statemments \n\n# #1\n\n>As the first socialist state, the Soviet Communists found themselves in a situation in which they could practically not rely on the writings of Marx and Engels at many points in the socialist construction, since the starting point for socialism was now completely different.\n\nWhy couldn't they \"rely on the writings of Marx and Engels\"? Marx and Engels historical-materialist method was fundamental Lenin's and Trotksy's analyses.    \nREFS:  \n\n* [Lenin\u2019s place in history - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/01/22/clch-j22.html) \n* [\u201cSocialism in One Country\u201d and the Soviet economic debates of the 1920s - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2009/05/nbp1-m04.html)\n\nIf they weren't relying on historical-materialism, what idealist conceptions were they using instead? \n\n# #2\n\n>Lenin did not live to see the end of NEP (1927), and in the course of the threat of fascist aggression, the Soviet Union was forced to resort to centralist methods for building up heavy industry. \n\nThere was no fascist threat in 1927.  The end of the NEP was forced on the Stalinist bureaucracy because farmers began withholding grain from the cities since there were being offered no goods worth trading for.  \n\nREF: [A magnificent account of Stalin\u2019s opponents in the USSR - World Socialist Web Site](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/12/21/rogo-d21.html)\n\n# #3\n\n>The \"tactical retreat\" back to capitalism, as Lenin describes NEP, remains, in addition to its objective successes, a groundbreaking piece of Marxist theory (and practice) that prevented the near-economic collapse of the young USSR and gave the CPSU a sufficiently stable foundation to defend itself against Hitlerite fascism a few years later.\n\nI can find nothing on your website about the critical role the \"Third Period Line\" of Stalinism played in allowing Hitler to destroy the organisations of the Germany working class in 1933 without any opposition.  Mussolini established a fascist dictatorship in Italy in October 1926.  The danger posed by Hitler and the NSDAP was clear to anyone who cared to look. Yet the Stalinist KPD and the Comintern insisted the social democrats were \"social fascists\" (i.e. the SAME as fascists) and the main prop of capitalism.  Surely the critical question for Marxists is why Hitler got so far in the first place, why the Red Army leadership was decimated in the Great Terror, why the 1939 non-aggression pact was signed and its consequences and why the largest land invasion in history - 4 million soldiers - was a \"surprise\". \n\nFYI: You are probably aware of this but on 1 April 1933 the Comintern issued its first statement which praised the policies of the KPD \"before and at the time of the Hitler coup\" as \"quite correct\", and summoned the party \"to prepare the masses for decisive revolutionary battles, for the overthrow of capitalism and for the overthrow of the Fascist dictatorship by an armed rebellion and also claimed: \n\n>  \u201cThe establishment of an open Fascist dictatorship, which destroys all democratic illusions among the masses, and frees them from the influence of the social-democrats, will hasten Germany's progress towards the proletarian revolution.\u201d  \n  \np. 90 [Twilight of the Comintern, 1930-1935 (Carr,1982)\\_\\[Free Borrow at Open Library\\]](https://archive.org/details/twilightofcomint00carr)",
