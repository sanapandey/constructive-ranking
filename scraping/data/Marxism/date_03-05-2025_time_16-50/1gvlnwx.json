There are plenty of sources like books and even well put up youtube essays explaining the issue. By this post I would say that OP not only doesn't know well the other economic systems but his as well since \"promoting competition\" is not something inherently capitalist but rather a sign of free market. I would say it could be best for you to start with some political science and philosophy 101 books and then some youtube videos on topic and then if you still think you want more info to come back and discuss which system is better.",

A fair amount of economic activity is dedicated to rent-seeking behaviors that don't help anyone. We do a fair amount of profit-seeking research that only exists to extend the lifespan on some patents. Getting rid of that and focusing our energies where it matters could lead to booms in productivity.\n\nThe morality argument may or may not fall deaf on your ears. People have differing conceptions of what moral behavior looks like. But off the top of my head, I'd say it's no coincidence a lot of religions have determined that usury is icky. And if you stare deeply enough into its soul, I think you'll find usury is the heart of capitalism.",

            "body": "Capitalism is a system based on two opposing classes.\nThe class of the capital owners (buisnesses, real estate, means of production in general-the bourgeoisie) and the class of the wage labour (proletarians).\nProletarians do not own means of production. They are forced to sell their labour as it is the only thing they can sell. But the capitalist dicates the price of this labour. He will always pay you less than your labour is worth or he wouldnt make profit. If he pays you 10$ an hour you have to generate 20 or more.\nThis difference is the profit of the capitalist.\nThe capitalist gains wealth by owning while proletarians are forced to sell their labour to survive. With imperialism capitalism was able to create a labour aristocracy in the west. Workers who are able to get paid better than normal because of more exploitation in foreign countries.\nThis whole system is based on exploitation. Moreover the capitalists dictate our form of production and the basic ideology of our society. It is the dictatorship if the bourgeoisie. To truly gain freedom for all we need to create a classless society. Without private property (meaning no private person owns means of production).\nThe production is focused on fullfilling the needs of society instead of feeding the lust for growth, profit and surplass value of an owning class. With rise of productivity people could be freed of their work (less working hours) instead of just increasing profit and surpluss value for the bourgeois. Socialism is the only way to end exploitation and the only way for workers to free themselves from material constraints.",

I would, therefore, try to first understand the reasons why these systems were deemed necessary by the people in the first place and in their time and circumstances. My advise would thus be to delve deeper into the historical context in Europe in which these ideas came to see the light, and the philosophy and history behind them, as well as their protagonists.",

It's a measure of our need to see ourselves as better than others. I have a slight suspicion that being low in this trait will correlate with support for libertarian capitalism. It could also be lower trait cooperation (willingness to sacrifice your needs for others) or low agreeableness in general. Maybe trait sympathy, too.\n\nThat's not a condemnation. I don't condemn anyone for how they are born.\n\nThe answers for the communists will have similar origins. People like to think of themselves as rational creatures, but we're mostly just apes who tend to see whatever is in the interests of our ego as morally right. People motivated by goodness alone are as rare as saints.\n\nIf you want to find the answers to moral questions, develop inner peace. If you find yourself losing your temper, telling lies, lost in greed or lust, being wrathful to hurt someone... that would indicate you're probably going to fail at answering moral questions. And frankly, that describes most of us.",
