    "selftext": "I think I have come to the conclusion that without revolution in colonised states, revolution in imperial states will not occur, or at least until it is too late, due to climate change.\n\nThis isn't to say support for revolution in the global south should be selfish, but rather recognising the two way relationship necessary for revolutionary success. Without revolution in colonised states, the workers in imperial states will likely not face the material conditions necessary to provoke revolutionary consciousness. The exploitation by the imperial bourgeois state of the colonised is enough to keep their heads above the figurative water. \n\nAt the same time, without following revolution in the imperial states, the new revolutionary global south will be crushed and we have seen this time and again. These colonised states may now wield the industrial power in this century but they lack the economic power, up front, to sustain this. Let alone the trade networks without being forced to deal with other bourgeois states like Russia, who don't actually support revolution in these countries, they are just cynically using them to stick a finger up to the West.\n\nIf the global south revolutionises, it will be a very different position than in Marx's time whereby productive industry still occurred in the imperial states, which is virtually non existent today. Our industries are largely financial management and service industries which in and of themselves do not actually provide the means to live to their workers.\n\nI do not support putsches, intervention by westerners, nor do I believe workers can be made to have a revolution when they are not ready, this flies in the face of dialectical materialism. However I do think there must be something we can do to support workers in these colonised states doing what they know. Maybe funding independent printing presses for printing in the languages of the workers, rather than exporting material in the languages of former colonisers. Maybe something else. This would be about support, not westerners taking over the job with a white saviour complex.\n\nWhat can I or we do?",

I believe you are referring to the phenomenon of labor aristocracy\u2014the fact that workers within the imperial core occupy a different class identity within the empire compared to workers in the imperial periphery. This is because the conditions of the imperial core workers are directly improved by the exploitation of the periphery, meaning that the labor aristocracy and the peripheral proletariat are locked in a form of class antagonism.\n\nHowever, although this analysis may have been true in the past (and it may still be true in large part today), the situation is beginning to change. The capitalist empire is starting to run up against the limits of an infinitely growing system on a finite world. There are simple physical limits to how much the global south *can* be exploited. As capital seeks ever more growth, more of that imperialist mode of operation gets directed inward at the core. If they can\u2019t squeeze the periphery any harder, they\u2019ll start squeezing their own workers just as hard.\n\nThe imperial core is rapidly approaching a state of genuine crisis, where the material conditions soon won\u2019t look much different from the global south. The duty of socialists in the core is to agitate and prepare the working class here, so that we\u2019re organized and ready for resistance when the crisis reaches an inflection point. But we are woefully, terribly under-organized. By all means, foster solidarity among the international proletariat, but let\u2019s not pretend there\u2019s nothing we can do at home.",

My point is that this turn inwards back onto the working class in the global north may take too long without agitation and revolution in the global south, rather than we shouldn't agitate at home at all.",

Shit\u2019s getting *scary* here lol. But regardless, I think having some time before fascism rises is actually good for us. It gives us more time to organize in preparation for the crisis.\n\nObviously we should absolutely support revolutionary efforts in the global south. But in the core, we\u2019re very limited in what kind of support we can offer, mostly constrained to agitating against our own governments and corporations to disrupt (however minorly) their operations. This is essentially what student-led anti-israel protests are accomplishing\u2014exerting pressure on local authorities to withdraw funding from the genocidal war machine in Gaza. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s what we can do for now without much of a socialist power base. I feel the majority of our efforts have to be focused on our own region, simply because our capability to create impact grows weaker with distance.",

Even within the US or Europe we can build strong anti-monopoly coalitions (as we're seeing in France right now). We can win fundamental reforms that can completely alter the political scenario. We can't think that nothing can change unless we have a 1917 style revolution in the US.\n\nThe idea that things must get worse in the US for people to gain revolutionary consciousness is not true. In fact the opposite is true. Things need to get better. Only through struggle for better conditions can the working class gain class consciousness and only through socialists immersing themselves in those struggles can we pull them toward revolutionary consciousness. And only through winning reforms can we build the belief and momentum to actually advance the socialist cause.\n\nPeople's heads going under water is not what causes revolutions. In Pakistan, devastated by the recent floods and IMF austerity, you're seeing a rise in political repression and ethnic and religious violence. You're seeing 1.7 million Afghan refugees forcefully deported. Worsening conditions lead to fascism. Here and everywhere.\n\nWe need to make sure that if and when American imperialism collapses, that our economy doesn't collapse with it and feed the forces of reaction. We have to build enough power to be able to provide for the people without the need for super exploitation of the global south. And we need to have built enough international solidarity that workers in the US stand with workers across the world.\n\nSo that is our task here in the belly of the beast. Build working class power here. Build international solidarity. Build the peace movement.\n\nImagine if we were able to elect a President who was willing to reform the IMF or allow better terms for debtor nations. It would be a tremendous boon for the global south. But we can't do that without first blocking the far right and winning progressive reforms and building left power. Bernie Sanders was willing to do that. He also had a plan to pay reparations to countries affected by global warming. We are not that far away. We don't need to wait for revolution to see massive shifts.",

Firstly, look at all the examples of socialist revolution in history. Not a single one occurred for the reasons you mentioned. You think the people of Russia took power because the tsar improved society, or because he doubled down on his repression? Did China or Cuba revolt as a result of conditions improving, or worsening? People may feel galvanised by wins to keep going, but that first win is a product of being forced by their conditions.\n\nThe US is not the only country in the world, I specifically didn't mention the US for a reason.",

Russians won crucial political reforms under the Tsar particularly in 1905 with the creation of the Duma.\n\nSo when the crisis of capitalism/imperialism did hit with WW I, the working class was organized and ready to take power. They had the masses behind them rather than the provisional government setup in Feb 1917 which allowed the October revolution to happen. \n\nTake Bolivia for another example. Do you think things would be better for their movement toward socialism if the fascist coup had been successful? Would that repression and massacre of millions have led to a socialist revolution?\n\nLet me talk about the US again because that\u2019s where I live. McCarthyism killed the left and the labor movement. Neoliberalism crushed what was  left of them. Communists were arrested and killed and had to go underground. That did not lead to more radical politics but rather the opposite.\n\nWhat led to the only real social democratic reforms in US history under FDR? Years of communist organizing before and then during the depression. Standing up for black workers in court. Creating sharecroppers unions. Building the industrial labor movement with the CIO. Fighting for small reforms leads to big things.",

America has a shit tonne of resource extraction, heavy industry and agriculture, so does Australia or Canada in the form of raw resources, agriculture.
