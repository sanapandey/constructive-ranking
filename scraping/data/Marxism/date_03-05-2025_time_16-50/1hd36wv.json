    "selftext": "The idea that person needs another person to achieve self-recognition comes purely out of the needs of a person with NPD, who needs external validation to regulate himself emotionally.\n\nIn a healthy person recognition is acquired from the self, not from others, and therein the entire Hegelian system collapses. In the case of the bondsman, he is also self-alienated and needs to work for the \u201cmaster\u201d in order to recognize himself. \n\nBoth are mentally ill, needing external validation to satisfy their existential dread, rather than simply being in the world.\n\n",

No man is an isle and all that.   \n This is not just poetry, it's an ontological fact.  We are not complete beings unto ourselves as if others were only there to limit us. Living among equals is what makes us a complete and free being.",

If so do you think he is talking about individual people?\nHe is talking about groups that come into contact without some prior universal to mediate them and what occurs after.\n\nThink of colonists that come into contact with indigenous people like in Australia. There is no language or prior point of communicating or anything, and ksvery haphazard.\nEven when modern researchers try to do experiments with remote populations, they find that lacking any concept of psychological experiments and motive for them, they can only be convinced to engage in them by appealing so something that is already meaningful to those people and their culture. So there is a shared part in the project, otherwise an experiment is seen as impractical and a waste of time.\n\nhttps://www.ethicalpolitics.org/ablunden/pdfs/state-of-nature.pdf\n\u201cWhat confront each other in the master/slave dialectic are two corporate subjects (families, companies, clans, polois or nations) not two individuals. \n\nThe master/slave dialectic demonstrates how modern, secular society emerged from traditional communities, not by means of a peaceful agreement but rather through conquest and subsumption of one by the other. When two sovereign subjects confront one another in the absence of effective overarching legal institutions, then conquest and the subsumption of one subject by the other is the only alternative to mutual destruction or withdrawal into mutual indifference. Even the establishment of trade relations presupposes certain mutual recognition, which historically follows from the failure of attempts at conquest or from the expectation of such failure. \n\nThe genesis of modern society was Hegel\u2019s central concern. All previous actors in history, all previous forms of spirit, had been communities with their own spirit tied up with their own history and a form of life. How could a society come about, encompassing a multiplicity of forms of life, no longer governed by \u201cpositive\u201d relations of traditional law within a closed system of production relations, but on the contrary, governed by rational relations of religious tolerance and sustained by a highly developed division of labour? How could such a modern spirit emerge out of the existing plurality of mutually hostile peoples, nations, religious communities and social strata, each with different values and beliefs? When Hegel observes that a \u201cstate of nature\u201d exists in international relations16 , he self\u00adevidently does not mean that individuals interact with one another with moral indifference on an international plane. Obviously, he refers to the relations between states, the corporate entities which are the subjects of international law. And it is in precisely this spirit that his understanding of the emergence of spirit from a \u201cstate of nature\u201d has to be understood, relations of mutual indifference between subjects. 17\u201d",
