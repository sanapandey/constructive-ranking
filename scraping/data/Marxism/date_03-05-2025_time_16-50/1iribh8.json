    "selftext": "I'm looking for some perspectives on climate change. A few thoughts about it, to be specific - \n\n\\- To me it seems climate change is driven by industrialisation. The production of energy using fossil fuels, the heating up of the earth consequently, the destruction of forests and pastural lands, the toxification of rivers / ground water / ocean which disturbs the distribution of organisms across them. The only way to reverse this is to reverse industrialisation itself to a large extent, and undo the ways in which we have thought of development. A non-capitalist society that is still industrial would still drive human civilisation into destruction through climate change. \n\n\\- To me it seems until we learn to build a culture that is in harmony with nature, in the very simple act of going to work or building a house, one which takes into account the life of other beings - the trees, the squirrels, the animals around us, rather than build by clearing the land, scaring away all animals, and colonising that piece of the earth for humans, or certain kinds of humans - until then we will always be causing imbalances, of which climate change is the most stark form, and until then we will always suffer when nature tries to restore balance and destroy what we have built.

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Saito, who was given access to works by Marx which had not yet been published, finds that Marx actually did a lot of research related to ecology in the later years of his life (Marx was reading the latest scientific works on soil science, for example), and these new thoughts about ecology  and its relation to capitalism likely would have had an important place within a new edition of Volume 1 of *Capital* if Marx had lived longer.",

            "body": "It is important to remember that climate change is primarily driven by an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration due to the burning of fossil fuels. The importance of CO2 as a climate driver cannot be overstated. Industrialization does not directly equal climate change, the burning of fossil fuels does. \n\nI urge you to take a look at Jason Hickel and Dylan Sullivan's paper, \"[How much growth is required to achieve good lives for all? Insights from needs-based analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452292924000493).\"\n\nIn it, Hickel explains how decent living standards can be provided to the world population at only 30% of current resource and energy use.\n\nWe don't all need to embrace asceticism in order to save the planet. We can all have a decent quality of life with modern conveniences, we just need to fix the unequal distribution of goods and wealth (and maximize production efficiency and sustainability), as well as to abandon many unnecessary luxury commodities. Of course, this cannot happen under Capitalism, where the main priority is short-term profit seeking. It has to come from Socialism, where the people decide how and what goods are produced and how they are distributed, and where the people are allowed to plan for our future. \n\nIn the meantime, we will continue to see biodiversity loss, increasing catastrophic natural disasters, humanitarian issues stemming from climate migration/displacement, spiking heat injuries and deaths, etc. As a species, we have a while before the planet becomes vastly uninhabitable, it's just a matter of how much we want to destroy in the meantime. \n\nI think the best thing that we can do to combat climate change is to fight for Socialism, especially in the imperial core. Once workers have control, ecosocialists can try to steer economic planning policy toward rapid sustainability measures and strategic decommodification.",
