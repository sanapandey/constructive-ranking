    "selftext": "Comrades, I have an incomplete thought I'd like to float to the collective consciousness for consideration. The basic premise is this:\n\nThe owners of AI technology need to preserve intellectual property in order to profit, yet, at the same time, they cannot develop the technology without trampling on the norms of intellectual property. \n\nOn the one hand, they need access to vast materials to use as training data, for which they cant afford to pay. Many people who make their income from their intellectual property, such as self-employed artists, have already made much noise complaining about this. On the other hand, unionised labor, such as IATSE, have demanded a share in the intellectual property to which theyve contributed (whether residuals from streaming services or from the use of their digitized voice and appearance), which is certainly unbearable to the capitalists. One can also look at China's deepseek model as further evidence: only by accepting an open-source model were they able to outcompete OpenAI, for which I assume the software will be banned. In a word, AI is being born on the basis of intellectual property, but is rapidly coming into conflict with it.\n\nThis conflict naturally puts the tech monopolists into conflict with large sections of the bourgeoisie and parts of labor, which pushes the heads of these industries towards repression of bourgeois-democratic norms, hence their shifting alliance to Trump.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there something here?",

AI companies don't really care about IP, they're providing software as a service on expensive physical infrastructure.\n\n\nPro-IP and luddite sentiments are coming from petit bourgeois and proletarians, and they (somewhat understandably) appear as the righeous underdogs. I find that worrying because I don't see\u00a0either of those sentiments actually being helpful in the long run.",

If anything, it's tempting that AI will make it harder for rights holders to guard their IP, but its pretty naive to imagine we'll be the beneficiaries and not the tech giants.",

Rather, we are seeing a counter-effort to expand the definition of *use of intellectual property* by those who worry about losing their market share.  \n  \nAI is being attacked by the creative and information sectors/trade associations/licensing firms/petty bourgeois creators/labor aristocrats/etc., who worry about being displaced by new technology. Historically, use meant distributing or borrowing other's intellectual property. They want it to now include the type of learning done by LLMs, media production apps, etc.  \n  \nThis situation definitely means a conflict among segments of the bourgeoisie, but this is explained by routine competition between capitalists as well as conflict between new productive forces and aging production relations.  \n  \nIt's all going to get settled by industry lawyers and licensing agreements, not Trump or the suspension of democracy.  \n  \nSo I think Meta and co. cozying up with Trump needs to be explained from elsewhere.",

I think they see a bit of fascism as a disruption opportunity to reshape class expectations and class dynamics and recover profit rates and more fluid investment t capital on our backs and by privatizing as much as possible.",

It had always operated as SaaS and so was profiting off infrastructure.\n\nChatGPT was written using open source machine learning libraries and was protected far more by industry secrets than by copyright.\n\nDeepSeek is not notable just because it's open source but because it runs on much smaller computers undercutting the infrastructure aspect.\n\nAll of this is just to say that the incentive for bougois to undercut each other by leveraging technology to reduce scale is normal. It's not a whole bunch different to the home vacuum cleaner going from a truck driving door to door, to an appliance. (Side note: I would be surprised if we don't see DeepSeek being comodified quickly)\n\nAs of right now, and our current fascination with chatbots, AI hasn't changed the nature of labor relations really. AI remains ineffective at displacing actual proletarian jobs and may be encouraging more organisation instead.\n\nThe tech monopolists are - for the time being - still bougois and still subject to the same internal conflict as the rest. What we're seeing is quite in keeping with Marx's ideas of power consolidation for the bougois class.\n\nThe move to Trump is somewhat inconsequential too. The democrats and republicans are both parts of the bougois state, what we're seeing is the state being used by the bougoisie to disrupt the proletariat.\n\nTL;DR: The bougois fight each other and exploit the workers for profit. If the fight _de jour_ is AI and the weapons are the selective application of intellectual property that's just what they do",

                    "body": "Thank you for the input, the first part about AI not relying on IP was particularly helpful in clarifying the situation. I do want to push back on two points, however. The first is that while I see your point about creative destruction in the market, normally this process doesn't involve a threat to a category of property the way it seems AI will have and is having for IP. I'm also not convinced that \"the move to Trump is ... inconsequential.\" I wouldn't take it for granted that a man like Sam Altman, who has stated he believes \"the whole structure of society, itself, will be up for some degree of debate and reconfiguration\" and who just recently quoted Napolean (how on the nose!), has re-aligned himself with a political movement specifically making encroachments against the division of powers.",

When I called these things business as usual and inconsequential I **did not** mean to imply they aren't destructive.\n\nIntellectual property isn't under threat so much as it's being expropriated. We'll still have art and literature, it just won't be profitable small scale. This is similar to how industrial textiles mills made home spinning wheels obsolete.\n\n Marx observed that it was the nature of capitalists to consolidate power at the material expense of the workers. These moves to make the rich richer and the workers less empowered isn't some terrifying new development but an inevitable part of a continuous chain since capitalism began that only stops when the proletariat has a successful revolution.\n\nIt's interesting in its mechanism, capitalist do have to innovate to maximise exploitation, but the outcome seems pretty expected.",

On hugginface you have a couple of llm models.\n\nThe more interesting conflict is another: if AI takes over a job, there is no labour involved. If no labour is involved, there is no surplus. If there is no surplus, the only source of profit is undercutting your competitors. \n\nThis is the social conflict, AI brings: the end of surplus value.",
