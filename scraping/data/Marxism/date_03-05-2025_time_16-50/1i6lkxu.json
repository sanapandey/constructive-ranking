The theory of Natural Selection has never been healthier, and evolution is now understood as a fundamental process in the development of all kinds of phenomena. Freudianism has become a small corner of die-hards in psychology. It's strongest legacy is the notion of the unconscious and , perhaps, it's develoment of the idea of the narcissistic personality, \n\nMarxism as a source for deeper understanding of our times and politics is in a lot better shape than Freudianism. Perhaps the most enduring element of Marxism is its fundamental insight into the links between mode of  economic production and the culture and society that rises from it, an idea that has enriched understanding of history, society, and politics.  And the idea of \"class struggle\" as a driver of history looks very solid.  It clears away a lot of mystifying fog around politics of our own time-  as looking at the gaggle of billionaires at the center will confirm. The trend toward \"populist\"  reaction against growing class inequality confirms this.",

There is no such science in any domain which can predict the future.\n\n\n> Marx\u2019s theories were not drawn up in a way that allows them to be experimentally verified.

But the USSR (before Kruschev), China and Vietnam both pose great examples of applying Marx\u2019s materialist dialectics for the greater good of humanity within their areas of influence.\n\n> The gap between Msrx\u2019s predictions and reality opened up even before Marx\u2019s death.

Marxism is neither a predictive system nor a yardstick of historical development. It is an analytical method for uncovering real societal economic and political conditions for the purpose of improving them, adapting strategy and practice in order to measure success and failure, maintaining constant focus on material conditions of social reproduction as they are what determine the degrees of improvement that are immediately or not-so-immediately viable through conscious intervention.",

And- he seems to have thought it might be coming soon.

The capitalists were not devouring each other, or-  their numbers were rising. Not shrinking. \nThe conditions of the working class were not getting ever worse, though they were ghastly by any decent standard. Working conditions were probably at their worst in about 1850, when Marx wrote Capital. \nBy the late 1800's - slow improvement. Workers were forming unions and socialist political parties. And in some countries they were winning seats in parliament! Hence, Engles and Bernstein develop \"revisionist socialism\", proposing 2 possible routes to the socialist future.  Revolution, as Marx has predicted, or  an \"evolution\"-  very current and scientific term at the time- toward democratic socialism through unions and the ballot box.\n\nSo-  when you start Talkin' Marxism-  ya gotta lay out which kind.",

It's actually a line from \"The Internationale\" , when written it was a LaSallean (humanist socialism) not a Marxist, anthem.

It's kind of like what SNL,  yr. 1 said about Franco- \"Generalissimo Franco is still dead.\"  Despite countless,  somewhat disgusting attempts to prolong it's life (pipe up the butt  to drain off flatulence) capitalism lives, as a sort of Zombie.  No one quite knows what sort of slugs will get it- out of the air, where it's stinking things up, and into the ground so we can have a proper (non-religious) burial.\n\nEncouraging signs- the proletariat, which now includes the Underclass \"precariat\", is growing by leaps and bounds.    The elite parties together by night and knives each other in the back by day.  AI, AGI, and ASI look ready to create unheard of levels of unemployment of every class-  possibly including  the Near Trillionaire class.

I'll try to summarize it as best as I can but take it with a grain of salt because I'm no expert and simplifications may not convey the nuance accurately.\n\nIn short, Marxism is a political and socioeconomic philosophy pioneered by German philosopher, Karl Marx. Marx's work primarily focused on analyzing the progress of human society and class relationships (relationship between people of different classes). \n\nMarx basically identified several key patterns of development that lead to changes in how societies are organized. The main premise is that society exists primarily as a way for humans to organize production systems, the process by which goods/services required for survival are produced.\n\nTherefore, as production technology and material conditions change, society is forced to change in response. This change is driven by class conflict which is the conflict that exists between people with different relationship to production. For example, in capitalism, the conflict is mainly between the working class and the owner class (those who sell their labour for survival and those who own the means/resources required for production).",

            "body": "So a friend asked me this question years ago, and I'll copy what I wrote for her. The biggest caveat is that I didn't realize the thesis-antithesis-synthesis model for understanding dialectics originated with Fichte, not Hegel. I maintain it's a useful oversimplification for introducing the concept, but it's not a model Marx really used overtly. With that noted, here's a text I sent in 2022: \n\n>Whoo boy, that's a tall ask. Marx was a prolific writer who covered economics, philosophy, history, then-current events, sociology (which he basically invented), and politics. And I'm certainly not the most qualified person to give an intro. But let's start with a quote from The Communist Manifesto: \n\n>\"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\n\n>Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\"\n\n>This is where Marx deviated from German Idealists like Hegel, one of his key influences, whom I understand even less than I understand Marx. One of Hegel's key contribution to philosophy was dialectics: basically a mode of reasoning where an idea, or thesis, is presented, an opposing idea, or antithesis, negates that thesis, and there is a struggle of ideas until thesis and antithesis are reconciled in synthesis, which then becomes a new thesis to be negated. And Marx took that and flipped it on its head. Ideas aren't the driving force behind history, he reckoned, but the material relations between different classes of people and the struggle to resolve the contradictions of interests these create. Ideas emerge from material conditions, not vice versa, but when we analyze these conditions, we can see a process similar to the one Hegel identified playing out. This is called dialectical materialism. \n\n>So applying this analytical framework primarily to Western Europe, Marx came to a few key conclusions: One was that class society was polarizing into two great camps: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Hereditary aristocrats were being rendered irrelevant, slavery was being abolished, peasants and artisans were being proletarianized, professionals were being assimilated into one class or another. Everything was coming down to a minority who owned wealth and power and the means of production, and the majority who had to sell their labor to survive, and on whose labor the bourgeoisie depended to maintain their wealth and power. Recognizing this trend, he saw one way this could be permanently resolved: by the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the establishment of a classless society, where the majority would truly rule, socialism. That's the jist of his contribution, although it's much bigger than that. But a lot of people took his ideas and ran with them in different directions. \n\n\n>Revisionist Marxists like Eduard Bernstein said, okay, the idea of a classless society sounds great, but the whole revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie, that sounds like a needlessly violent process, especially when countries like Germany and Britain were moving towards universal manhood suffrage. So Revisionist Marxist thinking goes, let's organize the majority to gain power within the system as it exists and gradually transform it from within. This became the dominant current of thought within the Social Democratic Party of Germany, or SPD, the largest and best-organized socialist party in the world by the early 20th century.\n\n>Then in Russia, Lenin and Trotsky and the rest of the Bolsheviks heard what the Revisionists were saying and said, well that's fucking stupid. Organizing the working class to vote in elections is all well and good, but you can't actually transform society that way. The state is a product of the ruling class, and will ultimately always serve the interests of that class, no matter who's elected to administer it. So instead of focusing on getting the broad majority of workers to vote in elections, you need to identify and organize the most politically conscious workers to become a revolutionary vanguard who can establish an entirely new political order.\n\n>Then in the upheaval at the end of World War I, both groups got the opportunity to put their ideas into practice, and both fell short of actually establishing a classless society. I'd say the failing was ultimately similar in both situations: the leadership of the party became a distinct class with interests that diverged from those of the working class as a whole. The SPD leadership was too invested in existing political structures that gave them power to really challenge those structures, while the Bolsheviks, excluded from power until they seized it by force, ultimately constituted a new ruling class of Russia that identified with the proletariat but had distinct interests which they pursued at the proletariat's expense. It's pretty tragic, but fascinating, and I think all we can do is learn all we can from these examples and keep trying, because the status quo is intolerable. Mao and Gramsci and Luxemburg had some interesting ideas that are worth contemplating, but I'll spare you any more text for now. Does that all make sense so far? Any questions? I love talking about this sort of thing.",

I mean they didn't hit you, but in a way, they're hurting you because your little fingers are tires from all the Legos you're putting together, and one day you won't be able to anymore, and they'll expell you anyway, so are you the violent one?

The other major class is the proletariat who do not own any means of production and make their living by engaging in wage labor contracts with the bourgeoisie.
