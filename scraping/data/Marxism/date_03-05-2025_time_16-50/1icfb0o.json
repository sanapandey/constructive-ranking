    "selftext": "India has three major Marxist parties:\n\n-Communist Party of India (CPI) \n\n-Marxist Party Of India (CPIM)\n\n-Marxist Leninist Party of India (CPIML)\n\nThe CPI is the oldest of the three parties but the Marxist Party can take pride in the fact that they are the most popular. The Marxist Party split from the CPI in 1964 due to a differ in ideology, and since then has managed to win and hold six seats in the Lok Sabha, which is more than either of the other two parties; holding two seats each. \n\nThe CPIM split from the CPI after the Sino-Indian war because the CPIM was in opposition to the CPI's pro-revisionist stance. When Stalin died, Khrushchev took over and passed reviosnist policies in the USSR; allowing capitalism and anti-Stalinist policies in certain ways in the Soviet Union. Around the time of the Sino Indian War, the relationship between Mao's China and the now revisionist USSR was falling apart because Mao didn't support Khrushchev. This debate between revisionism and anti reviosnism was already a cause of unrest within the CPI, but the Sino Indian War saw some of the anti revisionists in the CPI supporting China in the war and not India. Thus in 1964, the anti revisionist faction of the CPI split into what is now the CPIM. \n\nThe same exact thing that occured within the CPI also did in the CPIM during the 1969. Radicals within the CPIM were concerned that the CPIM was becoming revisionist, which is why they split in two, with the more radical faction becoming the brand new CPIML. However, the CPIML ended up collapsing in the 70s and splitting in two, with the modern day CPIML keeping the same name. \n\n\nThe three parties currently exist and do have seats in the Lok Sabha. As mentioned previously, the CPIM is the most popular and posseses six seats and a status as a national party. The CPIM in recent years has advocateed more for democratic socialism but still supports the principles of communism and Marxism Leninism. The CPIML has had more vocality towards being anti revisionist and Maoist. \n\nWhich party would you support and what is the general opinion by Marxists of these parties?",

            "body": "they're all casteist reactionaries that failed to adapt Marxism to India specific conditions. Even DMK is more Marxist than CPI which is to be very honest a joke party\n\nCPI -> Casteist reactionaries\n\nCPIM -> Bourgeois Casteist reactionaries\n\nCPI maoist ->Mao's People's war strategy worked specifically because of certain historical events allowing to do so, thus Mazumdar's strategy was orthodox and juvenile. IDC, Naxalbari was and still is a stupid idea that very obviously failed.\n\nI'll be very real with you, the Indian Marxists have been completed jokers who have a schoolboy's understanding of Marxism and its derivatives (unless they've been captured by vested interests which make a lot of sense).\n\nI like Teltumbde, Chattopadhyay, Pannalal dasgupta and obviously Kosambi. Namboodiripad is kind of a fence for me but ig at least he was willing to reject his roots as a member of Kerala's highest caste. Still doesn't excuse them for their poverty of thought.\n\nMarxism in India has been a joke movement and we don't have a minh/Hoxha/Mao/Lenin equivalent who can adapt to India specific conditions (specifically the mammoth of caste). If Ambedkar completed \"india and communism\" and wasn't a liberal we would have had a fighting chance but alas.\n\nNevertheless I think India is a very strong contender for communism considering how much Marx wrote on the country. He even said many Indian villages had a form of proto-communism in the Grundrisse.\n\nI will support a party that:\n\n1. Has a realistic pragmatic strategy \n2. Has a grounded sense of India specific conditions\n3. Isn't run by Savarna elites",

But one word of advice: the reason why the CCP is the only real successful and most advanced communist party in the world is because of Mao's very early roots in Anarchism, allowing him to integrate praxis into his theory. Reading is good but make sure you are moving and practising.",
