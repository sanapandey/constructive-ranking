Are you talking about capitalist society? Are you talking about a hypothetical communist society? Who is \"we?\".  Be specific on the premises of your example that go unmentioned.\n\nIn capitalist relations there is no labour exploitation in the Marxist framework if you make a machine entirely on your own volition under conditions that you control and still maintain control over the machine as it has been finished. Whether you are entitled to enumeration is entirely up to yourself, you can decide to hand it over freely or demand a price for it. If then you decide to hand the machine over to someone else who uses it to make a profit, there is no labour exploitation in the Marxist sense. Exploitation in the Marxist view happens at the level of the production process.\n\nIf you make a machine as part of your job, contracted by a capitalist, there is no question of handing it over to another worker. The capitalist owns the product of your labour and then decides how to dispose of it and pockets the profit.\n\nIf you're talking about communist relations there are a variety of possibilities. But if you and your fellow workers produce a machine under conditions that you control and  remain control over the end product, it could potentially be a matter of democratic deliberation with your fellow workers, or it could be that according to a planned economy you still have to direct your product to someone  else or some other enterprise, but that the system of the planned economy ensures you are somehow equally renumerated for the labour that went into your product.",

                            "body": "I understand you are trying to do a hypothetical but to Marxist accounts of exploitation it very much matters under what system the production and distribution of that machine would take place. There is no universal, transhistorical answer to this question to Marxists. In general, Marxism is not concerned with moral questions, and your question strikes me as a question that can only be answered in those terms if no historical comparisons are to be made.\n\nMarxism generally sticks to an analytic viewpoint of exploitation, one that can either be in line or contrast with intuitive, sensory experiences exploitation as exploitation is commonly understood. As others have also indicated, exploitation entails that a worker has no control over the production proces and has a part of their labour product expropriated by the capitalist. For Marxists, exploitation happens at the point of production. When I make a machine and I am free to do with the end result as I desire, I am not being exploited in the Marxist sense. It's as simple as that. It could be that you sell, rent or grant the machine to  another worker, but whatever that worker does with it is not  really of importance to Marxist accounts of exploitation. If you sell that machine without a profit because you assume the worker will not use it for commercial gain, then even if he does you are not exploited in the Marxist sense even though you may feel cheated. Marxism isn't really concerned whether a particular transiction is deemed morally legitimate. Moreover, if that worker does so for commercial gain, he isn't just a worker any more. He is a worker in relation to a capitalist, but if he employs others in his own commercial enterprise that makes him a capitalist too. It's one of the issues with your question when you talk of a \"worker\", worker is not an absolute property but a relationship.\n\nOf course, the wage-capital relationship is commonly not *perceived* as exploitative. Why? Because we are convinced that we are paid what our labour power is worth, as measured by the markets under which we freely sign a labour contract and the profits do not come from labour but from a whole bunch of other stuff. Precisely in his economic works, Marx aims to show how that other stuff is simply ideological distortion. The whole point of the capitalist superstructure is to make the labour process appear less nakedly exploitative compared to a peasant who is threatened by a guy with a sword to hand over part of his harvest.\n\n[This](https://jacobin.com/2022/06/karl-marx-labor-theory-of-value-ga-cohen-economics) is an article on Marxist views on exploitation including viewpoints that don't rely on the technical details of any labour theory of value.",

            "body": "For Marx, exploitation (in the sense of value) is not a moral judgment. It's an analytic tool for understanding capitalism. Marx does have moral problems with capitalism but those are not involved in his ideas on value and exploitation. \n\nIn feudal times, exploitation was more open. A serf farmed crops and the local lord would collect a certain percentage of the crop (or other times, require the serf to work a certain number of days on the lord's land). The lord and serf would fight over the surplus product and how much should go to the lord and how much the serf should keep. \n\nIn capitalism, a person gets a job (usually for a wage) and then goes to work creating or helping create commodities. Those commodities are then sold for a profit. That profit, the money left over after all the costs of production are paid for, is what the worker and the capitalist (or a representative of the capitalist firm) fight over. How much ought to go to the worker and how much ought to go to the capitalist? \n\nA common misinterpretation of Marx is that his value theory is about how not enough of this surplus value goes to the worker and the worker deserves more or deserves to in some way control or direct this surplus. Marx makes clear in Capital that isn't what he's getting at:\n\n\"The fact that this particular commodity, labour-power, possesses the peculiar use value of supplying labour, and therefore of creating value, cannot affect the general law of commodity production. If, therefore, the magnitude of value advanced in wages is not merely found again in the product, but is found there augmented by a surplus-value, this is not because the seller has been defrauded, for he has really received the value of his commodity; it is due solely to the fact that this commodity has been used up by the buyer.\"\n\nNow let's answer your question more directly. How would Marx want the means of production renumerated? He wouldn't. Marx describes communism as such:\n\n\"in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.\"\n\nSociety is collectively planned to maximize people's free time, rather than being concerned about anyone getting what they \"deserve\" or \"earn\". Each person gives what they are able to and each person gets what they need to self-actualize. From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.",

However, the moral and philosophical justification for private property still makes sense regardless; we have to take account of it.

Marx was mainly concerned with critical analysis of capitalist political economy (though his framework is universally applicable to any society engaged in any kind of economic activity). In capitalist economy, the vast majority of machines (or generally, means of production) aren't owned by the people who make them. They're made by workers who are in employment of companies, whose profits are reaped by capitalist owners. The sale or lending of machines is the moment of actualization of labor to capital, mainly money or credit. Of that capital, the capitalist owner and the worker are in contradictory interest over who receives how much of the earnings. The generated earnings are split into the workers pay, other expenses relevant to keeping operations going, and profit for the owner (what Marx called the surplus value). The ratio of the split is a result of the struggle between worker and capitalist, and where the margin of exploitative appropriation of surplus is negotiated. This \"extraction\" of surplus value is the element of exploitation in this example.\n\nEdit: To extend with your example, machines (means of production) are generally not purchased by individual workers, but again, by capitalist owners of companies who employ workers whose labor forms the basis of income. Same dynamics apply.\n\nIf you want your example to be taken literally, one machine maker and one worker who uses the machine to produce commodities, there is no capitalist surplus extraction in a case of direct trade (maker sells machine to worker). Though it might be more profitable for both parties to form a cooperative business, with distribution of earnings based on the amount of labor invested by each person. If the maker however employs the worker and extracts surplus, there is your exploitation.",

An exploitation-free transaction would mean no capitalist engagement. Worker to worker. Like in your example, machine maker to machine operator. Both are members of the working class.\n\nThe labor capitalists are engaged in is mostly not of \"societal usefulness\".

A capitalist that buys machines or other means of production to hire workers to produce commodities is reaping the benefits without investing their own labor. If, as you say, a worker does this, they become part of the capitalist class.\n\nIn collective economy, the workers making machines are equally rewarded as the workers operating the machines, namely by the amount of invested labor.\n\n>I am convinced that the issue of bargaining power is a key factor in creating exploitation.\n\nBargaining power is a euphemism for extortion. If the means of production are in collective property, their usage is determined by social demand, not projected profits. If the profit motive is the primary incentive, artificial shortages, lack of access to existential commodities for the \"bottom\" of the socioeconomic hierarchy, ecological destruction, even war, famine and the spread of treatable disease all become relatively acceptable side effects of economic activity.",

In Marxist terms, dead labor provider to live labor provider.\n\n>Bargaining power is a euphemism for extortion.\u00a0\n\nIt is not a euphemism but an analytical tool to understand extortion. What is extortion to you? For me it is a transaction whose terms are based on a significant difference in bargaining power. It is hard to draw the line exactly, but we can agree through examples. If you and I are workers partaking in a transaction, the degree of difference between the preferences/needs of each of us dictates the terms of the bargain, and thus whether there is extortion or not.\n\nOn a related point, one way to think of \"societal usefulness\" is in satisfying needs and preferences of people. The market is a mechanism to do so. The logic is the following. You produce something demanded by a considerable amount of people; that is something with societal usefulness. You get rewarded with additional claims on societal production. You are incentivized to continue this process. Several issues arise with shortcomings of the market mechanism, concerning externalities. But another problem more relevant to our conversation is that the more you produce wanted products on the market, the larger your claims on societal wealth. At some point, you claims drown out the preferences and needs of other consumers. Which then requires us to de-commodify certain products and regulate power differentials between participants. What is the alternative you have for signaling what to produce and how much to produce?",

If you produce something and exchange it, it's your own labor you reap the benefits of.\n\nRegardless, you wanted to know where exploitation begins, I think I answered this adequately.\n\n>The market is a mechanism to do so.\n\nWhich leads to aforementioned problems, and in a more encompassing sense, contradictory class interest, which is the core element of Marxist (materialist) dialectics. You should familiarize yourself with the basics, Das Kapital is required for a fundamental understanding.\n\nOur discussion runs the risk of conflating two different points; 1) to understand the exploitative element in capitalism and when it does or doesn't occur, and 2) how to solve it with collective economy. I've used your example specifically to address the first point, but you seem to steer the discussion more towards the second, which is fine in principle, but not really something we can easily exhaust in a brief exchange of reddit comments.\n\n>What is the alternative you have for signaling what to produce and how much to produce?\n\nThe alternative is collective ownership and planned economy. Contrary to capitalist polemics, planned economies are already [very much a reality in the organization of multinational, quasi-monopolist corporations](https://www.versobooks.com/products/636-the-people-s-republic-of-walmart).  \nSalvador Allende made an early attempt at utilizing information technology for economic planning with his \"Project Cybersyn\", it's an interesting rabbit hole.",

I think there is still some disagreement concerning the first point but maybe I'm not able to verbalize my disagreement well. Beyond that, for the second point, I have heard of Project Cybersyn but haven't gone well into its functioning. Thanks for the recommendation!",
