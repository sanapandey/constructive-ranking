    "selftext": "I have pondered this takeaway many times and I really don't see people discussing this moral to the story per say. \nIt really stems from some of Marxs later writings about Democracy and Socialism.\n\nIn short my thought are in Orwells Animal Farm. Everything sort of goes south after the Pigs are chosen to be the leaders. Republics sort of work the same way. When we think we are Democratically giving a representative our power to rule. \n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union put it's government into a Republic, which was abused slightly by Lenin and greatly by Stalin.\nWould Communism, or any form of government, for that matter, be better off under a Direct Democracy, rather than relinquishing power to an Aristocratic representative? I get the whole masses would vote themselves a circus bit, but would the public vote together to starve itself or cut off their own head? Because I am sure there are a few politicians out there that would gladly have you die for a few extra dollars.\n\nAnyway my take away is the moral of Animal Farm is no matter how great of governing ideology you have, if you turn that power over to a republic, they are going to stab you in the back with that power. Therefore a republic is not a true democracy. ",

Additionally, animal farm not only completely disregards the material conditions of the Soviet Union (no matter which Marxist framework you use, Trotskyist Maoist or any other kind of Marxist), it is also completely ignorant to the history of Marxist figures through the characteristics of the pigs. Dog shit book and Orwell brain rot.",

One can say he definitely took enough characteristics from Russian leadership for the personalities of his characters. He was using Russia because it was the best example at that time of the proletariat rising up to grab power and build a better government and society for itself. Only to turn it over to a dictatorship of a republic,  and not of the proletariat. \n\nYour comment reminds me of that of a Libertarian that thinks they are edgy and smart. So much so that they don't even take the time to realize the nuance of a writers intentions and criticize things that they don't want to understand.  The moral of the book is not communism bad. It is more about the struggle of the people giving too much trust to the Aristocratic class.",

Orwell was a paid snitch on behalf of the British government and made a list of suspected communists. He called Paul Robeson 'anti-white', and labelled Charlie Chaplin a 'suspected Jew'. Look up Orwell's list. \n\n  \nNo matter what you think about the USSR, Orwell is the last person to take information from about it.",

Did you know that as an English man, he fought for the republic in the Spanish War against fascism? He actually risked his life for the cause.\nDon't get it twisted? Did you know that his dislike for Stalin came from the Spanish War in which a much stronger and educated communist government and economy could have flourished. But Stalin refused to help the republic,  while Hitler and Mussulini supplied Franco and the Nationalists with all the weapons they needed. Even though early on it was looking like it would be a victory for the socialist republican.\nOrwell felt betrayed by Stalin, and so did many others. \nI am guessing Stalin is like Trump to some of you here. You refuse to criticize, even though it is deserved. Blind Faith is still Blind.",

They want you to believe their death statistics from 4 wars, droughts, famine, and disease over the course of several decades is directly related to communism. Most of their  claims are unfounded and have little gray value. That said there is no doubt that Stalin was a dictator, he practiced very little democracy, and did some atrocious things. I believe it unfortunate, because sadly it gives the right fuel to bash communism rather than have a discussion. Which in turn feeds them right into the hands of the Aristocrats. I also believe Orwell didn't like what Stalin did with his opportunity to a movement he was strongly behind, but I don't think he wrote the book to bash Stalin. He would have just named names if that was the case.",
