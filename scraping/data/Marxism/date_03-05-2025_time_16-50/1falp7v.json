Hell, Hegel didn't even use the very popular thesis-antithesis-synthesis explanation. He thought it reduced dynamic contexts into formulas, which we can sort of see in some fundamental ideas of Marx and Engels' (and their ideological successors). \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's still worth understanding Marx and Engels' interpretations of it, but it helps to inform the reader of more context about how their theory works and justifies itself.",

It's how we understand things like the class struggle and class consciousness and when it is strong and when it is weak.\n\nEdit: And of course history, economics, and politics. Marx said capitalism played an historically progressive role. If you don't find dialectics necessary then you could, in an extreme case, come to believe that capitalism is *always* progressive. The fact it was progressive but is no more requires dialectics to understand and explain why that is the case.",
