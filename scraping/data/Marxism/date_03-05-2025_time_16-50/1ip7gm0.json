They are logic / thinking machines.\n\nIt\u2019s also a very real threat to knowledge workers.\n\nThe development of Capitalism in Marx\u2019s time saw the enclosure of agriculture which ended a millennia\u2019s of tradition where humanity lived a mostly pastoral existence. It instituted wage work / wage slavery as the most common way of earning a living. The invention of Greenwich time and clocks as tracking work hours became essential for logistics and production. The clock and the factory regimented modern life. Luddites tried to smash factories.\n\nThe elimination or reduction of jobs such as weavers, the rural labourer, the lamp lighter, the saddle maker, cobbler.\n\nFor our century, social democracy can mitigate the effects of mass unemployment.\n\nAccording to Marxist analysis what could happen? Another revolution? The \"perfect\" planned economy ruled by an AI?\n\nWill the profit drop and AI products become ubiquitous \n\n",

            "body": ">Luddites tried to smash factories. The elimination or reduction of jobs such as weavers, the rural labourer, the lamp lighter, the saddle maker, cobbler.\n\nMarx wrote about all this at the time, in Capital Vol 1 Ch 15:\n\n\"The enormous destruction of machinery that occurred in the English manufacturing districts during the first 15 years of this century, chiefly caused by the employment of the power-loom, and known as the Luddite movement, gave the anti-Jacobin governments of a Sidmouth, a Castlereagh, and the like, a pretext for the most reactionary and forcible measures. It took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of production, but against the mode in which they are used.\"\n\nAnd then in Capital Vol 3 Ch 15 we get this:\n\n\"A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers, i.e., enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development.\"\n\nThe development of automation - in whatever shape or form - has always been considered inevitable in Marxist analysis. This is regardless of what individual capitalists want:\n\n\"No capitalist ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be, and how much it may increase the rate of surplus-value, so long as it reduces the rate of profit. Yet every such new method of production cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells them originally above their prices of production, or, perhaps, above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the market-prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs of production. He can do this, because the average labour-time required socially for the production of these latter commodities is higher than the labour-time required for the new methods of production. His method of production stands above the social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general law. There follows a fall in the rate of profit \u2014 perhaps first in this sphere of production, and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest \u2014 which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the capitalist.\"\n\nIn short, capitalists HAVE to adopt automation BECAUSE it is cheaper. Being cheaper means that the products can be sold more cheaply, and thus can out-compete other capitalists who do not automate. So, whether they want to or not, capitalists will HAVE to automate, and the automation they enact will cause mass unemployment and discord. This is the Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall and its role in the collapse of capitalism.",

And the idea of following trends and buying things just to keep up appearances is as old as civilization itself.\n\nAnd here's Marx writing about the concept in \"Wage Labour and Capital\" (1847):\n\n\"A house may be large or small; as long as the neighboring houses are likewise small, it satisfies all social requirement for a residence. But let there arise next to the little house a palace, and the little house shrinks to a hut. The little house now makes it clear that its inmate has no social position at all to maintain, or but a very insignificant one; and however high it may shoot up in the course of civilization, if the neighboring palace rises in equal or even in greater measure, the occupant of the relatively little house will always find himself more uncomfortable, more dissatisfied, more cramped within his four walls.\"\n\n>The largest corporations currently have this whole thing as their business model: gathering data to determine what to sell to people.\n\n\"Production not only supplies a material for the need, but it also supplies a need for the material. As soon as consumption emerges from its initial state of natural crudity and immediacy \u2013 and, if it remained at that stage, this would be because production itself had been arrested there \u2013 it becomes itself mediated as a drive by the object. The need which consumption feels for the object is created by the perception of it. The object of art \u2013 like every other product \u2013 creates a public which is sensitive to art and enjoys beauty. Production thus not only creates an object for the subject, but also a subject for the object.\" - Grundrisse, Ch 1",

AI uptake is still slow as it's mostly a solution in search of a problem at this point, like most past tech hype cycles such as \"the cloud,\" the Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Metaverse, quantum computing, etc. All of these technologies were going to transform everything and didn't and LLMs still need more practical use cases, a lower degree of risk and some technical refinements before they even find their basic market stability. In many ways, this is yet another gambit to artificially maintain the GPU market which has been in a bubble for the past few years that many companies and investors have wound their way into. \n\nWhile LLMs likely will lead to loss of work, this won't be because of the technologies themselves, but because of the social relations that value machine insights over human ones. These are typically from parts of our life that rely on speed of information over accuracy or that rely on hyper-particularization of tasks, both of which are already significant features of capitalism. So it's not that what they're calling AI will itself alter our industrial and social structures, it's that it will create new contradictions in societies built on human work for hire and the class system it enables. The greater challenge is more people will believe in the technologically determinist argument and use AI to justify any number of social eugenics programs. The present corporate techno-fascist incarnation is disposed to do just that, but it's not inevitable. We can stop them.",

The Soviets used Lysenkoism (and the CCP followed them) because they believed, incorrectly, that it would increase agricultural output. And it lined up with their ideological values about genetics, which is why it was promoted. In doing so, they censored and suppressed evidence that said Lysenkoism doesn't work. If you're worried about an AI making shit up and the resulting failure of production that accompanies it, then shouldn't you also include the fact that humans have cheerfully done the same thing? Human reasoning can be wrong too, should we stop using it?",

Yet every such new method of production cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells them originally above their prices of production, or, perhaps, above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the market-prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs of production. He can do this, because the average labour-time required socially for the production of these latter commodities is higher than the labour-time required for the new methods of production. His method of production stands above the social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general law. There follows a fall in the rate of profit \u2014 perhaps first in this sphere of production, and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest \u2014 **which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the capitalist.**\" - Capital, Vol 3, Ch 15\n\nIn short: technology has to advance whether the capitalists want it to or not, because cutting costs gives you a competitive advantage. If you don't, someone else will, and they'll beat you. Tech right now is struggling to find human needs to meet (and mostly just monetizing the needs it's already met) but there's a reason it's developing so much and it's because it has to.\n\n>it's about Musk being a complete imbecile compared to the bourgeoisie in the period when capitalism was still progressive\n\nMusk is an imbecile, but the companies he own seem to work because he hires decent engineers (and then keeps getting in their way). SpaceX and Tesla have both produced good results. This is the way things have always been: the business owner's job is to manage money, not to invent. And there were plenty of hucksters and scammers in the 19th century economy too.

Please reflect for a moment: is this actually a *good* argument? My point was that humans motivated by socialism in a socialist economy (whether you want to admit it or not) still made huge mistakes because of things like pride and dogmatism. Do you think those core facets of the human condition will permanently go away with the abolishment of capitalism? Humans and AI are both capable of making mistakes for stupid reasons.",

I'm in STEM, and have even learnt quite a bit about AI from university courses (I coded/trained a few simple models myself). The automation of intellectual labor has already happened to a great degree. In fact, these \"AI\" models aren't even that big leaps in the grand scheme of things. \n\nThe invention of calculators for example, erased huge parts of the intellectual workforce who was being used to crunch numbers. With the invention of turing complete computers, it became in theory, possible to automate \\*any\\* intellectual labor. Further advancements came with the development of PCs and high level programming languages. PCs made it possible for anyone to purchase computing power, while high level programming languages made it much easier for people to \"accumulate\" intellectual labor over time (by creating new libraries which could be shared around, so you can use code developed by others).\n\n  \nBasically, my point is, that this automation of intellectual labor has already happened to a great degree. Intellectual labor is already an \"industrialized\" sector. \n\n\\>For our century, social democracy can mitigate the effects of mass unemployment.\n\nYou cannot turn back the historical clock in any society. Western societies which used to be social democracies developed into neoliberalism precisely because social democracy wasn't stable. The social democracies of the past were ripped apart because they accumulated capital rapidly, which caused profit rates to fall too much.",

AI doesn't change this task at all.  It cannot save capitalism from its inherent contradictions.\n\n\\--\n\nA historical materialist analysis of AI need to start with what is new and what is the same and what are the contradictions in the process\n\n* hasn't the mechanisation and automation of skilled labor always been part of capitalism's constant drive to remove living labour from the production process?  Isn't AI just a continuation of this process since it is \"trained\" on the digitised libraries of the products of human labour?\n* What does the failure of AI to produce autonomous vehicles represent?  I read one estimate that US$ 100 billion has been invested in research but its application is limited.  \n* What will happen as AI started to be trained on its own output?  Promises of geometric improvement and Artificial General Intelligence make good science fiction but there are already limits. AI, because of its fundamental structure, cannot do basic arithmetic beyond two digit numbers and there is no prospect of it being able to.  \n* AI will not solve the contradictions of capitalism.  Replacing living labour with dead capital has been happening since the birth of capitalism as required by the cycle of M-C-M.\n* Human intelligence is not the same as digital binary logic machine learning.  While AI claims to be based on a \"neural network\" this is really an oversimplified model of the human brain about which our understanding is still limited.  Mathematician and scientist Roger Penrose has discussed some these problems in [The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds and The Laws of Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Mind)***.***   A digital computer is a Turing machine that sees the world as THINGS composed of 0s or 1s whose \"meaning\" is determined with the help of pre-defined reference tables.  The limitations of the axiomatic logic of these machines was anticpated before their creation by [G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) and  [Tarski's undefinability theorem (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem) and Turing's [Halting problem (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem)  \n* There is an underlying limit also because reality, as far as we understanding, is not reducible to \"bits\" of data.  The world, as Engels summarised it as follows:\n\n>... The great basic thought that the world is not to be comprehended as a complex of ready-made\u00a0*things,*\u00a0but as a complex of\u00a0*processes,*\u00a0in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into being and passing away, in which, in spite of all seeming accidentality and of all temporary retrogression, a progressive development asserts itself in the end\u2014this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two different things.   \n[Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of classical German philosophy, IV](https://www.wsws.org/en/special/library/ludwig-feuerbach-end-classical-german-philosophy/05.html)",
