Helping the poor has little to do with the aims or analysis of Communists.\n\n>Communism is for us not a\u00a0state of affairs\u00a0which is to be established, an\u00a0ideal\u00a0to which reality [will] have to adjust itself. We call communism the\u00a0real\u00a0movement which abolishes the present state of things.

Idealism and Materialism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm)\n\n>historically capitalism is better statistically than communism.\n\nCommunism has never existed historically, so this is false.\n\n>What is the definition of Marxism?\n\nA method of analysis in which one uses dialectical materialism to draw conclusions about historical social, political, or economic events. \n\nDialectical materialism on the most basic level is the theory that all social, economic, and political change comes from contradicting interests inherent to certain modes of production (material conditions). In every society since the widespread establishment of agriculture, there has been some method of production, each having a class system or hierarchy where one group must serve another. In the modern day, Marxists describe capitalism as being generally based on a dichotomous class system primarily consisting of the bourgeois (those who own the means of production and extract surplus value from those who work for them) and the proletariat (those whose surplus labor value is turned to profit for the bourgeoisie). \n\n>The history of all hitherto existing society\u00a0is the history of class struggles.\n\n>Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master\u00a0and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\n\n>In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.\n\n>The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.\n\n>Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other \u2014 Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.\n\n[- Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party, Section I: Bourgeois and Proletarians](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm#007)\n\nCapitalism, in Marxist theory, is a system of production where commodities are the primary drivers of production and exchange. \n\n>The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as \u201can immense accumulation of commodities,\u201d\n\n[- Karl Marx, Capital: Volume One, Part I: Commodities and Money, Chapter One: Commodities, Section 1: The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use-Value and Value](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm#S1)\n\nA commodity in Marxist theory can be generally described as a product sold for money. In Capital, Marx gets into the ***far*** more advanced nuances of what makes a commodity, what gives a commodity its value, use-value v. exchange value, etc, but this is the most basic understanding of a commodity. \n\nMarxism, using the aforementioned dialectical mode of analysis, posits that eventually, there will be an \"end to history\" when classes, currency, and commodity production are abolished (i.e. communism) because there will be no more contradicting interests, which will need to be resolved by the abolition of one class or another. Because Marxists believe that history is driven by the contradicting interests of classes, which invariably leads to the violent overthrow of one of the ruling classes by the subjugated, we believe that capitalism not only should suffer the same fate, but that it is an inevitability that it will. \n\nThus, Marxists, in the most simple terms possible, are those who believe dialectical materialism is the correct means of historical, political, and social analysis, and from this analysis draw the conclusion that the bourgeoisie and capitalism in turn will be overthrown by a proletariat uprising which will lead to a world communist order in which class, currency, and commodity production will no longer exist, for production will be ruled under a common plan where no class system is present.\n\nKeep in mind that this is about as barebones of an explanation as you can get. There are far more details that I'm omitting for the sake of simplicity. Please comment with any questions if you have them or read Marx yourself to learn more about Marxism.\n\n>What is the definition of Leninism?\n\nMarxism applied to the conditions of the world/Russia at the time of the October Revolution in 1917. Lenin did not invent any new method of analysis, nor did he differ from Marx in any substantive way. \n\nThis is my opinion, but many who consider themselves Marxists have very different and very strong opinions on Lenin. \n\n>What is the definition of Trotskyism?\n\nFrankly, I'm going to skip over this one because what differentiates Trotsky from other Marxists is an extremely complicated discussion for somebody new to Marxism, and I'm not particularly knowledgeable on Trotsky compared to Marx, Engels, Lenin, etc.\n\n>Why do you support AES nation, since from what I have seen these countries are far behind other countries and tend to have repressive and brutal governments? \n\nFirstly, those who support/critically support \"AES\" nations tend to be Marxist-Leninists or offshoots of Marxist-Leninists. Despite the name, in my opinion, these people are not communists because their beliefs fundamentally contradict the theories outlined above. Their analysis tends to focus more on sentiment regarding colonialism and imperialism while dismissing the material analysis of Marx. They will say otherwise, so, again, feel free to ask questions about why I believe they are not communists.\n\n[Dialogue With Stalin by Amadeo Bordiga](https://www.marxists.org/archive/bordiga/works/1952/stalin.htm) is often considered one of the more important pieces of anti-Stalin/anti-Marxist-Leninist Marxist literature. It is important to understand that neither Marx nor Lenin were Marxist-Leninists. Stalin and his contemporaries were the first to use the term and consider themselves such.",

Permanent revolution is the idea that socialism must be achieved internationally and not just within the confines of one country in order to be truly successful. This is argued to be the case because of the capitalist influence and coercion that would be exerted on any singular nation that transitions to socialism.\n\nAnother key feature of Trotskyism is the opposition to bureaucratic policies that were present in the Stalinist political system. Trotsky was critical of the anti-democratic, increasingly top-down nature of the decision-making within the communist party under Stalin.

            "body": "I am going to start by drawing a distinction between Marxism and Marxism-Leninism which is Stalin's interpretation of a synthesis between Marx and Lenin. What you are calling \"AES\" are countries that are ruled by Marxist-Leninist parties. That ideology is most associated with the beliefs that there can be socialism within one country and that that socialism does not need the support of workers in the advanced capitalist countries, both of which are at odds with more traditional Marxist beliefs.\n\n>What is the definition of Marxism?\n\nMarxism is an ideology based on Marx and Engels' writings. (Engels was fond of quoting Marx's claim that he was \"not a Marxist\" but here I will conflate Marx with Marxism.) There is a bit of tension between Marx's ideas in the Communist Manifesto and his more mature ideas in Capital, but I would still strongly recommend reading the Manifesto for a short overview of his basic claims. In its essence, Marxism is the idea that capitalism is a distinct type of economy which developed in a specific time and place (western Europe around the 1600s), that this economy is necessarily expansive and so is global (colonialism, imperialism, globalization), that it requires both a working class (proletariat) and a capitalist class (bourgeoisie), that it is focused on the pursuit of private profit through the mass production of commodities (money-->commodities -->profit), that this profit necessitates a disciplined working class (surplus labor time --> surplus value), and that the working class does not befit from being so disciplined. This results in the existence of class struggle which we generally call \"politics\". Eventually (hopefully) workers will wake up, realize they need to take over the state, unite with workers in other countries, and create an alternative international, democratic economy called \"socialism\" or \"communism\" which can be characterized by \"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.\" Marx understood the working class in the advanced capitalist countries as leading this transformation. In Marx's lifetime, this struggle was understood to be connected to supporting the abolition of slavery (in the US), and the formation of social democratic parties throughout Europe. (You can look up the early history of the Social Democratic Party of Germany and the International Workingmen's Association (IWA) for more about this. Marx's letter to Abraham Lincoln for the IWA is also a nice condensed summary of his political views.)\n\n>What is the definition of Leninism?\n\nLenin understood himself to be a Marxist, but he was from a later generation, that of the Second International. He felt that WW1 was a capitalist war which workers in Russia needed to oppose in the name of working class solidarity, that the social democratic parties of Europe had betrayed social democracy by supporting WW1, and that WW1 was paving the way for a socialist revolution throughout Europe (the advanced capitalist countries) which the revolution in the USSR would inspire. You can read Lenin's short April Theses for more information. The goal of socialists in Russia was to establish democracy through the soviets and use that power to \"take steps towards\" socialism in the USSR until the workers until the advanced capitalist countries came to the defense of the socialist movement in the USSR. His understanding of socialism was heavily influenced by the German socialist Karl Kautsky (a close acquaintance of Engels and editor of vol 4 of Capital) and the Germany Social Democratic Party, but they later had a split about the October Revolution and Kautsky's position on WW1. (Lenin accused Kautsky of reneging on his earlier beliefs.)\n\n>What is the definition of Trotskyism?\n\nTrotsky's early beliefs are very similar to what is described above under Lenin. As a mid-20th century movement, Trotskyism is basically the position that the USSR was the lesser evil relative to the US, but it needs to be overthrown by a more legitimate socialist movement supported by a socialist movement in the advanced capitalist world. The USSR was not socialist but midway between socialism and communism (Lenin's steps towards socialism vs. Stalin's socialism in one country). The Stalinist USSR had become a \"degraded workers' state\"; the AES states which followed its model were \"deformed workers' states\". Socialism required world revolution led by a socialist transformation in the advanced capitalist countries (as Marx argued). Trotsky saw himself as just a vanilla Marxist.\n\n>Why do you support AES nation\n\nThey represent part of the history of organized resistance to capitalism, and we need more of that. There are many things done by AES that don't deserve anyone's support, though. I think of these states as being plagued by developmental state problems. There are similar problems that many capitalist countries in the developing world also face. In reality, global capitalism has many serious problems (including the destruction of the planet), and it is incredibly naive to believe that it will meet the needs of the entire world's population because it is an exploitative system. There are not many examples of poor countries that have really become capitalist \"success\" stories (\"success\" by the politically loaded and pathetic standards of the IMF and World Bank) and those that have are in quite unique circumstances.\n\n>What would you call Bernie Sanders political ideology and does it align with yours?\n\nSanders is a social democrat, but I think also a socialist. His hero is Eugene Debbs. Marxism in its 19th century form is a version of internationalist social democracy, so there is not as much tension between Sanders as Marx as both liberals and Marxist Leninists commonly allege. Personally, I wish Sanders used his public profile to speak more (at all?) about the need to build a workers' party and the need for international solidarity.",

Initially based on the works of Karl Marx, but the term \"Marxism\" has been re-interpreted, misinterpreted, re-imagined, and bastardized by both the left and right for generations.\n\nLeninism: A specific practical method of political and economic change, influenced by Marx, that argues the state is a bourgeois entity that needs to dissolve through the dictatorship of the proletariat - a kind of re-arrangement of power where the working class takes control through the influence and activity of a determined vanguard. I would say the role of the state is a highlight and central component of Leninism: What is it? What's its role in revolution?\n\nTrotskyism: A specific ideological interpretation of Marxism that supports vanguardism, dictatorship of the proletariat, but advocated for a permanent revolution - the development of an industrial proletariat as a force to shift the economic and political power imbalance through international revolution.\n\nBernie: He is a committed social democrat. Understanding the difference between a socialist and a social democrat is crucial to understanding much of the tensions and disagreements on the \"far left.\" He has many of the ideological underpinnings of a socialist (expand public services and the social safety net, using the economic levers to meet the needs of the people rather than corporate interests, etc.) but he is willing to work within a political infrastructure that a socialist (or communist) would argue is thoroughly bourgeois and incapable of adequately responding to the needs of workers, and certainly is not revolutionary in any way. He is not the \"most leftist\" politician in America - he is remarkably left for someone who achieved his level of success in the conventional political forum.\n\nAs far as the question about nations and development, this involves a larger conversation about political and economic history, the needs and wants of societies, and political manipulation. I'm not from the US, but when I look at the situation in Cuba, the first thing I think of is how difficult it must have been for Cubans to see their political and economic levers stolen by Spain, then (post-1898) controlled by the USA, eventually propping up a dictator. Then, after the revolution, a party tried to use those economic and political levers to benefit the people rather than US capital, but were subsequently forced to live for generations under the threat of attack, funded invasions, attempts at undermining political institutions, and embargos. The conditions we see in Cuba are the result of a continued historical attack on a nation. Governments that try to use their economy to meet the needs of the people rather than making deals with US corporations and/or multilateral neoliberal organizations, are subject to an onslaught of powerful pressures and manipulations.\n\nIn short, this is less about AES, and more about the power of imperialism and military force.\n\nBut, you are much better off reading the works of Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and the history of Cuba than a blurb by a middle-aged, tired, radical like myself.

However, It\u2019s predominantly used to analyze historical development of societies using the framework of dialectical materialism. How it differs from other ideologies is that Marxism applies the scientific method and is rooted in concrete facts. A key element of Marxism is criticism and self criticism. It\u2019s how we learn and develop the theory of Marxism. \n\nGoing off of that Leninism is an extension of Marxism. Lenin took Marxism and by applying it built on the theory. [Leninism arose in the era of imperialism (here\u2019s a song about it)](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Gl7QkYQ5vCMzugOR4UWdS?si=xviLk8deQ5Sl6tnVLoeERA). A core part of Leninism is the use of the state to bring about and guide a revolution towards socialism.

China has pulled over a billion people out of poverty and now challenges the US as a global super power. That speaks to the power of marxism-Leninism-maoism as a valid path towards socialism. Cuba went from an US colony to another powerhouse. Eliminating severe poverty, illiteracy, and even developing a lung cancer vaccine all while besieged by the US.

Many socialists and communists disagree on this fact, frankly, and it's not as simple as who is right and wrong. Marx and Lenin used these words differently, even. What I can say is that the statistics you're referring to probably have some sort of rigging, most likely the poverty line is too low (i.e. 1 dollar a day or something like that), and Steven Pinker who likes to bring up that poverty has improved fell for this too, but it does not scale if you increase the amount. If you increase it to $5, which still isn't much, and compensated for inflation, it turns out poverty has increased.  \n\nMarxism is a theory of economy, more specifically of Capitalism that predicts that the internal tensions within it, such as that between a boss and a worker, much like lord and serf before them, will lead to a new state of things that relieve these tensions, put very simply. When explained this way, it sounds extremely reasonable, right? \nWell, despite the fact many disagree, and in my opinion on shaky bases, the actual points of contention regard what form that takes, and what to do about it. Here we get into practical theories regarding political economy. \n\nI won't actually explain these, because this is actually not doable. It's as simple as that. There are disagreements on forms of action, if any action should be taken, if the opposite action should be taken to make capitalism worse and accelerate its demise. These theories all have intelligent people behind them, and are based on infinite considerations, and this is only one facet of being a communist. \n\nOne thing I will point out is very few communists think helping the poor is actually the point, a helpful side product definitely. This is about a sustainable organization of political economy, an end to war and such, the end of history. Welfare is not communist, equality isn't, wealth redistribution isn't, unless we're dealing solely in the moral character of communism. These are separate, but often associated matters. \n\nIn regard to AES, there is no such thing, and there is such a thing.

Communism is the movement of the workers to expropriate the means of production of society as a whole and to rationally run production according to the principle of social/collective scientific planning in order to meet the needs of all.",

Generally characterized by socialism, dialetical materialism, internationalism, and revolution.  \n\"What is the definition of Leninism?\"\n\nI assume this is referring to Stalinism. It is a betrayal of Marxism, having killed all the old Bolsheviks, destroying the cominterns trade union, allowing the proletariat to work with reactionary trade unions, and more.  \n\"What is the definition of Trotskyism?\"\n\nA response to Stalinism, which eventually degraded into social democracy as Trotskyites defended the USSR and other bourgeois revolutions.\n\nBoth Stalinists and Trotskyists love their college student groups\n\n\"Why do you support AES nation, since from what I have seen these countries are far behind other countries and tend to have repressive and brutal governments?\"\n\nIt's not about \"repressive and brutal governments\", all states are oppressive to a certain class. The proletarian dictatorship will be \"repressive\" to the bourgeoisie.\n\nNeither does their stage of development matter. All are capitalist. \n\n\"What would you call Bernie Sanders political ideology and does it align with yours?(for those who don\u2019t know, Bernie Sanders is an American politician who is the most leftist politician in the United States)\"\n\nHe is a social democrat. He does not wish to destroy capitalism, but to simply add welfare.",

Chinese billionaires are a complete betrayal of Marx. China has a housing market. Communist want free housing for all. Cuba is the closet we got but due to HEAVY embargos from the US, they are bottle necked. Despite being the 3rd poorest American naation, they have the greatest access to healthcare and the best out of hospital care for diseases they have treatments for (embargos limit the ability for doctors to access MRI/CT, etc).  Cuba has even created its own vaccines.  This is a very poor nation",

Just look up Marxists.org it's a treasure trove of information from a wide variety of Marxist theorists and academics. \n\n4) Most of us don't - mostly because these **aren't** truly socialist countries. They use the terminology of traditional socialist texts and theorists to mask authoritarian regimes. Except, maybe, Cuba. This country would be further advanced than it is without the American sanctions that have prevented growth from happening despite its potential.  However, I don't know enough about Cuba to be certain. \n\n5) Bernie Sanders is, as far as I know, a socialist. Not Marxist. It's admirable because he's spent his whole career fighting against the tide of U.S. capitalism. He seems to just want what most other developed countries have. Free, at the point of use, healthcare. Proper wages and worker rights. A society that actually supports the people that support it. Rather than the capitalist hellscape many people live in. \n\n6) I personally don't support these countries. I don't really know why anyone, that actually knows anything about them, would.\n\n7) Poverty, lack of opportunity. Sanctions, as well as difficulties with the government, have made it very difficult to live in. This has been a long-term problem, (think of the scene in *Scarface* when Tony Montana travels from Cuba to the U.S.), and will continue.",

You gotta compare like for like if you gonna say ones better than the other, right?\n\n>Why do you support AES nation, since from what I have seen these countries are far behind other countries and tend to have repressive and brutal governments?\n\nTwo things:\n\"Repressive and brutal governments\" - according to who? The countries that are at war with them? The former ruling class and counter-revolutionaries? Western media that's owned by our ruling class?\n\"These countries are far behind\" - again, according to who? By what metric? Homelessness? Illiteracy? Access to affordable food and healthcare? Seems that all these countries are far ahead of the US and many other capitalist countries.\n\nThe reason I critically support these countries is that they prioritize the welfare of their people ahead of the profitability of their business sector. None of them are doing \"perfect communism\" cos that doesn't exist; they're using the resources they have in the conditions they're in to provide the best possible standard of living they can to their people.\n\nPay close attention to that last sentence cos it explains why your understanding of AES countries is skewed. You're seeing these countries as isolated entities, free agents of their own destinies. In truth they are part of a global system of trade, economics and politics, one that correctly sees them as an existential threat to itself, and has been rallying its extensive forces for over 100 years to dismantle and destroy these countries.\n\nIt's succeeded on a number of occasions, but now as it starts to crumble under the weight of its own contradictions, socialism, and these AES countries as it vanguard, are emerging as the renew hope for humanity.",

Think of it as socialist/communist theory v1.0.\n\nLeninism: communist theory v1.10. Leninism outlines that communism can only be achieved through a centralised state and a vanguard party. Historically, Leninism also involves state ownership of the means of production, rather than worker ownership of the means of production, as Marx had outlined. Leninists would argue that the state/party represent the workers, which sounds fine on paper, but historically, it resulted in authoritarian regimes that while still better in some aspects than life under capitalism, nevertheless restricted freedom of expression and took power away from the people.\n\nTrotskyism: communist theory v1.13. Basically Trotsky's main contention was with Stalin's doctrine of communism in one country. Trotsky believed communist/socialist nations should aim to export the revolution abroad and trigger a chain reaction that would result in a global communist revolution.",
