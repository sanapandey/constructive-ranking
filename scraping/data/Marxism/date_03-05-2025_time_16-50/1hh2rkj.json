This tactic has been used for decades and was acknowledged internally by the White House as early as Eisenhower.\n\nThis history is detailed in Carbon Democracy by Timothy Mitchell.\n\nYou find yourself aligned with zionism by rejecting Hamas, which is not remotely similar to ISIS. And you flatten all important distinctions when you apply this Bush-era blanket term of \u201cIslamism\u201d.\n\nISIS has been a tool of the West, as is plainly seen today in Syria. Hamas has not and is directly confronting Western imperialism.",

Imperialism is part of the problem but nationalism is just but an extension of it. As a communist you mustn't extend support to nationalist movements uncritically just because they're fighting a vague definition of imperialism.",

They are revolutionary because they are directly confronting the primary contradiction of Western imperialism. They are doing more in the struggle against capital than Western armchair Marxists discussing theory.\n\nThe secondary contradiction is the ideology of Hamas, which will have to be addressed if they are successful.\n\nMarx and Engels wrote a great deal about these kinds of struggles and understood the nuance. What you\u2019re caught up in is a Western academic Marxism not so different from liberalism.",

And you\u2019re again lumping together all Islamic militant groups as if they\u2019re the same and giving them this label \u201cIslamist\u201d. There\u2019s zero comparison between Hamas and ISIS or Al Qaeda. The former is directly confronting a colonial project, the latter have consistently fought for the same interests as the US. See who the US is now promoting as the next up in Syria? Ever wonder why ISIS hasn\u2019t joined the fight with Hamas? To the contrary, Israel treated wounded ISIS fighters during the Syrian civil war.\n\nWho has killed more women and homosexuals in Palestine? The answer is Israel, but they do it with a rainbow flag, right? And this is why I say you\u2019re lost in ideology and it has taken you to the side of imperialism. I can find your exact opinion broadcasted on any American news network.\n\nYou do not understand Marxism beyond how it\u2019s been transformed into a 21st century aesthetic.",
