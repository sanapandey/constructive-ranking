    "selftext": "I recently learned of Marx\u2019s social conflict theory. What I found interesting is that everything outlined in Marx\u2019s social conflict theory seems to perfectly highlight the core flaws of every communistic society we\u2019ve seen. Of course anarcho-communism addresses these flaws, but it also contradicts social functionalism. I just find it interesting that the father of communism seems to have constructed the perfect counterpoint to communism (barring anarcho-communism). ",

Essentially, it claims that the decision-makers within these institutions act in the interest of themselves and their peers. This is mostly why we haven\u2019t seen a fair communist society. Corruption has taken over in every instance.",

It aligns nearly perfectly with dialectical materialism, the theory that allowed Marx to theorize communism. There\u2019s no actual conflict (lol) between the two theories. I think what you\u2019re confusing is a view of governments and beurocracy more in line with Max Weber than Karl Marx.  Marx\u2019s criticisms of government institutions aren\u2019t at odds with his support of such things as nationalization and what have you. \n\nMy money is on you having an understanding of social conflict theory without having a good grasp on Marxist theory proper. Which is fine of course. But it seems to be where the confusion is coming into play. \n\nEdit: added last two sentences",

They are so easily oppressed by their government due to the absolute power it holds under communism. Corruption is all over the world, but it is much harder to address a single all-powerful entity with one interest compared to fragmented entities with varying interests. This is why anarcho-communism is the only form which actually holds the potential to achieve the goals of communism. \n\nWhere in the world is this idea of yours that only communist countries have ever addressed corruption coming from??? I\u2019m sure you know of the French Revolution as well as the American Revolution.",

That's just the product of liberal academics failing to understand Marxism and frankly trying to reframe Marxism as social Darwinist-adjacent. It's ridiculous. Marxism is specifically the theory of class struggle within the context of class society. Once classes are abolished, there will necessarily be no class conflict.\n\nSociety *is*, in the main, developed through *contradiction*. That is to say that some state of affairs gives rise to its own contradictions, a unity of opposites. Such contradictions necessarily strive to resolve themselves, creating the motion of development. To make the point more concrete, Gramsci once hypothesized that after class struggle has been resolved by the decisive victory of the proletariat and the consequent abolition of classes, society will then take on the contradiction between humanity and natural forces, i.e., the struggle between social and organic life. This contradiction obviously isn't resolved through competition or rote conflict, but possibly the precise opposite: learning how to harmonize the needs of society with the needs of organic life, redesigning our economy.",
