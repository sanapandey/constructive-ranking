In his podcast this week, he has someone on to talk about what the MAGA coalition ideologically. \n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/1KMEgZg3tOZP2tu2fWe5wl?si=B4vhVKD2RcaYNxhPAPvR6Q\n\nThe short version of why I'm freaking out about this is that throughout the conversation they basically say something like \n\nDonald Trump won the election because liberals like Obama failed to deliver on promises (or maybe just ideas people had, given all the hope and change talk). The failure of liberal elites to actually deliver for the American people has opened up a space for people like JD Vance and other hyper online right-wingers to fill. And why do they fit into this space? Because they have a special brand of nationalism that's a different KIND than that of someone like George W Bush. Their nationalism is a religious nationalism. It's a traditionalist-mystic, ethno-nationalism with a focus on the hyper masculine. It's a backlash against liberals who don't help poor people and they see the problem to be feminism and queer people because that's all the liberals talk about. And the guest is even talking about how scared he is that this administration will just invade somewhere because they believe it is human nature that masculine energy needs to be channeled into a physically vigorous national project in order for men to be virtuous. \n\nThey just said all of those things, disconnected, over the course of a conversation, not actually calling it what it is. Obviously fascism. \nWhether you think that's what it is or not, their analysis is fascism. \n\nI'm sorry. I guess this is just a rant. I just can't handle how liberals even say that Obama failed the working class and that's how we got where we are today but not realize that they're part of the problem. \n\n\"Why are you mad at Joe Biden? There was no inflation. Why are you mad at Joe Biden? It was all just corporate greed. We're still not going to do anything about it. There was no inflation. You're only critique is that he's old. Why are you mad at Joe Biden? This is the lefts fault\"",

New American Century seemed pretty clearly to me to be about repositioning US imperialism in the post-cold war era in order to take advantage of unipolarity. Generally any imperialist war comes with a degree of emergency rule and \u201cwar at home.\u201d So I\u2019m not sure I see how it would be fascist and not just \u201cnormal\u201d imperialism.\n\nIt was a more openly aggressive US imperial strategy and the failure of this and political impasse since then imo are related to the growth of fascism (also materially as the working class military recruitment imploded at the time while being replaced by a more middle class and rural military\u2026 almost certainty a huge driver of fascist sentiment and over fascist/militia organizing among the rural middle class - along with their general class tendency towards fascist-like politics.)\n\nI\u2019d say fascism is much closer to power regardless of what Trump believes just because there are organized (immune) right-wing vigilantes enforcing an illiberal social hierarchy. There were militias and groups like the minutemen in the Bush era, but it wasn\u2019t a broader movement, it was like the left at that time\u2026 marginal to the mainstream. (I mean we still are, but it\u2019s easier to talk to regular workers now than in 2004 or whatnot\u2026 the recession changed that.)",

The working class placed these people at great cost and great expdctations, and the Left politicians turned out to be Liberals. So here comes resentment, desillusionment. And the Alt-Right exploited these emotions to turn the working class against the Liberals-in-Leftist-clothing politicians. And eventually the Alt-Right became fascism. \n\n\nSo (and please, educate me because I'm a noob and I wanna learn) Ezra is... right. The working class expected the Democrats to be leftists.

Anyone who derives his power by the strength of its alliances/funding with the business community is in on the same game. The entire political game is about who will serve the richest best. Everything else is a about psychological manipulation, and that is something the right does much better by going at the most primitive and dark instincts. The Democrats simply have nothing to go with any more but \"not them!\" It's a party correctly labeled as a the last line of defense against any modern leftist uprising. As long as the Democrats are fine losing, and they are, there will be no inroads towards dismantling the cloud capitalists' takeover. There basically 7 corporations that dominate the cloud capital arena (valued orders of magnitude greater than the actual economy), and they were all lined up behind Trump to show their fealty. The hoi poloi don't matter one bit. No one has anything but contempt for the common man. He is a laughing stock, a loser. No one is working for his liberation from oppressive forces.",

That the MAGA movement is a symptom of the failures of liberalism, resulting in a populist backlash. But he doesn't take the obvious step to something like \"we should take a more populist position then, and move to the left in order to solve the problems that liberalism has caused. If liberalism has failed then we need to give people an option that isn't the fascists\". Which is especially frustrating because he can see that this is true of surrendering the more apolitical spaces. He thinks it was a major problem that the Harris campaign didn't try to make an appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, if I'm not wrong. It's just also true of the political space as well, if you ask me. \nYou are so right though. I am also in awe that he won't just call them fascists at all. This is what fascism is, ideologically and as a movement historically. He's smart. C'mon",

If Biden *had* run and lost I'm sure armchair experts would be saying *Obviously it was age.*\n\nLike sure it was a surprise he won in 2016, but then he lost in 2020. And then 2024, I don't know many people who would have predicted those 3 outcomes. It's really easy, and lazy, to after-the-fact say \"Oh they should have done *this* or *that.\"* And 90% of those commentators are wrong, and I think Ezra is one of them.\n\nTBH it sounds like you're really confident that MAGA voters would have switched sides for somebody like Bernie, but I haven't heard a single Maga voter say \"I wish Bernie was running so I don't have to vote for Trump.\" I think Trump wasn't wrong when he bragged \"My supporters would let me shoot somebody in the street and still support me...\"",

I pretty much buy into the idea that the USA is polarized around a system/anti-system spectrum too. And I think that if that's true, the Democrats are making big mistakes. That is just one person's opinion though, you're right. \n\n>Ezra is one of them\n\nAnd yeah, that's sort of why I'm mad, I guess. What I'm saying is that if he believes what he's saying he believes in this episode of the show then he really shouldn't be a liberal anymore. Or at least that he needs to realize that his reporting is part of the problem, driving people into the arms of the fascists, rather than accounting for why the system we have is unable to grapple with people like Trump. \n\nThat's really the meat of it. If he thinks this is true then it means that Trump is a symptom of liberalism and he doesn't seem to believe that. It's a contradiction in his thinking and one that I believe is contributing to the rise of fascism",

You have to understand that he genuinely believes we can capitalism our way out of all this before you try to listen to him or else it'll give you an aneurysm. He would disavow the specific label, but he's essentially a techno-optimistic or techno-utopian.\n\nOne of the things I appreciate about him is how straightforward and honest he is about this position, but you gotta keep front of mind the fact that he is a \"progressive\" capitalist and anti-Marxist when you go to listen to his show. If you're listening to the king of \"lefty\" liberals and expecting to hear something Marx-adjacent, I'd argue the disappointment is on you.",
