    "selftext": "Say the US turns socialist tommorow, we want to bring consciousness to the working class of the world. What does that took like? Do agi prop against capitalism, fund labor parties and movements globally like the EZLN in Mexico, arm the vanguard/socialist parties? at what point does it cross the boundaries of 'self determination' ? Like the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to replace its corrupt leader and fight against counter revolutionaries? What do Marxists usually believe in - I also hear takes of where we should not export revolution at all as it destroys the country's self determination - but what if the one who is pressing has more funds and power then the workers like the King of Saud?
