    "selftext": "A friend of mine is studying psychology and will soon become a therapist. I asked him whether he plans to open his own practice or work at a clinic. He said he prefers to open his own practice because, at a clinic, the clinic would take a portion of his earnings. For example, if a therapy session costs 200 EUR, as a self-employed therapist, he would keep the entire 200 EUR. However, if he worked at a private clinic, the clinic might take 50%, leaving him with only 100 EUR, paid indirectly through his salary.\n\nAt that moment, I pointed out that this principle applies broadly under capitalism, whenever there\u2019s a choice between being self-employed and working for a private company. When you're self-employed, you keep all the value you produce. But when you're employed by a company, a portion of the value you create is taken by the CEO or shareholders, which Marx referred to as \"surplus-value.\"\n\nThe psychotherapist example is particularly useful for illustrating surplus-value extraction for two reasons. First, becoming a therapist requires minimal capital\u2014aside from perhaps renting a space for your practice\u2014so many therapists end up being self-employed. Second, it\u2019s easy to calculate the value a therapist generates because their work isn\u2019t tied to any pre-existing infrastructure. If a therapy session costs 200 EUR, the therapist directly generates 200 EUR of value in that session.\n\nTo clarify this further, let\u2019s consider my situation. I work as a software engineer, and I frequently handle change requests that my company bills at certain rates. Sometimes, I make changes that are invoiced at 1,000 EUR, but that doesn\u2019t mean I personally generate 1,000 EUR of value in that moment. The work I do relies on a pre-existing software infrastructure that was developed before I even joined the company. For me to make a change worth 1,000 EUR, the software itself needs to exist in a specific state beforehand. This makes it difficult to measure exactly how much value I\u2019m producing as a software engineer, since my work builds on something that was already there. In contrast, a therapist\u2019s work is much easier to quantify, which is why I believe the example of the psychotherapist is the simplest way to explain how capitalism works to someone unfamiliar with Marxist theory.",

For that reason you'd expect a different cost-benefit analysis for each case. \n\nThe 'surplus' value is better understood as a fee the clinic charges to handle these things, a fee which both pays for the value of those things and pays for the people who perform those things.

That is included within the SNLT of a commodity.\n\nProfit is the unpaid labor of the worker, it's not a surcharge added onto the value of a commodity after the fact. To say that surplus value is a fee charged on top of the constituent labor contained within the commodity implies that commodities are sold above their actual value. Marx refutes this in Value, Price & Profit:\n\n> It is nonsense to suppose that [...] profits of different trades spring from the prices of commodities, or selling them at a price over and above their\u00a0value.... To explain, therefore, the\u00a0general nature of profits, you must start from the theorem that, on an average, commodities are\u00a0sold at their real values, and that\u00a0profits are derived from selling them at their values, that is, in proportion to the quantity of labour realized in them. If you cannot explain profit upon this supposition, you cannot explain it at all.\n\nI might not be understanding you correctly, totally open to hear your perspective.",

Unlike a situation where worker gives up their labor in exchange for money, the therapist is giving up their labor in exchange for money, an office to provide patients with therapy, liability insurance, administrators, and a head office that can connect patients with therapists. These are all things that a therapist needs in order to actually perform his practice, so they would have to pay for them anyway. In these sense the therapist is just trading cash for those services to be organized and purchased by a third party, rather than organizing and paying for them himself. \n\nI could be wrong missing stuff but i think that's a good evaluation",

He MUST self exploit or he will go out of business. For example, he must pay for his own office and business structure. This is in a sense WORSE than working for a capitalist as now, even the \u201cjob\u201d of the capitalist has been outsourced to the petit-bourgeois. Secondly, he is still subject to the whims of the market. He may think he sets his own rates but in fact, those are set already. There is no \u201cgetting out\u201d of the system entirely, and this is a problem. What your friend is doing though imo is a step in the right direction although comrades will disagree with me; they might say having a divided and siloed workforce is precisely what enables capitalism to continue.",
