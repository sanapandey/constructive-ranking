    "selftext": "I work in state mapping, and recently have been doing some extracurricular research into the UK enclosures and clearances, which is depressing and infuriating stuff. I'd like to bring my mood back up with some reading focused on the Russian and Chinese revolutionary efforts to *reverse* enclosure and expropriate the expropriators, and commie land reform in general. General Russian/Chinese history I am less interested in at this stage, unless the texts have a strong focus on these issues. Would greatly appreciate any recommendations.",
