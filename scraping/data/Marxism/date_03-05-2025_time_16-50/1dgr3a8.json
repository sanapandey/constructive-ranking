    "selftext": "hello, im new here.  \nim trying to apply marxist theory in a game economy server (minecraft) i have read only Capital vol 1 but i know we cant simply put a $/min in commodities because there is transfer of value and things like that, but in minecraft i believe we can simplify things and forget about transfers of value and simply put a $/min for work time.  \nim making an spreadsheet with values of time, tecnique used, costs and the amount of products i got. the problem arises when i have to put a $/min value. I may know for example that an diamond pickaxe used for mining diamonds is worth in the market for around 100$ but how can i know the $/min if i dont know how much time the pickaxe needed to be made? i just bought the pickaxe i dont produced it myself so i cant know.",

            "body": "Villager trading probably eliminates any chance of you being able to apply Labour Theory of Value to a server. Mining is obsolete in most advanced economies, pretty much ever since villages got updated because the changes allowed for the creation of iron farms magnitudes more efficient than ones beforehand.\n\nPeople typically go the route of trading with villagers for diamond tools or armour now as the primary incentive to go mining is eliminated. The issue being that the emerald, backbone of villager trading, has no consistent value as there are so many possible avenues of obtaining them. As such I am not sure that there is a definitive value that can be applied to diamond gear based on LTV.",

                    "body": "You can represent it via super exploitation of the villager class. Over time, as the economy of the player-base develops, they reached the highest stage of Minecraft: imperialism. Wherein, the imperial core of the human players exploit the imperial periphery of the villages, for which they harbor and create camps for. This creates a mining aristocracy who no longer labor, but force this labor onto commodity exchange predicated upon the oppressed and enslaved villagers. Perhaps, there is no chance of revolution from the player base, because, even the most impoverished players are still vastly more wealthy than your most wealthy of villagers. The only chance we have of freedom for all people, is to lead the villagers upon a three line struggle, and reclaim their dignity. \n\n(/j)",

Seems like Marx says something about comparing all commodities and the time needed to produce them, in such a way a thing that needs 2x more time to produce is valuated 2x more, put simply. but there is no way to compare the time needed to produce things i didint produce myself. you can ask the seller but he can be lying so he can profit more.  \nhope you understand me",

Marxist economics is something that studies the whole capitalist system, not a few dozen people who don\u2019t even participate in a capitalist system inside the game. You\u2019re better off looking into early barter economies or trying to enforce some level of resource scarcity through mods or something.",

                    "body": "you are right, minecraft is not an capitalist system, thats what im trying to prove. in minecraft everyone have the means of production. but i dont see what resource scarcity have to do with this. minecraft is perfectly capable of accounting commodities (items) in terms of labor to produce it, even if it has farms where items are produced infinetely.  \nmy plan is to make the prices of items become the real prices (the value of time needed to produce them) so people will perceive that there is no point in selling and buying things when everyone has the power to produce the thing themselves. there is no surplus value. they would exchange time to get the thing and get the amount of money so they can buy the thing haha.  \nbut for that i need to price my items, and for that i need to answer my question on how to compare commodities and time when i dont know how much time things needed to be produced. I currently dont have the most efficient ways of producing items so i just want to know the price so i can see if i can produce the thing and sell or just buy from others who can produce the thing in the Average Time.",

Production and the average labour time is socially determined. The numbers of people and way \u201cproduction\u201d is done (as socially isolated pre class modes of production) means that there is no actual average. It\u2019s like trying to get meaningful statistical analysis from a small sample size, your averages are kind of meaningless when you have 10 massively different data entries. You don\u2019t seem to have production info from other people either in which case it\u2019s actually impossible. LTV in the Marxist way is not really meant to be applied in this way although you can look at Ricardo\u2019s original text on LTV for some help I guess. \n\nThis is why I\u2019m suggesting looking at barter economies. Without scarcity and property rights though there\u2019s very little reason for barter.",

I think that would be easier to calculate in minecraft, no?",

            "body": "researching more about MELT, i think i found a solution to my problem:  \ni found that, in Marx times, gold was the currency used, or paper money that could be directly converted in a constant amount of gold. So to know how much your time is worth in money you would just needed to know how much is the price of 1mg of gold.  \nin our days money is not anymore directly conversible into gold so there are researchers analysing how to calculate the MELT but this is out of my question.  \nin minecraft economy servers there are official stores where you can buy and sell items at constant amount of money. In my thinking, the equivalent of gold at Marxs times, the MELT, in minecraft is how much people can earn, at average, selling items to the store working at certain amount of time.  \nso, in my specific case, i believe the MELT is around 1200, 1500$ per minute because guardian farms are very common and with them you can get around that value selling the fish, prismarine shards that drop from guardian in one minute at farm, at average,  to the official store.",
