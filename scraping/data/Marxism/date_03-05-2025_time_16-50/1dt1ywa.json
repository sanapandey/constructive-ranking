Earlier in my political develop I had ruthless and emotional criticism of the founding fathers **regarding slavery**, and I still kind of do, but I'm sobering up on their historical moment.\n\nAt the time of the American Revolution which could be characterized as the dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie, their political revolution was that of overcoming the political and economic forces of the monarchy and the Ancien r\u00e9gime broadly. Just like in the dictatorship of the proletariat, capitalism will still exist in its overcoming, the future of socialism inherits the illegitimated relations of capitalism. Bourgeois revolutionaries inherited the illegitimated aspects of the Ancien r\u00e9gime which include slavery. Although under the early dictatorship of the Bourgeois, slavery still existed(s) their theoretical project was (and is) to abolish slavery. \n\nHopefully this comparison is appropriate in recognizing that just how overcoming capitalism will inherit cruelties that need overcoming, the bourgeois revolutions like in the US inherited slavery, yet sought the desire to overcome it through the theories of bourgeois right.

We could reason one-dimensionally that this historical moment was a conservative counter revolution because they profited off slaves, or we could reason that the radical vision of the revolution in the colonies held the possibility to emancipate forced labor, that's what bourgeois right is. \n\nThere were parts of the bourgeois revolution in America that included the extremely reactionary aspects of colonial extraction such as slavery, but the radicalism of secularity and subjecting the state to civil society is undoubtedly revolutionary in its historical moment. For fucks sake, when the Bolsheviks seized power there were still exploited peasants providing food for the cities, is Bolshevism counter revolutionary? No.  \n\nBritish generals suggested freeing slaves not out of their endearment for workers by the way, that was a political maneuver to retain their colonial power. Let's not start defending the promises of British generals.\n\nOn your point about the civil war, you are totally right. The American revolution in the 1700s didn't instantly emancipate everyone, just like the dictatorship of the proletariat isn't instantly communism. But the American revolution's political project of subjecting the state to bourgeois civil society provided the economic and political means by which the civil war was possible. The political radicalism of the American revolution was undeniable.\n\nRevolutions (and this is no exception) are complicated processes, and are not streamline events. Was existing slavery in the US + the Indian genocide, the emancipation promised by the founding fathers? Certainly not. But the political advances in realizing the autonomy of civil society from the state was. Was forced collectivization the emancipation promised by Marxism and socialist revolution? Certainly not, yet as Marxists here we are.",

Having read Foner\u2019s Capitalism and Slavery, Horne\u2019s Counter-Revolution of 1776, most of Marx\u2019s writings on the American Civil War and other similar works, I\u2019m learning a lot more in depth on that whole spectrum by reading Black Reconstruction. I\u2019m only about halfway through still but it is incredibly rich in detail on the various social forces that were at play before, during and after the Civil War, as well as the different political figures and associations involved. Interestingly enough, Johnson as a rising figure had been openly anti-bourgeois and had stated intentions to strengthen abolition, but evidently turned out to have been motivated by opportunism as demonstrated by his actions after the bourgeoisie had begun to take him seriously as a political actor.",

Where that revolution was deeply tied to religion the American revolutionaries had the language and theory of the French enlightenment to structure that revolution into a secular one. \n\nThat being said I also agree with the other comment here. In order to pull off that revolution the American bourgeois had to make a deal with the southern slave owning aristocracy. \n\nThe civil war is what it took to finish the Bourgeois revolution. \n\nSo I don\u2019t quite see it as a counter revolution, I do see it as revolutionary for the bourgeois class. But because it had to be a class collaborationist revolution it took 80 more years for it to end.\n\nEdit: and just to clarify it was a revolution from the decaying vestiges of the feudal mode of production. That\u2019s what made it progressive, but that didn\u2019t make it good. It also meant the expansion of the US into the west in order to take land from natives. That need to expand was also a reason for the civil war. American history is rarely good.",

The UK or rather England already had its revolution against the ancien regime in the English civil wars period, long before other European states because the British Isles were further along into capitalist development.\n\nWhile the English monarch was restored after the civil wars, he was restored as a figurehead while Parliament had real power, so the civil wars succeeded in their job of taking power from the old order and giving it to the new bourgeois. Hell, they went one stop further and willingly blocked ancient aristocrats (themselves voting for it) from holding military positions, killing off the feudal lord. This is the situation that the American revolution happened on top of, an already existing bourgeois capitalist system, not an ancien regime.\n\nIn fact we could say the American revolution was a reactionary revolution to an earlier order against British capitalism, given the slavery obsession, racism and colonial settlement rather than imperialist control (for example, the brits didn't try to literally colonise India with their own population). This starts making sense when you realise how many Europeans left for America because they were religious conservatives and other reactionaries.",

The colonial relationship between the American colonies and the British Empire were remnants of pre-bourgeois society and pre-bourgeois concepts of freedom.\n\nBy the way you're totally correct that the American revolution was a revolution on top of a pre-existing bourgeois order, only it was just more radical than said bourgeois order. The historical progression of the bourgeoisie asserting themselves as class took many years. \n\nListen, I understand where you are coming from by trying to delegitimize the American revolution as a progressive force in history. Hearing liberals worship at the alter of the founding fathers is equally as teeth grinding for me. But I am not a liberal. For all of it's shit, the American revolution was a real bourgeois political revolution, maybe not for the ordinary farmer, but radical nonetheless. You're not going to believe this, but early on, the US fought for decolonization efforts in liberating overseas colonies from their illegitimate European overlords. Mind boggling shit.\n\nHistory is fucked up for real. But as Marxists we have to recognize the radicality of the bourgeois revolution in America, and it's role in the historical process.",

Is it possible for slavery to exist and perpetuate itself in capitalism in the examples of bourgeois revolutions you provided. Absolutely. But it is simultaneously possible for capitalism to emancipate slave labor in realizing bourgeois labor relations. \n\nLocke justified a different kind of slavery that was ahead of time, this is what I\u2019m talking about. These kind of early liberal thinkers mainly opposed slavery on the basis of productive labor relations. \n\nAlthough capitalism can totally exist with slavery, slavery is actually a hinderance to capitalism in its tendency to constantly revolutionize the forces of production. Look to the civil war. \n\nAlso I think we are confusing bourgeois society and capitalism because Locke and Voltaire didn\u2019t give birth to capitalism, they gave birth to bourgeois society, which is currently in crisis (capitalism). \n\nOne more thing socialism isn\u2019t essentially the state controlled by workers. The state controlled by workers will still exist in and out of capitalism. It is the job of the workers to overcome capitalism to achieve socialism.\n\nI\u2019m struggling to address you\u2019re disagreement on this matter could you elaborate more?",
