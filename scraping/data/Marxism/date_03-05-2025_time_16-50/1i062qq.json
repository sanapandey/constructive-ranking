    "selftext": "\nThis one keeps popping up in my feeds and it drives mad.\n\nYou know the argument. To return a shopping cart to the corral after use is morally correct and proves that one can self govern. Doing otherwise, since the act has no reward or punishment, is amoral.\n\nI\u2019m paraphrasing, but what irks me most is that the shopping cart, corral, and parking lot are all under the stewardship of the grocery store or other like business.\n\nThe act of returning your cart may help another person. By easing the duty of the employed cart collector or by clearing your cart from usable walking/parking spaces, this makes the act right in itself.\n\nHowever the cart collection is the purview of the store. A store that provides shopping carts to its patrons may employ as many cart collectors as necessary. This could be zero of such employees, or every patron could be met at their vehicles with a tuxedoed cart farer waiting to return your cart with a white-gloved hand.\n\nFor the store owner and employer, the idea of providing maximal service would seem ludicrous. So the owners have settled into a happy medium where the shoppers are half responsible for their own cart and a small amount of employees will collect them often.\n\nLet\u2019s pivot to a grocery store bagging. A store may hire a suitable amount of bagging employees so that customers may do no work. Or, as seen more and more commonly is that patrons of stores are expected to bag their own groceries. \n\nWe end up with the same moral conundrum. Bagging your own groceries is moral  and  leaving the act of bagging to the register employee is amoral. By refusing to bag your own groceries, you are holding every other customer up and doubling the duties of the checkout clerk. \n\nSurprise, this isn\u2019t a moral issue but an economic one, and to me, specifically, this is a labor/capital issue\n\nThese stores have no duty or obligation to provide these services. Yet the services are expected and demanded by society. Yes, it is good for the owner and employer of the store to pass these duties onto the customer. The customer, however is now working for the store, minutely and without compensation.\n\nThe store owners are double dipping. They have less employees to pay and gain the labor of the customer.\n\nSo what is the issue? By going to a cart providing store, one agrees to the circumstance of returning your cart. That is the unsigned contract. You might get someone to bag your groceries and you might not. The option the shopper has is to which store to give your money. Which services do you require and how much are you willing to give up for convenience.\n\nFor many people, however, there is little or no choice. This is because of the customer\u2019s budget or because of which stores are near enough to be worth traveling. The contract is nonnegotiable. Also, these general trends to offload more work onto customers seems to be prevailing . The customer has not agreed to these changes, they have accepted them.\n\nFor example, a store may have no cart corrals and now the customer must return it all the way themselves. This is nearly the same argument, but the act would not feel good to the customer. The cart corral is expected by the customer. Changes like this do not test the morality of the customer but instead unveil the true reason for returning the cart.\n\nWho is the benefactor of returning a cart?  The benefactor of such an action is not society and the action is not good in itself. The benefactor of these acts are the owners and share holders of these companies.\n\nFor each instance of the customer giving labor in lieu of a hired employee, there is an exchange of labor, creating more wealth to the owners of the store. \n\nThus, the original argument that returning your cart is a selfless, moral act indicating the ability to self govern is false. It is an exchange of money and labor, only.\n\nSo while one may take their time to return a cart while no one is looking, I say, make them hire another person.",

            "body": "You are in part correct, but the initial moral fable is about what we owe each other as a society. It is about if you take initiative to make minor improvements in your community. \n\nEven if we take the scenario extremely literally, even with a person dedicated to running carts 24/7 they will never be as fast as everyone taking 2 minutes to put it in a central location. This unnecessarily increases risk to your fellows.\n\nPut another way, would we not expect centralized socialized food commissaries to request you place your cart out of the walkway?",

But in a Society of specialized workers, and in a society of rampant corporatism the lines become fuzzy. The argument isn\u2019t to leave carts out to hurt other people or to leave them lying around in general. I was just pointing out that scales tipping more for the corporations at the cost of the customer.",

            "body": "That is alot of word to say you don't want to put your cart in a corral. Some things aren't about the material conditions and the economic impact, some of it is just culture. So yeah it is moral. The cart corral isn't just there to make it easier for the lot attendant, it's purpose is to prevent damage to people's cars, and so small children and old people don't get hurt by wandering carts when the wind picks up. There really isn't a need for more attendants. But I also don't think we necessarily need humans to be lot attending at all. But yeah you are kind of a dick for not making that person's job easier, just like your a dick if you treat wait staff like shit or litter because you know a janitor will pick up your trash.\nEdit: removed repeating \"but also\"",

And I think you\u2019re wrong that not everything is about material condition. I was also pointing out that the simple act of cart return befits the capitalists who gain profits by hiring less people. They make customers bag their own groceries to hire less employees. So where\u2019s the line?\n\nEvery industry that has customer facing representatives can remove those employees and foist the work onto the customer as a benefit to owners of the business.",

I do agree there is a certain amount of cost cutting, but also there does reach a point of reasonability. Is there supposed to be someone who follows you through the store, puts what you say into the cart, shadows you through checkout and bags, loads your car and puts the basket away. Why shop at that point just order your groceries online right? That would save the capitalist the most money, which is why we see them pushing that avenue more and more today anyway. Not everything has to have a number. Consumers are irrational in some ways. I guess is it a savings if you never accounted for it in the first place.",
