    "selftext": "As a project manager by trade, I keep thinking about exactly what would it take to achieve a socialism (let's say something like China's level of control of the economy) in the United states. I see soooo many obstacles where any one of these will derail the entire project. I'm looking for a feasible plan that gets us to the finish line in the most ethical way.\n\n(1) I see a major problem being proletariat cohesion the suburbanization and internet atomization of society has most people with few friends, belonging to no outside of work organizations that would ever discuss leftist politics, they have no understanding of Marxist theory or even acknowledge their working class status. Unless they have played a sport after grade school, they have probably almost no experience with organizing.\n\n(2) Then there is the overcoming the counterrevolutionary forces. I can't see any version of a transition where the wealthy accept losing a democratic vote and would surrender their weapons, yachts, and turn their mansions into apartments so getting armed and trained will need to happen. Assuming that this can be done, capitalist forces would certainly monitor and/or cut internet communications rendering coordination and the use of moderns devices very difficult. An armed revolt could expect to be met by drones and air strikes. Running out of oil would stop troop movements as well as food and medical assistance. Will they nuke us if we are doing too well? \n\n(3) Even if we can hold out and reach a treaty with the capitalists, all modern devices require some kind of subscription or have a product life of less than 2 years and we would be at their mercy through debt in about that much time. Do you try to peacefully coexist with the capitalists as they constantly threaten and deceive your people? Do you just stop with the closest capitalists or do you try to neutralize them all? \n\n(4) Then there is the issue of dealing with traitors (tempted by constant propaganda) and spies. What do you do with people who peacefully refuse to participate and keep trying to sabotage your society? Do we just expell them to where they think is better or jail then? What do we do to deal with our constant labor shortages? What do are we willing to trade with the capitalists for vital resources and technology?  \n\nSo I ask you Reddit, is there any scenario where we overcome all these issues? Give me reason to be at least theoretically optimistic",

In America you have you a much harder task for sure but how does America run itself when the majority has taken control of said production? Railways don\u2019t work without workers. Petrol doesn\u2019t get pumped or refined. Food doesn\u2019t get harvested and processed and delivered. \n\nThe lifespan of the American military is probably a few years regardless due to their massive stockpiles but how do they fight when their regular soldiers refuse to do so? Or have actively joined the revolution? Only the right wing sections of the military and officer corps would back a counterrevolution. All of America\u2019s strengths can be turned on its head. Because the world is run by workers. I would definitely be scared of nuclear weapons though, that\u2019s a terrifying eventuality we will have to face. \n\nRevolution resolves the question of the capitalists. There is no coexistence once dual power is resolved. One side wins out. \n\nThe answer to the questions about dissidents. Prevent them from politically organising and getting their message out through repressing their freedom of speech. Only the working class has the right to a vote and a voice in the revolution. If the working class does not support you you\u2019re fucked anyway and basically doing an adventurist coup which is not what Marxists support. When the 99% all support you politically that\u2019s the time to strike. \n\nThen it\u2019s time to spread the revolution. They can trade with other soviet republics. Hopefully they don\u2019t have to trade with capitalists to survive as that would be a sign international revolution is not going as planned and an open door for capital to reassert itself like it did in Russia.",

But we are seeking to end oppression itself, while living in and trying to get out from under this massively oppressive and shortsighted system. We need to look at the long term and commit ourselves to building small brick by small brick. Maybe I am wrong on the theory here but it seems like late-stage capitalism could last a very long time. Nothing is set in stone, and fascism or unending capitalism are not inevitable. The working class always has the ability to find class consciousness, unite, and fight.",

Slavery is at least seen as something that is contemptible by today's standards. The Soviet Union, despite its long-term failure, overcame odds that seemed unfathomable. It legitimized Marxism as a viable political ideology that can oppose imperial occupation.\u00a0\n\n\nYour frustration is understandable.
