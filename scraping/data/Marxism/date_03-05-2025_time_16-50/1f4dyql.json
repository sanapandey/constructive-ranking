    "selftext": "I understand that the value of a produced good is, simplified, the time for labor plus capital consumed to produce the good. But capitalists have heaps of money sitting around idly (e.g. in a bank account). These can buy labor or physical goods, but as long as they don't buy anything they have no actual value. You cannot eat money, and the physical bank notes have almost no value at all, they're pieces of paper or pieces of metal, barely enough to be worth anything.\n\nSo, what is Marx's view on the value of money?\n\nEDIT: Just had the idea to ask ChatGPT. For the records, here's the answer:\n\n>According to Karl Marx, the value of money is rooted in its function as a measure of value and a medium of exchange within the capitalist mode of production. Marx's analysis of money is primarily found in his work \"Capital,\" where he explains how money arises from the development of commodity exchange and represents a universal equivalent form for expressing the value of all other commodities..\n\n>\n\n>2. \\*\\*Money as a Medium of Exchange\\*\\*:\n\n>\n\n>3. \\*\\*Money and Capital\\*\\*:\n\n>\n\n>4. \\*\\*Money's Value in a Developed Economy\\*\\*:\n\n>\n\n>In summary, according to Marx, the value of money is a complex concept tied to its function as a measure of the value of labor embodied in commodities, a medium of exchange, and a tool for the accumulation of capital. The value of money is intrinsically linked to the labor theory of value, where the worth of money, like any other commodity, is based on the amount of socially necessary labor time required to produce it.\n\nEDIT 2: I am surprised to see how little agreement there seems to exist on what Marx's view was on this question. Some here claim that his view was that money receives its value from only labor, others claim that his views were it receives its value from a gold standard, and that gold has its own inherent value, whereas others claim that gold backs money but only has labor value. I would have assumed that there is more general consensus on such a fundamental matter, given how extensively Marx was studied.\n\nEDIT 3: Seems this post was edited somehow - no idea by whom. The explanation copied from ChatGPT is now gone. Mods? Bots? Hackers? We will probably never know.",

Assuming he argued that money was backed by e.g. gold that first needed to be mined through labor, then wouldn't that simply postpone the problem of the value of money to the value of gold? Sure, it's not exactly the same, but ultimately gold has little practical use (other than being pretty, and few medical instruments and such things). You can actually do rather little with gold in comparison to e.g. iron. It's too soft, for many appliances. Sure, it does not corrode.\n\nTo me this sounds like the argument that money is backed by something like gold is simply postponing the problem without actual gain.\n\nThis really made me wondering if the true value of money is *only* in the believes - even if it's backed by gold.\n\nAnd that's what I wanted to check to see whether Marx shared this view or had a different one.",

But its wide use in artistic applications alone made it highly valuable for millennia, worthy of entire wars being fought over it.  \nGold-backed currencies did function as a \"bill of ownership\" of certain amounts at state-determined rates, countries would allow a state-guaranteed exchange of money to gold. So in this way, money did have an abstracted use value when Marx was alive. Which also effectively answers your question; the value of money as an exchange commodity was not entirely arbitrary.\n\nThis is actually often used as a cheap talking point for liberal economists to proclaim the uselessness of Marx's work in modern societies with fiat currencies. This has of course been answered in length by Marxists of different strides.",

This distinction is crucial to understanding Marx (value, use-value, as well as exchange-value). \n\nThe *value* of money is determined by its congealed socially necessary labor-time (SNLT). The *use-value* of money is its universal exchangeability with all ordinary commodities\u2014its use-value as purely money is as pure exchange-value. The *exchange-value* of money is determined by its quantity relative to the transactions it facilitates (M\u2013C\u2013M\u2032 or C\u2013M\u2013C\u2032\u2014or considered as separate moments: C\u2013M followed by M\u2013C\u2032; M\u2013C followed by C\u2013M\u2032).  It is because of the universal exchangeability of money, as well as its role in the continuous process of circulation that the value of money can be divorced from its exchange-value: the value of the ordinary commodities money can acquire compensates for the (potentially brief) absence of all SNLT value of the money commodity itself.\n\nYou seem fixated on what is the use-value of money. However money\u2019s use-value is its universal exchangeability and its pure use-value as exchange-value.\n\nAs with any ordinary commodity, money\u2019s value can approach zero in the limit, while its exchange-value remains quite substantial. Money\u2019s exchange-value is what allows money to serve as the universal measure of value of all other commodities (even if it has no value itself, as with electronic fiat money; Marx finds the basis of this exchange-value of money, divorced from its value, in the debasement and clipping of coins which already\u2014even with metallic money\u2014divorces the exchange-value, it\u2019s face value, from the SNLT value of money).\n\nMarx lists four functions of money:\n\n1. Medium of exchange\n1. Means of payment\n1. Store of value\n1. Standard of price\n1. Measure of value",

It implies that even use-value is not bound to anything concrete (i.e. \"consumable\"), but to a *social agreement*.\n\nPicture a national bank withdrawing an old set of bank notes and issuing a new set. In the very moment they do, the old bank notes have lost their money. So, their use-value has become zero in just a moment whereas the new notes - which had zero use-value before said date - have not got received use-value serving to exchange for commodities.\n\nThis example clearly demonstrates that money has no inherent use-value, **it's all a social agreement**. A commodity has use-value beyond a social agreement, it is objectively true that you can eat an apple and still your hunger, as is the use of a chair on which you can sit. Sure, you can also burn the chair in a fire, then you have warmth, but it's gone afterwards. But with money you can do almost nothing that has an objective use-value beyond any social agreement.\n\nNone of the five functions you list are inherent to money. They are all based on the assumption that people accept things to be in this way first. For example, if you and me cannot agree on which bank notes to use (you use USD, I use EUR), then, well, sorry, there is no medium of exchange that both of us agree on and therefore both your USD and my EUR bills are entirely worthless. I argue that the primacy is with the social agreement, not the use-value of money, as clearly there exist many situations where the social agreement falters or changes and the money itself immediately becomes worthless.\n\nI am truly puzzled that Marx, apparently, did not see things this way, as it's so completely obvious if you just think for a short moment.",

So if Marx saw it all backwards, he would never have been recognized as the genius he is (he would lack that genius). \n\nMarx saw nothing as inherent. Everything is dialectical and overdetermined (to borrow the term from Freud and Luk\u00e1cs). Any thing that does not fulfill those functions of money is not money. You instead call something that is not money by the moniker \u201cmoney\u201d and then complain that it is not money but nevertheless has the moniker that you yourself errantly applied. \n\nYou say \u201csocial agreement\u201d but it is larger than that. Money is a social phenomenon and it is always social conditions that comprise money (whether the agreement is pervasive or not). It is always relational\u2014always socially contingent. There is no such thing as money independent or social conditions. To think otherwise is to misunderstand money and society. If both parties to an exchange do not recognize the \u201cmoney\u201d as money, then it is not money (though their might be other bearers of ordinary commodities who do acknowledge the money functions of the commodity bearer\u2019s money commodity). \n\nYou yourself introduce the fallacy here from your own fallacious thinking and then complain that others are fallacious. It is what psychologists call projection.",

But then again, I would argue: yes, there are things that people don't just \"believe\" in, at least from a pragmatist's perspective. If you have an apple you *can* indeed eat it and still your hunger. I would argue that's more than just a believe, although, obviously, it also has a believe component. But with money (or laws, by the way) there's really no inherent value in it, the scale is very much skewed towards the believes and it's hard to come up with a meaningful argument what any inherent value would be other than the believe itself.\n\n> When solely money compensates labor-time, that epoch marks society entering a novel and world-historic crisis.\n\nNot sure I understand you here - isn't that what has already happened, i.e. labor-time is solely compensated through money? (Let's forget about ideas of self-realization through work and such motivational factors for a moment and focus on the daily grind we undergo.) Or are you saying, that in the past there existed a non-capitalist society where people essentially did not exchange labor-time against money, and hence that society was neither capitalist nor capitalistically ideological?",

I am interested in what value *money* has according to Marx, not what value *commodities* have according to Marx. (Let's not get into discussions about that it takes such-and-such a time to produce a single dollar bill or coin, these are negligible for the moment.)\n\nIf money is backed by e.g. gold, then the value of money is, well, the value of gold. BUT: That does not solve the issue really. The value of gold is defined by its money value, not by its use-value. There's really little use-value of gold as I pointed out (sure, it does not corrode, it's pretty, etc., but it's barely useful.) If this is how Marx defines the value of money, then this is a pretty odd definition to me given it's circularity.\n\nIf money is backed by e.g. gold, and gold gets its value from labor to mine and produce it (rather than from its use-value), then essentially money is backed not by gold but by the labor to produce gold. In that case, it's not correct to state that Marx truly believes money gets the value from gold, but it would be more correct to state that money gets the value from the labor to produce gold as money's substitute.\n\nHowever, that leads to a fallacy problem of some sorts. What *is* the value of labor? Well, that's expressed in money. But what *is* the value of money? Well, that's expressed in labor (to mine gold which backs money)!\n\nSo, we end up with a circular definition.\n\nNow, given that the definition of value of money and labor apparently is self-referential, then it would be more correct to state that money *and* labor receive their value simply through *attribution* of value, i.e. from people's *believes*. It is then, according to this logic, not the *labor* that gives value to money, but the *social agreement* everyone buys into (or our mental believes, or our attribution) and takes for granted.\n\nAnd I am wondering whether Marx did or did not say anything along those lines.",

Well, that's expressed in money. But what is the value of money? Well, that's expressed in labor (to mine gold which backs money)!\n\nNo, this is completely wrong. It only goes in one direction. Money is a commodity which has a value expressed in labour. The labour is how value is *defined*.\n\nAs simply as possible, in Marx's writing:\n\n\"Exchange-value\" and \"value\" are synonyms. \"Use-value\" is not a synonym, but a different concept.\n\n\"Money\" is not a measure of exchange-value, but prices in any currency or relative to any fixed store of value tend (under certain modelling assumptions) to fluctuate around a fixed average correlating to exchange-value.\n\nAristotle and Adam Smith said that labour creates value. Marx says this is too simple: he says it is the *average across society*, which is based on the level of technology and division of labour in that society. He calls it \"socially necessary labour time\".\n\nThis is a definition - a labour theory of value - so there are no layers beneath that or circularity. All economic theories have some starting assumption of what \"value\" is. This is essentially the problem economics is trying to solve: what is \"value\"? In this regard Marx has the same base answer as the classical economists, but he develops his theory to the point of exposing the contradictions of capitalism.",

Another thing to pay attention to while reading is the concept of \"value,\" as it has 3 distinct usages in Marxism, use-value, exchange-value, and value (referring to congealed socially-necessary labor time). Understanding this could sharpen your discourse, as it's not clear what you mean when you talk about money that has no value",

            "body": "Money is a commodity. It's value is determined the socially necessary labor time to produce the money commodity. Marx historically lived in a time where Gold or Silver were the national currency. It's important to understand, that for Marx this money commodity was more than just an aspect of his value theory. The money commodity is constitutive for (monetary) value itself. (To read more about this, read Backhaus: \"Dialektik der Wertform\")\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nOf course today's paper money and money theories at first glance don't seem to have any direct correlation with gold or silver. Marx called it \"Wertzeichen\" a representative of value. The paper itself is worthless, but it represents the value of gold/silver that in theory can be exchanged for gold/silver at the bank. If you're interested in this, read the appropriate chapters in \"A contribution to the critique of political economy\". Michael Heinrich discusses the relevancy of the Wertzeichen in his work \"Die Wissenschaft vom Wert\".\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nAs said Marx would be perplexed by the digital money, that we have today and the dissolution of any equivalence to a gold standard. It could very well be, that his whole theory of value would be completely different as he would have to address certain new aspects of the development capitalist economy. But this should not discourage us to look at the theory he developed addressing his own historical situation. Certainly we have a false perception if we think that the money on our bank accounts is just sitting there idly. The bank uses that money to lend out credits, that are greater than the amount on the bank account. This money is used in all sorts of ways. Financial capital is transformed into industrial capital for example if the bank issues a loan for factory equipment in exchange for interests.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nWe rarely see a truly idle \"buried treasures\" in our economy. Most of the money in our developed capitalist mode participates as capital in the value creation process in some way and is therefore not just money in the sense of a printed dollar note with the sole and only use value of being exchangeable with any commodity. However for Marx even in crisis, when money is not used in exchanges as commerce comes to a standstill money, i.e. gold/silver, retains its value, i.e. the socially necessary labor time to produce it. In crisis money has its use value as the aforementioned treasure. If Warren Buffet for example hoards US-Dollars in cash instead of real estate or shares in companies this might well be interpreted as a preparation for a crisis in that sense.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nI highly encourage you to read the first chapters of Capital and \"A contribution to the critique of political economy\". These chapters explain the basics of Marx' theory of money. They don't however explain the complex function that money serves in value creation and interests, fictious capital and more. To really understand money you're going to have to read the whole of capital 1-3 as much of a task it is.",
