Absolutely phenomenal read, and I highly recommend it.",

It is as minimum one of main factors.\n\nSecond one, in my believe, is that traditional family come form the fact that it is more optimum for people to live next to land they are working on. And that mean dissolution of communal living in favor of family housing with discovery of agriculture.",

            "body": "It is generally correct in its overall conclusions and the analysis is groundbreaking particularly for the time, he basically founded a whole school of thought of anthropology and created the Marxist answer to feminism through the lens of dialectic and historical materialism. The evidence used is outdated and he got a few things wrong which is to be expected given the limited means he had available. \n\nhttps://marxistleftreview.org/articles/the-origins-of-womens-oppression-a-defence-of-engels-and-a-new-departure/\n\nThis is a good summary and also a modern contribution written by a comrade of mine. There\u2019s plenty of other work out there as well by feminists and Marxists and anthropologists and the crossovers between them. I would be a wary of anything that challenges Engels argument that women\u2019s oppression stems from class society. That fundamentally falls back into the liberal conception of oppression as stemming from abstract ideas and not class. There\u2019s a reason many modern feminist circles try to do takedowns of it. We must reject the liberal conception of oppression that sees it as just something floating in the aether as something detached from material reality or worse, biologically determinist based on \u201cgender.\u201d\n\nMuch more work has been done on pre class and early class societies which I think every Marxist should pay close attention to. The development of early class society and the resistance to this reifies our current understanding of class society now and arms us with knowledge to challenge the status quo arguments of liberals that think women have always been oppressed by men and human beings are inherently greedy, possessive, lecherous and violent.",
