    "selftext": "Kia ora - greetings comrades.\n\nHere to let you know about the first issue of The Red Paper - a revolutionary Marxist paper from Whanganui-a-Tara, Aotearoa (Wellington, NZ). Like a lot of you we are horrified by the way the world is going - climate crises, increasing imperialist rivalries, the devastation of Palestine, increasing impoverishment of the working class and the growing rise of the far right. So we decided to write about it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHere is a link to the website with the PDF: [https://tepouwhero.webflow.io/?fbclid=IwY2xjawF9f39leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHVo3306l0Y5DF5h1uKWAKTHgk89m86K\\_TsMAeXIzx5t9bxxfKKFDebVaeA\\_aem\\_koEyRzM3FC2oUoobHbM1Kw](https://tepouwhero.webflow.io/?fbclid=IwY2xjawF9f39leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHVo3306l0Y5DF5h1uKWAKTHgk89m86K_TsMAeXIzx5t9bxxfKKFDebVaeA_aem_koEyRzM3FC2oUoobHbM1Kw)\n\nThe paper has a crossword, a chess puzzle and cartoons so it's not all serious business.\n\nWe invite you to share your thoughts, feedback, and ideas.

I think it's important to note that tino rangatiratanga and indigenous movements in general are not homogenous. It has been coopted for sure by some politicians for instance, whereas there is also a more radical edge.",
