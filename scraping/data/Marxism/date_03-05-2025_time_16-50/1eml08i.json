    "selftext": "I'd really appreciate if you could recommend documentaries on how Chinese people lived in the 20th century. Their habits, day-to-day lives, political leaning and opinions, how they dressed, etc. I know it varies between regions but I'm looking to watch multiple docs so it doesn't matter if some are specific to certain communities.\n\n(I'm asking for recommendations here to escape the anti-communist bias most documentaries carry)",
