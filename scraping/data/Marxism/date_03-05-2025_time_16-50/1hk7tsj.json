As a result of a collapsing economy in the face of hard socialism, they went deep into debt and tried price controls, along with trying to print their way out of it. Printing money devalues it and you get the classic \"too much money chasing too few goods\". Eventually, people lost all faith in the currency.\n\nIs that really what happen to Venezuela money or was there other factors that lead to massive inflation?\n",

                    "body": "The biggest single reason for their collapse was the total reliance on oil exports. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez funded all of his generous social programs with oil revenue, riding out the huge spike in oil prices that peaked in 2008. When the recession crashed global oil markets, Venezuela got fucked particularly hard, and the government began inflating the currency to try to continue to fund its programs. This failed to prevent widespread impoverishment, which led to social unrest, which led to government crackdowns on political opposition, which helped motivate Western powers already hostile to the Bolivarian regime to toughen sanctions, which caused more poverty and unrest, which just repeated the above cycle.\n\nThey\u2019ve never been able to climb out of that death spiral, and it doesn\u2019t help that the US seems determined to keep them in it until they liberalize their economic system, though at this point the rank incompetence of the Maduro government bears a lot of the blame as well.\n\nIt\u2019s also probably worth pointing out that Western exploitation encouraged that initial reliance on the economic house of cards that was funding an entire social democracy on exports of their dirty and uneconomical tar sands oil.",

I would say they endured an intentional assault on their economy from abroad with the Trump admin spiking oil exports, various banks around the world confiscating assets. Meanwhile their domestic spending on(good) social programs was reliant on oil income. Without that income they were forced to either print money to fund those programs, or borrow. Some people think, wrongly in the case of most nations, that any nation that controls the money supply can infinitely print money as long as it is taxed back out of an economy without ill effect. . . fiat currency being what it is I find this view short sighted. The US can do that because the dollar is, for the moment, in high demand abroad. Venezuela not so much. Anyone feel free to correct me, or fill in facts, this is what I vaguely recall happening from doing research at the time. . . it has been years. XD",

Another factor is monetary policy which devalued the currency to boost exports (something a lot of countries do to acquire foreign currencies to make debt payments). They also had some disastrous monetary decisions in the wake of the 2014 crisis which made it worse. And the rest can be blamed on corruption.\n\nAll of this of course is in the context of sanctions and pressure by the US to for regime change. We know Venezuelan elites were creating artificial shortages to force Maduro out. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/world/venezuela-takes-over-supermarket-chain-accused-of-hoarding-idUSKBN0L71W1/",

Chavez could try to use inflated petrol prices to fund social programs to stabilize society and build up the national economy outside the neoliberal imf schemes of the 1990s.\n\nHe could be popular with the people and counter the economic power of the rich because of massive social spending. But when fuel prices crashed, the economy did as well and now there are austerity measures which have eroded the popularity of the government.",

They hoarded food in storage units, and shot up the prices so no one could pay for it. \n\nThen they started withdrawing money from the banks and illegally smuggling out money with US help. Leaving the country way less physical money and no choice but to print more. \n\nThen the US offered to send \u201caid\u201d, which would have most likely been a front for sending in weapons as the US has done that before in other socialist countries it wanted to destabilize. Which the government rightfully refused.\n\nThen the US called it a dictatorship and staged a coup. Seriously; watch the revolution will not be televised. The shit they did was crazy.",

            "body": "To put it simply, Chavez was really stupid...\n\nOne of the early factors that contributed to the economic crisis was Chavez's response to striking oil workers in 2002. In retaliation, Chavez fired ~18,000 workers. That loss of expertise had significant impacts on the production of oil for years to come.\n\nThen, of course, there's the typical boom and bust of monoeconomies. With the 2008 economic crisis, oil prices collapsed, which hit Venezuela pretty hard and resulted in the government being unable to fund their social programs. In response, they foolishly figured printing more money would fix the problem.\n\nSince then, their economy has been unable to bounce back. Sanctions on the country play a complicated role, with many being targeted against individuals. However, some impact the country's sources of revenue, like the oil industry, and others inadvertently make it more complicated for Venezuelan citizens and small businesses to participate in the global economy.\n\nAll in all, I'd say the bulk of the blame lies with the incompetence of Chavez, Maduro, their cronies, and a smaller share on the sanctions. I'm not really a socialist, but I can't really blame socialism as a whole for what occurred. Economic incompetence and authoritarianism aren't unique to socialist leaders, and there's been plenty through history who were purely democratic and could have handled the economy better. But it's a complicated subject and a sore spot for many who were personally affected by Chavez.",
