    "selftext": "My mom keeps sending me instagram posts about it and I'm trying to be supportive of her leftward expansion into political theory but at the same time, this general strike feels like just as much of a gimmick as all the others that have been planned the past decade. On top of that, I don't believe a successful general strike, with their vague list of demands like \"workers get the means of production\" or \"women's rights\" will actually do much. My prediction is that politicians will promise to change a couple of things to break the strike and then never follow through and the capitalist machine will roll on like a train over pennies. No way 3.5% of the population can just strike our way directly into socialism. Not in this country. Or, if the strike is broken up by force, it may accelerate us into class warfare, which is... Well, I'm not an accelerationist. Maybe that's a mistake. I'm open to comments on that, too. \n\nAnyways, thoughts? ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "If these guys join up with the unions led by UAW who are planning a general strike on Mayday 2028 by aligning contract deadlines to expire on that date across multiple unions, then we could have a very successful general strike which is a great way to organize for a better world.  We must do all we can but always seek solidarity with other people who want the same thing, the same rights, and the better world that we want. UAW has been made aware of this group and is in the process of reaching out.  When they touch base I think you have the beginnings of a conscious movement toward economic and social justice that transcends capitalist categories.  A general strike should be boundary breaking, life enhancing and produce a working coalition that can break down the barriers of class, race and gender that hold people in thrall to the capitalist machine.  This new citizen-worker alliance could work through negotiation, communication and legislation throughout society to improve lives and deliver economic rights, social freedom, and political and legal power to the working class and their progressive allies.",

We need concrete organized labor power across many sectors to do a general strike, not just tell everyone to stop buying things or whatever. A general strike can't be a spontaneous action, it takes decades of work and planning.",
