    "selftext": "Heyo all!\n\nBefore I turn to my question, I'd say a bit about my background. I'm a philosophy MA student, hence my journey to Marxism was mediated via the classical German and French philosophers. Essentially Merleau-Ponty, Husserl, Kant and all the way to Luk\u00e1cs. In addition, I'm also a student at a Film Academy where I do audiovisual work. I decided for the latter due to my frustration from philosophy, ever reading without any acts of proper laboring creation. So rather than \"pure art\" of any kind, it was the more manual and tangible things that attracted me.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'd love to ask for an advice. How to perform the artistic praxis as a Marxist? Don't get me wrong, I don't intend to fall for the transcendental view of art and the justification of its production for its own purposes: \"art for art's sake\". That was never my intention. Yet, what is the alternative? Sure, I can focus on Marxist themes: exploitation, alienation, capitalist produced violence and such. But is that enough? Shouldn't there be a specific form - rather than content - pertaining to Marxist artistic praxis? Does Marx/others say anything about the role of art in revolution? \n\nWhere I come from (Czechia), in the leftist circles, the view of art as an imaginative practice has been popular later. Art as the means to imagine a different world, a non-capitalist. I have nothing against this and I used to like it a lot. Take a novel in speculative fiction that paints a picture of a socialist utopia (or capitalist dystopia worse than that of today). Yet, I feel like this isn't enough.\n\nAnother thing I can think of is \"giving voice to those whom it has been denied\". Essentially sharing the standpoint of the proletariat with others. Sure, but isn't that appropriating and patronizing? \n\nAnother issue is the structure of the cultural institutions in my homeland. Do I really want to support state-funded galleries? Commercial cinemas? Private institutions? How meaningful is anti-capitalist art when presented within capitalist institutions? And then of course there's the question of the spectator. Galleries here are frequented by the midddle class, especially the pseudo-independent galleries. How to reliably confront them? \n\nA lot of questions, I know, sorry for that! I'm genuinely at a crossroads though and I'd appreciate some help here. I don't want to fall into a bourgeois conception of the artistic praxis.",

He was a Marxist art critic and that work might address some of your concerns.\n\nIf one of the issues you have isn\u2019t the content of the art so much as the art world that you would need to participate in, then consider how you could organise with other artists to create alternative structures. Maybe you could get together to form a collective? Maybe you could take inspiration from Yanagi Soetsu\u2019s *The Unknown Craftsman* and the notion of making quality art for ordinary people, often anonymously, as is often the case with craftspeople. Or you could look to socialists like William Morris and John Ruskin and their work as part of the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain.",

            "body": "Have you read these by Trotsky?\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1923/art/tia23.htm\n\n> Art must make its own way and by its own means. The Marxian methods are not the same as the artistic.\n\n.\n\n> What the worker will take from Shakespeare, Goethe, Pushkin, or Dostoyevsky will be a more complex idea of human personality, of its passions and feelings, a deeper and profounder understanding of its psychic forces and of the role of the subconscious, etc. In the final analysis, the worker will become richer. \n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1923/art/tia23b.htm\n\n> It is not true that we regard only that art as new and revolutionary which speaks of the worker, and it is nonsense to say that we demand that the poets should describe inevitably a factory chimney, or the uprising against capital!\n\nThis second essay may be more to your point. I interpret the first to say that it is not really a concern of the political wing as such to dictate or demand anything of art, that art must be self-consciously political. Even the work of reactionary artists can be of use to the new world, can be illuminating and spirit-enhancing.\n\nBut the second essay encourages you to consider the relation of the artist to their art as being, not in a vacuum, but related to that artist's material conditions, to new ways of thinking, new perspectives etc. In other words, if you find your thinking transformed by Marxism, then feel free to make art however you see fit and on whatever topics you see fit, and your new mentality will come through anyway.\n\nMore to the point, \n\n>Art as the means to imagine a different world, a non-capitalist. I have nothing against this and I used to like it a lot. Take a novel in speculative fiction that paints a picture of a socialist utopia (or capitalist dystopia worse than that of today). Yet, I feel like this isn't enough.\n\nI worry that you are overestimating the (*direct*) political significance of art. Because bringing about class consciousness and righting wrongs is not the purpose of art. Expression, emotional development, exploring curiosity, examining life in all its forms - these are the *freedoms* of art. Is it not the purpose of socialism to feel freer, rather than more bounded?\n\n>Another thing I can think of is \"giving voice to those whom it has been denied\". Essentially sharing the standpoint of the proletariat with others. Sure, but isn't that appropriating and patronizing?\n\nYou should make art that is sincere to you, that comes out of your hopes and desires and fears and questions. It is only condescending if you approach it in a condescending way! And how can it be appropriating to tell stories? Is this liberal identity politics more than Marxism? Don't be so concerned with the \"right\" you have to tell a story until you have actually tried to tell it - and see for yourself if you do the subject matter justice. Write what you know and what you are interested in!\n\n> How meaningful is anti-capitalist art when presented within capitalist institutions?\n\nIt could be very meaningful, or not meaningful at all. Why tie yourself into knots over how you might present your art when you haven't made any yet? Perhaps your art itself will dictate how it is best presented to audiences. There is nothing wrong with using the modes and systems at your disposal.",

Majority of values come from consumer. How much time consumer of art put into it enjoyment?\n\nIf some one glance on \"Monna Lisa\" they will not get any Value from art. We get value from art if we connect to it. Perform labor.\n\nSo, purpose of art is to make as think, emotionally, intellectually. It does not matter how much work artist put into it. That is not where Value of art lay.\n\nThat not the case for price of art. Value of art to society and production value are very different thinks.",

There can be no real and effective \u201cfreedom\u201d in a society based on the power of money, in a society in which the masses of working people live in poverty and the handful of rich live like parasites. \u201cAre you free in relation to your bourgeois publisher, Mr. Writer, in relation to your bourgeois public, which demands that you provide it with pornography in frames and paintings, and prostitution as a \u201csupplement\u201d to \u201csacred\u201d scenic art? The freedom of the bourgeois writer, artist or actress is simply masked (or hypocritically masked) dependence on the money-bag, on corruption, on prostitution. And we socialists expose this hypocrisy and rip off the false labels, not in order to arrive at a non-class literature and art (that will be possible only in a socialist extra-class society), but to contrast this hypocritically free literature, which is in reality linked to the bourgeoisie, with a really free one that will be openly linked to the proletariat\u201d. \u201cTo work, then, comrades! We are faced with a new and difficult task. But it is a noble and grateful one\u2014to organise a broad, multiform and varied literature inseparably linked with the Social-Democratic working-class movement. Only then will it be able to fulfil its duty and, even within the framework of bourgeois society, break out of bourgeois slavery and merge with the movement of the really advanced and thoroughly revolutionary class\u201d.\n\n-V.I.
