    "selftext": "Few people know, but in Soviet Russia and the USSR of 1918-1991, the role of the Communist Party in the Constitution was different in different periods.\n\n\n\nThe first Soviet Constitution was adopted in 1918, and this Constitution did not mention the Communist Party at all. Its entire text was focused on the Soviets and the power of the working people. This was not yet the Constitution of the USSR, since the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic had not yet been transformed into it at that time.\n\n\n\nThe second Soviet Constitution was adopted in 1924. This was already the Constitution of the USSR. The party was also not mentioned in this Constitution. In fact, although the party actually has enormous power in the country, constitutionally power belongs to people far from being based on the principle of party affiliation.\n\n\n\nOnly in 1936 was a Constitution adopted that spelled out the leading role of the party (in Article 126). At the same time, a reservation was made that the party united the most active and conscious citizens from the ranks of the working class, working peasants and the working intelligentsia.\n\n\n\nSo, from the moment of the October Revolution until 1936, there was no constitutional requirement for workers to obey the party leadership. However, under Stalin, such a requirement was introduced at the level of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nIn 1977, in the new Constitution, under Brezhnev, the words about the most active and conscious citizens from the ranks of the working class, working peasants and working intelligentsia uniting in the party were removed, but the leading role of the party was already spelled out at the beginning of the Constitution, in Article 6. All those who were looking for a way to work less in party affiliation were actively joining the party.\n\n\n\nSoon Perestroika happens, the USSR collapses, and these same people begin to actively call themselves liberals, conservatives, nationalists and say that they joined the party only because it was accepted, but in fact they always hated communist ideology.",

What if people like Gorbachev, Yeltsin, Chubais and Gaidar join it? What if they become the leaders? The absence of the party in the Constitution is necessary so that the power of the Soviets does not accidentally turn into the power of members of the Communist Party, lying about their communist worldview. Which was the case in the late USSR.",
