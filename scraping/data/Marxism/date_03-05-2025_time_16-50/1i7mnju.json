Most people in the United States are not millionaires let alone billionaires. How can the everyday people see a man like Trump and NOT be able to tell that he doesn\u2019t give a shit about the average Joe. Are Americans that lost\u2026 everything that is happening right now is literally the beginning of the end how could we as people allow this. How !",

They don't care that he grifts and lies because they only focus on what they want to focus on. Making money and being rich is a virtue among maga and something to be praised, it doesn't matter how he got the money, just that he was smart enough to do it.\n\nBut if you're a Marxist you should see how the end already happened a long time ago. Whether Republicans or Democrats win it doesn't really matter because it will be an oligarchy either way, just one that leans center right vs one that's on the extreme right. Is one better that the other? Sure, but not by a large margin. In some sense, the democrats are even more sinister because they pretend to be on the left and actually take the steam out of a lot of true left wing movements.   \n  \nMaybe a swing to the right will show people that right wing billionaires aren't working for the average person.",

Our foremost enemy is capitalism, along with the rich and powerful who prop it up. The best way forward is to grow the Left and the socialist Left so that we are larger than the Right and can win more people over to socialist ideas while not being snuffed out. If things get bad enough, we may have to shift primary focus (temporarily) into more of a united front approach with liberalism where it's more of an everyone-against-the-right approach. We are nowhere near that point. Things would need to (and probably will) get far worse before we should even consider pivoting to the approach that you are advocating for right now.\n\nUnless you are talking about the overall Left instead of the socialist/Marxist Left.",

The population is literally the last to be asked in the process of an electoral candidate being selected. People are given limited choices, more eligible voters don\u2019t vote than vote for either of the main two candidates. TLDR there is a growing right and far right (as well as left) but also people vote for Trump due to \u201cchange\u201d and cynicism. Also, the Democrats lost more votes from last time than Trump gained, so a lot of this comes down to a referendum on Biden and the Democrats post COVID recovery. \n\nBackground as I see it:\n\nNeoliberalism is at an impasse globally since the recession and I think this is why we are seeing this in many places worldwide as well as left radicalization here and there. \n\nIn the US, the war on terror put US imperialism at an impasse. They had wanted to take the initiative after 9/11 and reorganize regions to help be a firewall against Chinese development. They got stuck in regime change adventures, increased the regional power of Iran and Russia, lost a lot of soft power, and lost a grip on Latin America. They\u2019ve gone back and forth from using the US international system (UN etc) and breaking from it for direct interventions, but are having trouble maintaining or gaining strategic advantage. They pivot to Asia and try to leave Eastern Europe to NATO but then Russia seizes the opportunity to push their interests.\n\nCOVID made the US middle class hungry for fascism. It\u2019s weird that it took trench warfare and economic ruin and mass labor unrest for that to happen in other places. Here it was not being able to evict renters for like 9 months that made them hunger for blood. The US middle class was just primed for it I guess, the Vietnam and both Gulf Wars fed right-wing militia movements. \n\nThe relative increase in strikes and slowing profitability and \u201cquiet quitting\u201d seems to have freaked out a portion of the ruling class too as they realize that to be competitive they need to try and squeeze some more money out of people who are already fed up. This is the main difference between 2016-2020 and now. A portion of the ruling class sees Trumpy fascism as a sort of disaster capitalism opportunity. They can let Trump\u2019s reactionary populism create social chaos and then \u201cDISRUPT\u201d the US economy and reshape the working class as they want.\n\nSo if Heritage and DOGE agendas go ahead it means renewed ruling class assault on everyone. My hope and what I think is the big unknown factor and what the Trump elite may be overlooking is the possibility of renewed labor militancy and increased popular support for labor. A strong generalized reaction by non-union workers or more youth lead militant wave within union in response to attacks on union rights would change the political dynamics in the US. It would provide a counter to the Democrat\u2019s tech liberalism and Trump\u2019s also tech-backed fake populism. The threat of renewed labor militancy might make more small-c conservative sectors of US capitalism close ranks on the \u201clibertarian\u201d-fascist billionaires and force Trump to lower the temperature.\n\nAt any rate DOGE makes it clear that at least a vanguard of the ruling class sees making us suffer and direct militarism as the ways out of their economic and imperial problems. If they want to turn the clock back to the early 20th century then we need to respond at least like the Wobblies or CIO\u2026 or better!",

Under capitalism profits call the tune - a decline in profits is what brings on economic crisis. Owners of capital will do anything to ensure profits rise, including resorting to utter barbarity.\n\nLast time, in the 1930s and '40s, profits rose after the \"dead wood\" was cleared in the Second World War. I'm not sure I see a new major power war in the offing, yet, but I'm not sure how else capitalism reinvents itself again when it's this far gone already.\n\nFor more I suggest the excellent Marxist economist Michael Roberts' blog: https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/",

Fascism is historically a violent reaction by the bourgeoisie against attempts at using democracy or populism for actual progress -- when capitalists must choose between democracy and maintaining their privileges, democracy is quickly jettisoned. The nonvoting bloc of eligible Americans is the biggest \"political party\" of all, for good reason: \"everyday Americans\" have known for decades that elected officials do not AND *can not* work to help them, the system is rigged so no matter who wins, they will serve billionaires & the status quo. This fact has become so inescapable that even conservatives pay lip service to it, promising to fight \"elites\" and \"corruption\" -- just like the Nazis referred to themselves as \"socialists\" to help confuse the frustrated & betrayed proletariat of Germany.\n\nYou're not seeing a brand new stage happening out of nowhere. This is the inevitable result of decades of \"government of, by, and for the people\" being compromised by the will of capitalism. These are the exact conditions for revolution. And with utmost predictability, the United States, after a century of violently fighting international communism to protect its financial interests, after a century of pretending they possessed the \"third way\" between fascist authoritarianism and communism in this fantasy image of democratic capitalism, has slowly come round to realizing with painful clarity the choice between \"socialism and barbarism\" -- or now, socialism and extinction. \n\nThose who hold power in this country are fighting the inevitability of this choice by every means at their disposal, deceit having been their main tool (so far). Fighting in the streets and authoritarian crackdown will follow. But because communism has a future, and capitalism does not, they will fail. The question is: are we ready for this moment in history, will we be organized, and will we be able to manage these events as they unfold to prevent as much destruction & chaos as possible?\n\nWith so many radicalized people finally sick of the electoral system, Marxists need to fill the gap and provide the leadership, or this will all be wasted, the building outrage misspent, progress delayed, and worse disasters will continue to unfold",

It's super super easy to look at conservatives and go \"God these people are stupid how can they not see what's going on???\" I get it, I've been there. However, it's not human nature to hate each other, this isn't something that appeared out of nowhere. America is built off racism, colonialism, white supremacy etc. These oppressive systems are ingrained into our conscience. We're told in kindergarten that our history was all peace and love and as we grow up our history is still glazed over. This is especially true if you grew up how I did, a middle class white kid. It's hard to see and understand oppression when you aren't experiencing it. Honestly I was only radicalized because I'm disabled, queer, and neurodivergent, if I grew up how my brother is I'd totally be as liberal as my parents are. Which brings me to my next point (ass messy as this is lol), how you're raised plays a HUGE part in your politics. A lot of conservatives grow up around conservative politics, back to my point about indoctrination. Even if it's subtle things like victim blaming or respecting authority. When you only see things that are meant to radicalize you, its really hard to deradicalize yourself, especially with the internet being a significant part of everyday life. Even before the internet, right wing media has been the main source of information. Also, right wing narratives are meant to keep you stuck in it, going deeper and deeper until you're a nazi or some shit. It's meant to confirm biases, it's meant to give you quick and easy answers to your problems. Can't get a girlfriend? It's because women are subhuman, not because you need to work on yourself. Scared of the homeless? It's because they're all drug addicts and thugs (ough this hurts) not because they're victims of systemic oppression and lack of mental health resources. You get the point. And just as a note, I'm not excusing any of this behavior, just explaining it. There's no point in getting horribly upset with people to their face, it only drags both of you further apart. Of course it's okay to express your emotions, I'm just saying that communicating through anger is counterproductive. You can express yourself without making the situation worse. Your emotions are for you to process on your own time. My point is, being understanding is key and no one is radicalized by their own fault.\n\nSorry this is so long and messy this is a reddit comment and I have no one to talk about this with.

Who honestly believes they aren't as captured by corporate interests as the right wing?\n\nPopulists simply do not care about Trumps conduct, in their mind everyone in D.C. is a corrupt cockroach. We just spent two decades gaslighting the American public into going to war and bombing over a dozen countries based on known lies with zero accountability. Trump is the rights embrace of a sort of domestic \"Realpolitik\", it's not about his conduct or character but about throwing a brick through D.Cs window\n\nYet at events of \"polite society\" George Bush and Obama are received well and Trump is the one that's portrayed as problematic. In a sane society Bush and Obama would be tried for war crimes and imprisoned. I don't know where people are getting this idea that America was just nice and peachy then along came Trump out of nowhere for no reason at all and ruined everything it's quite strange",

The narrative of how the Nazis came to power almost paints it as if it was some fluke of nature. It wasn\u2019t. Germany was always imperialistic. Germany always had hostile intent towards Poland. It was always militaristic, nationalistic, oligarchical, and racist. It just took a nation who was so desperate to be comfortable again, and a man that will make all their wishes come true\u2026 just at the expense of anyone else that doesn\u2019t fit into their little world.\n\nWe\u2019re the same as Germany, whether we wanna admit that or not. Fascism was always here. We developed it over the centuries. We committed genocide against the people that lived here, and enslaved people that didn\u2019t. We created a race and sex-based hierarchy. We became militaristic and authoritarian. It just took one man and a people desperate for comfort to make it into what it truly was. \n\nBut, like Nazi Germany, it will fall. They all do, because in reality, they\u2019re weak, but want to appear strong. They base everything on things that can\u2019t sustain them for long, and they will eventually collapse. This is their fate.",
