    "selftext": "Big tech companies have been quick to put an end to or cut back their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, a response to pressure from Donald Trump and his administration. Pushing back against the trend is Apple, whose shareholders voted down a proposal to dismantle its DEI initiatives this week. However, Trump has now personally urged the company to end these diversity policies.\n\nhttps://www.techspot.com/news/106932-donald-trump-tells-apple-get-rid-diversity-programs.html\n\n\nWhat is going on? What is your thought on this?",

            "body": "American politics is a contest between different segments of the bourgeois class. What you are seeing play out is a fight between older more established capital vs new tech capital. Apple being one of the largest most well established companies on earth is firmly on the opposing side of that fight. Their concern is long term success as opposed to the snatch and grab antics you see from the currently empowered tech capitalists. To that end Apple and its shareholders understand that this right wing pendulum swing will come to an end and once that pendulum swings left (culturally speaking) they\u2019ll be un-phased by this mess. \n\nThat\u2019s my simple understanding of the situation at least.",

            "body": "I think drawing on Marxist feminists like Silvia Federici is useful for explaining this one.\n\nNeoliberalism, as a form of capitalism, included a level of 'girlboss feminism' that takes women more and more away from reproductive labour in the home and towards productive labour in the workplace. This caused a lot of household jobs to be outsourced to companies (cleaners, nurseries, deliveroo &c.). Neoliberalism encloses the home. \n\nThis increases the cost of reproduction of workers (labour power). Reproduction of workers happens on two scales, everyday reproduction: eating, bathing, rent etc. and generational: having and raising children. If the cost of everyday reproduction gets too high, people stop having kids because they either don't have time or don't have money.\n\nIn the short term this is great for Capital--lots of labour power means lots of profit. However, they've created a reproduction crisis where birth rates have gone through the floor. To ameliorate this, imperial core capital is relying on importing migrant work from the periphery. This has led to 'great replacement' theories gaining popularity with those whose class consciousness is non-existent.\n\nA certain section of the Bourgeoisie is very anxious about this looming crisis--labour power will drop off a cliff if something isn't done. This explains the pro-natalist trends amongst the some silicon valley right wingers.\n\nSilvia Federici makes the point in Caliban and the witch that when society gets into a reproduction crisis, it violently doubles down on traditional gender roles. This is twofold--it punishes gender non-conforming people for 'not doing their duty' in making babies and forces women back into households to reproduce the next generation. This explains the rise in homophobia, transphobia and misogyny from the right. Think how Transphobes tend to focus on the perception that transitioning 'sterilises' people.\n\nTargeting DEI hits all the goals of blaming immigrants to take the heat off of capital for causing this crisis, punishing gender binary transgressions and forcing women out of the workplace to spend more time making the next generation of workers.\n\nA social democratic way of solving the same problem would just be to reduce the working day to 3/2.5 days a week. Capital would lose the same amount of labour power but the reproductive labour could be shared more evenly across households. Though as a Marxist, we should be looking to more revolutionary solutions than that.\n\nTL;DR: Capitalism got so greedy it's preventing the Proletariat reproducing. Now it's trying to solve it by blaming the problem on immigrants and forcing women to have more babies.",

The tech vanguard are promising finance etc that this will re-shift the balance of class forces far to their favor and grow capital through slashing the welfare and regulatory parts of the federal government and selling off education etc.\n\nWith more international competition, monopolistic companies like Apple want more direct government involvement in securing access to international extraction, more support from powerful home empires, etc. the Generals also strategically want to focus on China. So pushing NATO onto the EU and maybe arming little Israel\u2019s all over the world to push your control in various regions is maybe better than the Cold War abs post Cold War US arrangement.\n\nAs best as I can tell we are seeing a convergence of interests due to ramifications of the global recession. Middle class fascism in the form of MAGA and similar movements elsewhere; a right-populist protectionism from manufacturing and other smaller domestic capitalist sectors; an imperial scramble for resources and strategic position as world growth became more unstable; and now tech industrialists needing more resources, growth, places to invest, and to crush increasing labor agitation.\n\nThis is why the Republicans are helping and the Democrats are staying quiet. If Trump pulls it off, do they want to be the politicians or party that tried to pull the breaks on a massive giveaway to the rich and effective doubling-down in neoliberalism?\n\nIf they pull it off, we may be screwed for a while and/or end up in WWIII once they run out of growth from privatizing everything. \n\nBut alternatively, if people successfully organize through labor and social movements to frustrate and stop the agenda - it would likely create the popular expectation of significant government reform and possibly more reforms for popular relief. I think a strike wave or possibly a mass occupation of the square type movement with labor support would cause massive splits in the ruling class and many would rather lower the temperature and cut into profitability to pay for fixing things so that UPS keeps delivering packages and the ports remain open etc.",

A shareholder can easily value diversity more than profit if they feel like the profit is still meeting their needs.\n\nTake, for example, investing in a phone company that you know doesn't use slave labor even though the competitor has higher profits because of their choices of labor. You sleep better at night while still enjoying a profit, and you value knowing you're doing something in the fight for better wages and living standards.\n\nYou are maximizing your perceived value as a shareholder in the company. The same values can be expressed through diversity, equity, and inclusion, not just labor rights.\n\nUnfortunately I'm a capitalist.",

This is the ONLY reason they are pushing back.  Moreover, DEI, like all neoliberal efforts does not disturb the status quo or market capitalism, it reinforces it: see who benefits most and who benefits least from these programs.",

Even, though, the ones who got their places weren't always good. \n\nBut this whole bullshit was called \"equality\", when 97% of the blacks live in ghettos, as before, but they openly changed some whites (throwing them away without a job) to non whites and non men. This is absurd, and that's what they wanted workers to think.\nMake bullshit, call it leftism or even socialism, and then say that if you don't like Trump, you like all those shitty things. Like gender theory, where you either bellieve in god, or in genders, which is both bullshit and doesn't even matter. \n\nAnd so what now? Trump got rid of \"left wing craziness\" and now workers in America treat Trump better, because he got rid of what they call socialism, he got rid of what was pissing off a lot of people. \n\nSo, it's just a circus number, populism and Bourgeois democracy. Nothing special, nothing new.\n\nIt's the same as with the taxes, when they firstly give you a little bit more of medicine and education, then make crazy taxes that make this all useless, after what they return the old taxes, or slightly higher taxes than before, and even less social programs as it used to be before.",
