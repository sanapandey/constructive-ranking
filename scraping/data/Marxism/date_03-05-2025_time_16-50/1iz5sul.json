    "selftext": "Gold costs more than iron, despite taking (largely) the same amount of labor to smelt, shape, etc. Yet one could still say it has more value, despite the same amount of labor. Can this be synthesized with Marx\u2019s theory of Value?\n\nAnother example, because gold does take longer to find and therefore more labor:\nIf I buy an exotic wood, roughly the same amount of money goes into chopping the tree down, milling it, etc. But it is more or less valuable depending on where I live (even factoring in labor required for transport). \n\nTL;DR: Something made of a rarer resource has more value despite requiring the same amount of labor for a cheaper thing. Can this coincide with Marx\u2019s Labor theory of Value?",

This is important, because it is the basis of a lot of very flimsy critiques of Marx's analysis of value that try to focus on this lack of correspondence without understanding the differing levels of abstraction Marx works through.",

Marx doesn't ascribe anything beyond this to rarity except insofar as he contextualizes it in terms of human relations (e.g. oxygen might be the most common element on Earth, but what actually concerns us in the context of analyzing capitalist relations is oxygen that is in a such a form as it can enter those relations as a commodity).\n\nRarity, however, doesn't have any necessary correspondence with the labour time required to bring a thing into human relations. Novelty licence plates with the name \"John\" may require exactly the same labour time as ones that say \"nhoJ\" but I am certain that the latter is significantly more rare (and, incidentally, they are unlikely to realize the same price in exchange).\n\nWhich brings me back to why I've said you've equated rarity with value. To be fair to you, that is imprecise. Rather, you've suggested correspondence between the two, saying that greater rarity exists as a consequence of greater labour time.

I\u2019ve only pointed out what any child could tell you as well, which is that in general rare things take more time and are harder to come by than common things. In terms of the labor theory of value, commodities that require more socially necessary labor time to produce have more value then those which require less and it therefore follows that rare resources which require more socially necessary labor time to extract have more value then those which require less. \n\nAnd although I\u2019d love to hear more about the special world you inhabit where truffles are as quickly obtained as button mushrooms and where you pan out as much gold as you do iron dust, I have better things to do now",

And, indeed, some things are labour intensive on account of their natural rarity. Nevertheless, this is not necessary. There are rare things (in both natural and economic terms) that are not labour intensive at all\u2014often this rarity is purely artificial, as in, say the Magic: The Gathering \"Black Lotus\" card. Original works of art are also often rare, or even singular, not necessarily because they they are labour intensive (there are only 90 copies of the first \"Friends of the Red Army Faction\" demo cassette, but it was recorded in under two hours on a single tape recorder with built-in condenser mic from the 80s, and the art and duplication were accomplished in a single afternoon), but because they happen to be in some sense singular and impossible to reproduce.\n\nMy point is simply\u2014and I don't know why you seem to insist otherwise\u2014that rarity (in the market) does not necessarily correspond to greater labour time. Ironically, you seem to understand this, insofar as you point to two examples of things where the labour required to bring them into human relations is precisely due to their relative natural rarity. This suggests that, on some level, you understand that rarity is a quantitative condition of things. Understanding that, I'm not sure why you make the leap to insisting that this quantitative condition will necessarily require more labour to bring a thing into being as a commodity as opposed to something common. It's just not true, *and* it's totally peripheral.",

I am however confused about why you would think that I do disagree. Never once did I say that rarity *necessarily* corresponds to greater value \u2014 that is why I keep referring you to my prior comments where I\u2019ve clearly qualified my statements by saying things like \u201cto the extent that greater amounts of labor are needed\u2026\u201d At another point, I even outright said \u201cnowhere has anyone made the argument that the mere fact of something being rare [\u2026] necessarily means that its more valuable\u201d and so, again, I am unsure why you continue to believe that my position is what I have explicitly stated it is not. \n\nBecause the content of the concept of rarity itself is that something is difficult to find or relatively scarce in quantity, it is reasonable to say that in general rarer resources will take more labor time to locate, extract, etc compared to relatively common ones \u2014 however, my saying that something is generally so is not the same as saying it is necessarily so. \n\nFinally, and this is beside the main point, i\u2019d also like to point out that rarity isn\u2019t necessarily quantitative \u2014 something may also be said to be rare if it is simply difficult to get, though not necessarily relative to it\u2019s quantity. Pearls and other baubles from the ocean floor, for example, are often quite plentiful where they are found, and yet their rarity arises from the fact that most people are unable to simply take a stroll along the ocean floor to obtain them but instead they may be obtained only by certain very specific types of labor and techniques. So the essence of the concept is less about quantity as such and more, as I\u2019ve said, about the relative difficulty *for us* in obtaining a thing \u2014 which, again, is why it\u2019s reasonable to speak of rarer things *generally* (NOT *necessarily*) requiring more labor to obtain",

You could go down to the Mariana Trench and obtain some weird fish, but that wouldn't guarantee you'd find a buyer for it to overcome the cost of acquisition. The amount of labor you put into obtaining something is not automatically proportional to the demand for that thing. Diamonds are not valuable because they are useful or because they are hard to acquire - they are valuable because they are shiny and provide social prestige. Their shininess is in effect their utility, and while rarity contributes to their social value, it isn't the sole reason for it. Especially when diamond companies were artificially hoarding diamonds to preserve market value for decades.\n\n>why do you think the labor theory of value can't answer this?\n\nHow does the Labor Theory of Value explain Stanley Cups? Regular plastic cups suddenly became a hot commodity for purely social reasons in a way that had nothing to do with changes in their production labor or even their utility. The Subjective Theory of Value can explain it easily: their value is simply how much people think they are worth, regardless of what the actual reason is.",

[The first link](https://redphoenixnews.com/2012/12/07/supply-demand-value-the-mud-pie-argument/) I found about it contains this quote:\n\n\"The \u201cmarket\u201d can\u2019t build things, cannot mine coal or run machinery for the purpose of producing industrial and consumer products. Yet, we are supposed to see it as the chief decider of value, as if labor could be removed from the situation effectively.\"\n\nBut the value of a product is determined by its user. In all cases, this is true. In a society where nobody ate meat, meat would have no value, regardless of the amount of labor used to produce it. Labor is necessary to supply, but supply has no value without demand. Even in \"use value\" this is true, because you can have something that is objectively useful to humans (like meat) that people still voluntarily choose to forgo for emotional reasons.\n\nThe person who wrote this also came to the ridiculous conclusion that a mud pie is essentially the same as a brick because both involve mud at some point, so I suppose it probably isn't fair to base my understanding of this argument entirely on this one person's blog post. Feel free to offer your own counter-examples.\n\n>Furthermore, you are obviously having trouble distinguishing between value and prices\n\nThere are multiple people in this thread trying to argue that diamonds have higher value specifically because they are harder to find, which is objectively and provably incorrect. If there is an issue \"distinguishing between value and prices\" would it not begin there, with the claim that a diamond's value is dependent purely on how hard it is to find?\n\n>I would suggest doing some reading to get a better grasp of the theory you\u2019re trying to argue against.\n\nI would suggest that if I'm in a Marxist subreddit, and I have read Marx thoroughly and cite him daily, and you disagree with the way I interpret Marx, then you should just explain it yourself instead of saying \"read theory\". I am entirely open to *being proven wrong*, I've done it in this very subreddit before and I was fine with it. But the person who did that actually, you know, *proved* it by citing the section of the work that disproved me.",

First off, diamonds have almost *no* use value, especially in Marx's time before diamond-tipped drills and so on became as common as they are now. Their industrial and practical uses are relatively minimal compared to their social use. And the social use is entirely emotional and subjective, to the point that some people reject structurally-identical lab grown diamonds because they think of them as less romantic. And [diamonds are often kept artificially scarce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timtreadgold/2024/12/26/diamond-mountain-casts-a-long-shadow-on-the-sale-of-de-beers/), which undermines the argument that their value is connected to the difficulty of finding them - after all, plenty of diamonds WERE found, and then intentionally hoarded to create shortages.",

The same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines. Diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth\u2019s surface, and hence their discovery costs, on an average, a great deal of labour time.\"\n\n\"If we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour, in converting carbon into diamonds, their value might fall below that of bricks\"\n\nRarity is part of a diamond's value, but lots of things that are rare are not valuable. The value of a diamond stems primarily from *social perception* which is a subjective concept. Social perception also isn't really \"use value\" since you're not using the diamonds for anything - you're buying them because you were told to. Case in point, we literally have the ability to convert carbon into diamonds, and the diamonds remain expensive because people are avoiding the \"converted carbon\" diamonds for subjective emotional reasons. Markets are based on human wants, and human wants are often incredibly stupid. Marx didn't account for this, but Veblen did.",

In the preface to the third volume of *Capital*, Engels refers directly to B\u00f6hm-Bawerk and Lexis and says, \u201cIf they understood what we were talking about, they would go over to our side; if they continue not to, then it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014you can construct a theory of exploitation off marginalism just as well.\u201d\n\nSo ultimately I agree with you. It also doesn\u2019t really matter if I do, seeing as there are marginalists who have taken up Marx (young Joan Robinson, for instance). But I think where you go wrong is you accept the neoclassical narrative that the labor theory of value was just dumb, dogmatic, dogshit, not even worth understanding, and that Marx simply ducked his head and went along with the faith of the times. That\u2019s not the case. Marx propagated a unique form of the labor theory of value\u2014one which I think is very much worth studying\u2014and did so in contradistinction to the majority opinion of his time.",

This is something that has been used by more or less every economist in history.

It\u2019d be better to start with the relationship between the subject and the lord in abstract, no?\n\nRegardless, to the extent that you are describing a real phenomenon with your example (monopoly and violence), then these are two things which Marx does analyze in *Capital*. One of the ways he analyzes them is precisely as disruptions of the steady state of perfectly competitive capitalism\u2014which, if correct, only proves the worth of the value theory. There are a lot of follow-ups to Marx which expand on his insights of monopoly and violence using his model of steady state; here are a few: Kalecki, *Theory of Economic Dynamics*; Robinson, *Accumulation of Capital*; Sweezy, *Monopoly Capital*; and Shaikh, *Capitalism*.",

The members of the community are directly associated for production; the work is distributed according to tradition and requirements, and likewise the products to the extent that they are destined for consumption.

Mineral rights are always won through violence. we can see this process playing out right now in Ukraine where the assignation of mineral rights is essentially determined by \"who has got the bigger guns?\" while the actual labor to extract it will be paid for later.",

For example, it may take more effort to dredge up a big pile of antimony (at 0.2 ppm) than a big pile of iron (at 50,000 ppm) from the earth's crust, but the iron will be put to use by the market much faster, so the market will reward every labor hour spent mining iron more than an hour mining antimony.\n\nSo, labor value curves. Sometimes an object has no extra value simply because people spent a lot of time producing it. All market values are speculative in this way until the product is actually sold on the market. Market speculators, in turn, try to avoid wasting time producing rare commodities until after the market opportunity appears.",

Exchange value is a category that emerges in the social relations of the market and depends on more things than just labour. There are other categories related to value such as use value that also can't be directly connected to exchange value or price.\n\nI think it's relevant to point out that labour doesn't always produce exchange value. But the important point is that exchange value can't emerge without labour (dead labour is another important concept to look into here).",

            "body": "Have you read Poverty of Philosophy? I think its worth pointing out that the \"labor theory of value\" is not uniquely marxist. In fact, it was the prevailing idea of exchange value among bourgeois economists like Smith and Ricardo. Ricardo in particular has large portions of his most prevalent works dedicated to arguing for an even more universal application of the labor theory of value against Smiths more fuzzy approach.\n\nThe reason Marx uses the labor theory of value is because that was what bourgeois economists were using, the whole point of Das Kapital is to use the logic of bourgeois political economy to reveal its own contradictions. \n\nIt is only AFTER Marx that any \"economist\" tries to argue that the *quantifier* of exchange value is supply and demand. Such an assertion is tautological and cannot be compared with an assertion such as socially necessary labor time being the quantifier of exchange value. Supply is meaningless if it is not put in relation to typical consumption. If there is a *decrease* in relative supply, there will be an upward price fluctuation for most commodities. Demand is only measurable as *\"the price that people end up being willing to pay\"*, that is it is completely dependent on what the price ends up being. Therefore saying that supply and demand is the proper quantifier of exchange value is akin to saying that the price is quantified by the price, a tautology. The assertions belong to different categories, the labor theory of value being synthetic, and the \"supply and demand theory of value\" (a fundamental misunderstanding) is tautological, and therefore analytic. x = x and so on.\n\nBasically, supply and demand is very useful when it comes to marginal changes in actual market price, not very useful when making a societal analysis of the relations of production. It's just not very relevant.\n\nI wonder what your sources are for your claim that gold and silver require a similar amount of labor to extract and refine. Some people in this thread argue about rarity leading to a greater amount of labor expended, which is true. It is true not in the sense that a private individual is scouring the jungle in search of gold, but in the sense that gold extraction businesses run 'mine production' operations that have specific protocols and average success rates and so on. More on that here:\n\n[https://www.gold.org/gold-supply/gold-mining-lifecycle](https://www.gold.org/gold-supply/gold-mining-lifecycle)\n\nIn contrast, silver is typically found together with base metals, mined closer to the surface, and not requiring as much labor for mine production. The fact that gold is typically mined at lower levels than silver also means that less labor is required to reach it, and the rock is generally harder, all of these factors contributing to gold mining being more labor intensive. \n\nIf this wasn't enough, gold ore is typically lower grade than silver ore, meaning that an equivalent amount of ore extracted does not result in an equivalent amount of refineable product. Speaking of refinement, the process for refining gold is also more labor intensive than for silver.\n\nI'm too lazy to provide sources on all of this so you may believe me or not.",
