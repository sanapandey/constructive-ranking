    "selftext": "I've come across people analyzing various topics from a Marxist perspective.\n\nI was wondering what is the process behind such an analysis. I feel like I should look for a change of this certain phenomenon and infer which forces influence this change, i.e. which cause it and which oppose it.\n\nBut whenever I try to do it in practice, I fail to do so.\n\nFor example, conspiracy theories. I see the change, they are becoming more present in public discourse. Causes, conspiracy theorists try to share their ideas and scientists try to correct them, but (there is a study about this) misinformation spreads six times faster than information. And I have described how change comes from opposing forces.\n\nBut usually people who do Marxist analysis infer some conclusions about motivations, which I seem to be unable to do. Am I missing anything, or is this approach good and I need more practice?\n\nAny examples of Marxists analysis of any random phenomena?",

            "body": "Fundamentally, Marxism is based on not regarding the world as an assemblage of things. What this means is that \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d cannot be understood just as such. A marxist take on conspiracy theories may have multiple lines.\n\n1. How does the term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d come into being? A Marxist might argue that the popularization of the term \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d by the state to discredit rumors and assertions that JFK was assassinated by the state. \n\n2. Where does the \u201ccorrect\u201d theory come from? A Marxist might see the term conspiracy theory as an attack from official institutions of thought, the university system, as a means of discrediting theories that come from outside of its gatekeeping. Why might they do this? Well, universities as any institution under a Capitalist state are organs for the ruling class. The Ruling Class is interested in furthering its truth. Conspiracy theories can be understood as a kind of class consciousness. People who believe in conspiracy theories often times are not involved in higher academia and are usually actually working class. A Conspiracy Theory then can be seen as a rejection of Bourgeois truth.",

What kind of impact do they have on the different functions of society? How do they impact the economic base of society?\n\n\nUse these questions and then apply them to specific conspiracies to see if your analysis holds true.\u00a0",

To what degree are real conspiracies secretly acted out by ruling class? How can people be educated on the conspiracy of capitalist property relations. How should workers conspire against such a system?\n\n Marxist analysis is about asking questions and shaping them around class. There are rules, tho. Class antagonism is a rule in Marxism. What is good for capitalists is bad for workers and vice versa.",

They must be rooted in the material structure of society. \n\n2. They are moving processes, so rather than material enviroment determining people in a singular manner, they start the process of the development of ideas, but Man, then in his activity in life affects his enviroment, thereby changing his material conditions, thereby changing his ideas and round and round you go in the development of society/Man. \n\nSomething in present material conditions must be generating conspiracy theories, this then compels Man to act ... so what you need to do is uncover this process of development. \n\nTrack and trace it and once you've identified it, you take actions to channel or abolish it.",
