    "selftext": "Good afternoon, \n\n  \nWithout getting too much into detail I am working on an academic paper that discusses the history of the Democratic party with a primary focus from the 1930s-1970s. The paper focuses on the brief creation of the New Deal coalition and the demise of this brief moment of social democracy.\n\nIt is also will delve into the points of conflict within this coalition such as the presence of the Dixie crats and pro segregation Democrats against civil rights advocates, the push and pull labor had with the new deal coalition during the great depression, and the hawks vs doves debates.\n\nWith all this being said, I am making this post to see if there are any critical histories of the Democratic party within this era or critical histories of liberalism as a whole. (preferably from a left perspective but I am open to right wing critiques as well) ",

Nowhere explicitly, but both the Wagner act and the GI Bill of rights factually excluded blacks, which is why they did not participate in the prosperity of the post war era.\n\nOn a different note: There is no relationship between the new deal and Bernstein's Revisionism. Social democracy is revisionist, evolutionary Socialism - not just any set of policies aimed at a welfare state.",
