    "selftext": "Just re-read 18th Brumaire (seemed somewhat appropriate given recent US political news);\n\nWhat\u2019s your big take-away from the book?\n\nFor me, it mostly has to do with Marx\u2019s conception of history; we can dress-up as past revolutionaries as much as we want, our actions will only promote revolutionary change to the extent they interact with \u201cconditions close at hand.\u201d Che Guevara T-shirts and hammer-sickles do not make revolutions\n\nThere\u2019s also the whole cycle of class conflict - the bourgeoise Party of Order at every stage cutting lower classes out of political power (Proles during June Days; the pure republicans; the Petty bourgeoise in 1849; the Legitimist-Orleanist conflict) inevitably leads to their own dismissal as impediments to \u201corder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to not analogize the Nat\u2019l Assembly to modern liberal parties in the west - the Democrats have such a deep fear of striking up political conflict or being branded as \u201cradical\u201d that they leave themselves defenseless to attacks from a populist criminal right wing - they really believe that hollow slogans are all that is necessary to ensure the bourgeoise political order, that the masses will rise to save their bourgeoise democracy at the drop of a hat, despite having no voice in the political process",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "My take away was Marx\u2019s method of political critique. So much of his work is bigger picture, the 18th Brumaire is great because he\u2019s focused on a very specific moment in French politics where you get to see his approach to active bourgeois politics. \n\nI think that\u2019s actually maybe missing in a lot of Marxist\u2019s tool boxes which leads to them ignoring bourgeois politics and seeing it as something they do not need to engage in. That is a big error in my opinion. \n\nTo me it\u2019s maybe his second most important work or something like that.",

Also it is the one where he goes furthest on his critique of the state with the analysis of Bonapartism (i.e. the imperialist state stabilizing class differences, even under the facade of socialism as universal suffrage; Loius Bonaparte was a socialist). In 18th Brumaire Marx shows the importance of working class organizing itself as a separate entity of the liberal forces and can be taken to show the importance of the DOP.",
