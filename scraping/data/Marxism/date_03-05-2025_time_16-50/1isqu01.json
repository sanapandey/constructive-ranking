    "selftext": "Hey good Marxist comrades! I am trying to find a particular passage from Capital v. 1 that describes the subjectivity of the workers. They become used to the relations of production and it changes how they think. I know that Part 8 on primitive accumulation has the famous \"mute compulsion\" passage (recently elaborated by S\u00f8ren Mau, but this part had more about subjectivity. I remember thinking that the passage was a good rebuttal to arguments from the past 30 years about affective labor. Harvey makes something about this passage in the corresponding video (which I also cannot find). Does anybody know what I'm trying to find? ",

The bourgeoise does not believe in the bourgeoise ideals ( traditional liberalism, labour theory of value, protestant work ethic, etc.), they believe in all other weird stuff like trans humanism, individualism et. \n\nThis is the contradiction between workers trade union consciousness (that is liberalism and metaphysics of labour, workerism/[Rousseaunist socialism](https://platypus1917.org/wp-content/uploads/tamasgm_tellingthetruthaboutclass.pdf)) and the incetive of workers to abolish themselves as class (socialism and anarchism).",

                    "body": "Marx Preface to the Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy: \n>  In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \u2013 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms \u2013 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.\n\n>In studying such transformations it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic or philosophic \u2013 in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production. No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.\n\n>Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient,[A] feudal and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as epochs marking progress in the economic development of society. The bourgeois mode of production is the last antagonistic form of the social process of production \u2013 antagonistic not in the sense of individual antagonism but of an antagonism that emanates from the individuals' social conditions of existence \u2013 but the productive forces developing within bourgeois society create also the material conditions for a solution of this antagonism. The prehistory of human society accordingly closes with this social formation.",

As long as this consciousness is lacking, the crisis remains permanent, it goes back to its starting-point, repeats the cycle until after infinite sufferings and terrible detours the school of history completes the education of the proletariat and confers upon it the leadership of mankind. But the proletariat is not given any choice. As Marx says, it must become a class not only \u201cas against capital\u201d but also \u201cfor itself;\u201d that is to say, the class struggle must be raised from the level of economic necessity to the level of conscious aim and effective class consciousness. The pacifists and humanitarians of the class struggle whose efforts tend whether they will or no to retard this lengthy, painful and crisis-ridden process would be horrified if they could but see what sufferings they inflict on the proletariat by extending this course of education. But the proletariat cannot abdicate its mission. The only question at issue is how much it has to suffer before it achieves ideological maturity, before it acquires a true understanding of its class situation and a true class consciousness.",

The true understanding of the working class\u2019s situation and of its true class consciousness has yet to be achieved. Marxists do not have it ready-made for them. But they act like they do. This is how and why Marxism has become a parody of itself, a farce of proletarian class consciousness. Marxism has come to serve entirely other ends than those of proletarian socialism: It has become a middle class \u2014 bourgeois \u2014 ideology of discontents within capitalism, actually of aspirations for more \u201cprogressive\u201d capitalism, and not for overcoming it. The bitter lesson of history \u2014 attended to by the avowed Right \u2014 is that attempts to improve capitalism have made it \u201cprogressively\u201d worse. At least worse in the sense of accumulated problems more difficult to overcome. And certainly worse in terms of a more confounding task politically difficult to engage and achieve. In comparison to past times, the working class seems hopelessly lost in the labyrinth of capitalism, confronted immediately by a host of every conceivable problem more directly than by capitalism itself. It is wishful thinking or ugly naivet\u00e9 to think that as Marxists we can point to all these problems and simply call them \u201ccapitalism.\u201d In this sense, the problem of capitalism has yet to actually present itself. It must be made to. And that will not happen before the working class is organized as a social and political force to confront it. The issue is what stands in the way of that. The Left today is itself an obstacle to working class struggle. If not the most major obstacle, still a very significant one.",

            "body": "This at least is a somewhat related passage from VII Accumulation of Capital ch. 23 Simple Reproduction, but I don't think this is it as it is not directly about subjectivity? Do you remember more about the context?:\n>From a social point of view, therefore, the working class, even when not directly engaged in the labour process, is just as much an appendage of capital as the ordinary instruments of labour. Even its individual consumption is, within certain limits, a mere factor in the process of production. That process, however, takes good care to prevent these self-conscious instruments from leaving it in the lurch, for it removes their product, as fast as it is made, from their pole to the opposite pole of capital. Individual consumption provides, on the one hand, the means for their maintenance and reproduction: on the other hand, it secures by the annihilation of the necessaries of life, the continued re-appearance of the workman in the labour-market. The Roman slave was held by fetters: the wage labourer is bound to his owner by invisible threads. The appearance of independence is kept up by means of a constant change of employers, and by the fictio juris of a contract.\n\n>In former times, capital resorted to legislation, whenever necessary, to enforce its proprietary rights over the free labourer.\n[...]\n\n>Capitalist production, therefore, of itself reproduces the separation between labour-power and the means of labour. It thereby reproduces and perpetuates the condition for exploiting the labourer. It incessantly forces him to sell his labour-power in order to live, and enables the capitalist to purchase labour-power in order that he may enrich himself. [17] It is no longer a mere accident, that capitalist and labourer confront each other in the market as buyer and seller. It is the process itself that incessantly hurls back the labourer on to the market as a vendor of his labour-power, and that incessantly converts his own product into a means by which another man can purchase him. In reality, the labourer belongs to capital before he has sold himself to capital. His economic bondage [18] is both brought about and concealed by the periodic sale of himself, by his change of masters, and by the oscillations in the market-price of labour-power. [19]\n\n>Capitalist production, therefore, under its aspect of a continuous connected process, of a process of reproduction, produces not only commodities, not only surplus-value, but it also produces and reproduces the capitalist relation; on the one side the capitalist, on the other the wage labourer.
