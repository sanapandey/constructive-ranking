I think, nevertheless, that the struggle continues everywhere, even where avowed socialists hold formal political power. There is certainly no country where anything approaching what Marx called socialism exists in such a way as to really constitute the mode of production. It appears often in embryonic forms when workers' struggles reaches their highest peaks. It has also exists as state monopoly capital where its realization has been \"blocked\" (as in the so-called \"actually existing socialisms\" premised on wage labour and capital accumulation).\n\nAs Beckett put it, \"Ever tried.

                    "body": "I want to draw a picture of Spain, specifically the intense cycle of workers\u2019 struggles between 1914 and 1919. During this period, there were over 200 strikes per year, driven by different sectors, each with its own demands, sometimes aligning and merging with others. The labor movement was not a monolith but a confluence of shifting forces\u2014trade unions, anarchists, socialists\u2014responding to industrial conditions and political constraints.\n\nThis period unfolded under a mix of liberal and conservative governments, while socialist organizing took root within trade unions. The documented results were not uniform: 40% of strikes achieved their goals, 30% failed outright, and the remaining 30% resulted in negotiations. If this is not the story of Marxism in action, then what is? It is the dialectic of struggle, reform, and counter-reform that has shaped every moment of history where workers have fought for dignity.\n\nMarxism does not \"create\" class struggle\u2014it merely makes its internal logic visible. Workers do not need to read Capital to know that exploitation exists; rather, the fight for better wages, for time, for conditions, is the real movement that generates political consciousness.\n\nWe often forget where we come from\u2014not because we should be grateful, but because history explains the privileges we enjoy today. Not as charity, not as moral progress, but as the sediment of past victories and defeats. The struggle is not linear; it surges, recedes, and mutates.",

These countries grapple with a pluralist majority of socialists, progressives, libs and right wingers and did not obtain their power by armed struggle. \n\n\n*AES nations* \n\nCuba, Laos, Vietnam, China, DPRK. \n\n\n*Socialist aligned countries* (Pink Tide)\n\nVenezuela, Bolivia, Sri Lanka. Burkina Faso arguably, but was not elected. \n\n\nThe Indian state of Tamil Nadu also has an elected communist party that controls the majority.\n\n\n\n\nUnless your concern was really just about pointing out that Russia is not socialist, which is plain as day.",

            "body": "Hello\n\nWhat I\u2019m going to say is not agreed upon universally among Marxists, but I am going to generally list the big players of what we call Actually Existing Socialism. These players are (incomplete list):\n\nCuba, China, Vietnam, North Korea, Laos\n\nLet\u2019s take a brief overview of these countries\n\nCuba: Cuba is a Marxist Leninist single party state that, despite heavy economic sanctions from the USA, has comparable or better standards of living when compared to most Latin American countries. There are also metrics that they are better than the US at, such as literacy and average life expectancy. They have an almost entirely centrally planned economy.\n\nChina: China is a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist single party state. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s doing alright these days, and it is. The GDP per capita of China has risen from just over $300 in 1990 to $12,500 in recent years. China practices a form of socialism where the \u201cforces of production\u201d a la capitalism are strictly managed by the socialist state. They have a lot of rules that capitalists domestic and international have to follow and heavy consequences if they don\u2019t. Many people including in this subreddit view modern China as a partial or complete abandonment of socialism, but many others view the steps they took as necessary and/or a development of the times.\n\nVietnam: Vietnam is a one party ML country which is closer to China than Cuba in the way they run their economy and government, although they have more of what some communists would say are \u201ctraditional Marxist-Leninist values.\u201d Vietnam is also doing pretty okay, boasting developmental metrics that are some of the best in the region. \n\nNorth Korea: North Korea is a one party state that follows the North Korean communist ideology, known as Juche. This ideology highly emphasizes self determination and mostly adheres to more orthodox tendencies of socialism. This country is better off than most media coverage depicts it, but it suffers greatly from being alienated from the global market due to some of the harshest sanctions in the world.\n\nLaos: Laos is a one party communist state as well, and it follows an adaptation of Marxism-Leninism that incorporates the situation of the Laotian natural resources and economy. Laos, alongside the other socialist nations, has suffered greatly from imperialism, but they also suffer from a lack of industrial resources. Laos has also suffered from a lot of internal conflict. As a result it is one of the most underdeveloped nations in the region. \n\nHopefully this gave an informational rundown on the 5 countries that socialists would normally consider \u201cactually existing socialism.\u201d There are other movements that have a decent amount of traction, such as the Katipunan in the Philippines or the zapatistas in Mexico, but these aren\u2019t representative of their governments.",

            "body": "When we're talking about whether a country is practicing Marxism, the definition of the marxist country must be on the table first. The original thought of Marxism about an ideal country should be like this, in my summary and understanding:\n\n* **Abolition of private property** in favor of communal ownership.\n* A **temporary proletarian state** to dismantle capitalist structures.\n* **Stateless, classless communism** with freedoms predicated on equality.\n* Global solidarity and an end to **alienation** under capitalism.\n\nAccording these standards, no country/regime can fit right now and before. But just as the summarized methodology from marxism said, **abstract theory came from and will go to the objective and spesific practice or nicht das Bewusstsein bestimmt das Leben, sondern das Leben bestimmt das Bewusstsein**. So a practice marxism discussion might have an agreement that an ideal aim of marxist country should not be dogmaticly applied.\n\nBased on that, I think the question would be \"which countries still have the aim/struggle to realize the ideal society of marxism?\"  Then it's very easy to see: China, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba are still having national society aim of Marxist-Leninism. \n\nAnd as a lot of commentors mentioned, what they have done is more representive than what they have said. There are a lot of proofs that those countries have done against the original mind of marxism, such as\n\n* state \"withering away\" vs. entrenched bureaucracy\n* collective ownership vs. state capitalism\n* human liberation vs. state censorship\n* proletarian internationalism vs. nationalism\n* ......\n\nBut Engels also said \"Ein Unze Aktion ist ein Zentner Theorie wert.\" Under the current historical condition and international environment, a judgement for whether the country is still practicing the aim of ideal marxist society should also be made with historical materialism, checking the actions/policies of these countries that are approaching or leaving away the final purposes.",

The building of socialism is a long process that requires specific conditions, political developments of the proletariat and tackling the question of the form of the state and the property of the means of production.  By Lenin's own words, even the early Soviet Union (which war far closer to socialism that it would ever be afterward) wasn't yet a socialist state as it just was an improvement of the former tsarist, feudal, and russian nationalist system.\n\nRussia is a liberal and nationalist state as most other countries. China embraced revisionism and state capitalism. Cuba never was a socialist revolution from the beginning it just adopted marxism-leninism as its official ideology as a means to drew closer to the USSR and adopted soviet-aligned policies on the economy and the form of the state.\n\nNote : this doesn't mean there are no actual communists in these countries.

There are some countries with more organized and powerful working classes with a greater but varying degree of say on government policies and a varying degree of socialistic types of ownership and distribution, such as Nicaragua and Venezuela. China Vietnam and Laos have totally reverted to capitalism, and by the 90s and early 2000s allowed an almost cartoonish level of exploitation of their workers by US monopoly capital although have improved this to some degree in recent years. Venezuela has recently been reversing course as well and is causing a lot of strife among the working classes, the communist party is now openly opposed to the government which was not always the case.\n\nIn short, we are losing massively and have been for a long time.",

            "body": "Leninism is specifically a strategy for the period when Capitalism enters decay. Lenin defines decay to be when industrial technology stops improving and stagnates. Lenin believed the Decay period began in the 1890's.\n\nDecay essentially ended in the 1960's when computing technology caused new improvements in industrial technology. So we are now in a Dynamic period of Capitalism.\n\nBecause of the end of the decay era, a lot of Leninist countries shifted back to some form of State Capitalism. Cuba, Vietnam, China, Russia all did this. The exception is Russia which has been trying to rebuild Tsarism, which essentially means it is Fascist.\n\nChina is mix. They still have the Communist Party as the vanguard of the workers, but they have shifted to capitalist production under state guidance. They implemented social credit and other methods of social organization to prevent the mass Bourgeoisization of the Proletariat during this State Capitalist period. So when world Capitalism enters decay again, the workers can seize power.",

It's part of the Six Accelerations. They call it Social Governance and it's considered the modern equivalent of the Communist Party. Its purpose is to function as the Vanguard of the workers in the internet era. The goal is to prevent the Chinese Bourgeoisie and capitalist companies from influencing the workers and breaking down their class consciousness. This prevents the mass bourgeosization of the workers that happened in other countries, like the US.\n\nIt's role as the Party Vanguard makes it a huge component of the Chinese State.",
