Hope some of you are kind enough to read, give me honest criticism but remember I\u2019m a baby philosopher \n\nHave We Tasted the Boot?\n\tGeorge Orwell, legendary author, activist, and anti-fascist, saw the rising dangers of totalitarianism and fascism firsthand. After fighting with anarchists in Spain during the Spanish civil war, he famously wrote in his book 1984 \u201cIf you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face- forever.\u201d (176). Orwell was warning us of the dangers of Totalitarianism, which theorist Hannah Arendt defines in her 1954 essay On the Nature of Totalitarianism as \u201cthe most radical denial of freedom.\u201d (90). Americans are quick to point out what we see as a totalitarian regime. Defying all definition, a hive-mind of programmed thinkers can be easily misled into labeling a democratically elected socialist government tyrannical, totalitarian, and an enemy to human rights, while simultaneously not knowing what constitutes totalitarianism. Ignorant to the fact that tyranny and totalitarianism are two different ideological forms of philosophical governance systems. All the while, a fascist regime will be a beacon of freedom, as it holds American interests. Americans will buy Ukrainian flags, support weapon sales, and prepare for war as our ally bans opposing political parties and embolden Neo-Nazis. What is behind the mass consent which gives power to the institutions that lays the framework for fascism? Does America really hold dear the value of \u201cfree speech for all\u201d while imprisoning anti-capitalist protestors and voices? Why are black liberation groups criticized for arming themselves at protests, while police protect White Nationalist groups doing the same? Are we free? Who is in charge? The answer: No, and not us. America is not susceptible to totalitarianism, it is innately totalitarian in its oppression of the working class, working towards the self-destructive and dialectically contradictory goal of infinite growth of profit for the Bourgeois class who founded and continue to run this nation in the interest of the capital owner only. This American regime is unique in its effectiveness at telling its people they are free while mentally disarming her working class. While I do find Hannah Arendt's philosophy of the systems of totalitarianism slightly flawed, if one uses a dialectical approach considering the history of class antagonism while using her definitions of totalitarianism, it become clear that we are not only being subjected to the endless boot of fascist totalitarianism, but embracing it, simply because we have been trained to by the very design of the Capitalist system\n\tA quick survey of the average daily lives and emotional state of Americans is in order before we examine this totalitarian state. The National Institute of Mental Health has found that 7.8 percent of all adults in the United States have experienced a major episode of depression. In a more telling statistic, this number nearly doubles to 15.2 percent in young people aged 18-25. In a 2022 Gallup poll, 50 percent of American workers reported feeling stressed and disconnected from their job on a daily basis, with 22 percent going as far as to say they are sad and distressed. As a student, I have experienced and struggled with these feelings of helplessness, falling into deep depressive states as I feel powerless to make a change. Through a critical analysis of these conditions through a dialectical materialist view, it become clear this is by design of the system we live in. How does this relate to totalitarianism? Hannah Arendt makes clear the distinction between strength and power. Power is simply the potential for action in a public sphere. This power lies in unity between the people; it is impossible to hold power as an individual. Strength, on the other hand, is our ability to withstand mental attack, the will to persevere. Keeping in the terminology of Emanuel Kant, The human drive of survival suggests strength as a concept to be a priori knowledge, which in hand suggests conflict and struggle between classes to be a universal an a posteriori inevitability, validated by Hegel\u2019s dialectic and illustrated in his theory of the Slave-Master relationship. In strength, tyranny and totalitarianism radically differ according to Hannah Arendt . Tyranny lacks the strength of totalitarianism because it can only effectively divide its masses, but is unable to prevent to dissent and vulnerable to the eventual strength of said populace, while totalitarianism effectively divides and wears down its mass's mental strength in order to prevent its destruction as and manufacture consent for its abuses. Capitalistic America\u2019s ruling class not only sees the danger of unity, but also the danger of education and mental strength, the courage to speak out. Arendt argues that isolation is the most effective tool of totalitarianism, writing that \u201cin complete loneliness, we realize that one man alone has no power at all but is always overwhelmed and defeated by superior power.\u201d (94). Marx\u2019s theory of alienation very simply explains how capitalism naturally isolates the individual, Capitalism\u2019s strongest tool in hindering the development of class consciousness, a step necessary for radical systemic change, as a tool of self-preservation. The further specialized an economy or workplace becomes, the less the worker sees the fruit of his labor and thwarts more profit is stripped from his labor. He feels increasingly lost and disconnected from his human nature and from the people around him, seeing them simply as competition in a wage driven society. As the power the working class and autonomy in the workplace and political sphere slowly diminishes, the strength is worn down, reducing said worker to something subhuman in the eyes of the bourgeois class, the nameless laborer, the assembly line worker, the gig worker. When the mental strength of an individual is worn down, power changes from potential into a pipe dream. Why fight? Why work to change a system that has already won? Furthermore, Marxist theory and literature that assures the worker he has  the strength needed to enact political through unity and the same militant action by which all nations were founded is demonized and hidden from him. He is taught that his place in the world will always be that of a worker, not a revolutionary. The masses have successfully been indoctrinated to believe the causes of the bourgeois classes are in their interest, effectively betraying his class and the interest of their fellow man. \nThis is our reality, an innately totalitarian nation characterized by its suppression of the masses, its attack on our strength, and its global imperialistic geopolitical interventionism against Democratic sovereign nations who challenge American homogeny. The means of capitalism\u2019s self-preservation, specifically the use of force by the state to protect capital, and their subsequent justification of said force to the public, when critically analyzed through a materialist lens clearly shows that the capitalist implementation of the jesuit morality in proletarian culture to which its bourgeois ruling class is not beholden to to be yet another self-preservation method of capitalism through coercive corporate media complicity. This force is exerted through both physical and psychological means. These methods are a psychological and spiritual attack on our strength. Dismissing these forms of consent manufacturing as not an act of violence simply because they are not necessarily physically harming us; they are training us to harm ourselves through capitalist coping mechanisms to dull and destroy our bodies, anything to placate the desire escape the prison of our totalitarian existence. We also must critique the state monopoly on physical violence, inflicted on its own citizens through its police force and against the exploited global masses with its military action, repression of colonized populations, and the occupation of countless countries for use as coward operating bases as an intimidation tactic against threats to western imperialist interests. These same tactics, specifically state violence, have historically been used as means of colonial repression by western colonizing powers. In accordance with Michel Foucault\u2019s boomerang theory, these same methods of repression inevitably will be and have been used against its own citizens. This has been very publicly demonstrated through the militarization of police and modern \u201criot\u201d tactics. This violence strengthens the mental and physical control of the ruling class and demoralizes its opponents. This violence however is only one mean of placation and is not the sole source of the American establishment\u2019s political power; Its institutions are designed to ensure its survival and prevent the fostering of strength among the masses, differentiating America as a totalitarian state from a tyrannical state, as the tyrannical state derives from force alone, a contradiction which inevitably leads to the growth of strength in the populace. When means of repression are unable to deter self-development of strength, they are at risk of violent revolt of the masses. The success and power of Americas force is dependent on its ability to shape culture and morals.\n While Hanna Arendt describes force as always illegitimate, history clearly shows that force has been the only successful path for mass populist movements seeking systemic change. to disagree with her. Arendt states that violence is used by the powerless, while it is clearly used with impunity by the ruling classes. Arendt asserts that force is never a substitute for power, to which one must ask: If strength is a necessary prerequisite for political power and is successively suppressed in the population, then how will the masses ever gain power? The success of the American empire has disproven her opinion that force is never legitimate and is disregarded by the ruling class, relegating the working man to a morality that disempowers him and discourages resistance and the formation of legitimate political strength. Her conclusion that violence and force are illegitimate forces are ahistorical, completely disregarding the success of almost every mass militant proletarian action in enacting total political change. The people have NO power except for the power of mass organization and armed struggle, which is inherently violent. There is a reason any possibility of violence is met with more violence by the state, and this is because they are aware that with it comes the possibility for change, making us inherently powerful. Strength is the deciding factor in suppressing the masses, and strength can be worn down. The Hegelian dialectic asserts that the ultimate goal of man and drive behind history is in pursuit of total freedom. This innate and primitive urge to fight for freedom cannot. I believe her assertion of violence being an illegitimate tool of the powerless is based in the very totalitarian morality she criticizes. The double standard of a system telling its people that nonviolence is a virtue while actively brutalizing its citizens strongly weakens even her advanced theory in its failure to address what she would see as a legitimate political tool for oppressed masses under totalitarianism. This moral double standard is an intentional attack and attempt to suppress our strength by the capitalist class, and Leon Trotsky describes the framing of morality as one of the most effective tools of class suppression and warfare. In his 1938 essay Their Morals and Ours, Trotsky writes \u201cThe bourgeoisie [\u2026] is vitally interested in imposing its moral philosophy upon the exploited masses. [\u2026] The appeal to abstract norms is not a disinterested philosophic mistake but a necessary element in the mechanics of class deception.\u201d (The New International 165). It is clear this class deception has been effective, as it permeates all facets of our culture and is unintentionally furthered through philosophers in the  highest levels of academia grounding themselves in a morality keeps the working class complacent and placated, such as Hannah Arendt. She misses the very point of philosophy in the words of Karl Marx, \u201cThe philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways, The point however is to change it.\u201d As Trotsky says, it is vital for the survival of the working class to \u201cexpose this deceit\u2019 and deny capitalist moral assertions.\nWhile Arendt Made clear her parameters for tyranny and totalitarianism, there are cases where further examination and the willingness to question preconceived notions of morality is necessary to understand how totalitarianism can flourish in stealthy ways. One of these cases is the United States of America. We spend so much time worrying about the active wave of fascist ideology and nationalist groups in America due to the possibility of a totalitarian future, when we should be discussing the fact that it is all by design, that we are already being crushed by Capitalistic totalitarianism. Critical analysis of structures and theory is necessary to combat this, and the education of the working masses on these subjects is necessary, and the work philosophers like Hannah Arendt only serves to disempower workers and maintain capitalist homogeny . The working class must reject the notion all violence is immoral, accept that resistance against oppression is a righteous cause, and reclaim the fact the people will always hold power through the capacity of revolution, and the fear of such action by those who rule.We refuse to let ourselves be told our only tool is one of illegitimacy. We are living under the boot. What shall we do? Being born under this boot, we have two options; We accept the boot as part of our lives, begging for the boot to crush us slower while we are slowly being destroyed, or we    can stab at the boot with all our might, ensuring it never has the strength to step on us again.\n\u201cThe proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains.

You\u2019re criticizing her on a different level of abstraction than she was trying to communicate at, I think; my understanding is that she\u2019s intentionally drawing the distinction between real *social* power and the capability of violence, not commenting on the practical means of accomplishing state control. \n\nGreat writing overall! You\u2019re a clear thinker, tho I would perhaps ask for more inline citations to philosophers \u2014 but that\u2019s probably just my personal view lol.
