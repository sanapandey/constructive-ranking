    "selftext": "The Permanent Revolution and Results and Prospects by Leon Trotsky, a precise Tagalog translation of his original work, is a significant contribution to the field of Marxism, particularly in the theory of revolutionary change. In this work, Trotsky discusses the concept of the \"Permanent Revolution,\" a theory that explains that revolutions in underdeveloped countries cannot be limited to the boundaries of national reforms. According to Trotsky, revolutionary movements must continue at an international level and collaborate with other countries to succeed in overthrowing capitalism and establishing socialism.\n\n[https://library.bz/main/uploads/259115932B6F46BA39AFBF83F94F9D60](https://library.bz/main/uploads/259115932B6F46BA39AFBF83F94F9D60)",
