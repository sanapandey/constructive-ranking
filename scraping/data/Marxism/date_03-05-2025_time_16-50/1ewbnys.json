    "selftext": "I apologize for the clumsy title. I am aware that much of the history and economics that the west produces is in service to liberal dogma. \n\nA common liberal retort is that all \"properly trained\" historians/economists agree that Marxism/the USSR/Cuba/China is bad or evil or ineffective.\n\nAre there any examples that break this mould. Historians or Economists who despite still being part of \"conventional\" academic circles push back against the propaganda? \n\nCould anyone suggest names that I can check out to bring to people's attention where this point comes up in conversation? \n\n",

Lots of them are not perfect Marxists though and have weird intellectual hang ups or are hyper focused on academic debate. \n\nDavid Harvey - a political economist and expert on Marx/marxism. Has a lot of lectures on capital and other texts which are quite useful. Still an intellectual, not a party activist. \n\nRichard Wolfe - a Marxist political economist. A bit of a sellout in recent times to be honest. \n\nAlexander Rabinowitz - a historian who spent decades going through soviet archives and really anything available at the time (not always being permitted by the ussr who had a canon interpretation of history and did not like it when anyone contradicted that). Wrote some phenomenal historical work on the Russian revolution which was widely considered in both the east and west as pretty groundbreaking. A liberal but reality has a Bolshevik bias which is quite evident in his study. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of others. This is the wrong focus though. Actual Marxist \u201cintellectuals\u201d are part of a party organisation. They might not have credentials (many do) but they write for the party for political intervention. Enlightened Intellectuals are not the way forwards for Marxism. Intellectuals themselves are relatively worthless outside of the party and have to ingratiate themselves in the institutions of capital to work - as they primarily deal within ideas and to be employed you have to give some service to ideas rather than be a radical. You won\u2019t see radicals employed at your unis as lecturers or whatever, they\u2019re immersed in the class struggle. \n\nMarxists focus on class struggle and a class conscious working class, led by the vanguard and the party educated in Marxism. Intellectuals contribute basically nothing to this outside of working to address political questions of the party. Marx and Lenin didn\u2019t just write to answer intellectual questions but to shape their activist work and orientate their party to specific political questions.",

Of course some random French historian might go and say \"hey, the germans aren't so bad after all!\".\n\nThat doesnt make ww1 Germany socialist.\n\nThe anti-USSR propoganda is not liberalism against socialism, it is liberalism (imperialism) against liberalism (imperialism)",
