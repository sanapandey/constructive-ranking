It\u2019s a very specific type of leftist that supports modern China and champions it as a pillar of socialist thought. Me and you are not that hyper specific type of leftist. \n\nI\u2019m unfamiliar with the mods of that subreddit or what their deal is but there\u2019s several perspectives that lead to leftist supporting China even after they swayed away from Mao, opened up to American markets and joined the global capitalist ruling class. \n\n1. Many leftist aren\u2019t convinced China actually did any of this. Some think the Chinese system in 2024 is a faithful continuation of Maos work and the Deng reforms were just part of building productive forces. \n\n2. Many leftist don\u2019t actually care what China is or what it does because it has a long way to go before it\u2019s anywhere near as intrusive globally as the western backed capitalist countries. Every propaganda lie ever told about China could be 100% true, doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re Iraqi\u2026. China isn't fucking with your country. \n\n\n3. many leftists think they're in the midst of a global war to uproot american hegemony and believe they need every ally they can get. their entire conception of reality and their future in this world is contingent on the united states collapsing. simply put, nothing any other country does matters if they fight or stand in opposition to the united states. \n\n4. many leftist think that the united states cant be defeated without the efforts of their geopolitical rivals. as a result\u2026\u2026 they need them. whether its Russia, china, Iran, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Myanmar, DPRK or Syria\u2026\u2026 if they help to uproot american hegemony it really doesn't mater. talking bad about them just gives the American propaganda machine more ammo. doesn't matter if its true, letting these countries become isolated and ridiculed means they'll be picked off one by one  \n\n\nyou might think some or all of these are incredibly stupid, or you might agree with every single one. welcome to leftist infighting friend",

I'd love to one day wake up to a completely classless and moneyless society - you know, communism. What I see in China's history since Mao is a forced retreat from what was conceivably the quickest path that might lead to that one day. I don't think it was so much a choice as it was a necessary for their survival. Did it completely alter their path to the point that they will never make it? No one can know that.\n\nWhat I'd like to suggest to you, if you're open to it: try finding out more about China's history so you aren't just looking at what they are today. \"Historical materialism\" right? Also, try not to get too wrapped up in the whole war between \"modern socialists\" and \"ultras\" - it's just going to get in your way if what you'd really like is to develop your own understanding of it.",

Secondly: look at the actions taken by all parties involved. China operates in that part of the world, obviously right? China is literally right there, they kind of have to and it's their responsibility in my opinion. The UK just announced that it's sending a fleet to the South China Sea to \"curb Chinese expansionist aggression\". So they're doing the same thing to China that they're saying China is doing to everyone else? This isn't a new thing, either.\n\nI have been in a western military, I was for 8 years or so. They actually taught us a very limited history of the military strategy of the west in basic training. When talking about the post WW2 transition into the cold war the text literally said that the west transitioned from actively attacking Nazi Germany to the \"containment\" of communism. So they opened military bases all over the world where they were able to that wasn't communist. Maybe that isn't \"aggression\", like actually throwing a punch, but it's certainly putting your guard up and letting everyone know that you'd like to, but now isn't the best time.\n\nAgain, slightly off topic but have you ever read Cixin Liu's Remembrance of Earth's Past series of books? It's SciFi (funnily enough with a Chinese author who has publicly stated that he agrees with what the Chinese government is doing) that takes the idea of expansionism to its logical conclusion on a universal scale. I won't spoil everything for you just in case but you could say it doesn't have a happy ending. I don't mean this as some kind of proof that China isn't expansionist - I was thinking more along the lines of \"this clearly explains why you can't trust an expansionist to tell you who else is an expansionist\".\n\n>their uyghur imprisoncamps\n\nThere is plenty of condemnation around the world of China's treatment of Uyghurs. How much of it comes from muslims or muslim organisations? internet search says: [None](https://www.google.com/search?q=muslim+organisation+condemns+the+treatment+of+uyghurs&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB908GB908&oq=muslim+organisation+condemns+the+treatment+of+uyghurs). How much of it comes from western government officials or media outlets? 100% of it. How many of those western governments or media outlets have ordered or been apologetic to the bombing of predominantly muslim countries in the middle east? Most if not all of them. In that search I linked there are more results for there being outrage from western government officials at muslim organisations for not condemning China's treatment of Uyghurs.\n\nYou'll also hear the argument \"China is garnering support from countries that they've helped by building infrastructure for them and forgiving their debts for it as a part of BRI\". So they have to admit that China is helping people around the world, for free, just to say that they're only doing it for enough support so that they can be excused for committing genocide against muslims...\n\nIt's not making much sense to me.\n\nedit: let's also not forget that the same western government officials and media outlets that condemn China's treatment of Uyghurs can't seem to understand that Palestinians don't deserve to be genocided. And this isn't even me talking about hamas or who started it or whatever. I've seen way too many pictures and videos of dead or maimed kids this year, more than I have in my entire 40 years, and I'm not even looking for it. How can you say that a child has made up their mind to be a terrorist and deserves to be killed on sight? How can you not notice that or say that it's wrong to think that when someone else says it? Yet this is what most western governmental officials and media outlets are doing as we speak. This isn't \"whataboutism\" so much as the question: \"why would you trust them to tell you who is committing genocide and who is not?\".\n\n>their exploitation of the working class, who are not unionized or protected\n\nThe All-China Federation of Trade Unions has 300 million members, so just less than half of their total work force. It doesn't sound great but in the US only 12% of the workforce are union members. Have you looked up job satisfaction studies in China? Don't trust the articles, look at the data.",

Originally I didn't find anything that had Cixin Liu explaining the purpose but what he said about the Chinese government was in response to a question about him having written the books (and them subsequently being made into a netflix TV show - it was off the back of the hype for it). The books definitively say \"expansionism bad\", but they don't also explicitly say \"collectivism good\". I'll sort of interject on myself here because I was going to say \"I'm not sure exactly what he thinks is the good as opposed to what he has told us is bad\" so I just went and looked it up again and in an interview with K. E. Lanning where they asked:\n\n>Western culture experienced the rise of the individual during the Renaissance, but in Chinese culture, responsibility for the greater good of society carries more weight than the individual. Through your characters, this strand appears to carry through your work. Can you discuss this?\n\nHe replied:\n\n>The liberation of humanity after the Renaissance is, of course, a huge progress for human civilization. In the modern world, it is the trend for the development of human society to be people-centered, and this is certainly a bright direction. Even in China, where there still exist various problems in this regard, it is also the general direction of development.\n\n>But what needs to be pointed out is the fact that the worlds described by science fiction are invented by the author. In the science fiction stories that I have written, there is a huge difference between the fictional world I have crafted and the real world. The fictional worlds I create are worlds in which humanity is in crisis or facing calamity, and some worlds are on the verge of extinction.\n\n>A social system is inseparable from the environment in which a society finds itself. Under such circumstances, there would need for a suitable and adaptable system. *To face a calamity, it might be possible that collectivism may once again become a mainstream view on values.*\n\nThe emphasis is mine to highlight to you exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nSo there you go, I'd say that's him saying \"collectivism good\" :)",

The expansionist argument i will give to you, you seem informed, i am not. (I have not read the books ;)).\n\nYour point about the unions also baffles me. You have to admit the ACFTU is not an independent and sovereign organization. They are a union that is not allowed to organize a strike. The amount of people that are member is not a good reflection of the role of unions in Chinese society, do you agree? You also compare them to a notoriously non-unionized country like the U.S., this seems cunning, rather than a sincere argument. Why not compare to France?\n\n\nWhich brings us to the elephant in the room.

It has nothing to do with whatever the truth might actually be so much as an appeal to be more critical of your sources because they are most likely not telling the truth. It's the exact same with what I said about expansionism. It feels kind of similar to a \"mean girl\" talking behind all their friends' backs. They see China as competition and every accusation, as it turns out, is actually an admission. If you deal with enough narcissists you'll start to realise that the only reason this happens is because they are so selfish they can only imagine the person they're talking about doing bad things that they would do or are doing themselves.\n\n>the media that reports about the uyghurs being western doesn't mean its not true.\n\nYou said this:\n\n>I do agree that westen media (even though not as a whole) is hypocritical and biased.\n\nI think they call this \"Gell-Mann amnesia\". So do you trust it or not? For me, it's a no. And for the next few lines at least, I will use the word \"you\" as if I am directly referring to you, the person I'm talking to: You are here in the Marxism subreddit, are you a marxist?

Why have you ignored it?\n\n>Which brings us to the elephant in the room.

They are a union that is not allowed to organize a strike.\n\nI apologise, I knew that there were workers strikes and assumed that it was this union since it was the only one. It turns out that it is despite them, which is even better news. So the strikes are \"unauthorised\" yet the Chinese people still feel safe enough to carry them out anyways, and the rest of the world actually hears about them. On top of that, the things they're striking over are being heard by the government and they are cracking down on businesses that mistreat workers.\n\n[Source for strikes and what workers are complaining about](https://clb.org.hk/en/content/china-labour-bulletin-strike-map-data-analysis-first-half-2024-review-workers-rights). There are undoubtedly more, if you want more, or you could just look it up yourself like you should have done already.\n\nDo I need a source for them cracking down on businesses? The western media loves to talk about it because \"freedom\" includes the \"freedom to exploit workers\" so I'm sure you've heard.\n\n>You also compare them to a notoriously non-unionized country like the U.S., this seems cunning, rather than a sincere argument. Why not compare to France?\n\nIt's kind of a moot point now but apparently union membership is at 11% in France, so it's slightly worse there than in the US, just FYI I guess.\n\n>Can you, without pointing to the West, acknowledge the lack of free speech, the lack of democracy, the lack of human rights that have become a central pillar of the CCP's approach?\n\nIf I can't point at the west, why should I listen when you parrot the western narrative on China to me? It just isn't true, and you'd know that if you looked into it as a marxist would.\n\nSince you trust them [here is a video of a westerner that has lived in China for 13 years talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCFzWrgfSpg), please watch it. One of the first things he says is that there are many videos like this one, you should watch the other ones too, if you're able to.",

We are not living in the same universe if you choose an anecdote on YouTube over a report by let's say the BBC when you are trying to learn about the truth.\n\nI'm also getting the sense you'd choose Chinese media over western media. 1 for one live in Western Europe (the Netherlands) and we have a great tradition of critical newsrooms with very strict ethical codes. An unthinkable organization in modern day China.\n\nI wish you all the best, and thank you for your time explaining your view. It has been very enlightening.

All that I have known about it prior to going thru Marxist thought is analogous to the Western media coverage of the same.
