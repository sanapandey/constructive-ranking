    "selftext": "Hello, I was wondering if anyone could recommend me any books or articles on passion (for a subject) in capitalism. I went down a rabbit hole yesterday and looked up some articles about how to know if you're passionate about a subject. It got me wondering since the article said stuff like \"you want to do it all the time\" or \"you don't notice the time passing when you're doing what you're passionate about\" or even \"you forget to eat/sleep because of it\". Does anyone else feel like it's convenient for the ruling class to feed the proletariat ideas like this? That if you're not willing to work yourself to the bone it's simply because you're not passionate enough. Don't get me wrong, I'm passionate about music and sometimes I don't notice time go by, and I do want to practice everyday and occasionally I'll even forget to eat for a bit (but I'll always eventually remember). But my passion is still work, even if I enjoy it. It tires me out, and I don't want to do it all the time, because it's exhausting. Am I reading too much into this? Does anyone agree/disagree with me or has any resources on this subject? Thanks in advance. ",

If one is 'passionate' about Marxist Economics, they'll do those 'passionate' things and probably talk about it to anyone and everyone ad nauseum. If one is 'passionate' about collecting butterflies, there you go. If, on the other hand, you see something in a company's brochure or employee's manual hyping the need for being 'passionate' about working for Spacely's Space Sprockets you can rest assured it's capitalist propaganda. \n\nWhile I am passionate about some subjects and issues, to avoid burnout I tend to rein myself in with the old adage of 'moderation in all things'. Deep-diving into topical rabbit holes isn't always a good thing, but knowing HOW to deep-dive into them safely is a good skill to cultivate.",

            "body": "I think there's two issues here. It's not immediately self-evident that this idea is dripfed top-down to the workers. If anything, most of the time, it's presented as something to be found outside work, outside of labour relations, as an escape from them. There's the \"do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life,\" but I think people are reasonably skeptical of that idea. Even the sigma male \"wake up at 4am\" dorks aren't really arguing for passion, it's more \"do something soul-crushing to get rich quick.\"\n\nSecond, \"That if you're not willing to work yourself to the bone it's simply because you're not passionate enough,\" is that really something that people struggle with to the point of needing an ideological framing to accept it? Do a lot of people think they *should* be working themselves to the bone, but they're ashamed that they don't want to? That doesn't seem like a very prevalant sentiment to me. I would think that most people don't admire overworkers because they appear passionate, but rather that they pity them because they're strapped for money.\n\nAnd finally, from a materialist point of view, that idea probably has no real effect on how the economy functions. How a worker feels about their work is ultimately not a very relevant factor in capitalist production structures.",
