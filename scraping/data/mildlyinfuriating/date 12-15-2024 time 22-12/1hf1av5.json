Just took note of this a few days ago at our local stores, it's fairly uniform pricing.\n\nThe reason is that we're on country well water and the landlord won't inspect it or get it tested for any contaminants. It made me very, very sick the first few days of living here. Our old house had the water lines disturbed by nearby construction, which put dirt in the lines, and nobody we called gave a shit.
