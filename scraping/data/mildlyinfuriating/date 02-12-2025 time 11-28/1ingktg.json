They consistently under staff every single shift and enforce a bunch of rules that are impossible to follow regarding # of managers on the floor and not voiding any items without manager approval. I feel bad for anyone who works there. Easily the most depressing job I've ever had. The stock room was always insane, receiving 3000-6000 boxes each week and this was in a medium-sized store.",

And having rules like 1 manager per \"open door\" i.e. if we had a shipment arrive sometimes they wouldn't have an additional manager scheduled so it was either break the rule or deny the shipment which we weren't allowed to do. Plus the trucks were stacked with multiple stores so your store's stuff had to be unloaded before the next store could be delivered.\n\nUgh I'm having flashbacks.",

Except we typically could void them, but we could only have a certain percentage of the total sales on our register. I could go the entire day with a very tiny amount/no voids and then my last customer would order an entire meal and then decide they want something else making me go over my percentage with one void of a combo meal with no chance to make more sales and get the percentage back down. I had that happen once when my manager was standing nearby and saw it happen, even though she could clearly see it wasn\u2019t my fault corporate required her to write me up regardless. So she tried to use my register for drive thru orders for a while after the dining room closed so she wouldn\u2019t have to write me up since I didn\u2019t deserve it.",

Somehow I juggled customers, balloons, and keeping the whole front of the store tidy enough that I was granted the extra special \"closing shift\" which mostly was so I could assist in counting the day's revenue with management which I was told I technically wasn't allowed to do. \n\nBut y'know what? Still got written up for being over by $2.05 in my cash drawer one night, $0.05 over the limit. I'd never been short or over before, and wasn't again. I was a little bitter about it, ngl.",

The store I work at recently cut a bunch of us to part time (from full time to like 4-9 hours a week, plus reduced our pay by $2 an hour) and they cut it down from 3 closers to 2, so I'd have to work the register, plus clean the bathrooms and vestibule and break room (while working the register so you have to peek out there every 30 seconds) stock shelves, do facing, get online orders, take out the trash, get carts, etc. \n\nThey remodeled the store in about October which cost $3 million, and the store is \"underperforming\" so of course they take it out on the employees. The reason that sales are down is because the fucking company does not advertise. Anywhere. Most people who come in who don't run a restaurant ask if they need a membership, and/or discovered the place on their own by driving by or something. I wouldn't be surprised if the location got shut down, which is hilarious considering how much they spent on the remodel and how much they fuck over their employees. They could have taken a TINY percentage out of that budget to allocate for workers but of course that's silly. I mean, a kid in high school could probably run the corporation better than these fucking nincompoops.",

With just the managers it only left us with 3 full time csrs and 3 part time csrs. We get two trucks every week with 16-20 pallets stacked well over are heads. They had the inventory set to auto and it was absolutely wrong on how much we actually needed. I\u2019m talking like 15-20 bags of the type of one food we would sell 4 a week of. We did our best to keep the store not like this but dang did have way to much inventory and not enough people/space to get out. This is even without taking the animal care hours that we needed to ensure their health and happiness. All came from the same budget from a close to 500k in sales a month store.",
