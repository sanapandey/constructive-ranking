I strongly suggest filing complaints with both the Department of Labor and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), providing them with all documentation related to this issue. This documentation should include the letter you mentioned, as it likely contains evidence of the potentially illegal practices. \n\n In addition to the federal agencies, it's also highly advisable to contact your state's Attorney General.  They are responsible for enforcing state-level consumer protection and labor laws, and their involvement can be crucial in addressing these types of violations.  Provide the Attorney General's office with the same detailed information and documentation you provide to the federal agencies. By taking these steps and contacting all three entities, you will be initiating a comprehensive process of holding the responsible parties accountable for their actions.\n\n It's important to be thorough and detailed in your complaints to each agency, clearly outlining the specific violations you believe have occurred and providing all supporting evidence you have. This will help them investigate the matter effectively and take appropriate action.",

You cannot build a company in a fear based environment or else the company will have word of mouth against them like how I assume it's happening here based on the email. Once you have a competitor that treats people with praise rather than the traditional toxic environment. Talent will move on & you'll never reach your goals as a CEO along with a ruined reputation which will be against you when building another business/product. Hope this essay helps you lol",
