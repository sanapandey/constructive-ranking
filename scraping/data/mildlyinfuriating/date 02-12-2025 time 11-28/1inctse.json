Unfortunately they put too much pressure on the shelf which fell down on my macbook pro and broke it.\n\nThey proceeded to be silent and acting like nothing had ever happened and ONLY when i come back home after my work day i discovered it!! (they probably broke it in the morning and i come back around 4PM) so they had the whole day to communicate it to me.",

I\u2019ve done that fine with other non-Apple laptops but again if they have a lot of glue and fragile stuff inside I\u2019m afraid of breaking things inside of it.\n\n- Getting a proper replacement screen. This is one of the \u201cretina\u201d models and I\u2019m afraid that buying a replacement screen will end me up with an expensive but low resolution and/or low brightness replacement screen that\u2019s being passed off as the real deal.\n\n\ud83d\ude05",

I got a little too rough on the bottom of the tv, and the glass popped inward and destroyed the screen. \n\nThis friend had a history of anger issues, he was very violent a lot of the time.

He was surprisingly calm, and I offered to pay him however much he had paid for the tv.

I have no idea what happened, obviously, but I have also seen shelf\u2019s break on a side and fall, and we see that it happened in this video. \n\n\nI 100% agree with your point, I can\u2019t see any way in which a shelf could break the anchor on one side and crash down creating a hole in the smack middle of the Mac. Like that\u2019s just not how the dimensions of a shelf work, they need to fit seamlessly into the structure, and we see here it\u2019s only less than a foot of space between shelves, so how could it possibly have broken and cause an impact in the middle of the Mac. \n\nAgain I have no idea what happened but when I watched the video this was my first thought, I don\u2019t think the impact could have been from the shelf\n\nEditing:\n\nOk commenter below you makes a decent point, if it tipped in the right way it\u2019s possible the left from edge could have taken a dive off the anchors and sent it a few inches out of the side, but still I\u2019m not rlly sure.",

If that's how the shelf was looking after it fell, it 100% wasn't dented by the shelf.\n\nHere is the most likely scenario, your roommate wanted to use it or was(probably knows your password if so) or was doing something with it. Dropped it, hit an edge somewhere, and dented it.\n\nThat's another reason why said roommate didn't report it, but staged it. You might as well have not even used the dusting excuse but say the shelf gave out and fell. Sorry, your problem, but something isn't adding up. \n\nDusting even shit quality shelves are not going to make them fall unless your roommate is smacking those shelves with the rag or duster.\n\nComing back to the original point, it's very, very unlikely based on how these shelves fall that it was the reason.\n\nConclusion: Your roommate is shady.",
