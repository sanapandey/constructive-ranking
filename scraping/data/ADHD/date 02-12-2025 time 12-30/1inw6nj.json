I remember how upset I used to feel if others kids were rejecting me or disliked me for whatever reason.\n\nOne of my biggest struggles to this day is extreme rejection sensitivity for the most silly things that others would just brush off and not think twice about.\n\nDoes anybody else deal with this? Is it really ADHD related? ",

            "body": "Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. \n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.
