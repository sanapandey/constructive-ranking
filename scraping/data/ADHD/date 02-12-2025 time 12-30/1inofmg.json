    "selftext": "I (22f) have been failing uni for 1 year (not taking any exams) and just living from day to day. Just writing it out feels pathetic. I know I should write job applications or find something else to study (I hate what I study and was depressed for at least 8 months + it isn't that expensive to study in Germany), but I just don't seem to care enough. I feel guilty for letting my family and myself down, but I just can't seem to find the motivation to start over. I should plan ahead and think of my future yet I am changing nothing. I work 15h a week and can afford my small apartment, but this is no way to live forever. I just dont know what I want in life and I am afraid that the next thing I am going to attempt won't be better. I am a very creative person, but pursuing a creative job would be irresponsible as it isn't paid well, very competitive and could be replaced by Ai in the future. Meanwhile, I am using food as a coping mechanism and living in a fantasy world. My inaction is destroying my life. \n\nI just can't picture myself succeeding in life when I struggle to keep my small apartment clean/  to better my eating habits/ to build healthy habits or any habits at all.\n\n  \n(I am currently in the process of getting a diagnosis, but I am not feeling to enthusiastic about it changing much)\n\n  \nHas anyone been in a similar situation and could give some advice?

It\u2019s not your fault. From what I have read, ADHD have a smaller frontal lobe of the brain. It\u2019s like born with a smaller computer with less GHz and RAM. So no wonder the computer is struggling! Try to show kindness and compassion towards yourself as if it\u2019s your best friend. Wait for the diagnosis and let us know how you go\u2026 I am parent and have 3 sons with ADHD, so I empathize with you. Just remember that\u2019s it\u2019s not your fault to be born with a smaller brain, and you are doing a good job staying alive!",

            "body": "Don't beat yourself up, this isn't an uncommon way to feel (esp with ADHD). If you zoom out, being only 22 in Germany (and smart enough to get into uni) and already working towards a diagnosis means you have a lot of options/opportunities. Many people 'restart' much later in life. Being 22 and realising your degree isn't doing it for you isn't uncommon at all.   \n  \nBut sounds like you need a spark to find the motivation to improve your habits. A diagnosis isn't gonna be a magic fix, but could be the push you need. Therapy could really help with finding your motivation.   \n  \nHabits really are everything imo, and trying to create a toolbox to improve your habits (relative to YOU from last year--not others) is what keeps my life going. Try and make incremental improvements to your daily habits, even if small. Might get the ball rolling a bit when you see you feel better about a small improvement. But again I would say seek to talk to a professional to really find your motivation. Good luck!",

            "body": "I was or am in a similar situation. After high school in my uni I was unable to study properly, I wanted to do so many things but can't focus on any thing and would just sit in my dorm all day. I would not attend classes and I was even not able to study on the day before exam(something I was able to do for subjects that I procrastinated on during high school). So, I started to fail my exams. I loved to learn, but couldn't bring myself to learn unless there is an urgent situation, this is how I had passed exams all my life. During that time I was suffering from burn out and I was unable to hyper focus before the exam. I was also depressed and felt I was wasting my life during that time. I became a loner and couldn't make new friends. I tried  to get diagnosis and went to doctor but they didn't check me for anything and told me to take a blood test. I didn't go there again due to lack of motivation.\n\nAfter 2 years I moved back to my home town and transferred to new college with existing backlogs. There I still skipped classes(I lack attention span to stay focused) but started to come out of my depression, and was able to study before exam without feeling overwhelmed. I managed to pass my exams and cleared my backlogs(Although 1 still remains) in next 2 years. My method of learning is not healthy or sustainable and I know it eventually leads to burnout. But, I can't do anything else, I am very slow learner, once I accumulate knowledge I am very good at problem solving but I can't accumulate knowledge very fast without this feeling of impending doom. I would just stare at the book all day without making any meaningful progress on a normal day. My grades are low so I didn't have a good start for my carrier, so I am currently doing a low paying internship and slowly trying to change my learning habits in my free time.",
