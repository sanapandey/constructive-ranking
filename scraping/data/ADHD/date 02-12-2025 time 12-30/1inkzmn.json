She is AuADHD inattentive and several teachers started commiserating about how brilliant she is and she could really excel even more and really go places if she just applied herself. I cut them off and said it's ridiculous that we expect students to apply 100% effort to every subject and that great grades should not be the focus here. Our family's goal is to support her good mental health and earn an education that sets her up for an awesome, fulfilling life. This requires balance. She cannot apply peak performance to every facet of her existence and we refuse to encourage it.\n\nThey backpedaled pretty fast and the little girl in me wept, and wept, and wept. I spent a long time sobbing in the parking lot before I could drive away.",

            "body": "Yeah, I know everyone's symptoms have downsides, but I'm really jealous of some of the hyperactive ADHDers who are just doing things all the time. Like sure, they may not be finishing what they start, and they may feel bad about their abandoned Etsy pages and switching jobs often, but at least they STARTED those things! I think of all these creative ideas and things I want to pursue, but I don't actually get off my butt and DO any of it! I could use some more impulsivity in my life. I want to experience all I can and have a full life, but I either can't decide what to do, or can't maintain motivation long enough to actually begin. So I guess the worst part for me is basically the task/decision paralysis. It's like what you said in your last sentence about wanting to do everything and not doing any of it. \ud83d\ude1e",

It\u2019s a tough process, some days are better than others. Not everyday will feel like it does right now.

You're looking for happiness, not to appear happy to other people. Stand your ground on that. Boundaries will be critical.\n\nTo this day, I have multiple projects going on all the time. Some of my house seems messy to others. That's their problem. What works for me is automating the things I find tedious or boring because those are the most likely to get forgotten, like paying bills or being reminded of appointments. I try to tackle things like appointments or recurring errands in limited numbers. For example, I have my yearly physical this week, so I will not set up any other appointments this week. I start the first week of February every year, and set each of my yearly appointments in its own week, eye doctor, dentist, gyn, etc. I have multiple apps that remind me, but also it's February, so I know to watch for things going on. In June, I don't have to worry about crap like that, so I'm more relaxed.\n\nThe last thing that works for me is to keep important things in front of my face. I have a whiteboard, a big one, where I cannot avoid seeing it. I keep a list of ongoing projects on it and anything I need to track. I also have apps and electronic tools, and I make liberal use of post its. I've turned aspects of my home into a smart home, so I don't have to think about it. There are three reminders to take out the garbage every week. Where you can, create routines that work for you, not other people. It can be weird as hell if that's what works. I use a lot of color in reminder type things. Everything else in my house is neutral. \n\nI don't over complicate things I don't really care about. I have a limited wardrobe. I have a short list of easy meals I eat most of the time. I don't go out except on specific days, whether it's by myself to a movie or dinner with family. Experiment. Find cues that work and discard routines that don't. Don't listen to anyone else, including me.  Listen to your brain. It is unique and wonderful just the way it is.",

I hate my role in project management so I'm  doubling down to get back into data. I am making the effort to learn SQL, Python and R as well as brush up on my statistics to help my career. I meet with my therapist monthly and my psych every 2 weeks and both are in on my plan.\n\nTo keep my attention I got books, I got videos classes, I got courses on Udemy and data camp and I found lots of data sets that revolve around topics I enjoy. I have limited myself to just these few learnings and it has been going alright so far. \n\nTo keep on task, I built out a spreadsheet page for each subject and my resources. I'm tackling one thing at a time and gave myself some reasonable timelines from discussions with an ai chatbot, about 2-3 months for each subject. I have put down a schedule for my learning days and plan to do at least 1-2 hours, 2-3 times a week at minimum.  I'm lucky in that I have been exposed to data analysis work for the last 5 years so I can really see how this coursework benefits me and it all works together so I'm also building a portfolio in the background using the new skills I learn to keep motivation.\n\nI'm also limiting my \"mind running\" or topic hopping as best I can in my free time. I go at it by committing to one task at a time. If I'm watching YouTube, I have a video series in mind and I try not to stray or do other things. If I'm on my computer, it's for a specific task, not just browsing for browsing sake.

It's so crippling to want and need to do something but be so frozen. \n\nIt was also a huge pain in the ass to get diagnosed and I didn't get that until a few years ago. \n\nKnowing that my life wasn't supposed to be so hard and wasn't this hard for everyone sucked. I can't imagine what I could have achieved when I was younger if I was given the proper medication and tools.",

It makes executive function incredibly hard. When I take my ADHD med, it helps me significantly. I just wish I didn't have to take it. Otherwise, I am trying to distract myself from memories and pain... I'll say this though, I'd rather be lost than have no freedom.",
