    "selftext": "I am turning 30 this year and I feel like I have nothing to show of my life. I have a dead end job as and hourly were I barely make enough money to survive. I have tried to study and change my career multiple times but I cant follow through, I cant ceep my focus.\n\nI am obese, I have tried to do something about it but I feel like overeating is the only thing that gives me the energy topush me through the day. I  shift back and forth between losing a few kilos and gaining them back. I cant keep it off because I cant keep the routines. \n\nI whant to go to the gym but rarely have the mental energy to push me to go there. I manage to keep the habit for a few weeks at a time and see some results and then I forget about it for weeks. To constantly push myself to work and trying to maintain my life leaves my brain drained.\n\nMy apartment is a mess, even though I trie so hard to keep up with dishes, laundry etc. it feels like a never ending Avalanche that I trie to hold back with a shovel\n\nI feel like all my free time I am glued to a screen. Either reddit, youtube, video games or porn. I whant to stop and start living life but I dont know how, I cant break the habit.\n\nAnd now, at 29, I get diagnosed with adhd, primarily inattentive. Finally there is an explanation to why doing anything is so hard. They find out that I am high performing in intelligence test, something I have known all my life but never had anything to show for it, always felt like a failure because I cant use my intelligence for anything.\n\nI am so angry that if I only knew this 10 years ago my adult life would have taken a completely different trajectory. With medication I would probably not have flunked out of university studying electrical engineering. I would have a career, future goals to fight for. But now I feels lost. I whant to change from this person I have become but I dont know where to start. I am sick of this person that I am, help me change. ",

            "body": "You need to work on ONE THING AT A TIME. Life is hard enough as it is. Throw ADHD on top and the basic day-to-day challenges quickly feel like an unmanageable nightmare. Compound this into 10+ of adult life and you can quickly feel like your life is slipping out of control.\n\nSo, my advice? *TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME*. Don\u2019t try to overwhelm yourself with everything. Just start by picking one thing you want to change about yourself and focus solely on that, until it\u2019s done. Make it your obsession. Use your ADHD focus to really obsess over it.\n\nBut\u2026 here\u2019s the trick. You gotta come up with a solution that works for YOU. You need to ignore all the bullsh*t and noise you read online about getting fit/finding a career/washing the dishes and instead focus on what you know about yourself.\n\nExample? Let\u2019s take overeating. If you know you struggle with this but don\u2019t have the mental control to stop it, you need to adjust your environment accordingly. The fix? Only buy healthy food. Don\u2019t even allow yourself the pleasure of having high fat/sugar foods in the house.\n\nAnother example? This time let\u2019s use fitness and sticking to a workout routine. Find yourself an accountability partner that will berate you every day/week to workout with them. Ask around. Be curious. Be vulnerable. Talk to people close to you about your struggles. Maybe someone in your circle will want to help. OR set yourself a challenge to try ten different workouts in a month. Find a load of options near you (tennis, boxing, dancing, swimming etc.) and push yourself out of your comfort zone until you find something that sticks.\n\n*YOUR ADHD MIND NEEDS STIMULATION - ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS FEED THAT STIMULATION IN A POSITIVE WAY.*\n\nKeep at it. I know how draining it is. Just remember: small, positive habits compound over time.\n\nMessage me if you want to chat.",

            "body": "Hi, I know what it feels like to feel that you\u2019re just shoving sand which falls back on you. And nothing is going to fix that overnight unfortunately. I did not know I had adhd until  I was 37 and missed a lot of opportunities, but it\u2019s useless and pointless to look back. Even with medication, things can go sideways. \n\nSo what do you do? 1) Not waste today on being angry about things that can\u2019t change. 2) Find some spiritual teaching that can help you find peace within chaos (cliche but Buddhist teachings really helped me though not a Buddhist). 3) Reduce the number of things in your life. It\u2019s easier to take care of.\n\nAnd final thought. I am way older than 30 now and I\u2019ve noticed that there is always a reason why something doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t work. If that\u2019s the case, then it won\u2019t and you\u2019ll have to learn to accept the body, house, job, life. If you want things to change, you will have to find a reason , one reason, why a small change might work. And if that doesn\u2019t work, try another. Then another. Then another. Only you can save you. \n\nGood luck! I hope you find a reason to make your life a bit more lovable",

(If you\u2019re \u201cin general normal healthy\u201d) \n\nI can only tell you what helped me and you need to try for yourself. \n\nI used the app called Yazio. The free version is enough, you don\u2019t need to buy the full version. \nYou\u2019ll learn really fast what\u2019s good for you and what\u2019s too much or unhealthy. \n\nMost healthy foods are easy to prepare, you just need a basic understanding. For example, most veggies you don\u2019t need to prepare, just cut once or a few times. Wash and throw them in the oven for 20-40 min. (depending on veggie/thickness).\nYou don\u2019t need extra oil. The peppers, pumpkin, tomatoes, onions will get a great flavour just from baking. Think about a cutter for veggies, so you\u2019ll get similar slices for baking and you can cut onions and cucumbers very thin for salads. \n\nI\u2019m also an overeater, so I eat a big volume of low calorie veggies and pickles. \n\nGet some good dry herb seasoning, use fresh herbs - if you can. \n\nI also love warm beans in tomato sauce blended with cottage cheese. It\u2019s fast, easy and has protein. Checkout cottage cheese recipes, there are great ones for the oven with 5 ingredients. \n\nWhen you drink enough water and tea, have one cheat day a week and eat only small pieces, if you crave chocolate/candy, then you\u2019ll lose weight. Don\u2019t forbid yourself anything, just allow yourself a little (buy small packages) or decide to eat on cheat day.\n\nI also love to slice an apple very thin and snack during watching a movie or drinking little zips of chia water and trying to bite the seeds.",

That\u2019s the only thing that motivates me to go to the gym. He shows me all the machines, exercises and right poses. \n\nDo I want a healthy and strong body? Yes.\n\nDo I hate myself for booking him? Yes. \n\nDo I hate to go there 3x/week? Yes. \n\nDo I think cancel the other 2 months? Yes.\n\nWould I go without him?

It's a drug, and it keeps you sedated and trick your body into feeling like you are doing something while you are not. You need to reduce your time in front of a screen to a minimum. If you do you will become bored of not doing anything. So you just start doing housework. Your house is tidy, what do I do now? Sit in front of the screen because you \"earned it\"? No. So, what do you do? Maybe work out. So you have a neat home and you have worked out. Amazingly you still have time. You will be shocked how much time you have. So what do you do? Maybe go meet someone, do a hobby, live your life. Maybe go to school, learn something new. You discover you like learning new things. You discover you like doing tasks and getting rewarded for them. You like connecting with girls. Things reddit, youtube, games and porn have  tricked you into thinking they can provide for you. It is not to late. I turned my life around at 28, you can too. \n\nGood luck.",

Say to yourself I will only wash one glass.
