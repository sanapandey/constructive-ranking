Probably because I always want to have \"more\" time so I try to reach my destination as fast as possible.\n\nBad part is that I also love speed but I try not to overdo it. Also, the kind of music I usually listen (drum and bass) doesn't help lol.\n\nHow do you guys deal with speeding?\n\n  \nEdit 1: Nothing besides 140 km per hour. I only do it when I know I'm alone on the road and I reduce the speed in high density areas. ",

It sounds dumb, but if you ever played GTA, and tried to drive all perfectly in the game like you were an NPC, but this is exactly how I slowed myself down lol I just pretend I\u2019m a GTA NPC \ud83e\udd23\n\nGranted it only works when you remember the game \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude02",
