Lately, I\u2019ve been going through a very dark phase in my life. I have no money because I\u2019m too impulsive and spend it all. And most of all, I\u2019m 27 and still in university. I keep failing, always for the same reason\u2014I just can\u2019t make my brain work. Honestly, I\u2019m devastated.",
