    "selftext": ".. like I'm getting overwhelmed how my life have become. Like I'm staring into the abyss and it's staring back at me. After an additional hour this feeling goes away and I'm stable, a bit numb, and usually a bit tired.\n\nAfter totally 6-7 hours I can get the same feeling again, when the medication leaves my system I would imagine. \n\nI've pondered about this, because these feelings of hopelessness usually leaves me not being  productive, because it dampens me. The feeling of total sadness lingers and I just want to become happy, but you're not really able to on the medication.\n\nI've brought this up with my physician but they're having a hard time understanding, because they want to say it's anxiety from the medication. But I don't have heart palpations, sweating, feeling any rush or whatever. I don't really feel anything except for a soothing calmness and this some times these bouts of hopelessness.\n\nAm I just plain wrong?",

            "body": "That's very relatable, and your physicians response is somewhat concerning depending on how you explained it.\n\nOne thing that is crucial to understand about ADHD is that it is part of The Big Three. Anxiety, ADHD, and Depression are all interlinked.\n\nFor instance, my family has a history of all three. By brother got anxiety and ADHD, i got Depression and ADHD.\n\nIt's common that ADHD meds can worsen or better the other two problems. For me it actually helps my depression.\n\nWhen I'm not on my meds, I am exactly as you describe but slightly worse. I've found Stimulants help me focus on life instead of wandering off into oblivion, but these meds affect everyone differently!\n\nSo, it's entirely possible you are getting a negative affect from it, and I would nip this in the bud NOW so it doesn't get worse.\n\nMaybe lower doasage, use a more gradual release, or try a different med.",

I would get in right away, feeling blackness and avoid can cause people to commit suicide and if this medication is making your brain body and emotions feel that way, I think there should be a different medication to try you end up committing suicide you make sure you promise yourself if you ever feel that way no matter what time a day or night it is you get into an ER immediately if you don\u2019t feel right. \n\nOther thing I can think of is when you feel that void in that hopelessness make sure you\u2019re outside in the sunshine and nature or listening to super happy music or praying to God for peace and love ,  and if those type of things don\u2019t help that feeling go away, I would definitely taper off of that medication with Dr. snowing and helping I sure hope you feel better.
