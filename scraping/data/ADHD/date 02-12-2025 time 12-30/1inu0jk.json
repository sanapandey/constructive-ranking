    "selftext": " Since we both have ADHD and feel things intensely, it felt safe to share my story here. From a distance, things always seem less complicated than they really are.\n\nThis morning, my partner (33) and I (30) had a fight that escalated into violence and threats. I\u2019m shocked and sad, but it also made me realize that I want to build the best life for myself. It\u2019s a lot to process, and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\n\nWe\u2019re both struggling mentally. He\u2019s staying with his parents due to financial issues, which is tough after having his own place for 15+ years. I\u2019m considering quitting my stable but boring job and have some big conversations ahead. We\u2019ve known each other for 9 years and recently got more serious. Since he doesn\u2019t have a place, he\u2019s been staying with me often, which complicated things. The (usually amazing) sex disappeared, but the relationship felt safer and more relaxed. At the same time, our bad sides surfaced.\n\nLast night, I stayed at his parents\u2019 place after a 90-minute commute from work. The evening was fun, and since we were both tired, we decided to sleep in. In the morning, I asked him to heat my breakfast because his parents are extremely possessive and controlling. He refused, so I did it myself. He panicked, afraid I\u2019d burn their wooden kitchen, and grabbed my wrists hard while I was holding the air fryer basket. I was raised to scream if a man grabs you, so I did. In reaction, I also threw food on the floor. He then proceeded to grab my wrists and kick me on butt. Is this just an overheated argument or true partner violence? Do I have to break it off with him or is there hope. ",

I wouldn't think twice about getting the hell out of a relationship that started to show even the slightest hints of what I went through with him. It's not worth it.",

            "body": "When I was living with my ex, it's all started super sweet and wonderful. But then I thought that my mental health started to worsen, so we started arguing more, and I would yell a lot (even though I'm usually super timid). I tried medications, I tried therapy - nothing would help, and I was turning into this arguing angry monster. Or so I thought.\u00a0\nWe since broke up, and I was living with my sibling for the past few years. We never had very close relationships, so I was worried I'm going to make their life hell - like I did my exes.\u00a0\n\n\nWe didn't have a single fight. Do we have arguments? Sure, but it turns out that adult people can solve issues without screaming and hurting each other. And a lot of the things that I used to think were issues (according to my \"beloved\") are not issues at all. The longer I was separated from my ex, the more I realized that I, potentially, was in abusive gaslighting relationships. And although my mental health was affecting me - it wasn't the core issues. My mental health issues are still very much present, and yet I'm not the \"monster\" I thought I once was.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, yea - I think you can hope and try to fix things all you want, or you can just prioritize yourself and your well-being. Don't try to fix a fully developed man just because there's \"hope\" it can get better.\u00a0",

Massive red flag on controlling behaviour and a line completely crossed on physical violence. \n\nHe better have been really ashamed of himself after and unable to even look you in the eye out of self hatred, otherwise it's a hard leave",
