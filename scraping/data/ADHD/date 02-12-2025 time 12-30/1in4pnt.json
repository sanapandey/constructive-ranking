Almost feels as if I'm conditioned to get sleepy after solving it a few times lol.\n\nI find the best time for me to read is first thing in the morning. My body naturally wants to move slow and my brain wants stimulus, plus its the main time of day I can actually fucking sit still long enough to read lol.\n\nSeriously though, I view not using my phone for an hour in the morning as almost crucial to having any decent executive function for the day.",

This is my ideal routine; in practice, I don't hit every point every evening, but I do my best, and it has helped me immensely in improving my sleep.\n\n* I have two alarms on my phone, one goes 2 hours before I want to start sleeping, another one an hour later.\n* When the first alarm goes, I make myself a cup of tea. If my stomach feels empty, I take a light snack too, something with little-to-no sugar. I also dim the lights in the living room.\n* From this moment on, I am no longer allowed to do things that fire up my brain. No doomscrolling, no long Reddit-comments, no thrillers or detectives or First Person Shooters or complicated crocheting patterns. Only light-hearted, easy-to-digest series or Youtube videos or something. And I watch these on TV, not my phone. Basically, anything that gives 'cosy', 'soft', 'hygge'.\n* Usually I'll do my bullet-journal evening review while something silly is playing on tv. I'll also do my Duolingo lessons if I haven't done them yet. If I notice that my brain is still racing at this time, I take 15 minutes to do a braindump / long-form journaling / worry-journal. I basically just write down everything that's spinning around in my head, until nothing new comes up. Then I check if there's anything I can do right now to ease/fix any of the things. If so, I do them. This usually helps with anxiety/stress.\n* When my second alarm goes, it's time to go to bed. In winter I make a hot-water bottle to bring to bed. I leave my phone downstairs, put my hot-water bottle in bed, then go to the bathroom to brush my teeth, wash my face and go to the toilet. Then I go upstairs, lay out my clothes for tomorrow and get into bed.\n* I have one of those sunlight alarms next to the bed, which I can also set to mimic sunset. I aim to be in bed half an hour before I want to start sleeping, and set the clock to go dark at that time. Then I read in bed (some easy/light fiction) until the clock goes dark.\n\nUsually with this routine I can fall asleep within 15 minutes of lights-out (30 minutes if I'm not exhausted) and have a decent night's sleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. When that happens (or when I have trouble falling asleep) I try to do some breathing exercises (4-7-8). If that doesn't help and I've been awake for over half an hour, I get up. I'll have water or tea, go to the toilet if I need to, and do some journaling or reading (by dim light, no full brightness) until I feel sleepy.\n\nSome other things: no caffeine or alcohol 3 hours before sleeptime, no naps during the day, no sleeping in too late regardless of how the night went, and my phone has a night-time mode where it automatically applies a blue-light filter after sunset.\n\nI hope this helps!",
