    "selftext": "The most clear I've ever felt about anything was this week when it was apparent that I have had ADHD my entire life. I thought I was just lazy, dumb (with mostly straight A's in school), and useless. The list of internal criticisms is lengthy. I've been in therapy consistently for several months now for other issues. That is where I took both bipolar and ADHD screenings. I presented the ADHD screening to my primary doctor, who, while admittedly not a neurologist or neuroscientist or psychiatrist, made me out to look like a jobless loser who hasn't taken care of anything in my life (far from the truth). I thought she wasn't going to but she did refer me to a psychiatrist. Amazingly I was seen quickly, and I am so grateful for the window of opportunity. I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed some medications. It snowed last night, so I'm waiting for myself to go clear the snow off the car and make it to the pharmacy.\n\nPerception is one of the issues I face where I read more into something than necessary. With this primary doctor, I bristled at nearly everything she said yesterday. She diagnosed me with PMDD in 2020 so I'm uncertain how she was able to do that given she is an internist and I really want to bring this up with her. I mention this here as she was hesitant to discuss ADHD. \"But you said you have depression.\" I was immediately put off by her comment and for the rest of the appt made myself very clear that I don't want to be told how I feel. I read the visit notes she took and found some other comments that really pissed me off, namely that I haven't followed up with my cancer care team from 2021, which is absolutely untrue, otherwise I'd be dead right now. But she wrote \"has not followed up on xyz cancer in 2021.\"\n\nOk, self. Stifle the rage. Take a breath.   \nAnyway, thanks for reading. The biggest relief I've ever felt was getting this diagnosis. Always remember to **advocate for yourself**. \n\nI'd love to hear your experiences in diagnosis.",

            "body": "I feel this in my bones. I am 42 and just got my diagnosis. I was diagnosed with depression by my primary doctor at 19, and I went through every medication and therapy for SPECIFICALLY depression, and I never really felt any better. Numb was the best I could do with the medication i was prescribed. \n\nYou know what changed? I got a new therapist who herself is ADHD. She recognized my symptoms right away and suggested I get a full evaluation. Textbook ADHD. I'm still working through trying medications and seeing what works, but I've been down this road before, I'm just glad this road leads somewhere.\n\nPublic perception really isnt on our side. Even my spouse who is an incredibly supportive person told me \"everybody's kind of ADHD these days\", which is a bit dismissive. I refuse to tell my family because I know how that conversation goes.\n\nGood for you for speaking up for yourself. It sounds like your doctor has some preconceived notions about you that wont support you in the future. Is there any way you can look into getting a new one?",

                    "body": "I completely get you and the numbness from prescribed meds that weren't treating the underlying issues.\n\nRe: dismissiveness...wow another huge thing, right? My parent used to comment (in the 90s) at how ADHD was a fake condition and well...she likely has raging ADHD herself. The other one she likes to dismiss is fibromyalgia despite knowing people with the condition.\n\nI asked my first therapist in 2019 or 2020 to screen me for ADHD but her immediate response was \"you're not inattentive during our sessions so therefore you do not have ADHD.\" Wasn't even given the chance to find out. I put the idea out of my head completely and decided I was just desperate to avoid being functional. Ugh.   \nSo, in my path to getting to today, I've felt so many things and had so many thoughts about ADHD. Is it real? Do we all have it? I always knew that was a dismissive thought pattern, and I know that people struggle differently, grow at different paces, and I know some of the people in my own life have varying degrees of ADHD. My current therapist almost casually agreed with me that I exhibit symptoms(?) or perhaps the better term is \"behaviors.\" That was all I needed to resume pursuing that avenue.  \nEven up until this week I wasn't asking myself the right questions. \"Why am I like this?\" became \"How can I best care for my needs?\" and \"What do I need to do to in order to find out what my needs are?\"\n\nAnd you are definitely asking the same question I am asking myself today which is \"Who will my next doctor be?\" As soon as I read the notes my feelings were confirmed that I need to find a more compassionate primary doctor. The look on her face as she rushed to end the appt was that of \"dear lord what the eff.\" \n\nThank you so much for your response. It's nice to not feel alone in this expanse.",
