As a whole it seems very daunting because when I\u2019m travelling via ride hailing apps or was otherwise on public transport I kind of zone out. and often think how are these people paying attention to all these things happening around them",

But I always keep a drink with me, music, and sometimes I\u2019ll even adjust my seat to be less comfortable when I start zoning.\n\nDefinitely practice in big parking lots first! It helps you gain confidence with how the car feels without the stress of a road.",

It\u2019s always important to remember you\u2019re driving a weapon capable of killing more than you if you eff around. \n\nBut you learn it\u2019s another task, like loading the dishwasher. Also. There is a lot to keep your attention. Your brain will like the little tasks of making sure you check your mirrors, watching for other cars, anticipating your next action. \n\nYou will be ok and don\u2019t over think it.\n\nEdit: spelling",

Too inattentive, slow reflexes and also too anxious, I can't trust myself with an engine. I'll see if meds can make things any better in the future.",

I'm certainly not professional racecar driver good, but I've driven across the US a bunch of times and I've never caused or even been a driver in an accident. Some of that is certainly luck, but I'm also just aware and defensive in my driving.\n\nI think driving provides just the right amount of stimulation for my brain to flow. It's enough to keep my attention so my thoughts don't wander, but light enough to not be tiring \u2013 it's like sudoku in motion. I can zone out too in the bigger picture \u2013 in the sense that I'm terrible with directions and large-scale spatial awareness (knowing which way is North intuitively for example), but on the small-scale, I'm great at knowing where all the cars around me are at, what turn is coming up, watching for road hazards, etc.",

Urban traffic is well... less relaxing.",

When I'm alone, it's a totally different story. \n\nI'm constantly tempted to check my phone, eat snacks, switch songs every 3 seconds, search for podcasts to listen to, hit my vape, etc and sometimes all at the same time. I'm definitely a distracted driver. It takes all my power to remain still and focused on driving, which can be exhausting. \n\nThe only thing I've found that helps is taking periodic breaks or calling someone to talk. I'm also very new to being diagnosed/medicated, so I'm curious how/if that changes anything.",
