I thought maybe I was just trying to talk myself into having ADHD, and so somehow forcing myself to have these symptoms. But it turned out that I actually do have ADHD, I\u2019m not some magician tricked my brain into having it.  In hindsight, I think it\u2019s more so that I was more aware of my symptoms and paying more attention to it so it felt like I was getting worse because I saw it in everything I did. Coming to terms with having ADHD also made it seem like things were getting worse for a little bit because I was finally able to let go of some of the masks I put on and just let myself be. Letting go did wonders for my mental health, but made me seem a little less in control of my life at times.",

Its common and will go away when you have found ways to integrate it into your identity. It will become more \"normal\" and more part of you and therefore you will notice it less, because it is \"just you being you\".\nIm going through the same lately with autism \ud83d\ude0a",

Even on good days or weeks my brain just turns off during class or goes somewhere more interesting.   \n  \nOne of my reports mentions me \"seemingly being in a different world\" at times. I'd fiddle around with my utensils, my room and most other things were a complete mess. At some point my classmates decided they didn't want me to focus either. I'd do everything in the last possible second but when college started that never really worked.\n\nIt's so weird when my family says i was \"normal\" when it constantly felt like i was in a state of failure and constantly had to be reminded to do things while being yelled at. Yet my teachers always noted that i behaved either weird or lazy.   \n  \nEvery now and again accomodations were made to observe or help with what noone knew it was at the time. I had 2 women from a clinical university watch me in elementary school and in kindergarden i was picked out to do some mental exercises in the form of board games.\n\nI got my diagnosis only very recently and the suspicion started a couple of years ago and i'm 28.",
