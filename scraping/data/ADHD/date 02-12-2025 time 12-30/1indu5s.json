I am struggling to understand why they can\u2019t share things with me (we text because they\u2019re in another state) and I looked back over the last six weeks to see that probably 70% has been me solely listening and very minimal (only twice in six weeks) with related stories. \n\nI would like some friendly advice and empathy. I am so heart broken since this occurred a few days ago and am crying now trying to explain it here to get some help. They have ignored my apology so far and I just feel like a horrible human being for being me even while trying SO hard not to be me ",

The second one is what I wrote, and is an unstable foundation upon which a friendship cannot stand.\n\nThe difference is in the first case the exchange is not based on misunderstanding a basic means of expression \u2014 as in the standing ADHD/autistic \u2018empathy by anecdote\u2019. It\u2019s really not much of a leap to expect someone who is interested in you as a person to be able to make the decision between: Option A \u2014 accept the anecdote is something this person does. Option B \u2014 clearly state what you would like from the other person. Avoiding Option C: make it the other person\u2019s problem to sort out, and assume they\u2019re in the wrong without any self-reflection.\n\nLeading to your original phrasing that put the onus squarely on OP to consider whether they might adjust their behaviour, and I added the counterpoint that someone who hasn\u2019t shown you the same courtesy might not be a worthwhile recipient of what might be a major effort to work against your primarily style of self-expression.\n\nSomeone who continuously doubts and questions your good intentions and with whom you have a catastrophic incompatibility of communication styles such that you expressing empathy and shared feeling is taken as hogging the spotlight is almost certainly not your friend \u2014 especially if no effort is made to explore the topic before writing it off as \u2018this behaviour means you are just wrong and bad\u2019",

And its super fucking annoying.\n\nI get that with ADHD (I have ADHD) when a thought comes to you (like a relatable story) you feel the need to get it out. Sometimes it is just best to sit and listen and let your thought pass. There is a time and place for sharing and this is gonna be learnt through trial and error, which I get can be exhausting.\n\nIn saying all that I'm not sure one way or the other if it completely applies to this specific interaction. But some advice following on from above. Hear them out first, discuss what they brought up without realting anything back to a personal experience of yours - i.e. ask them how certain things made them feel, be empathetic \"That's so good man, I'm happy for you!\", \"Wow you seem really excited about it, is this something you've been trying to do for a while?\", \"That's sad to hear man, I'm hear if you want to talk it out with we, now or whenever you feel ready\". Then at a later stage you can ask, \"you shared with me so and so, can I share something similar that happened to me, maybe we can fiund some mutiple support\", or whatever applies to the specific situation.\n\nOf course sometimes you can share straight away, but you can't do it in a fashion that doesn't just shutdown what they where sharing. You first response cannot be \"OMG! Ao this happend to me blah blah blah...\". People with ADHD can often do this before the other person has actually finished talking and of course that will upset them.\n\nIt's a practice thing for sure. With a friendship though if it isn't a positive relationship for you feel free to not nurture it or keep it going.",

So I figured out sort of \u201crules\u201d. \n\nPeople don\u2019t like to be \u201cone upped\u201d. You can\u2019t *always* have a \u201cbetter\u201d story. Other people have to shine. Someone else gets to have the story of the \u201cworst case of stomach flu\u201d. \n\nAlso your story has to have a point. If they are seeking comfort or recognition or support, your story, by itself, doesn\u2019t provide that. It\u2019s just half the thought and the rest didn\u2019t get fleshed out before you started talked. You might have even rambled a bit while sharing. \n\nAnd then, as a rule, the more serious or sad a topic, the fewer personal stories I should share. Or I should probably hold off. Just because I know that those are topics where a person is looking to vent or for advice or where the topic is very fact specific. So unless every fact is the exact same, my story might not be relevant. Or my similar event might not be similar enough and I may unintentionally come off as tone deaf or insensitive when \u201ccomparing\u201d our suffering. Or they might feel like I interrupted them before they finished sharing or derailed them with my tangent. So\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s how I try to put in into play. Can I add value with my story?  Is it funny? Or is it just me recounting an event in my life? \n\nDoes it have a point? Does the outcome of my story provide insight into how you might handle your situation? Or maybe am I agreeing with you or validating your feelings because I felt the same way? But the point is, my story ends with a further discussion of your feelings and how you might proceed. My story was just adding some color to their scene. \n\nAnd if the conversation is somber, it is just best to just \u201cactively listen\u201d for as long as humanly possible. Nod. Say \u201cuh huh.\u201d Don\u2019t worry if you get distracted because you\u2019re gonna let them keep talking. *You* don\u2019t need to tell a story, yet. *They* do. You will survive 10 minutes if you have to wait. \n\nSo I try to practice the same thing I do at night when my anxiety makes my mind race and thoughts of tomorrows to do list won\u2019t let me go to sleep. I just tell myself I\u2019m keeping a list in my head of things to talk about soon. If it\u2019s *that* important and life changing, I\u2019ll remember it when my friend takes a breath. If I don\u2019t, it must have been a lame story. If it\u2019s really important, I\u2019ll be reminded when she talks again\u2026 But it\u2019s ok to wait a few minutes when my friend is upset. As long as she does it for me.",

            "body": "Learning when to be quiet and let the other person feel heard was a struggle for me, because my brain kept trying to validate how they felt by interjecting (and sometimes full on interrupting) with my own similar stories, because it felt to me like I wanted them to know that I understood. \n\nAs I grew up, I realized not everyone needs to be understood all the time. Sometimes they just want to be heard/to vent. Or they want to be shown that I understand in other ways -  while still getting to talk more than me, because they\u2019re trying to open up about something that may be hard for them. It can be tough for some people to not see my habits as me taking their hard situation and trying to divert the topic and make it about me.\n\nThat said, your friend is being unnecessarily harsh, I\u2019d say. I don\u2019t think it makes you a bad person, it\u2019s just a disconnect in understanding. The intentions are still pure - you\u2019re trying to soothe them in your own way. They just can\u2019t understand your language. \n\nIf you love them, you may have to learn to speak theirs.",
