When I forget it for quite a while I tend to hear the cracking eventually... and be like \"OMFG another ruined pod!\" \ud83d\ude49\n\nMaybe I should default to always use a the turn off timer on my electric and trust me that I will get distracted again...

I don\u2019t even shut off the timer chime until I\u2019ve actually shut off the burner, especially if I\u2019ve wandered off to get the mail/put socks in the laundry/etc. \n\nUsing Siri to set the timer is even better because the minute I open my phone, I get distracted and will forget that I opened it to set a timer! \n\nSorry about your sense of smell, OP.

Where the timer is a physical turn on knob like a dimmer. And another separate dimmer like knob for the intensity. These touch buttons typical for induction stoves that beep each time and take forever to react drive me crazy! \n\n>Sorry about your sense of smell, OP.\n\n\ud83e\udd17\n\n>especially if I\u2019ve wandered off to get the mail\n\nYeah I accidentally locked myself out of my appartment once while there were pancakes in the pan...
