What I mean to say is that we are born with the brain we have, and brains are created unequal, and have to work with what we got and using it as an excuse or even \u201cexplanation\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nThere is, IMO, a fine line between excuse and explanation. If I don\u2019t do my work on time and explain why I didn\u2019t do it to my boss as caused by my ADHD, I am in fact attempting to use it as an excuse.\n\nThe explanation aspect is just for ME - I can tell myself, hey it\u2019s okay, this is just some disorder I was born with, wasn\u2019t my fault, so I should be kind to myself, and next time I will take additional steps that non-ADHD people may not have to take, in order to do work on time. As soon as I give this \u201cexplanation\u201d to someone else, it stops being an explanation and becomes an excuse instead.\n\nSo in fact it is an additional responsibility IMO. It is my responsibility to deal with my disorder, is what I mean to say. I will have to do extra effort, take meds and deal with their side effects, and things will be harder for me. But life isn\u2019t fair. I was born with this disorder and have to live with it. Life is harder with it, but that\u2019s how it is, some people just have it harder than others. I\u2019m lucky in many aspects too, I got diagnosed for example - many people can\u2019t even afford to do that.",

Telling people why you're having a hard time doing whatever it is they want you to do honestly in itself is not making excuses. In fact it can help in effectively communicating what the problem is and coming up with a solution together - eg with reasonable accommodations in the workplace which people with disabilities are entitled to by law, at least in the US. At the very least it's part of showing them that you're not malicious or uncaring. Then follow up by showing that you're taking it seriously and working on getting the right medication and  setting up a system that allows you to not make the same mistakes again.\n\n\nBeing born with a disability doesn't mean it has to be on you alone to work harder than everyone else just to be able to participate in the system the majority set up for themselves. That's where the whole equity thing comes in. \n\n\nYes some people have it harder from the way they're born but as a society we should work on making it less hard collectively. That includes accepting that sometimes people who are paralyzed from the waist down can't walk up the stairs no matter how hard they try and people with ADHD will often forget things. And instead of getting mad at that and saying they're making excuses, maybe add a ramp or an elevator in the building and set up a schedule that works, have reminders, check in with your employees in regular intervals, etc. There are limits to this obviously, someone in a wheelchair probably simply can't do a job full of physical labor. But that doesn't make them a bad person not taking responsibility either, it just means the job is not a good fit and they need to find something else. Their responsibility is getting the wheelchair and using it, ours is getting medication and therapy/ working on strategies that help our brains work, society's collective responsibility is to make it more inclusive in the way we design or infrastructure and systems and to give people grace when they're trying their best with the tools they have.",

No need to stress about having everything.\n\nWith the example of dishes, it is not a question of if it will get done, usually, just when.  Sometimes the answer is just not right now and that is alright, they don't have to be done right now.  They can wait a few hours or a day.",

Ad nauseam\". \nThis is what society\"aka those in power\" shoved down our parents throat's (Reagan and Thatcher being the worst offender's with \"Welfare Queens\"). This was shoved down into Millennials/Gen X. \nSo while younger and younger generations continue to slowly break this toxic thought, we adopted \"Grind/Hustle culture\" which is just a slightly different type of Toxic. \nAlso American Capitalism (this isn't for you OP, but for anyone who has shit to say about that, you better have read \"Wealth of Nations\" first).\n\nSuffice to say, anything and I mean ANYTHING that gives you a reason that you can't participate in this is looked down upon. Physical disability is always met with \"Well your legs aren't broken or You still have one hand or You can wheel yourself around can't you?\". This goes doubly so for \"invisible illnesses\" such as Autoimmune or Mental conditions. \nThen pile in the prevailing public folk wisdom, that ADHD is just \"Hyper active boys\", then pile on the growing public distrust of \"pharmaceuticals\", aka \"Everyone just wants to drug their kids or all these doctors do is drug kids!\" Cascade this with \"everyone is a little ADHD\" which further cascades into \"everyone is ADHD now\". Which finally translates into the thought of \"OP is actually just a lazy SOB who is using this made up 'mental illness' to get out of doing any kind of work so they can just skate through life, while I work my ass off and pay taxes to fund slackers like them\". Which is then just verbalized into, \"OP, you're just lazy\".\n\nSource: I went to Uni for History/Political Science and have Crohn's/Arthritis and ADHD.",

There is no handouts in life. No one is going to do it for you. You aren't working hard enough. You got time to lean, you got time to clean. Ad nauseam\". \nThis is what society\"aka those in power\" shoved down our parents throat's (Reagan and Thatcher being the worst offender's with \"Welfare Queens\"). This was shoved down into Millennials/Gen X. \nSo while younger and younger generations continue to slowly break this toxic thought, we adopted \"Grind/Hustle culture\" which is just a slightly different type of Toxic. \nAlso American Capitalism (this isn't for you OP, but for anyone who has shit to say about that, you better have read \"Wealth of Nations\" first).\n\nSuffice to say, anything and I mean ANYTHING that gives you a reason that you can't participate in this is looked down upon. Physical disability is always met with \"Well your legs aren't broken or You still have one hand or You can wheel yourself around can't you?\". This goes doubly so for \"invisible illnesses\" such as Autoimmune or Mental conditions. \nThen pile in the prevailing public folk wisdom, that ADHD is just \"Hyper active boys\", then pile on the growing public distrust of \"pharmaceuticals\", aka \"Everyone just wants to drug their kids or all these doctors do is drug kids!\" Cascade this with \"everyone is a little ADHD\" which further cascades into \"everyone is ADHD now\". Which finally translates into the thought of \"OP is actually just a lazy SOB who is using this made up 'mental illness' to get out of doing any kind of work so they can just skate through life, while I work my ass off and pay taxes to fund slackers like them\". Which is then just verbalized into, \"OP, you're just lazy\".\n\nSource: I went to Uni for History/Political Science and have Crohn's/Arthritis and ADHD.",

They all have their ideas of what it is. But mostly I think it's because they can't truly imagine, even if they know someone personally who has a divergent disorder other than ADHD, that our brains work so much differently. A lot of these people are also older, born in the 80s or before, so their understanding of the human mind and mental health is much different, they seem to believe that everything can be conditioned out of people with hard work and dedication, because that's how they were raised. Didn't do good enough? Have a hard time being on time? Forgot where you left something? Fell behind on dishes, can't get out of bed, forgot to eat, feeling depressed, can't pass a test? Try harder. That was the answer for everything up until the last 20 years, when a lot of information and research on the human mind was finally widespread and better understood by the masses. They don't understand that chemical and neurological disorders and imbalances can cause so many issues and need to be treated a certain way, which usually involves therapy and potentially medication. These people would have probably gobbled down \"mommy's little helpers\" but can't fathom why someone would need to take ritalin to function day to day",

For her, like most people, \"Disorder\" is a _big_ word and only used in extreme cases. (Mum had a major freak out when I told her what the full form of ADHD was\u2026 especially after I uttered the word \"disorder\") \n\nWhen people look at someone with ADHD, they don't really associate their quirks and issues with the word \"Disorder\" because all that seems closer to laziness than something like Schizophrenia.\n\nWhen Mum argued with me about me not having a \"disorder\", she initially started pointing out examples that were clear signs of ADHD without realising it. It was hilarious. And even when she very begrudgingly initially accepted that I have ADHD, she said it more as if I had severe cognitive impairment or something. \n\nHeck, most people (at least the ones I know of) think of Autism as only the non-functional or similar variant. For them, Autism means the person visibly has lots of issues in everyday life. \n\nI think that popular media and stuff are to blame here. At least early on, ADHD was ignored and Autism portrayed as mostly non-functional in movies and stuff. People saw this and formed preconceived notions and misconceptions. \n\nI mean, even I'd grown up most of my life not knowing that I had ADHD.
