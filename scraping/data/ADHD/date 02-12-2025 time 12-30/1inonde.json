    "selftext": "* My morning routine is and always has been really slow\n* Since finding out I have ADHD \\~7 months ago, medication + other strategies have helped with many areas of life, but not morning routine\n* EG this morning: alarm at 7:15am, got up not much later (\\~7:30 ish), shower + get dressed, now time = 8:40am, medication + breakfast + wash up 3 bowls + use bathroom, now time = 9:50am, then I leave flat >2.5 hours after I wake up\n* Other people get ready so much faster and I want to reclaim this wasted time in the morning!\n* Based on my understanding of me/ADHD, I think the problem is under-stimulation:  having a shower, getting dressed, having breakfast, brushing teeth etc, these things are all so boring/repetitive and I have to do them day after day after day after ...\n* I don't dislike having a shower but I often spend ages standing under the hot water \"warming up\"/thinking about random \\*\\*\\*\\* until I somehow \"feel ready\" to start properly showering\n* (please don't recommend me cold showers \ud83d\ude05)\n* Any tips to speed things up?",

I don't know how you get to work, but could you pair it with something you find rewarding, like an audio book or podcast? Do you have to shower in the morning? Could it be moved to before bed? Have you set a time that you'd prefer to leave by/ arrive and work back and set the amount of time you get to put towards each morning task?",

And you get to start the day softly while enjoying breakfast. Just bring a toothbrush if you prefer brushing teeth after eating.",

It's rather helpful not having to worry what you wear - at least for men.\n\n> wash up 3 bowls\n\nWhy 3 bowls? Isn't one enough for you?\n\n> I don't dislike having a shower but I often spend ages standing under the hot water \"warming up\"/thinking about random **** until I somehow \"feel ready\" to start properly showering\n\nMaybe play a specific song which takes exactly as long as you need showering. If you focus on the melody/lyrics, you don't fall into day dreaming.",
