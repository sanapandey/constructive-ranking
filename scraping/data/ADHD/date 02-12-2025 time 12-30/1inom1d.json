Do I draw the box or cut it out and make it? Then I\u2019m sat there for hours trying to figure out this box situation but it was supposed be a simple first step of a 10 step task \ud83d\ude2d What could this be a trait of or I just an over thinker?

Obviously these notes change and grow a lot, the more I learn",
