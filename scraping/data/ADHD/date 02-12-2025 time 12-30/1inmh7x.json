Mundane tasks are mundane, and even though you might remember each time your feet were in your mouth, the conversation was engaging you. As per the feet situation, not knowing yourself at all, it took me years to re-learn socializing and knowing what works for me to know when to keep quiet and listen. Laundry is boring, but there are plenty of people with plenty of techniques that can help!   \n   \n\nEDIT: Also /u/blamejaneshui is very correct, \"love your weirdness\" the more you try to struggle or get angry with your self the harder it is. Rather than that learn to work with it, and develop strategies to manage it.  \n   \nEDIT2: [good analogy from the west wing](https://www.youtubetrimmer.com/view/?v=ehC5aYj2xNc&start=0&end=54&loop=0)",

Being able to use all of the tools you mentioned still requires adequate working memory to do so, and not all of us have that. So maybe we plan to set an alarm but get distracted by a notification when we go to unlock our phone, and then we forget. Or maybe the alarm goes off, but you just happen to get an email or someone stops by your office to chat then. Just saying. It\u2019s incredibly condescending to post, especially here of all places, this kind of overly simplistic advice, as if we haven\u2019t all already tried the basics.",
