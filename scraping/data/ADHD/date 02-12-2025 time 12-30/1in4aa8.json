Surprises and delights me every time! No judgement, just wants me to be happy, so he helps without pushing. Blows my freaking mind.

I had to realize she wouldnt pick up on my body language or subtle hints, particularly when i wanted out of a conversation. I thrive in chaos, love clutter and am very vague, while she needs order, minimalism and a defined schedule. Separate bedrooms is a huge help here, but I understand how that can be difficult or weird for a lot of couples. I would say the main thing is having a sense of humor about our funny little abnormalities and teasing eachother rather than reprimanding eachother for behaviors that we cant much control.",

My masking/people-pleasing tendencies are compounded by the fact that I grew up evangelical, so it was a lot of obedience and keeping social norms, never rocking the boat. I have been unpacking that since my early 20s so my diagnosis was like a continuation of that work \u2014 like \u201coh ok no WONDER I have been neglecting my own needs and trying to make everyone else happy all the time.\u201d Add RSD to that, and so much makes sense - and I am comforted by the fact it\u2019s not just me! It\u2019s been a journey in trusting myself and listening to what I need - and then giving myself what I need instead of trying to power through without it.\n\nSomething my therapist said recently really hit home: I questioned whether I should figure out how to cope without my ADHD meds, because I did so for decades before. She said, \u201cimagine the childhood version of yourself, in elementary school, and you\u2019re doing poorly in class, even though you work so hard. Your peers are doing fine and you are feeling so discouraged, but you just keep trying and trying. Then one day, you get your eyes checked and it turns out you need glasses. With your glasses, everything comes into focus, and you realize what everyone else was able to see the whole time. Would you ever tell that little girl not to wear her glasses?\u201d \n\nI cried when she said that. And that\u2019s what I try to remember when I feel inadequate for my messy house, or when I feel frustrated if my husband shuts down in a moment of overstimulation. We both need our glasses \u2014 meds, space to calm down, grace and forgiveness from each other when we are at our limit, jigsaw puzzles \ud83d\ude02 It\u2019s not a flaw, it just is. And everything works so much better when we accept it as wiring instead of trying to fight it or rewire it. \n\nWow that was so long, sorry \ud83d\ude02 and I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s helpful but that\u2019s my own experience.",

She's the talker, I'm the Spock-like buzzkill,  it's like a damn sitcom over here. We both get hyperactive at different times of day and it usually doesn't line up, but when it does align, we're prone to impulsively starting a big creative project we'll never finish, singing random made up songs, and living in a blissfully goofy state.  Sure, the house is a mess, sure we misundertand each other, and SURE we can both get heated about stupid shit. But, we both have giant bombastic physical sense's of humor, we talk in tangents and stories, if one person doesn't remember a conversation, it's never taken personally; we just get each other and that's nice. I was previously married to a very orderly, moralistic person and holy (insert your god here) it's a night and day difference. Never having to feel guilty for simply existing has been the best thing that's ever happened to me.",

I only say that because I\u2019m now currently dating a man with ADHD and find it a lot easier (in that we have similar personality traits and annoyances). My autistic ex was very rigid and organised, was never late and was, I felt, inflexible to change. I\u2019m more \u201claid back\u201d and feel pressure when someone is asking \u2018what\u2019s the plan? When are we going? Where do we park?\u2019 - it makes me feel frazzled and gives me anxiety.

My niece has age appropriate social skills and friendships. She only yantrums when my sister does not limit her screen time. That's not autism. My sister just wanted NDIS - self managed, of course. My GP told me that she is now autistic abd claims that women don't meet the diagnostic criteria because autism presents differently in girls. I'm female. My autism was diagnosed in childhood. If autism presents differently in girls then I should have the 'female' type, too. So yes, at the momebt everyone does have autism since it seems acceptable that anyone can have it if they want it.",
