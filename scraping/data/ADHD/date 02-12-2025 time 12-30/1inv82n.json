    "selftext": "It absolutely sucks.  There's a bunch of things I'm passionate about, but there's one that I *always* come back to.  I'd love to open a ceramic studio and teach people pottery.  Bonus points if I was a licensed art therapist, because I think that ceramics being used in therapy could be *huge*.  But I'm $120k in debt working as a tech (aka: not enough income).  I couldn't even afford a kiln, let alone a space to do this.  And it would likely be wildly unprofitable, which is only an issue because of bills.  Studios closest to me are so expensive likely for that reason.\n\nI hate it.  It sucks.  It's even worse because I could probably swing it if I had no debt as my job doesn't require a degree, it just helps immensely.  But if I didn't go to school I would have never found my passion for ceramics.\n\nIt's even worse all my ideas are like that.  Expensive, but helps others in one way or another.\n\nInstead I'm working full time and the only reason I can afford to live is because of DINK.  I love my job, if I could afford to quit I'd still be part time here, but I have so many other things I think I could do if I had the money to do it.",
