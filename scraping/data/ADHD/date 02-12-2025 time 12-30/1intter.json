    "selftext": "I've dealt with chronic fatigue for over a decade now. When I was in school I would fall asleep all the time. As an adult I can barely manage to function when I'm working a part time job. I just have no energy when I'm outside of work. Like, I'm a chef and if I have even a part time job I have to live on microwavable meals because I don't have the energy to cook for myself.\n\nI have been going from specialist to specialist trying to figure out the fatigue and all I get back is that my physical health is normal and there is no medical reason for my fatigue.\n\nMy therapist's new theory is that it's due to being constantly overwhelmed by every aspect of life and that leads to a low threshold for burnout. I can definitely see how that makes sense but I was wondering if other people have had similar experiences. ",
