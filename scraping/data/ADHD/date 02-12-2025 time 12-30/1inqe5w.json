    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nOver the last year or so I\u2019ve really fallen out of love with video games, and I have other hobbies I\u2019d really like to prioritize. The problem, however, is that I\u2019ve spent my entire life with video games as my primary hobby as it feels like the only thing that really \u201cdulls\u201d the ADHD symptoms and other hobbies are a bit of a battle to get momentum with. \u201cMomentum\u201d is probably the best word to use for this, as it really feels like I\u2019m continuing to play games more out of momentum than genuine fun.\n\nI\u2019m not necessarily trying to cut out video games for the rest of my life, but I do want to take a few months to hit a reset button so to speak. Do you guys have any practical tips for how to avoid these habits for a while?\n\nThank you!",

On a PC you still need to use, log out of whatever accounts you use (steam, gog, whatever), turn off auto-logins or autofill for your passwords. Basically anything you can do to make starting a game as much of a hassle as possible, and then make whatever hobby you're trying out as easily available as possible.",

And they could play video games like they invented it!! \n\nThen there is me .. I could start a video game if it's too in-depth or too complex I either get frustrated or start thinking about other stuff..  and God forbid I hear some kind of ambient noise because then I'm all about what was that noise... Lol I read quite a few times that people with ADHD enjoy video games. I wish I could...",
