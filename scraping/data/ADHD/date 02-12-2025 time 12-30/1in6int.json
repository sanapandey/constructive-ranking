Some of it is pressure. Some of it is fear bc a parent is scared their kid will suffer. Some of it is low emotional IQ. \n\nSince we now know that ADHD is hella genetic, and Dr. Barkley has stated that if a kid is dx then the parents should be screened, we can also assume that the traits in ADHD kids are the traits that parents hate about themselves and it \u201ctriggers\u201d them.\n\nNo matter the cause it\u2019s never OK to abuse a child.",

As a fairly quiet girl in the 1970s, I would not have even been considered for an ADHD Dx, so there wasn't a good explanation for my failure to \"live up to my potential\".\n\nHe was a fairly normal, stable guy, overall, though he was occasionally over-harsh and humiliating, and was an old-school spanker.\n\nMy late mother, OTOH, had even *worse* ADHD symptoms, as an adult, than I did - even pre-Dx - though I'm quite certain she would have cut off her leg before admitting it, had the possibility ever been presented to her.\n\nShe also exhibited intractable behaviors and attitudes that suggest BPD and/or NPD (Borderline and Narcissistic Personality Disorders), and was quite often verbally - and sometimes physically - very abusive toward me, even as a small child. \n\nHer inconsistencies made it even harder for me to rein in my focus, and I think she sometimes deliberately derailed me when I was doing well. \n\nWhy? Because she hated *herself* - but not being able to admit she wasn't perfect, she had to have somewhere to put all that loathing. \n\nThat place was me.",

I was so afraid of my drunken, physically abusive father, who also had undiagnosed ADHD, that I stole Liquid Paper from a store, due to my almost complete lack of impulse control klepto phase, and changed the grades on my Report Card, and forged my mother's signature on it. That only worked for 2 Report Card periods.\n\nInstead of pondering what was going on, I was a miscreant, lazy, manipulative, and indifferent in my parent's eyes. And this continued my entire public school career. Still no thought to \"Why is this happening?: from my parents. I spent half of my life at that time grounded, and punched more that once by my father.\n\nI flunked my senior year, and got my GED a year or two later. Humorously, my home town's GED organization wanted to give me a certificate for scoring so high on the GED....\n\nI left public school convinced I was stupid, and crazy. I checked myself into psych wards 3 times before I was 30, suicidal, because I couldn't \"Get it together.\" I was misdiagnosed as Bipolar 2.\n\nIn my mid 30's, my father, who finally realized something was really wrong with me, convinced me to apply for disability. Surprisingly, it went right through, due to my long history of psych problems. And I've been on it since, for almost 20 years. But that will end, soon, probably, with the current administration's cruelty.\n\nIt wasn't until my mid 40's, after watching a video by Dr. Russell Barkley that I knew what was wrong with me.
