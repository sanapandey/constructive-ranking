I think it\u2019s entirely valid to be frustrated and upset about it but trying to keep from using that frustration to beat ourselves up. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve started trying to rephrase my thoughts from \u201cI should/need to do ___\u201d and instead say \u201cI want to do ___ because it will help me ___\u201d without any obligation to actually do it. It seems that rephrasing so I\u2019m not making demand makes me way more inclined to actually do it.",

Bonus things is way more motivating than failing to do too many things",
