    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 30, and at first, I felt really bitter about the late diagnosis. I couldn\u2019t help but think that if I had been diagnosed earlier, it could\u2019ve spared me from a lot of struggles, and my self-esteem might have been better if I had understood myself earlier and why I am the way I am.\n\nBut then something happened during a study project. I mentioned to my instructor that I had recently been diagnosed, and she suggested I meet with the special educator to see if she had any study tips for me.\n\nI did, and it was awful. She basically told me that the project I had chosen was too difficult for someone with ADHD, and that I should probably pick something easier. (\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44)\n\nThat moment really made me think: being diagnosed late isn\u2019t necessarily only a bad thing.\n\nBefore that, no one had ever questioned my ability to achieve anything. Even though many teachers saw me as a problem from a behavior perspective because I had trouble sitting still or staying quiet, they never doubted my potential. I started to wonder how different things might have been if I had been diagnosed earlier. Would I have been told to aim lower? Would I have been constantly belittled and made to feel like I should try less?\n\nFor context, I don\u2019t do well emotionally, but I\u2019ve been what people would call successful in my career and hold a Master\u2019s degree. I\u2019m just speculating, but if I had encountered people telling me to aim lower, I might not be where I am today. That thought helps comfort me on the days when the bitterness about my late diagnosis starts to resurface.",

I have a lot of trauma and anxiety from my time in educational institutions that I\u2019m still working on.

Medication has been absolutely life changing for me, but it's hard not to sometimes wonder where I would be now if I had sought treatment earlier.\n\n\n\nI ended up graduating with the PhD I set out for, but on the whole didn't set myself up for a career in academia like I initially intended. I have given various explanations (to myself and others) as to why I decided to pivot into an industry career rather than taking the academic route, but I sometimes wonder if that decision was in large part a rationalization I came up with after falling short of excelling in the way that I wanted & needed to if I wanted to make it as a career academic.\n\n  \nIt's hard not to kick myself sometimes and think about how much more successful I could have been if I caught this earlier, but I try and instead focus on how grateful I am that I've found a effective treatment. It took a little bit to shake the internal stigma of feeling like I was using some sort of performance-enhancing drug or taking a shortcut to compensate for some kind of character flaw, but Adderall has had nothing short of a profound effect on me and my life. For the first time in my life I can throw myself into work tasks and be fully engaged in them, often to the point that I'm genuinely just enjoying work. When I take it, I can commit to tasks like a \"normal adult\" rather than spending my day feeling overwhelming guilt at my inability to do anything less than the bare minimum (if that). \n\n  \nI have made a point to not be shy about talking about my struggles and how much Adderall has helped me, because I have a deep respect for it now and feel like there are still stigmas / misunderstandings about it that I want to combat so that others can have an easier time seeking treatment too.",
