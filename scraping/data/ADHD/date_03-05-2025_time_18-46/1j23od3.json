I recently had to donate some stuffed animals because we\u2019re moving, and I can\u2019t stop picturing them ending up in a landfill somewhere, cold, alone. It\u2019s only gotten worse as I\u2019ve gotten older (I\u2019m 22 F) and now I can\u2019t even enjoy valentines or Christmas aisles because I walk through feeling so sad envisioning all the stuffed animals in a landfill in a few years. \n\nI feel like it\u2019s really affecting my life now and wondering if anyone has any advice or has experienced this.

One time I spent a whole day crying because I had a stray thought about Laika, the dog they sent into space, and I looked up a bunch of stuff about her and couldn't stop imagining how scared and confused she must have been.  I'm crying on the bus right now completely against my will just typing this lol.  I live in an area with a lot of homeless encampments and some days find myself just spun out into a total existential crisis about it.  I'm very easily taken advantage of because of it tbh.  It's a curse, and my partner often asks me how I can stand to exist just like...caring about everything happening to everyone everywhere all the time.  And the answer is I can't, someone please help \ud83d\ude2d",

Mindfulness meditation has really helped: it teaches you how to separate from your thoughts and feelings so that they aren\u2019t so overwhelming.\u00a0",

            "body": "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ADHD related either but I really relate to what you\u2019ve described. I have often felt so consumed and overwhelmed by my emotions that I wanted to crawl out of my skin. It\u2019s really hard to manage intense emotions and it can be so draining. The trick is that you have to learn to separate yourself from the emotions. You can try noticing how you feel and narrate that to yourself. You might say \u201cI notice that I\u2019m feeling worried/sad/anxious about person/thing/situation\u201d and just the act of noting the feeling and saying it to yourself is oddly calming for me. If you search \u201cdropping anchor\u201d or \u201cspiral technique\u201d you can try these and see if they help. They make you get out of your head and connect to your body which I find helps with those intense feelings. Also, there is an online course I found to be helpful as well: https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/\nI hope this helps. Good luck \ud83d\ude0a",
