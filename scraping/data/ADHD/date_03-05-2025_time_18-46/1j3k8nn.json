What would you like to be productive doing instead?\n\nI knew tiktok would always be a problem for me so I never downloaded it, but then youtube got shorts, and I've definitely lost many, many hours in that labyrinth. The problem is I use long youtube videos to be productive. If I'm doing chores, gardening, or working on a project, it helps me to have a long video to keep me company and keep that part of my brain entertained. So I can't delete youtube from my phone, but there are hacks to make sure I don't see those shorts popping up. \n\nFor social media, I don't have those apps on my phone. I make sure I only access that stuff on a browser on my computer. That way I'm going in with intention whenever I have to get on Facegram-ect. I think an unintended benefit of my computer being a desktop is it has a specific location. I can't take my computer to the couch or bed, and loose time on it.",
