I cry in front of people too much. I absolutely hate myself. Today\u2019s my birthday and I turned 21 but I feel absolutely nothing. I just don\u2019t care to celebrate because of how disappointed I am in myself. I\u2019m medicated and have all of the resources I need yet I still feel stupid compared to everyone around me. \u201cDon\u2019t compare yourself to others\u201d is such a meaningless quote to me because how can I NOT feel stupid when the class average is a 70% and I got a 32%??",

I know you don\u2019t feel like celebrating, but you made it to 21, and that\u2019s worth something, even if today feels like just another day.\n\nI hear you on the struggle. ADHD can make everything feel 10x harder, and when you're constantly measuring yourself against others, it\u2019s easy to spiral into self-doubt. But getting a 32% doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re stupid. It means the way you're being tested isn\u2019t aligning with the way your brain works. And that\u2019s frustrating as hell, especially when you are trying... meds, resources, everything.\n\nYou're not broken, you're not hopeless, and you're definitely not alone in this. It might be worth revisiting your study methods... sometimes small changes (active recall, different environments, even body-doubling) can make a huge difference. And if emotions are hitting you extra hard, that could be something to bring up with your doctor... meds sometimes need tweaking.\n\nYou\u2019re not defined by your grades or how long things take. You\u2019re still here, still fighting, and that\u2019s more than enough.",

            "body": "You\u2019re not alone. I dropped out of college multiple times. Wasted money on many dropped classes. Forgive your past mistakes or what feel like failures. You\u2019re learning and that\u2019s not always a linear path, for anyone really. \n\nOur emotions can really rule over us longer, just do your best to keep regulating them. Gratitude journaling, or journaling with a feelings wheel available as helped me a lot to identify the sources of my anxiety and distraction. \n\nOften we aren\u2019t just fighting what adhd is doing to us today (that\u2019s what medication helps with), we\u2019re fighting years of trauma and negative thought patterns that our brains so easily go to. It takes time and conscious effort to build new pathways with better lenses to view our world. \n\nI can only say it sounds like you\u2019re doing better than I was at 21. At 36 I\u2019m grateful for my wife and children, for my decent paying job, to have a home. When I was your age I pictured my future as homelessness in a van. Don\u2019t give up on yourself, or worry that you need to win every battle, or fix it all today. \n\nFind some light in your life, practice being thankful\nfor it, in the morning ask one thing you can succeed at today, at night ask what 1-3 things went well, what 1-3 things could have made today better. Don\u2019t start the whole doom list each time, just find what\u2019s bubbling in those top spots and make steady progress. \n\nWhen you make a little progress on big stressors it can help clear the mind immensely even if there\u2019s still a ton left. Count your little victories, they matter. \n\nI continually say the biggest thing nobody seems to try and impress upon younger people is that life is so much longer than you think. If I had understood at a younger age the value of aiming at 10-20 minutes of success each day, and not judging the rest of the day at all. Instead I would burn out and go numb for months after failing some huge overload I put on myself. Then have a day where I tackle a months long backlog, but then wonder why the momentum never picked up. \n\n\nI love you. You are not alone. You are stronger than you know. You are not weak for feeling your sadness and pain. You are still growing, still learning, and forever capable of achieving that which you steadily commit to.",
