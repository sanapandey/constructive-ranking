    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with ADHD over the past year, but it didn\u2019t fully hit me until a few months into treatment. One day after work, I got into my car and just broke down crying. Like, really crying, couldn\u2019t breathe. And I\u2019m not someone who cries often, but this was different. It was from the depths. \n\nI kept hearing the echoes from my childhood. Teachers, parent-teacher conferences, the notes they sent home: \u201cHe has so much potential, he just doesn\u2019t apply himself.\u201d Over and over, like a loop in my head. I remembered my messy room, getting in trouble for talking in class, getting beat by my mom, missing the school bus, hiding my report cards, acing tests but never doing homework. And through it all, I knew I wasn\u2019t dumb. I was just struggling in a way no one understood, not even me.\n\nAnd I cried because little me went through so much. Little me was punished so often. But little me wasn\u2019t understood. Little me didn\u2019t get the support he needed. And now, as an adult, I have to be the one to give him that. ",

You can now nurture little you retrospectively in the ways he needs to be nurtured by making sure he feels accepted and by providing some context for all the times he didn't feel accepted in the past. A useful exercise is to have an imaginary conversation with your inner child, providing reassurance. You can also write a letter to your inner child, telling him what he needs to know. It's sometimes done as part of \"re-parenting\" the inner child, but I don't think you need to see it like that. You can just see it as reframing that inner child's experience in terms that make sense for him, given the context and the information you have now \ud83d\ude0a wishing all the very best as you both go through this journey together!",

It can get real unfun, but it\u2019s necessary, otherwise it just sits and turns into a sisyphean pain in the ass.",

People always told me I wasn\u2019t putting in any effort, meanwhile I put myself through so much pressure to accomplish life goals. It felt like I gave 200% and only got 50% compared to others. I accomplished most of my goals through sheer willpower and stress.\n\nMy biggest grief is that I only recently got into my first relationship at 28 years old. I also struggled really hard to have a fun night with someone, even if they pretty much invited me. This might not sound like much to others, but I always dreamt of getting in a relationship and having fun in bed. It was only when I first learned about ADHD during that first relationship that I started to understand where my anxieties came from, and that I pushed myself away from other people because of that. I discovered that I am actually lovable and a fun person to be with, and always have been.\n\nEven though I have an amazing 2nd partner now who is also diverse, I still grief my youth for never being able to have the same fun as others, being with someone and feeling equal. I do still thank the universe that I found out this \u201cearly\u201d, but I am sad nonetheless.\n\nMy girlfriend told me: \u201dyou are worthy\u201d yesterday and I broke down crying, because it reminded me of my past and what I have lost.",

My father told me I was just \u201ca spoiled brat\u201d. He didn\u2019t tell me until I was well into my 30s I actually got diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar disorder. I didn\u2019t even know what to do with this information until a few weeks ago when I asked my doctor to test me after 2 years of trying other treatments. I had actually forgot about it.\n\nNow I still feel horrible for all of the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d Im going through.

No. No, it wasn\u2019t. It was honestly fucked up.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, you will also (hopefully) come to realize 2 things.\u00a0\n\n\n1) Now that you do know, while it sucks you can\u2019t change the past, you can change the future.\u00a0\n\n\n2) You\u2019re still here. Mental health / health issues have taken a lot of people. Some decided it was too much, and felt the best solution was to check out of life. Others self medicated, and ODd. Some went down the wrong path, and put themselves into situations that led them to a jail cell, or, like the others, 6 feet deep.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, keep fighting.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonally, I realized that I\u2019m still here, because even though there were so many people against me, and so many people who counted me out, I never counted myself out.\u00a0\n\n\nI got some other issues.\u00a0\n\n\nI just say I\u2019m crazy.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, it was a double edged sword. I was too crazy to realize the odds were against me.\u00a0\n\n\nI missed out on a lot. I was robbed of a lot.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I also took a lot of risks that a normal person wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\n\nBack to point 1. You can too.\u00a0",

So you have to go through all of it all over again, except as an adult this time, and with no hope that you can ever improve.\n\nCongrats on your diagnosis. But if you discover that treatment doesn't actually help in any of the ways they all promise and rave about here, I'd brace yourself for all the traumas you cited coming back in the worst ways possible.",
