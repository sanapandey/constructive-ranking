I want to put effort into things including work and classes but i feel like i can\u2019t. i want to SO badly put my full energy and attention into things but even with the things i enjoy doing i always find myself going \u201cwhatever\u201d because im too tired to make it look good. my dad calls me lazy and i agree in some aspects, but i dont want to be..i want to do everything with 10/10 efficiency and effort my mind wants it but i physically cannot escape the mindset of it being decent enough for it to get me a decent grade or a few likes. \n\n\nhow do you escape the mindset of something being mediocre and your okay with it because atleast its done?? i always just want things done, even if its shit or not.",

            "body": "huh that's interesting, I have the opposite experience. my perfectionism makes it very hard to make decisions (because what if the decision is wrong/not perfect?) so I spend way too long on things...like hours and hours too long...and it only makes them marginally better and sometimes makes them worse3. (I have combo ADHD and OCD so that may play a role) But I actually aspire to a \"it's good enough\"mindset haha! Honestly I think this psychologically much healthier than perfectionism because good enough is achievable and perfection is not.",

And you build momentum that way rather than striking out on big swings.",
