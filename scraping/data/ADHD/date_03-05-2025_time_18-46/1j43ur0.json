    "selftext": "Hi. I was diagnosed with ADHD and last summer and it prompted me to try Ritalin.\n\nBefore that I was (and still am) on paroxetine to treat my depression. Since i've been taking ritalin, I was able to achieve a lot of progress in my life and higyene : My sleep schedule is mostly fixed and I feel more energetic overall. It's been 9 month id' say.\n\nThe thing is, my adhd is still an issue. I would say I have 2 problem as of now :\n\n1st is hypersensitivity : I realised how I have difficulties to address sudden conversations, like when my mom comes in to talk to me, and I always had trouble handling sounds that are too loud, too random.\n\n2 is how I tend to avoid at all cost things that will or might be depleasant, thing that will pull me out of my confort zone. Things that bore me or that I dont know how to deal with are often left unadressed. I think this hurt my personal development a lot.\n\nFor now, this post is about my treatment regarding my adhd. As I said im taking both ritalin and paroxetine on daily basis. I want to know your opinion on how I could change my treatment. My concern is mainly about paroxetine. By the way, I am followed by a psychiatrist, so every advice you may give will be talked with her first.",

Can be very helpful for ADHD sufferers in helping identify triggers and understanding your thought processes",

There are great benefits to exercice, and yet, I just cant make a habit out of it.\n\nTbf its a bit frustrating, Im out of shape and really dislike my body. I have a hard time forgiving myself when I stop doing exercices.",

It\u2019s possible that it is, but I\u2019m curious if some of the issues you\u2019re still left with just can\u2019t be \u2018cured\u2019/vastly improved with meds alone.\n\nAs I was reading what you described, I\u2019m curious if a form of talk therapy would be able to give you additional \u2018tools\u2019 to help with some these issues. Like a talk therapist (one who does not prescribe meds) could help you work through feelings/hesitancies about you steering away from uncomfortable/pleasant things to help you overcome some of that.  \n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean that in a mean way. I\u2019m stating this because I have greatly benefited from having a therapist just for the talking portion/cognitive behavioral therapy in addition to being on medication. \n\nI\u2019ve been on Adderall XR since late December. My life has greatly improved, but I still have issues with memory and other things related to ADHD. \n\nDefinitely talk to your doc like you said. They would have a little bit better idea of helping you to manage your expectations regarding meds and how you\u2019ll feel overall.",

I will try to get therapy sessions to make things more clear. I cant remember if I ever tried cognitive behavioral therapy, so ill try to remember that. I also wanted to try mindfulness meditation.\n\n  \nI will admit that I talked about a lot of thing, but I'm really concerned about the use of paroxetine. I've been taking this med for years now, because of depression. And I dont know how to evaluate its impact on me. I dont know if I should stop this med, if another would be better for my situation.",

                            "body": "That\u2019s a great question. Definitely something to bring up. \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with your med, but I did notice it\u2019s an SSRI. I\u2019m currently on Viibryd, which is the same drug class. \n\nThere was a 3 day period in January where I didn\u2019t take Viibryd because I was in bed with a nasty cold. I know I was sick, but I was extra irritable and didn\u2019t feel like myself, even when I was almost better. I realized I had forgotten to take it for those 3 days. Once I took it again, the following day I felt so much better. Less irritable. \n\nSo even though I have the Adderall now on board, it seems I still need the Viibryd for irritability and to continue to help. I was on Zoloft for some postpartum depression, but switched over to Viibryd in hopes I wouldn\u2019t have the weight gain side effect. \n\nSo for me, this currently combo I\u2019m on helps. But everyone metabolizes and reacts to meds differently. \n\nI tried Celexa and Lexapro in my 20s for anxiety/depression, and I do not feel either one helped. I just ended up gaining 20lbs over 7ish months. And both of those are also SSRIs. But for me, the Zoloft helped so so much, and the Viibryd is helping too. And with the Viibryd, I don\u2019t have the weight gain. \n\nSo if you are comfortable, then maybe trying a different med for your depression could be beneficial. It can be frustrating too though unfortunately because some people need to try more than one to find the right med for them.",
