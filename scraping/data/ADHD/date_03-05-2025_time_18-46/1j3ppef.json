    "selftext": "Hi guys, I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child but pretty much blocked all OT supports because I was normal and didn't need help (lol) and I left such a gap that I now need to be rediagnosed with Adult ADHD before I can avail of supports. \n\nBasically I think I was so defensive about my ADHD and unconsciously masking that I have developed really thick mental walls so much so that it's even difficult for me to work out whether I'm depressed or not!\n\nI would really like to start therapy but I am worried about starting therapy with a psychiatrist who doesn't have knowledge of ADD/ADHD.\n\nIf anyone has similar experiences I would love to hear them!",
