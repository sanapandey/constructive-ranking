    "selftext": "Hi All - I wanted to first off thank everybody who commented on my last post. I decided to go see a new doctor who sent in a prescription of Vyvanse. I'm trying to decide when I should start it based on what the early side effects might be. If anybody has any suggestions on what to expect and/or if there's any kind of activities I should avoid until I get adjusted. Thanks!\n\n  \nEdit - I'm a 50 year old male and am currently taking Paxil",

            "body": "I\u2019m on a high dose of Vyvanse and have been for a couple of years. I take mine about 6am because I need to be on go for my morning routine-kids, dog, getting ready, work. I am not a breakfast person typically but I force myself to have something with protein as that seems to help with absorption. If I take it at 6, I can expect it to last through work and exercise-2-3pm. I\u2019m in grad school so I do have a short acting stim for studying/class. So, it\u2019s all about timing for when you need it most. \nI am used to stimulants and had plenty of self-medicating experience before I was treated for ADHD so any side effects were not a surprise-appetite somewhat suppressed (this gets somewhat better). I like Vyvanse better than Adderall as it seems to not have such a noticeable onset and no crash later. Best of luck on your journey and stay hydrated.",
