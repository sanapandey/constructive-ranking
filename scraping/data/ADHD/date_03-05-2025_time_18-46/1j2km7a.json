    "selftext": "I started strattera 3 weeks ago. Did well on it. Had insomnia first couple days and slight irritability but it got better. I was doing great, just had heart palpitations and chest pain so I stopped it. I felt great on it, just felt like I was having a stroke. \nDoc put me on Qelbree and I began having vivid awful nightmares. Horror nightmares, fighting demons, paranoia at waking, etc. \n\nShe now thinks I have a mood disorder due to the insomnia, nightmares, irritability\u2026.. but I don\u2019t pass the bipolar tests. All the tests she\u2019s done are negative. \nAfter reading, aren\u2019t these side effects normal for these medications? I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m bipolar. I don\u2019t have these symptoms when I\u2019m not on these meds.\nAnyone experienced this? ",

            "body": "I would seek a 2nd opinion from another doctor. Mood disorder could be something different than bipolar- it could be depression or generalized anxiety. However, it could be side effects! \nI\u2019m on Wellbutrin and Vyvanse. When I got on Wellbutrin it changed my sleeping patterns. I was able to wake up more easily in the morning. My point is- the nightmares might mean that your sleep cycle has changed- maybe you are getting more REM sleep now when before you got less. I don\u2019t know. There are just different factors to consider than jumping immediately to all the sudden you have a mood disorder.",

They say it usually appears in the first months of medication. \n\nBe patient, but mostly be careful!",
