    "selftext": "I was curious if others experience this sensation. Some days I will get up and just feel nothing. I wouldn't call it depression, it's just a feeling of nothingness. No emotions, no motivations, no bad feelings either. Like you are just sitting inside your own body waiting for it or your brain to do something. I find this happens a lot more on the weekends and I need to take my medication to snap out of it.",

Went from brain doing conspiracy theories to that feeling you get when a plane exits the cloud and there's just blue everywhere, or the feeling of mirror still lake. It's kinda pleasant, and usually doesn't last very long. Sometimes it turns into autistic shutdown instead, and that's a whole different animal. But to me those two are related because both have the same feeling of stillness. I think of it as my brain doing a lil reboot.",

No emotions, no urgency, just this weird empty state where even thinking feels like too much effort. It\u2019s not sadness, not boredom, just\u2026 nothing.\n\n\nFor me, this happens most when I don\u2019t have structure, like on weekends when there\u2019s nothing forcing my brain to engage. Meds help snap me out of it, but if I don\u2019t take them, I just drift. Sometimes, even after taking them, I still need something external\u2014like a podcast, music, or even a random task\u2014to pull me out of the void.\n\n\nIf you relate to this, this video really captures the weird way ADHD meds can make such a huge difference between feeling present and feeling nothing: youtube[dot]com/watch?v=bQ_wDpISzGY. You\u2019re not alone in this.",
