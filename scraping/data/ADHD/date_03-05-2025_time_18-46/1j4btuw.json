    "selftext": "As the title says, I know this has been asked before but I really need help with getting a good system for paying my bills ON TIME. I could rifle through the history but I think the key point is that I'm stuck sending CHECKS for some bills & that's where my snag is. \n\nRight now, I'm barely making it by, got a small private loan to try & get a small cushion of cash while I try to get some things back on track. (please don't rip into me for the loan, I know the consequences & made sure I can pay off early without penalty, this is just for a few weeks, if that.)\n\nSo I have a good amount of knowledge about finances & I know what I *need* to do, but for some reason I keep falling behind on a few things. I have tried budget trackers, calendars, journals, notebooks- I write it down & throw it in the bag & forget it for weeks. The best thing I've found that's worked for like five days now is the traditional bullet journal idea, modified to fit in my pocket. Problem is, I still have a habit of putting it in a bag & forgetting it on weekends.\n\nSo anyway, my water & mortgage have to be sent via check. (Well, technically, I could pay water online but it's a 15% fee every time, I can't make myself do it because that's outrageous.) The mortgage company sometimes takes like 3-4 weeks to cash any checks I send.  The water process faster but sometimes I still forget to send it for a couple weeks (or think that I did send it because I did write the check, but didn't put it in the mail.)\n\nSo does anyone have a **tip or trick for remembering/managing sending checks for bills?** I cannot make these automated per the mortgage company (long story).

Otherwise they just mail a check. This means the bill pays would come out of your account when the check is sent so you\u2019re not relying on whoever to cash them.\n\nTry looking on your online banking portal for a \u201cBill Pay\u201d center and set them up from there.\n\nI try to set every possible bill to automatically recur, that\u2019s really the best mitigation though I understand income situations may differ.",

            "body": "Does your bank offer automatic bill pay from your checking account? I am able to set this up online, basically the bank automatically withdraws the money from my account, and prints and mails a physical check to the place I am paying. It should work just like writing a check from your checkbook and mailing it (but with the benefit that the check 'clears' right away, so you aren't thinking you have more than you do because the mortgage company took four weeks to process a check). It obviously works better for amounts that are the same every month, because you can set it as a recurring payment and not touch it again. You can also schedule one-time payments for bills that the amount changes each month - set it up right when you get the bill from the company to be sent by the due date.\n\n\nYou might also be able to ask the utility company to bill you the same amount each month (my electric company offers this and calls it the equal pay method). They bill based on an average of past use, and then true it up once a year based on actual use. You can also ask to change your due dates so they aren't scattered throughout the month, but are instead right after you get paid and can be taken care of all at once.",
