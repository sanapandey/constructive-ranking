    "selftext": "Hey guys my wife (23f) and I (25m) have been together every single day since the day we met I\u2019ve never had a more supportive love and caring partner. I just had a few questions because of her diagnosis there has been some behaviors that are typically not seen as healthy.\n\nSo for instance, she constantly reiterate, she doesn\u2019t need anybody else but me she is willing to cut off all of her friends and family. As long as she has me she\u2019s good. She literally just sits around and plays phone games. \n\nKnowing that is not particularly healthy, I have urged her to make friends. I have slapped money in her hand for her and her friends to go and do things, but it still boils down to almost a hyper fixation on me. \n\nWith me also having BP/BPD tendencies she gets very quiet shuts down and what not when I have my episodes but overall we\u2019re pretty strong and no arguing \n\nOn top of her other symptoms that don\u2019t matter (cleanliness and organization) I can work around those I just need advice on actually advice to not feel like I\u2019m accidentally isolating her but then again I\u2019ve never told her who to be or not be friends with and never have asked her to stay in the house  I\u2019m just flabbergasted that a girl in her early twenties doesn\u2019t have friends or goes out and again \u201conly wants me\u201d\n\n",

If you have other couple friends maybe do a double date or if there\u2019s a gathering for a game night or movie night and it\u2019s mostly her friends offer to go with her.  That way she has you so she feels \u201csafe\u201d and she might make a new friend while you\u2019re there that happens to click and it takes off from there.",

Usually when I\u2019m deep in my phone I\u2019m either avoiding my job or I\u2019m in waiting mode like I expect to be asked to do something and don\u2019t want to be distracted from what I actually want to do so I get on reddit. Does she actually enjoy the phone games or is it more like maybe she just doesn\u2019t know what else to do?  Also is she taking any medication?",
