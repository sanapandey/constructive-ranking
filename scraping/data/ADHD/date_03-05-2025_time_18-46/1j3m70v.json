It seems wherever I divert my attention to, that being my arms, my legs, my finger tips, my mouth, doesn't matter where the spotlight of my focus ends up, I can always find somewhere that isn't comfortable just by thinking about it. It sucks. \n\nI wish I could just sit still and be comfortable like everyone else. ",

Also have sensory issues while trying to go to sleep. Unless im really tired or medicated/stoned it takes me forever to get comfortable.",
