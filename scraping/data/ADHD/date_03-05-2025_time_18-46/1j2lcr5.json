And I thought that it had a good effect, only issue was the 50mg just didnt last long enough, so I got prescribed 70mg and I thought that was okay-ish but kind of strong until 12 days in when I just felt like a legit zombie, I felt like I lost all concentration I got from elvanse and I just stared at my wall with no thoughts and it kind of correlated with me starting to do worse with my job so I thought something was surely wrong. Felt really empty and odd. Told my prescriber and they said to move back down to 50mg and now it\u2019s my second day - I don\u2019t feel the same as I did on 50mg before, I still feel pretty zombie-like. I feel stupid.\n\nAnyone know what this is about? Am i imagining things? I feel like I\u2019m going lowkey insane, did I just have like too much of a dose and I need to readjust back? I really hope I get the benefits back since they helped so much.",

            "body": "Hey, so I\u2019ve experienced something similar to this. During finals in law school, I would sometimes take more than my prescribed dose. Not supposed to, obviously, but it was a high stress desperate time.\n\nWhat I recommend you do is take a break for at least a day, no Elvanse. Ideally two days if you can. Your brain/adrenals/neurotransmitters are likely fried from the 70mg dose which was way too high for you. \n\nI\u2019m not a doctor but I\u2019ve taken Vyvanse/Elvanse for 10 years and have learned a lot in that time. If your dose is too high and you keep taking more, day in day out, which you did for 12 days, you just get totally fried. Vyvanse doesn\u2019t work properly if you\u2019re sleep deprived, exhausted, dehydrated. You need to take a break for a few days to let your body and brain rest.\n\nYou may feel crappy when you take this break, but that\u2019s okay, it will pass. Take a day or two off Vyvanse, then continue at 50mg. If it\u2019s wearing off too early, I recommend boosting an extra 10mg or 20mg to \u201cget you through\u201d the rest of the day. I have done this many times with my doctors blessing.\n\nTo do this you can ask for 50mg and 20mg capsules from your doctor. Or you can open up your 70mg capsule, and split it into 3 equal sized doses. 2 of those doses combined equal roughly 50mg, 1 dose equals roughly 20mg. \n\nFor now, take a day or two off and just take it easy. Hydrate, rest, make sure you get good sleep. And come back again after that back to 50mg. Forget 70mg, that dose is way too high for you, as you\u2019ve seen! \n\nI\u2019ve experienced a similar effect after studying for law school finals, and after taking a break off of Elvanse, and then resuming again at a lower dose, I was back to normal.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you have, and let me know how it goes. Good luck! Try not to stress too much, your body is over stimulated right now but IT WILL PASS shortly. You\u2019ll be back to normal shortly. Hang in there, you\u2019ll be okay.",

Relieved to hear I\u2019m not alone since it\u2019s hard to find much about this.\n\nSince I wrote this post yesterday, I want to add that it\u2019s my 3rd day back on 50mg and I feel slightly more normal so I think I\u2019m getting better already but still feeling very sluggish and messed up. Just a thought though, could it be possible that 50mg is also too much? I did take it for a month straight, but I remember 30 and 40 working decently beforehand and I\u2019ve heard people say to stick to the lowest dosage possible. Only reason I ever even went up from 30 is because of duration concerns, though it\u2019s hard to think now if I had difference in therapeutic effect so I don\u2019t even know. My prescriber also takes so long to answer and she plainly ignores half of my email contents",

I\u2019m a 35 year old male, 6 feet, 30mg is my dose. However, it only lasts for a few hours so I usually boost with an extra 15-20 later in the afternoon.\n\nIf I were you, I would try 30mg again and see how it feels. Keep a little journal that logs when you take it, what side effects, if any, you notice, and just short notes generally about you feel mentally and physically.",
