    "selftext": "I like to think I'm good at multitasking. However I noticed that if I do too much of it I forget to do things. Like read the whole email, or forget how to finish a sentence.  Today I was trying to tell my coworker that she had a call, got stuck on a sentence and even my boss was like. Take a deep breath and try again lol. \n\nPoint is, how do you recognize shut down before you get to that point and what do you do about it?",

For example: I set alarms for the laundry because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll forget it in the washer and it\u2019ll get all mildewy. \n\nAnother example: I\u2019ll make lists of things I need to do on certain projects at work. I\u2019ll make checklists for things I regularly forget on my projects. \n\nPretty much I rely on my memory as little as possible because I KNOW it will fail me.",

I use my phone to play Pandora so I don\u2019t use it for Reddit. The day before an off day I make a SMALL list of things I need to accomplish so I can see them (If I write down 6 small steps to complete one task, that looks like 6 things to do) \n\nIf I sit and do nothing I panic when I realize my wife is about to be home and I didn\u2019t do anything productive and I just feel disappointed in myself and my wife doesn\u2019t really understand why I\u2019m so gloomy and tired because I didn\u2019t do anything all day.",

But in reality, it it one of the causes why I can\u2019t finish things out because I kept jumping from one task to another task. I don\u2019t even create to do list. That\u2019s why I had a therapy, either I have to make a choice, do a lifestyle change or take meds. I chose the first one. I downloaded Skipper in my chrome browser, and starts doing todo list in MSTeams. My life now is better. Thank God!",
