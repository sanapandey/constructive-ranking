    "selftext": "I'm 27 and I have loved cars all my life. I have read car books and magazines ever since I learnt how to read. But I grew up poor and I never had a car which I could drive and I couldn't afford driving classes. I didn't have friends who were willing to teach me either.\n\nSo most of my adult life I have been laughed at and mocked because of my inability to drive so I saved up money and bought an used car.\n\nIt's been two months and I have improved significantly. It's a manual which I was barely able to move in the beginning but now I'm being able to get around well enough. Although it feels like a sensory overload and I get so stressed I start sweating. I mess up turns, I mess up parking (I once parked so bad my car entire rear left door got scratched, which thankfully got better with a scratch remover). My car is right-hand drive and I find it very difficult to judge the left side of the car.\n\nNow here's the bigger trouble: I live in Gurgaon where traffic laws don't exist, the road conditions are nightmarish and everyone drives like absolute maniacs.\n\nI just can't concentrate enough, I constantly have this dread that I will hit something or someone. Changing gears, being at the right speed, maneuvering correctly, checking your mirrors, looking ahead, looking out for all sorts of things I can hit and managing all of this at once seems impossible.\n\nSeeking advice.",
