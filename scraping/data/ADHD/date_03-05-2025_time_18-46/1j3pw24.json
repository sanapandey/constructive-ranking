    "selftext": "I'd put the advice flair on this but then I realised it's going to be more of me wanting similar experiences rather than actually asking for advice, although you all are welcome to leave advice if you'd like to. \n\nI've tried many times to get diagnosed, or get a referral for one and yet none seem to just.. take me seriously?? I don't know if it's because I talk so much about my symptoms or that it feels like I'm making them all up and yet I still go back to square one. Being confused at why I'm so relunctant to do anything, or better yet taking forever to do a task just because deep down i get overwhelmed by all the little things i need to do. Granted, these aren't all my symptoms but I've been really dying to get a diagnosis just to get a sense ot at least confirm what I think I'm experiencing. \n\nMost of the time I'm in a session, I was always treated nicely but then when i say I want a diagnosis for ADHD they say it's complicated. Sometimes they'll tell me that I'm struggling with something in my head and that I just need to get \"rid\" of the obstacle, or that I'm not exhibiting symptoms in front of them. Most of the time they'll say if I have it then as a kid I should have been diagnosed. Unfortunately that's the problem when you grow up with parents who doesn't believe in mental disorders, they don't take you to one even when there's just so many evidence of teachers complaining about your learning deficiency in school. \n\nHonestly I'm stumped, I don't think I should even get diagnosed at this point. If it gets terrible enough and I think I need medicine, I'll consider of getting one again. Barely holding onto whatever strat I have left to just pull myself up and finish my degree but yeahh is a tough world out there folks.",

This sounds like the way my partner was treated by primary care doctors, but that would be a pretty unprofessional way to handle it as a psychiatrist. You may need to insist upon an ADHD screening instead of just the vibes thing they appear to be doing. But either way whoever you're currently talking about is an unprofessional chucklebucket, and even if they diagnose you they'll still be pretty uninformed about ADHD. You probably want a new psychiatrist before you try again.",

An ADHD diagnosis is protected under the ADA Act if applicable.  Best thing I ever did.\n\nIf they ask for a referral say \"some dude on reddit\" which would probably fly. \n\nI hope this helps, this is how you get a documented diagnosis on paper in my experience.",
