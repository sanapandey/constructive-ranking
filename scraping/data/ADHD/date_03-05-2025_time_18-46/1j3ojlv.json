    "selftext": "American comedian Paul Scheer was interviewed on Neal BrenNan\u2019s podcast entitled Blocks. In it, he briefly spoke about having received an adult adhd diagnosis. He also wrote a NYTimes best-selling autobiography entitled Joyful Recollections of Trauma and included a chapter (entitled, What\u2019s your Problem?) which is all about his adhd.\n\n(https://www.amazon.com/Joyful-Recollections-Trauma-Paul-Scheer/dp/0063293714)\n\nEdited to add: ugh. I can't edit the title above but obvs it's supposed to be PAUL Scheer, not PAU. \n\n  \n",
