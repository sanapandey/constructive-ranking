I miss the ability to disappear into a new hobby for however long it lasts. \nI\u2019m finding that although the meds work well and I am far more competent at life with them, my down time is now just taken up with chronic doomscrolling. \nI\u2019d love to find something to do to fill those hours. I\u2019ve tried getting back into one of the billion crafts I started and quit but nothing is hitting the spot. \nNo idea why I\u2019m posting this, I\u2019m not sure what if any advice can be given. I figured I\u2019d throw it out there to the community to see if anyone has any ideas or words. Thanks. \u263a\ufe0f ",

I can do what society expects of me.\u00a0\n\n\nMedication lets me keep up in a world not designed for me, and people like me.\u00a0\n\n\n*But!*\n\n\nMedication doesn't *fix* you. It doesnt *heal* you. Because there's nothing to fix, and nothing to heal. We're coping with a society in which our natural roles in a pre-captialistic society don't exist, and one in which our strengths are only used in a very narrow way.\u00a0\n\n\nSo, it's kind of like... you didn't *lose* that part of yourself.\u00a0\n\n\nYou chose stability over the highs and lows. You may miss those obsessions, but do you miss everything falling apart around you as you indulge them?\n\n\nNot to be assumptive.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is all a trade-off, like anything. But you are still whole. You may miss the sparkle, the flame... but do you miss the ashes?",

And it radiates farther than obsessive fixations, in my experience. Maybe you're not engaged in these because you recognize more important things and prioritize them?\n\n\nADHD sometimes makes us feel like we can be anything and everything.\u00a0\n\n\nBut, we cannot. It is the limitation of having one body and one life in that body. Do what you can, it's enough. We have to prioritize, and we cannot mourn what could have been. That's an illusion.\n\n\nI hope that is in any way helpful. Thanks for sharing.",

When you don't have a specific sparkle to draw you away from it, the conmectivity is much harder to put down but still well worth it.",
