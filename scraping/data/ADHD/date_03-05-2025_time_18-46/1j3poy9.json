    "selftext": "So I did an online ADHD test (Connors) that my psychologist told me to take to evaluate me. She just called me saying that my answers and my sister\u2019s answers were highly negative and it is rare that people with ADHD are this severe.\n\nEven though my doctor explained to me multiple times, I still don\u2019t understand. This test is all from a scale of agreed to disagree  (or something very similar to that). Wouldn\u2019t people with ADHD choose the agree answer if the most? How is it that two people (my sister, and I), testing for one person (me) both choose mostly agree answers. Could it actually be that I agree????? All we have to do is retake the test, but what if it happens again? Is she in the wrong here or what is going on?",

                    "body": "The way I thought it worked is that those tests were only a PART of the assessment (that\u2019s how it was for me anyway). My psych wanted to corroborate my answers with the thoughts of other people close to me, like my mother, for the exact reason that (as he stated): \n\nwhile he didn\u2019t believe I was lying or exaggerating on the self assessments, as individuals it\u2019s hard for us to see things from outside our own perspective, so the answers may seem exaggerated because that\u2019s how we see things internally. I worded that wrong I know but hopefully it makes some kind of sense. \n\nBasically we are the best at knowing ourselves, but at the same time if we\u2019re stuck in these symptoms and struggling to the point of seeking help we may \u201cexaggerate\u201d the answers unintentionally because that\u2019s where we are at personally. Whereas if you were at a point in your life where you weren\u2019t struggling as much with the symptoms your answers may reflect that. Basically it\u2019s a good way to see where you\u2019re at, but it isn\u2019t the best OVERALL look at it as we only see things from where we are at personally. \n\nHe also said too that (mind you none of this was in an accusational way, just explaining why he did things the way he did in order to get the right diagnosis and treatment I needed to help me) sometimes if we\u2019ve fully convinced ourselves that we know what the problem is, we may accidentally skew the answers somewhat. Which is why they often seek information from a family member or close friend who has known you since childhood.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that was way longer than I intended it to be, but basically what I think is in OP\u2019s case here it seems pointless to retake the test? If they answered true to them at this time in their life why would the answers differ? Seems like a good way to gaslight someone into playing down their struggles and eventually failing to get a proper diagnosis. I\u2019d absolutely seek another opinion.",

But the key isn\u2019t just whether you answer \"agree\" a lot, it\u2019s which questions you\u2019re agreeing to and how those patterns compare to ADHD diagnostic criteria.\n\n\nFor example, if you strongly agree with statements about being easily distracted, struggling with organization, or forgetting tasks, that aligns with ADHD symptoms. But if you\u2019re mostly agreeing with statements about mood swings or anxiety, that might point to something else.\n\n\nAlso, having both you and your sister fill it out helps catch blind spots. Sometimes we don\u2019t notice how much we struggle with certain things, but people close to us do. The fact that your answers were similar actually strengthens the case that what you\u2019re experiencing is real.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re overthinking it (which, let\u2019s be real, is very ADHD), this video breaks down the whole \u201cis this actually ADHD or am I just imagining it?\u201d struggle really well: youtube[dot]com/watch?v=bQ_wDpISzGY.

They may want to get diagnosed so they can access the Medciatiin or get extra time in tests.\n\nOne of the things they found that tells them if someone is faking is if the symptoms are too severe in the study.  If the ratings are too high, then it\u2019s highly likely to be fake.  Especially because people with ADHD tend to downplay their symptoms and rate them lower than they are due to lack of awareness.\n\nSo they may suspect that.\n\nThe other issue is that it would be very, very rare to have severe ADHD and get to adulthood without being diagnosed in childhood.",
