I take my physical and reading tests next week and I\u2019m questioning the likelihood of my adhd getting in the way of the job.\n\nI know I can pass the physical part of the exam but the reading test is what will get me, since it\u2019s timed and I tend to read things once or twice to fully grasp it.\n\nI can be extremely focused and detailed once I \u201cget the hang of something\u201d but if I can\u2019t understand something I just space out, even if I try and force myself to pay attention. \n\nHow difficult was training? What are some things you do to manage your ADHD?",

The training programme is 2.5 years and used to be quite selective, although they\u2019ve struggled with recruitment in the last few years and have made it easier to get in.",
