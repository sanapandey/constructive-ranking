    "selftext": "Is it the ADHD or something else? I know we are all obsessed with having our \"systems\" to accomplish things on the daily. For the most part, I've come to terms with the fact that my brain works better under certain conditions and that I can optimize for those more times than not.\n\nBut when the day gets away from me and I feel like I've been rotting instead of getting to a good point in work projects, how am I supposed to feel? I've already made a lot of progress in reframing some bad habits of guilt and shame around an unproductive day, but it always feels like 2 steps forward, one step back because I'll have a day where I work ahead and then a day.I can't focus and my confidence just shatters until I drag myself back up again. It's exhausting. \n\nPlease tell me I'm not the only one.",

I know exactly what you are talking about with the guilt or shame. It\u2019s unfortunately something that we have to learn to work through/manage with ADHD. People don\u2019t realize how debilitating ADHD actually can be.",

I basically take what they make and implement it in prod environments. I\u2019d say about 80% of what I do is troubleshooting, identifying bugs, and working with our devs to fix it. \n\nYou\u2019d be surprised at how prevalent ADHD is in software engineers or tech in general. We\u2019re incredible problem solvers when we can harness our ADHDness. \n\nMy advice to you would be to pay attention to your mental health and what works for you. Whether that be medication or other coping strategies. You\u2019ll thank yourself later when you enter the market. \n\nADHD aside, I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a CS major? Look for internships as soon as possible and work on projects on your own time. Tech companies typically care more about your ability to do the work, than just having a degree. A good number of CS students will graduate without having done an internship or work outside of what was required in class and they find the job market a lot more difficult than someone that not only graduated with a degree, but also did internships as well. \n\nIf you have more questions, feel free to PM me. I\u2019m happy to share insight!",

All these years later and I'm (somehow) college educated and running an IT department at a small business while my parents are working the same dead-end jobs they were 25 years ago, probably making less than back then because of inflation.",

Once you go from the healthy to the unhealthy, it can feel stressful in an unhelpful way.\n\n\nI would argue pressure is good for you, but for people like us, we need a very particular and specific system in place to use pressure in a healthy and productive way so that we don't feel overwhelmed.",
