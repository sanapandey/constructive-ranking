    "selftext": "I'm trying to narrow down some issues with my 7-year-old son, who was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago. I also have ADHD and have been managing it since I was around his age.\n\nWe've been working with a combination of medication (currently Focalin in two different doses) and a lot of dietary controls, like avoiding food dyes (especially red dye), gluten, and fake sugars. The gluten is allergy related.  \n\nRecently, we noticed a complete reversal in his behavior\u2014less self-control, focus, and mood stability. The only change we can think of is a new Cirkul water bottle with flavor inserts. Although they don't have food dyes, my wife found an article linking sodium benzoate to negative effects on college students with ADHD. We're concerned it might be impacting our son even more due to his age.\n\nHas anyone else experienced negative effects from sodium benzoate, either personally or with their children? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",

But there\u2019s no harm in eliminating it from his diet and seeing if any positive changes take place.\n\nHumans are so complicated that there are an infinite number of things that could be causing this. Unpredictable behavioral patterns are normal in growing children. Also, stimulants are very intense on the nervous system, and especially powerful for growing children. Could these behaviors be caused by his medication?\n\nP.S. \u2014You guys seem like amazing parents for being so observant and caring for your child. The world needs more parents like y\u2019all. You should be proud :)",

There\u2019s so much my mother didn\u2019t know back then that has changed today.\n\nI have medication near the bottom of my list of potential causes. My reasoning is that he\u2019s been on it since July/August, and things had been steadily improving as we fine-tuned the dosage. He\u2019s also been off food dyes even longer, since we identified Red 40 as a major trigger that caused multi-week downward spirals.\n\nThe recent issues started after we got back from a cruise about a month ago. My wife bought him the Cirkul bottle as a reward (I can\u2019t remember for what), and she double-checked the ingredients to make sure it didn\u2019t have food dyes. Sodium benzoate wasn\u2019t even on our radar until now. It\u2019s the only truly new variable we can trace.\n\nUnless he\u2019s sneaking candy at school\u2014which is definitely a possibility",
