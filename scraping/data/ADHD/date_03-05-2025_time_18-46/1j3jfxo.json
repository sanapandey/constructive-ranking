I will constantly monitor my votes when I first post something and get hurt when I see even one downvote. I know this is my Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria kicking in but wondering if I\u2019m the only one who feels like this? Perhaps it gets better the more you post.\n\nEdit: I am seriously touched by how many people share this experience and I\u2019ve once again been reminded that I am not alone in my emotions. Thank you for that, everyone <3 I truly appreciate this.",

One person downvotes and the next will see that and go into reading the comment already assuming that what that person said was wrong.

About 30 mins after making some comments I\u2019ll check my profile to see if any are tanking. If they are, I delete them. I don\u2019t come on Reddit to argue. I have no use for it, and most times you don\u2019t accomplish anything even if you \u201cwin\u201d the argument. 95% of the time they will never admit to wrong ofc. I don\u2019t bother blocking people either, because you never know. They probably just misunderstood your comment and you caught them on a bad day. Can\u2019t worry about it. And so that I don\u2019t worry about it, I just go ahead and delete comments that are causing a ruckus. If a comment gets multiple people replying the exact same thing then I will delete the comment too. Upvotes are nice, but I don\u2019t need my inbox exploding any more than I need people arguing with me, lol.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnyway, ya. I find all that stuff to be stressful and just sitting there worrying about what someone may reply is stressful and can ruin my day, so I just don\u2019t do it anymore. I also am ofc not part of any political subs. Imo they are only for people that want to argue, or for people that want validation on their choices.

They do this is make their own posts go to the top, so it might not always be a person behind the downvotes. \n\nI try not to focus on them anyways, it doesnt mean anything.   Also, people don't use the downvotes right.  Its not meant to be used just cuz you hate someone elses opinion, and alot of people just use it like that.  Its supposed to be used for 'low quality posts'. not even sure what that means, probably spamming and promoting is considered low quality i would say tho.",

It's a cluster of symptoms associated with ADHD.\n\nWe all may have it but it's not a diagnosable disorder, which means there is no treatment for it.  So when I have a strong RSD reaction to something, I try to reflect and be self analytical about what's actually making me feel that particular way.\n\nI think it's an untreated anxiety disorder which has its roots deep in to the \"emotional memory\" of my brain.  I tend to recall the bad in my life much more than I can remember the good things.  It's like every bad moment comes with a free DVD copy of the event that I can recall at any point in time.  So, when I feel that RSD come kicking in, - it's not about being downvoted on reddit, it's about reliving me being 5 years old and getting picked on and excluded from playing with the other kids.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.",

It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.
