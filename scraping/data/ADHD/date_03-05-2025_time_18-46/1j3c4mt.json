    "selftext": "I met with my medicine provider this morning, and I told her I wanted to switch from adderal XR to Vyvanse because I don\u2019t like the crash and adderal doesn\u2019t last me nearly as long as it needs to. \n\nWe tried to start me on vyvanse 10mg, but she didn\u2019t send the generic so it was >150$. After speaking with my insurance, I found they will cover the generic, so I asked she send that instead. \n\nShe said since I\u2019m on XR adderal, we could just do a direct switch to vyvanse, and put me on 20mg. I told her I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not how it works, and I thought 20mg adderal was not equal to 20mg vyvanse, but I do get she\u2019s the doctor and I don\u2019t want to argue too much. I just feel like she doesn\u2019t really hear me out, and I\u2019m so busy being a full time student and working full time, that I\u2019m really worried my struggles will come back being on too low of a dose. \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be too big of a deal, but I do pay a copay every time I meet with her, but I also won\u2019t meet with her for another month to try and increase my dose. And even then, she will only increase it by 10mg a month. Anyone else been in a similar situation? I just don\u2019t know what to do! I\u2019m not sure how to find another provider near me either.",

            "body": "I\u2019m confused on the wording. Most of the time, the doctor sends a prescription and it has a code that allows for brand OR generic unless the patient requests brand specifically. Also vyvanse generic IS usually covered by insurance but it\u2019s expensive, so your copay when you pick it up may still be high. It\u2019s common for people to stay on adderall because it\u2019s cheaper.\n\nAdding for context: I get a lot of patients as an intern that say \u201cI switched back because it\u2019s cheaper\u201d and even a pharmacist that was like \u201cyou must have good insurance if you\u2019re on vyvanse.\u201d It\u2019s still a newer generic, so it\u2019ll take time to be cheaper",

It was hell of a ride lol.\n\nI was pretty annoyed that my doctor didn\u2019t know the dosages weren\u2019t equivalent and I eventually just had to find a different provider.\u00a0",

If you want to try it I would go with that for now and see if it helps and increase it if you need too. For reference Vyvanse goes up to 70mg so 20mg is usually the lowest starting dose.",

            "body": "Yea your situation is not the best on the doctor side of things. Considering Adderall XR at 20mg was not much of a novelty for you, then the direct translation of dosage to Vyvanse will most likely not do much. For anecdotal reference, I was trialing adderall XR at a max dose of 30mg and then when switching to Vyvanse, only getting somewhat of a desired feeling at around 50-60mg.\n\nObviously everything on this sub must be taken case-by-case, seen as everyone reacts differently with meds, however, it is quite a known fact that Adderall-Vyvanse translation is not 1:1.",
