Having sex with the same partner after a while bores me. I am always looking for the next best looking thing that I can bed. I dont know if some of my childhood trauma is baked into it being that I grew up in an abusive household or theres people like me who deal with the same issues. It has cost me alot mentally. I dont know if I can stay in a monogamous relationship. ",

Unfortunately for me it's around 2-3 years which is enough time to build a really great stable relationship with future plans and family connections and comfortability. Then I get bored and my mind goes back to fantasies of non-monogamy and the unmatched thrill of new relationship energy. I'm actually going through it right now, yet again, with an amazing partner. It's an internal struggle of deciding whether or not to just ignore these thoughts or act on them and end the relationship for grass that my brain tells me is greener.",

Therapy has to be specific to work.\n\n\nTherapy for your sexual dysfunction would focus on that, and would probably be about why you don't feel arousal, how you can get back to feeling arousal, and how to achieve it.\n\n\nLike a lot of women don't actually know what the arousal pattern is, or they do know they just suppress is because they don't think their partner can achieve it. There's so many people who thinks they should just naturally feel arousal, but that's no true. A lot of people need to be actively turned on to feel arousal.\u00a0\nLoving someone doesn't make arousal automatic.\n\n\nThe first line of defense is sleep. People who don't sleep well don't want to have sex.\n\n\nThe next is if you feel good about yourself. If you don't feel safe, if you don't feel desired, if you're tired,\u00a0 and if you don't get to do things that gives you energy, if course your libido suffers.\n\n\nIf you're on mood stabilizers, those are known to kill your libido. Trying new meds can be worth it.\n\n\nFatigue. If you feel like you're constantly playing catch up, you get fatigued, and sex is on the back burner..\n\n\nADHD burnout famously kills libido\n\n\nSo yeah, therapy for sexual dysfunction would focus on things like these.\u00a0\nIf you think it's the PTSD that causes it, then that would also be a focus.\nTalk therapy isn't known to be very effective against PTSD, but there are treatments. It doesn't have to be forever.\u00a0",

Sleep is terrible atm, in part due to changing meds to get off worse ones (don't know that I'd consider either to be mood stabilisers at the low dose I'm on though). I've been burnt out and depressed lately, but this is improving.\n\nI acknowledge that I'm essentially reframing the purpose of sex in my life. Ie. Unhealthy patterns/behaviours due to trauma. And the biggest one of all.... We want a baby. But I'm utterly terrified of being pregnant. I'm also \"geriatric\" as far as pregnancy goes, only adding to the stress of this. As soon as we were married in November my libido closed up shop (also due to an incident that related to a loss of trust - no this wasn't cheating before anyone asks).\n\nI'm struggling to feel safe in regard to trust and intimacy. Very rarely in my life have I felt good about myself. It took years of work to get there, and this event has damaged that all over again.\n\nI've had/have some health issues in recent years, causing fatigue as well. I can't even remember what feeling well rested is.. Do people actually feel this?? Genuine question. If I waited until I feel well rested, I'd die one day at 80, never having had sex again.\n\nI've never heard of the term 'arousal pattern'. I haven't had another person arouse me for years! I have to do that for myself in the shower, then enter the bedroom. It's not that he doesn't try, and he's a very generous lover - the best actually, I married him for a reason! I've never really put much thought into what gets me aroused tbh.. Not being funny here, but do you have any examples of what you mean by arousal patterns.. Or I could just Google.. But I dunno that that's the best idea! \ud83d\ude05",

Is it that you personally want a baby but are terrified, or that he wants a baby and you're not so sure? Also if you have chronic fatigue where you feel too exhausted for sex, do you have the energy for a baby? \n\nFor the other stuff, here's a comparison. I'm severely physically disabled, have experienced sexual violence, am perimenopausal, and of course the ADHD. I very rarely get spontaneously horny, I think I'm too exhausted for a libido. I also have a copper IUD, so I am 100% sure I'm not getting pregnant. \n\nWe've been together 11 years. The sex keeps getting better and better. I love it, and I know I'll love it once I get into it. We have to make time for it, because it's so easy to forget when you have ADHD and your libido is gone, and take more time to get me turned on, which is pretty normal for people in perimenopause. Recently we've found that a blindfold (and sometimes very basic wrist restraint, just a wide ribbon I sewed loops into the ends of) helps if one of us is having trouble focusing, a tip I got from a fantasy romance novel where the author has ADHD! Last time we had sex I forgot that I'm in the middle of an ME flare and it really exhausted me afterwards, but eh, this happens sometimes, and he got me snacks and a drink immediately.",

This is something I'm working through with my psychologist and I'm waiting to hear back about a referral to Havening therapy. I was trying another form of cultural somatic therapy, but I've been waiting three months to hear back from the provider about further appointments for this too.\n\nI have pregnancy related trauma from a termination when I was a teen (no judgement please). My brother was also born with a minor disability, back in the days before ultrasounds, and my best friend from high school nearly died when she was pregnant. It all adds up to me being terrified, but I definitely want a baby. I'm \"geriatric\" so it's kinda now or never.. But we are open to adoption and/or fostering if the natural way doesn't come to fruition.\n\nI'm not particularly affectionate, and can be rather touch adverse at times. It's fair to say that the sex I have with my husband has been the most intimate I've had, and he's incredibly patient and kind. I feel a lot of guilt for not being able to give him more in this regard. He tells me often that he doesn't have an issue not having it all the time, but the guilt still weighs heavy! He can tell if I'm doing it for him, so I really want to find ways to get ME into it again.",

And then I hyper focus on it. all or nothing\n\nI'm very committed to my husband and have no desire to cheat but I enjoy other positions and paying into interest. Odd fantasies I won't act out. I think in theory i might he had more fun with multiple partners but in practice I want to feel really safe and comfortable and vulnerable and some of the things I do require an immense level of trust and vulnerability. \n\nMy take is this, do you want to be in a monogamous relationship? If you do, you will hold yourself to reasonable standards and i promise you, 1 partner is enough. I've literally never been with anyone else but my husband so he's all I know. I'm never bored of hubby but I'm always up to try to things and switch things up and explore and that helps a ton. The love, trust and communication is more than enough to keep me happy.\n\nIf you don't want monogamy, that's fine too. As long as your practice safe sex it's not a crime to have multiple partners. I think that's a fair life choice. I like would have been more experimental if I was single with other people and that would have been fine. All depends on what you want. \n\nyou can go to therapy for introspection on why you do the things you do and really think things out about what you want. it'll help.

Like time didn\u2019t exist and 1000 years went by in an altered brain state.\n\nI think it can be hard to be present but within the right dynamic it connects to hyperfocus and like an endless supply of neurochemicals the mind is starved for most of the time as long as you don\u2019t race to the finish line and thing of the journey as the best part.  To start by thinking of the jog is the best part, not crossing the finish line. To find the bliss in maintaining what may feel like the \u201creally good but not the best\u201d part. To think of that as the best part and the finish line like the last end credits of a film. Enjoy the film, and don\u2019t worry about the credits.",

How much variety are you getting? Are you communicating your needs for variety? Or is it literally just \"consistent partner is boring\"?\n\nI don't think it's ADHD related, but I personally am incompatible with sexually 'routine' partners. I can be in a 100% vanilla sexual relationship and be satisfied. What bores me is being limited to the same flirting, the same come ons, the same foreplay, the same position(s). It feels horribly monotonous.\n\nI've ended things with a partner over it. We discussed my needs multiple times over a span of months; agreement was had.... I got one or two nights of variety then back to the routine. They weren't a good fit long term.\n\nThat said, I can't at all relate if your issue is the person themselves. I like getting to know someone's desires over time. In romantic relationships I'm a sap.",

I think it got better as I got into my 30s but I had a hard time being in relationships longer than a year or two for this reason. I\u2019d get bored and lose interest, but also, less sex became an issue for my partners. It always ate me up and I felt emasculated for not living up to stereotypes. But I\u2019m now I\u2019m in a 6 year relationship and doing ok. \n\nMy advice: (1) manage your adhd. (2) set good habits to make space for intimacy. (3) choose a partner wisely - find someone you\u2019re deeply attracted to and who can meet your needs, (4) you\u2019re going to have to find a partner with a lower sexual drive or someone who can match your wavelength. (4) it gets better as you get older. After my early 30s it calmed down and mixed with meeting the right partner, I was able to make it work over a long period of time. (5) a sex therapist or a therapist in general couldn\u2019t hurt. I tried an adhd therapist for this issue in particular but can\u2019t say it made a huge impact\u2026although it did help me overall. \n\nOverall, you won\u2019t change a lot. But if you learn who you are, how to deal with it and choose a partner compatible to you, you\u2019ll be fine in the long term. And in the short term, enjoy sewing your wild oats as they say.",
