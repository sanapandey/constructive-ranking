    "selftext": "Basically what the title says. Every time I interact with my peers I feel like I am lacking behind in life. Many others often have more life experience and mutual interest and a lot of the time I feel like I feel excluded because I lack experience. Combine that with a lot of other little things (being unaware of things like my volume and getting too loud, or my surroundings and bumping into things) and I feel like I am way less mentally mature than my peers. A lot of the time I feel like this actively burdens the people around me. Is there any way to work on this?",

It might not seem great right now, but once you embrace being yourself, life becomes pretty damn great. Sucks I didn't learn this until I was older, but you can't change your past, only your future. \n\nThe harsh truth is you probably aren't surrounding yourself with your people and will probably never feel like you fit in or are part of the group until you change who you hang out with. It sucks, but if you can find like-minded people that you actually connect with, it makes the world of a difference. \n\nTry to do what you enjoy doing, and just being yourself (super easy to do, right?), and you'll connect with the right people. \n\nEverything you mentioned, I still do. I just changed my mentality about it and learned how to accept my for who I am. I started seeing a therapist that specializes in ADHD, which has been very helpful. I recommend at least looking into it. \n\nYou're also not a burden, or the other million negative thoughts you have about yourself. You aren't lacking in anything, you're just taking a different path.",

Reason I\u2019m mentioning is that if you\u2019re comfortable doing stuff like that, you\u2019ll find many people outside your peer group and make one or two people that are on your wavelength of interests and things. ADHD people sometimes learn to relax a bit when we hang out with others like us, because we get each other",

My boss is younger than I am and he is the absolute best boss I\u2019ve ever had and where he operates vs where I operate is completely different. \nI found that I (can\u2019t speak for everyone) look at people in authority or doing better off than me to be superior than I am. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in. Counseling helps keep it from getting out of control, but I fairly certain I\u2019ll deal with until I die. \nFor reference, I\u2019m a project manager for a global automotive supplier, not exactly a small or mundane position.",
