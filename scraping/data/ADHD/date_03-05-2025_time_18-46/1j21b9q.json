    "selftext": "My medication seems to be wearing off extremely quickly.\n\nI\u2019m on both Vyvanse and Dexedrine (used as boosters). The Vyvanse is at 50 mg.\n\n- Vyvanse stops about 4-5 hours after taking it\n- Dexedrine stops about 3-4 hours after taking it\n- The crashes make it difficult to not be overly fatigued throughout the day\n\n\nIncreasing the Vyvanse dose seems to just make it stronger instead of last longer. \n\nAny ideas? Does anyone else go through this too? I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on.\n\nI\u2019ve tried water, protein, supplements, etc and nothing really makes a difference.",

Trying to combat tiredness with stimulants just leads to it coming back harder later. Fatigue and ADHD are not the same thing, though the former can make symptoms of the latter worse.",

Have they offered any explanations?\n\nMy experience with these meds has been that they make me less fatigued generally because a) I'm not dealing with ADHD symptoms all day and b) my calmer mind allows me to get to sleep easier. To achieve that I do sometime have an additional dex around 6pm if I sense that the chaos is returning. \n\nBut onto the the meds and ADHD symptoms, I have something similar. I would say my 50mg Vyvanse lasts till about 14.00, so I'll have the dex at that point. And yeah, that will run out early evening. There's usually enough left there to see me being a reasonably useful human to my family in the evening and getting to bed for a quiet sleep, but sometimes I do need that extra booster.\n\nBut like I say I don't get crashes, I just get the ADHD symptoms come back.",
