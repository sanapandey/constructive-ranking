Her tism is louder than her ADHD so working with that instead has worked for her better. \n\nI will say, dosage and type of med is big. IR adderall was a NIGHTMARE for me and stimming and just in general. 15mg dose of IR Ritalin at 8am and then the 54mg XR of Concerta at 11:30am is the perfect mix for me.

I go into a lot of detail too that seems to annoy people.\n\n-grocery shopping has always been a cluster f**k of an experience for me. So many things wrong that it was hard to pin point exactly why. Now with the medication and coaching, I'm good at planning and focusing on what I need to get, but I still have issues there with the noises from all the equipment, bright lights, and just all the people there when it's busy. It's still an ordeal for me.\n\nAnd more, I don't wanna make this too long. I'm thinking these things are my personality that was hidden under the ADHD symptoms. I've been questioning who I really am.",

Overwhelm from emotions? Too much noise? Fluorescent lights?\n\nOnce the noxious sensory input has been recognized, you can start problem solving on how to reduce it and lessen its impact.\n\nFor now, it might be helpful to drink lots of water to make sure your muscles are hydrated, over the counter meds (ibuprofen or Tylenol, follow the instructions on the bottle), over the counter pain relief topicals (biofreeze or voltaren) and use ice and/or heat to help reduce/soothe the pain.",

However, after regularly taking them for about a month, I realized that the adhd meds made me mask less which is actually a good thing because I have a tendency to mask way too hard and then I seem even more socially inept and weird than I actually am. When I\u2019m not hyperfocusing on every interaction and overthinking other people\u2019s perception of me, I\u2019m able to navigate social interactions much more naturally. \n\nIt also helped me realize how much my anxiety played into my \u201cautistic traits.\u201d I\u2019m definitely still very much autistic, but I\u2019m overall normal-er in terms of socializing and communicating when I\u2019m on my meds. \n\nThe meds also made me more aware of my sensory issues. I always said I had very minimal sensory issues compared to other autistic people I know which is still probably true, but I think part of it is that I was masking so hard that I wasn\u2019t letting myself recognize how certain things were making me feel. And then I\u2019d get really overwhelmed and irritable out of nowhere. Now I can be like \u201coh that tv is really loud and bothering me. Let me turn it down.\u201d Before meds, I wasn\u2019t able to pinpoint what was contributing to my discomfort/anxiety.",
