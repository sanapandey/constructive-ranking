    "selftext": "The argument doesn't even have to be something that deep, yk? But sometimes with my friend I start spewing out things that don't connect outloud like they do in my brain. And because I can't get them to understand, it makes me feel dumb and inferior.   \nLike I genuinely had some good points to make but, not being able to properly turn them into words/text is so discouraging...\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? And how to explain yourself without making it sound like your making excuses? Because sometimes I'll say \"Ah my brain kept jumping around\" but it genuinely just sounds like I'm making excuses for having a weak argument :')",
