    "selftext": "I returned to work after taking a temporary leave of absence. Due to my needs I needed a part time job and it caused me to have to resign from my old position. I took a job in community health nursing and it has been especially challenging for me. The organization and time management piece is especially hard for me to do. I also commute an hour to work and commute back home another hour. I go home feeling absolutely drained and on my days off I just end up sleeping. I was struggling so much that I had to ask my doctor to allow me to take 3 weeks off because my anxiety levels were so high that I constantly felt like I was in distress. I want to work but it just seems like things are just not working out for me. I had success working in med surg before with no issues but my psychiatrist doesn't want me working nights. I need to provide medical to the disability team but I don't know what to tell them. Should I quit or try to find a new area?\nThanks in advance.",
