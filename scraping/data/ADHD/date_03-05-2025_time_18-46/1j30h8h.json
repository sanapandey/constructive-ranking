The standard line about ghosts is they have unfinished business.  \n\nI was laying on bed thinking about how much I had to do still: work, housework, numerous unfinished hobbies.  Got the feeling that I would need to come back in the afterlife just to get it all done. I can relate to the undead needing just a little more time to get something done.  \n",

                    "body": "Just a prenote, these are tendencies and generalities; there are definitely going to be exceptions to this information.\u00a0\n\n\nFirst of all, the impact of a person's death is usually dependent on their \"importance\" to other people and society. Part of that is impacted by their age. For example, in societies with high child mortality rates, a child dying is normal. It's unfortunate, but they typically don't have any funeral or ritual recognition held for their death.\u00a0\n\n\nIn Western societies, with very low child mortality, a similar lack of importance is laid on the elderly. They're expected to die sooner or later, and so, while unfortunate, the impact of their death is not as great as it would have been if they were in their 30s or something.\u00a0\n\n\nHowever, when a person is an active part of society, or active in systems of interaction with many people, the impact is far greater. When they die, they are oftentimes assigned unfinished business. For example, the man who never found love, or the woman who was about to make her dream come true.\u00a0Even the elderly can play into it, such as the person horribly rejected and scorned by their lover and living the rest of their life isolated in grief.\u00a0\n\n\nGhosts oftentimes involve relationships cut off before reaching their natural end. Different cultures have different ways of handling this. In some, they want the ghost to pass on. Like in medieval (?) England, if you grieved for too long the dead person's spirit couldn't move on. The spirit would be bitter and evil because now you are unfinished business preventing them from passing on.\n\n\nOthers want the person's spirit to stay. One example in the article I read talked about a society where each man worshiped the spirit of his father (called the Sir-Ghost), and the ghost acts as a protector. The dead father's relationship with his family was cut off too soon and now he's unable to fulfill his duty to protect his family, so he does it in death. If the man dies, the Sir-Ghost has failed. He's promptly cut off and abandoned, and the recently deceased man now becomes the new Sir-Ghost.\u00a0\n\n\nThe Manus. That's the people that have the Sir-Ghost.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyway, because of the impact of their death on people, they've developed methods of coping with the unfinished business left behind by the dead person. It doesn't matter to the dead person anymore, but because it matters to those who are alive, they've created the idea of spirits and ghosts remaining on earth until their duty is finished.",

The ADHD brain loves patterns, but is more likely to get caught in a loop, rather than progressing along the spiral. The ADHD brain has a hard time discerning when it has become stuck in a loop, and because it craves patterns, it gets stuck in the loop, even if it's to it's detriment.\nADHD ghosts have just gotten stuck in the loop. Some stay longer than others because of time blindness. Sometimes they are just procrastinating. Sometimes they just need a little help coming out of the loop. Just a bit of lingering energy that hasn't transfered to the next big adventure.\n\n\nI don't think that most ghosts want to haunt people. In life, I've never wanted to agressively harass other people cuz I'm too self-absorbed. But I could probably haunt people unintentionally while being consumed by my ghostly woes.",
