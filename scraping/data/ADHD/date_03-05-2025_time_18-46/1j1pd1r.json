Sure, buying all the supplies to try a new craft isn\u2019t the smartest but there aren\u2019t really a lot of well known places to try a new craft without commitment. There should me more arts workshops and stations available where you could build stuff at.\nBe right back, I\u2019m going to go research more about it.\n\n\nEdit: I just wanna build stuff without paying a kidney for it.\nEdit 2: I\u2019m trying to do interesting stuff without staring at screens but it\u2019s hard damn.",

That\u2019s mine, I\u2019m becoming more okay with that and starting to allow myself to chop and change where I want. Having said that, making and being creative is something I always come back to and I think having a space to do that, with the set up facilitating the activity and the cleanup being easy, would be incredible for me. \n\n\nThe issue is that I know what I\u2019d want, but idk what other people want. I\u2019d be happy with a big shed, maybe some welding screens that can be used as partitions for some level of privacy so people don\u2019t feel watched, and then a tool rack with multiple of the basics and one each of the more expensive ones with a view to expand those tools. No idea what fees would be, but I feel like it\u2019d need to be a subscription service which I don\u2019t love, but with the price of property and upkeep and tool maintenance/replacement there\u2019s no other way it\u2019d work. And then I guess the more people that join the less it\u2019d cost each but the more space you\u2019d need etc etc etc. it\u2019s actually really hard to work out. I\u2019ve considered a timeshare style situation where you have a number of hours with your subscription and you can book those in advance? But that undoes the immediate availability I\u2019d want for hyperfixating adhd folk like us who just wanna head down to the shed and build a table one weekend. It\u2019s hard, there are a lot of moving parts and as far as im aware, no one else has a model to refer to for \u201cwhat not to do\u201d. I don\u2019t expect a reply this is more of a vent than anything but if you have ideas, they\u2019re always welcome!",

(lol focus) \n\nand secondhand sewing machines are the best!!! you can refurbish your current clothes without spending much. or get clothes from thrift stores to transform.\n\nthere are also a lot of fun hobbies like journaling/bullet journaling, and practicing a new handwriting. or drawing with a single pen (watch youtube videos to upskill). \n\nlots to do without spending money!! gotta be aware of the urges that make us spend unnecessary money on the hobbies :/ i\u2019ve been through that for sure",
