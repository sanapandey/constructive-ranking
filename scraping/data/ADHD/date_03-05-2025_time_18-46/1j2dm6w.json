    "selftext": "I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s going on, and any thoughts or advice are welcomed. I don\u2019t have the energy to go back to my GP, and therapy or psychiatrists aren\u2019t an option financially. Just looking for insight from the community\u2014thanks for reading.\n\nI was prescribed 5mg of dexamphetamine three times a day. It worked really well for the first week.\n\nI knew there could be a \u201choneymoon period,\u201d so I kept my expectations in check. At first, I had more control over my thoughts, could bring them back on track, and initiate tasks with ease. I could sustain effort and attention.\n\nThen, after a week, it just stopped working. Overnight, there was no difference between being medicated and unmedicated. Literally nothing.\n\nI understand tolerance, but I don\u2019t understand how it stopped so suddenly and completely.\n\nMy GP switched me to 30mg of lisdexamfetamine (slow-release). I felt zero effects. Then, I got bumped up to 50mg, but I still don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually working.\n\nI have more energy, and my thoughts are clearer, but I can\u2019t control them like I could at first. It\u2019s not that my brain isn\u2019t responding\u2014it\u2019s just not helping with what really matters: concentration and initiation.\n\nBut what if it is working? Even non-ADHD people procrastinate or lack motivation. Meds won\u2019t magically fix everything. Maybe it worked at first because I was so excited to finally feel capable, and now that excitement is gone.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s all it was\u2014just the excitement.\n\n\u201cYeah, I can read, but I\u2019m over that now.\u201d\n\nWhat if meds only make you capable of doing what you want, but the real problem is\u2026 I don\u2019t actually want to do anything?\n\nSo then why don\u2019t I?\n\nWhat do I actually want? To waste every day lost in my thoughts? And then get upset about it?\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of meds if they only make me better at staring at a wall?\n\nOr maybe these just aren\u2019t the right meds. But then, why did they work at first? And why didn\u2019t they work again when the dose was increased?",
