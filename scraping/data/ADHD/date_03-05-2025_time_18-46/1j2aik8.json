Any recommendations?\n\nFor example, I want to track how much I spend on nail polish and boba (lol) and limit it/treat it as a reward. I know I could do this on paper but eh.",

Like if you can create a \u201cboba\u201d category, but unless you get your boba at the same place and assign it to the category it won\u2019t know you got boba. Same with nail polish which may be even more difficult if you buy it from a place you also get other things from.",
