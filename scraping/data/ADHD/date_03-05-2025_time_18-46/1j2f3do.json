            "body": "In terms of my own ADHD, my struggle is to direct my attention where it needs to go, versus where it wants to go. If personal training is something your attention tends to naturally snap to, then it probably would be a great fit. Even if it isn\u2019t though, consider pursuing it anyway if it appeals to you. You are not necessarily going to find a profession that always holds your attention with ease. But you can use a job like this to help you finance a life where you can spend your free time on your interests.\n\nGetting started at least doesn\u2019t involve high entry barriers. I recommend the IPTA CPT, which is NCCA-accredited, affordable, and quick and easy.",
