    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nLately, I\u2019ve been caught in this intense cycle with my mood swings that I just need to share. There are moments where if I had a gun lying arround I am sure I would 100% end it here and there \u2013 like that small shift could end it all. Then, almost the very next day, I\u2019m lying in bed, Thinking I hope I live a long life. It\u2019s like my emotions are constantly oscillating between these two extremes, and it\u2019s both confusing and draining. Something as simple as sucking at a video game is enoug to trigger this, and makes me feel completely worthless as a human beeing and that I am a failure and will never achive anything. It makes me feel re\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*d , worth less then the average person. Unable to ever get really good at stuff that no one else seems to struggle with. Like pain is the only thing actually holding me back in these moments and I would 100% do it.\n\nI know ADHD can make our emotional responses even more unpredictable, and sometimes it feels like I\u2019m on a rollercoaster I can\u2019t get off. I\u2019m wondering if anyone else experiences these rapid shifts \u2013 one moment feeling utterly hopeless, and the next, not wanting to be in that place at all. How do you cope when the scales tip so abruptly?\n\nThanks for reading and sharing your experiences.\n\nStay safe, everyone.",
