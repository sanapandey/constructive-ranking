    "selftext": "I went to go buy the Ultra Fine 0.38 millimeter pens that I always use to write things with. I like these pens very very much, they scratch the paper in a way that I can only describe as making my brain happy.\n\nWell, they are out. So I decided to buy the second best thing, an off brand pen that is 0.5mm and said it was a best seller.\n\nThe second I tried writing something with it I felt a genuinely visceral discomfort compared to the brand I always use, and I am not fully sure as to why.\n\nIt's a perfectly fine pen, but tiny tiny things about it are off. It's too smooth to hold, the clicker is too thin, the point is too long, idk.\n\nIs this an adhd thing or an undiagnosed OCD thing? ",
