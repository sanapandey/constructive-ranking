    "selftext": "Okay so I'm gonna put this here cuz I don't have anywhere else to park it. \n\nThis is a mix of 'being on a mission cuz we are being wronged' and adult social care costs. \n\nMy AuDHD doesn't allow me to just draw a line under something that isn't right. I HAVE TO put things right. \n\nLong story short. We have an 25M adult son with Cerebral palsy, autism amongst other things who goes to adult social care here in the UK. \nHe can do most things himself except cook, bath himself & walk without an aid. He can walk short distance with sticks but requires a wheelchair for more than 20mtrs.\n\nNow we are being charged extortionate fee's, including (this is the one that has annoyed me and has filled me with anger inside) \u00a3250 per month to push him in a wheel chair when they go to the park (this may happen a couple of times a month). \n\nThey class this as 1:1 care and have  been charged 1 Hr per day for 4 days a week, every week. \nTotalling over \u00a33k per year for a staff member to push him from a carpark to a park, when the staff member is going to the park anyway with all the other users. \n\nI'm sorry, I've ranted but I'm so so mad I'm shaking with anger.\nI will not stop until I've sorted this. \n\nThe reason I've put it here is because my anger, and my shaking and my brain is going 1000mph,I'm googling adult social care services law and what can & want be charged for.\n I'm doing it again, ranting. I'll go now. If this gets deleted, it's okay, I have a copy. \n\nI'm still so so angry \ud83d\ude21 \ud83d\ude0e",
