    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been running on empty since January, pretty much, and I\u2019m unsure how to proceed. Most advice for burnout involves taking time to unwind and recharge, but I simply don\u2019t have the time to do that. I let assignments pile up while trying to relax, but couldn\u2019t relax because I knew that I had assignments to do. So I pretty much spent a lot of time doing nothing with no mental energy gained from it, and if I want to have everything I need done actually done, I\u2019ll have to be working almost all day tomorrow. I wanted to get things done tonight, but I\u2019m so easily distracted it\u2019s insane. How do you manage to get things done when you\u2019re burnt out and quite literally cannot afford to take a break? ",
