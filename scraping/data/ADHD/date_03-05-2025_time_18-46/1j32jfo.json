Even though I get around 250$ monthly, and I do not pay food, rent, water, electricity or any other appliances, somehow, i manage to have no money. Of course I feel like shit for not having money. I would really like to save, you know, like an adult, any tips? ",

Cut all the unnecessary things out and you\u2019ll be surprised. If you ain\u2019t literally dying without it, you don\u2019t need it. \nBest xx",

I set up alerts so that I get an email and a text message for every transaction above $0. it also emails and text me the remaining balance. that helps me keep track of how much money I have. note that some banks don't have this feature. the big ones like Wells Fargo do. small ones like some little credit unions might not.",
