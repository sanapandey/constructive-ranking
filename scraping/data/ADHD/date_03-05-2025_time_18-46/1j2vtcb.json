And no ADHD med has ever helped me at all at any doseage - they all just give me a completely recreational amphetamine rush, with no improvement to attention control, initiative, etc.\n\nSo - does\u00a0*anyone*\u00a0here relate to this experience? Did you ever get anywhere with overcoming your symptoms?",

Maybe your anxiety manifests in disconnect? You can\u2019t pay attention or focus but it\u2019s a side effect of adhd rather than adhd?\n\nThis is what I'm trying to pin down here. Everyone in this sub insists that if a psychiatrist diagnosed you with ADHD, using the current official diagnostics, then you have it, and how dare you think you know better. And my psychiatrist's attitude was basically the same. They even insist that getting nothing but a recreational amphetamine rush from meds is a normal/common response for ADHD patients, that I shouldn't have expected anything more than that, and that it's up to me to use that energy for focus instead of just getting distracted(I can't. Period). I eventually stopped seeing them after two years of going in circles over this with them, and being unable to find any evidence that anyone in here \"with ADHD\" is having the same experience, let alone getting anywhere with it. \n\nThat, plus the fact that the only improvements to focus anyone here describes getting from ADHD meds is it \"calms them down, stops their mind from racing, stops them feeling so overwhelmed with anxiety and noisy thoughts\" etc etc etc, has left me very lost at sea with no idea what condition I even have, since I don't relate to the symptoms or treatments to the one I've been diagnosed with at all.\n\nThe psych in question is a very reputable, published, ADHD specialist with a year-long waiting list to see in the first place; I don't understand how I could've been misdiagnosed by an expert, nor how to advocate against it.",

So I'm wondering how there can be any hope in meds for me when not only has nothing worked so far, but the descriptions of them *working* don't even make sense to me.\n\n*\"Generalized anxiety disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry about events or activities\"*\n\nI don't have this at all. I don't meet any of the criteria for any kind of anxiety disorder, nor do I relate to any of the symptoms.",

I still have decision paralysis since I have so many things I want to do. But overall it should help. I\u2019m on concerta and Ritalin and it\u2019s helped me get my life together in a lot of ways. Just keep trying. Therapy / a life coach might be a good start if you get on meds again.",

It's not appropriate advice for this sub or disorder.\n\n> Therapy / a life coach might be a good start if you get on meds again.\n\nDid that when on(again, the completely ineffectual) courses of meds - nothing they suggested had any bearing because I still couldn't control the target or duration of my attention in any of the ways required for an adult to function. They *agreed* they were used to helping patients who were already working on a foundation of meds \"changing their lives\" in the first place, and just telling them where to point that new resource; they had nothing to offer someone dealing with(essentially) completely-unmedicated ADHD(unmedicated in the sense that the meds weren't doing anything they were supposed to).",

It\u2019s the combination of meds, therapy, and using all these tools that have helped me personally. Just using a planner and lists isn\u2019t helpful. Just being medicated also isn\u2019t super helpful. But being medicated and sitting down to make a list and put things in your calender as you schedule them plus setting reminders helps. If none of those meds have worked for you I\u2019m not sure what you are looking for. It looks like you\u2019ve tried everything except maybe Wellbutrin which is more for depression but helps with focus as well. If they don\u2019t help you focus there has to be something else going on. You definitely have ADHD but maybe there is a hormone reason it\u2019s not working. I saw a post earlier today where someone said their meds don\u2019t work on their period. Im not sure if there\u2019s other reasons similar to that where the meds just wouldn\u2019t work for some people. Obviously I\u2019m not a doctor just an ADHDer on reddit. I am sorry if I came across sounding indifferent or like it is as easy as making more lists. I just know in my experience Concerta with Ritalin as a booster for the afternoon and evening has made a huge difference. But if I was just floating through life on these meds without using these other tools I would still be focused but not doing what I need to do when it comes to work, chores, hobbies. And i would just be really frustrated that I wasn\u2019t making progress. I wish you the best of luck in your journey trying to find the right medication.",

He'd stonewall me when I tried to inquire any deeper, which made it impossible to maintain a trusting relationship/continue seeing him, especially with no improvement whatsover after two years. My GP can put me on the year-long waitlist for another psychiatrist in the meantime, but has warned me that they probably won't say anything different. That's why asking the community is all I have left.\n\n> It looks like you\u2019ve tried everything except maybe Wellbutrin which is more for depression but helps with focus as well.\n\n\"but helps with focus\".... *how?* What is going on in a person with ADHD's mind when they're not on Wellbutrin vs when they are, which allows them to focus better in the latter state?\n\nIf the answer has anything to do with relieving anxiety and emotional dysregulation, it's another blind alley.\n\nEDIT: For the record, I'm male and have no other health issues or deficiencies, mental or physical. Diet/weight/sleep, all the usual suspects are all optimal/ruled out.",
