    "selftext": "As the title says, I'm being accused of being dehydrated by my general physician and not drinking enough water even though I carry a gallon of water around with me to drink. Once I'm urinating every 30min I don't see the point in drinking more water unless I'm trying to flush something out of my system. But I'm not. My last Adderall dose is around 2pm 20mg IR. By 6-7pm I've urinated approximately 8-10 times. But if I keep drinking water it just goes through me because my body has what it needs.\n\nAny hydrating suggestions?\n\n  \nEDIT: For more context\n\nThe hydration subject came up with my doctor because during my bloodwork they saw my blood has a high protein content making it thick. The accepted range is 5-9 (I don't know the units) and mine was like 9.3. Kidney and liver function is good. Cardiovascular is good. I don't have high blood pressure And I was told I needed to drink more water. \n\nI eat a basic diet. And I drink my daily gallon of water.\n\nBreakfast - Protein shake blended with a whole banana (Weekends with eggs & Sausage/Bacon)\n\nLunch - Chef or Caesar salad with any meat (chicken, fish, pork, beef)\n\nDinner -  Chef or Caesar salad with any meat (chicken, fish, pork, beef) \n\nLate night snack -  Seeds (Almonds or Sunflower)",

It\u2019s a little pricey but I usually bounce around plans when I can get discount codes. \n\nI currently find that doing meal prep on Sunday afternoons works for me. By no means are these elaborate meals because that takes too long. Prep usually takes about an hour to an hour and a half and then no more prep for the rest of the week. Usually I oven bake chicken breast with whatever seasoning I\u2019m feeling for the week, for a carb I do either rice, quinoa, or pasta, and for a veg it will be broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or green beans. I roast the veggies in the oven after the chicken is done or in a frying pan. Sometimes I\u2019ll use ground beef or turkey and make it more of a burrito bowl styled meal and I\u2019ll sautee peppers and onions for the veg. For the past few weeks I\u2019ve been making bonza Mac and cheese with sliced sausage and saut\u00e9ed Brussels sprouts. Everything gets portioned into individual meals in containers so I can just grab and microwave for a meal. \n\nI have slowly been buying better tools like a convection oven / air fryer which makes the chicken cook so much faster. Or I got a nicer rice cooker that is pretty much set it and forget it and can do different types of rice and also quinoa. I buy spice mixes so I don\u2019t have to put in mental effort making my own spice blend.\n\nETA: I\u2019m happy to chat more about stuff like this!! I feel like it took too darn long figuring all this stuff out on my own so I love sharing what\u2019s worked for me. Also the trial and error process is pretty frustrating but you just have to keep pushing through until something clicks. Which is hard. And annoying. And stupid. But also necessary.",

Because if they changed the amount of water they drink voluntarily (i mean not because of thirst/noticing excess urination) and suddenly started drinking excessive amounts of water, i don't think the response is exactly pathological. Especially if they're on adhd meds, which tend to elevate blood pressure and in turn act as weak diuretics",

It's just that if a completely healthy person suddenly starts drinking copious amounts of water, on their own volition without any physiological motivation to do so, they will start to produce a lot more urine. That's a completely normal response, and can be easily fixed with drinking normal amounts of water",

Canned soups/vegetables, ramen, dehydrated seasoned rice/beans, dehydrated soups, and instant microwave foods are especially bad and can elevate BP a ton, but if your mostly already eating whole less ultra processed stuff, there's no point going out of your way to avoid salt.",
