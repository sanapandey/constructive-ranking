    "selftext": "Hi. I had a therapist last year who was very nice but she had absolutely no training or understanding of ADHD.\n\nFinancial reasons caused me to stop going to therapy with her, and I wasn't disappointed because I wanted help with my ADHD and the connecting symptoms.\n\nI spoke to two ADHD coaches. Both were more than beyond what I can afford, and one refused to help me because I was a network marketer (something about stealing their steps?)\n\nI have one now. I've had her since January. She is nice but the last four times, she's showed up to our ZOOM like meeting at least 5 minutes late. Last time, it was almost 15 minutes and I was about to cancel the meeting myself.\n\nI told my husband a few minutes ago that I'm not going back to her. She was almost 10 minutes late, didn't apologize, she was eating on the call (not gross but it still bothered me) and because I couldn't think of anything to really say she ended our call 13 minutes early. She also said some things that bothered me (nothing rude or inappropriate).\n\nLike I said, she's a nice lady but she is not the therapist for me. I feel so lost. I don't even know what I want or need anymore.",
