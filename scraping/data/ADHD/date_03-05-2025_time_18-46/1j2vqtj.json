    "selftext": "I\u2019m a college student. I\u2019ve never been officially diagnosed with ADHD but it wasn\u2019t until middle school that my parents hinted at a possibility. They didn\u2019t see it as necessary and neither did I.\n\nBut beginning high school and now in college I\u2019ve been feeling the weight of it. Small mistakes keep pulling my grades down consistently. I don\u2019t know what it is. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m lacking focus? I finish my assignments and exams like I did everything right and then the results always say otherwise. \n\nThe college has accommodations for ADHD but I\u2019ve never been officially diagnosed. I\u2019ll get one soon. I just can\u2019t help but feel like this is just some placebo effect that I\u2019m blaming my shitty results on. I\u2019ve been used to being in an exam room with everyone else; being put in a different room feels so daunting.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m overcomplicating this. It just feels wrong to \u201cblame\u201d this on something that I don\u2019t even know I actually have. Even if I did have it I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do with that information.",
