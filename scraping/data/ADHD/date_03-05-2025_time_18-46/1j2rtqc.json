    "selftext": "Question for those with DX ADHD... is it common for y'all to be afraid of / opposed to marriage? \n\nMy boyfriend of 5 years hasn't had any problems with commitment, and we have built quite a life together (share a house, bank accounts, pets, etc), but at the same time says he doesn't want to get married because it's \"too permanent\". \n\nWe're basically already married, just without the papers. I don't see getting married as a big deal, because our day to day lives literally would not change. But he's freaked out by it. I'm trying to understand why.\n\nCould this be related to his ADHD, or am I being used? Thoughts?",

I, myself have been married for 3 years, together for 9 years and marriage was not an issue for me. I wouldn\u2019t say I have commitment issues, I just like change. It\u2019s hard to stick with one boring job or hobby. But I love my wife and I can\u2019t imagine my life with anyone else.\n\nMy advice would be to communicate with your partner. Be open minded and try to stay non-judgmental. ADHD is not one size fits all.",

I'm pretty reticent about it now, but that hesitation comes from a long history of *not* hesitating: I wanted desperately to be in a committed relationship and never break up again, so I got married at 23 to a woman I started dating at 18 (but who I had known since I was 15). Got divorced at 27 and put myself through the wringer several more times, never actually married again but considered it and got close. I'm 38 now and while I still do want that kind of companionship, I'm much more hesitant about diving in, so to speak. If anything, the ADHD trait was the tendency to commit too early.",

I won't get married just because couples are expected to do, or to \"tie the knot\", or check a box on the List of Life. If there's not a convincing reason to, living like we're married is how I'm going to live with my partner.\n\nYou yourself said your day to day won't change. Why are you so for doing it? Validation of commitment (even though divorce exists)? If you're just going through the motions of life because that's what's expected, I'd do some reflection and figure out your \"why\" (in addition to his \"why not\").\n\nTo answer your question, I'm not sure it's ADHD in his case. \"Too permanent\" is an odd answer for ADHD but in line for someone with problems committing in life, but it could also just be the vague answer he gives to not talk about it. It'd be worth talking and asking him about, but I'd take care not to pressure him into it or an answer though. Some folks (ADHD or not) will basically shut down like a deer in the headlights if someone is pressuring them.",
