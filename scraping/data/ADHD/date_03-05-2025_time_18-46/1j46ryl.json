I am completely unable to juggle all of this and people are starting to get upset with me for missing deadlines. I\u2019m pulling 1-2 all-nighters a week and then struggling to make it to my morning class consistently because I\u2019m so sleep-deprived. My thesis mentor chastised me for not \u201cdoing the bare minimum and going to class\u201d when I really am working so hard and had a conversation with them the week before about how I\u2019m struggling. They are also aware that I have ADHD and that I\u2019m working with my therapist to do better and that I take meds for it.\n\nI\u2019m really not sure how to ask for help because I feel like I\u2019ve been met with some assumptions that I\u2019m lazy or apathetic and I\u2019m working really hard (and failing, apparently) to not seem that way. I\u2019m worried that if I ask to cut back on my responsibilities that I\u2019ll be met with hostility or be seen as incapable. \n\nAttendance is also part of my grade for my morning class, and I hate that I\u2019ve been struggling so much to make it on time / make it at all. At some point though, your body is just too exhausted and won\u2019t let you keep pushing through though, you know? I don\u2019t know if there are any accommodations that I can request for class attendance for that class but I feel like I should just be able to push through and go even though I\u2019m not sleeping much if at all :( I don\u2019t know why everything is so hard. I\u2019m just really exhausted. \n\nAnyone else ever dealt with anything like this? How did you deal with it? \n\nAlso if anyone has ever decided to take a leave of absence from school due to adhd symptoms how did you make that decision?\n\nI really appreciate you all \ud83e\ude77 thanks for listening to me ",
