    "selftext": "So basicallyyy, me (16M) have had a lot to drink today at school, i\u2019m sober right now but I drank around 10-15 shots of vodka and I KNOW i\u2019m about to have a crazy hangover upcoming cause of the headache I\u2019m experiencing right now (hours later)\n\nSo my question is, should I take my ADHD pills tomorrow morning? For the experienced folks, will it help with my hangover or worsen it. \n\n(This is not a medication problem/advice, I just want to know how it is for other people with ADHD who drink and take their pills the NEXT morning like normal) ",
