Apart from this, it is hard for me to pay attention, I always forget something people just told me or I cannot pay attention at school, thus, it will be hard for me to finish assignment. Last but not least, sometimes, I don't know my response is appropriate or not. I worry I give a wrong response to others.",

He\u2019s very smart but cannot focus and fell two years behind academically in public school. He had also become very depressed and was ostracized because he didn\u2019t quite \u201cfit in\u201d. So we switched him to an online public charter school program where he can go at his own pace and take as many breaks as necessary. This has been life-changing for him! He\u2019s caught back up and totally thriving!!! There are a ton of free school options out there that might suit your learning style better.",
