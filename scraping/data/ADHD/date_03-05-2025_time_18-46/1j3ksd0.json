    "selftext": "I need to explain some background, but it's all ADHD related.\n\nI got surgery three weeks ago. Nothing serious, but I had to be put asleep. The doctors said this will mess up my health markers for a few weeks. My mother want me to get my bloods done to look for deficiencies as we're learning about the common comordidies with ADHD. But I can't get tested for a few weeks.\n\nSchool has been driving me crazy. My symptoms have stayed the same amount of aggressiveness as when I was younger but I'm nearing the end of my secondary school career (ages 12 to 19, it's European high-school) and that means important exams next year. I'm getting a little distressed with my energy levels, focus (or lack there of) and how much I actually get done in a day, study wise.\n\nMy mother is against the typical ADHD treatment, however, I feel with some explaining as time goes by, she can come around to them. For the mean time, I found some caffeine/energy supplements (SCIENCE BASED! And approved by my countries medical organisations!) online, but I'm not allowed to take them until I get my bloods done. (To get a baseline of my health vitals)\n\nI get half homeschooled so I work from home a lot but honestly, the environment isn't always the issue. Regardless of where I am I just can't focus or take it in unless I'm trying really hard, then get knocked out the rest of the day.\n\n\nActual question:\n\nAnyway, this is a long winded way of asking if any ADHDers have any tips that helped them while they were unmedicated or aren't on any rught now. Anything that could tide me over a few weeks would be greatly appreciated. I take 6 subjects (exempt from one) and are all within my skills set of English and history but even though I want to do something I still can't force myself.\n\nI get good grades eventually but the stress I go through to scrap by will probably cause a heart attack at 30.\n\nAlso, this is my first time posting on this sub reddit. Hope this flies by the mods, thank you for reading.",

Honestly I\u2019m undiagnosed and unmediated so that\u2019s probably no help at all but I would also tell my friends to convinced me certain sections of my exams were needed to be revised by a date so I would do it.",
