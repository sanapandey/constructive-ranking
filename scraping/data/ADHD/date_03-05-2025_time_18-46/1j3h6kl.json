    "selftext": "So im still waiting for an ADHD assessment (2 years so far), and what i can only guess is ADHD at this point has made my whole life hell and im barely able to manage day to day especially as an adult. \n\nIve tried as many things as i can but the only thing in my life thats made an actually noticable difference has been nicotine (vaping), which i hate so much since its so addictive. Im currently 6 months free and past withdrawals, and life has gone back to only sucking as much as it did before nic (a fuck ton).\n\nMy current plan is pray that i can survive until i get assessed, and hope i can get some treatment that works. But its honestly a struggle and half the time im just living day to day.\n\nIt does make me wonder if its worth trying to get by with nothing to manage it at all and in the worst case would getting treatment make it easier to stay off nic again? Im confident if i wasnt struggling so much in life, i would be able to put nicotine behind me for good at this point. the only reason i ever think about it anymore is because for almost everything i struggle with daily, nicotine helped me at least temporarily manage ",

I\u2019m interested to see what other people have to say, but this has been my experience. I didn\u2019t start smoking until I started taking the medication.",

I really hope that you are an outlier and do not have the same experience that I do. Maybe some of the medications are different for other people. I know that Adderall made my cravings more intense. Welbutrin did nothing for me. Vyvanse still had cravings and the appetite suppression made the craving for nic more apparent. Best of luck on your journey!",

The last time I quit, I was successful at not smoking anything or consuming nicotine at all for maybe a month or two and the craving for nicotine was so strong that I picked up a vape and since then have been \u201c addicted\u201d again.",
