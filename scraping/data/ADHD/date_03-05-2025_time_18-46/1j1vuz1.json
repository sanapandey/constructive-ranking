    "selftext": "It\u2019s so hard trying to explain the lack of motivation does not equate to laziness or apathy. Even if someone is educated about ADHD, I get the sense that they just do not understand the feeling of wanting to do something, logically knowing you should do something, and still putting it off all while stressing about not doing said thing. \n\nI was trying to explain to my therapist why being productive at work is a different ballgame than home/my personal life. If I have outside pressures and know that there\u2019s going to be obvious repercussions for not getting something done right now, I will do it. I will put my all into it. If I come home and I know there\u2019s something I probably should do, but I can push it off without getting yelled at or fired, I struggles to maintain motivation. That feeling/thought process is so innate to me that it\u2019s confusing to me when people without ADHD don\u2019t still don\u2019t seem to get it when i explain it. \n\nMy motivation is heavily based on my environment and short term consequences.

If you went over to your stove right now and turned it on, theoretically you could easily but your hand on the stove. There\u2019s nothing physically stopping you from doing so, but your innate sense of survival will stop you from doing so, basically a mental block. It\u2019s the same thing with tasks. It\u2019s like trying to touch a hot stove.",
