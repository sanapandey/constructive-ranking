    "selftext": "Hey. ADHD symptoms have been hitting me extremely hard lately. I am struggling in my college classes and am finding it harder and harder to catch up with each passing week. My psychiatrists office has been yanking me around for over a month now and I\u2019m just exhausted. I have a bag of 15mg Adderall XR capsules that, before a month ago, had been sitting in a dark shelf in their original container since spring 2022. Would these be safe to take? They\u2019ve been on my desk now for some time in a little zip lock bag. ",

The efficacy has plummeted tho after sitting for years, so you\u2019ll probably feel the difference between unexpired and expired drugs, expired ones not relieving symptoms as well. I only advise to not take double or triple doses to compensate cause that actually might lead to increased side effects.",
