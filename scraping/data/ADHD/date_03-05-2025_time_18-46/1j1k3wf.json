    "selftext": "my dad was a mad adhd denier and still is (although he's at least labelled it as now) and so I never got a diagnosis or anything at all, for 13 of the 14 years I spent in school, got diagnosed and prescribed some really weak shit (at least relative to me, I got concerta and biphentin) which didn't react well and so my parents wouldn't let me medicate thru my final year, I almost failed high school and got some of the lowest grades imaginable \n\nrecently I decided to talk to my doc about amphetamines and after getting insane depression with vyvanse ive seen great success on a generic for adderall (apotex apo-amphetamine xr).\n\nlike.... I used to feel a need to fidget and yap anywhere at any time and I couldn't focus on anything but like I've been able to get stuff done man. im starting some classes after the weekend to retake precalc and calculus on account of nearly failing and I seriously think i'll be able to get a's man. the first year after diagnosis was rough but thankfully I won't have to worry about it for several more years on account of public health insurance I'm incredibly happy man I had to share the good this stuff has been doing for me. it's beautiful",
