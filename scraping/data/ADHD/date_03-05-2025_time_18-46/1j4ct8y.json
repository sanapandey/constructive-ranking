    "selftext": "Just as the title says, what if you cannot remember any symptoms being present (or disruptive enough to remember) before the age of 12? Ever since college I've been noticing how much I struggle to start assignments and stay on task while doing them. It's not only affected me in school and at work but also with my personal hobbies. I cant even get myself to do the things that I want to do sometimes. It seems like ADHD would explain a lot of this, but I dont remember it being a problem in early childhood. I dont even remember anything from elementary school, I just know that I was a good student and never received any negative assessments from teachers. Anyone share a similar experience to mine? Did you get a diagnosis? I feel like getting tested might just be a waste of time for me, but at the same time I would like some answers to everything I'm feeling.",

It became a huge academic burden after 14 though so I can relate.\n\nI know diagnostic criteria says that symptoms must be prevelant from before. I am still confident I have ADHD. I have thought about this maybe being a female-only experience. Women tend to show more responsibility and mask it more when they are irresoonsible. Can I ask if you are male or female?\u00a0",

Social/cultural norms over the last decade have affected how people are able to pay attention in general, too. \nIf long term memory is an issue (also an ADHD thing), it\u2019s possible that you could simply not remember some childhood symptoms. You could still do well in elementary school and then struggle in college. Hard to say.\n\nMany people are diagnosed as adults so it\u2019s never too late (age 21 for me)",

            "body": "The agreement of onset criteria is hotly debated. Iirc from a talk with the head of the adhd working group for the DSM-5, they initially wanted a broader \"symptoms present before adulthood\" than a clear age of onset but the editors were wary about making changes that would drastically increase the amount of people being diagnosed with a disorder that is prodominatly treated with medication: concerns that it would hurt the APA's legitimacy with the public and lawmakers is how this researcher described it. So they compromised on age 12 up from 7.\u00a0\n\n\nTwo major problems with the age of onset criteria is that 1. We have research that people with higher IQs are often diagnosed later in life, suggesting a \"masking\" strategy or self-accomodations play a role in what impairment looks like. And 2. People with ADHD generally don't have the strongest memories, they might not recognize or remember impairment from 10-20 years ago.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen I was trained to evaluate for adhd, the instructors advice was, in light of the research, definitely look for signs of an onset of symptoms in childhood but think broadly about executive functioning and what impairment can look like.\u00a0 To avoid the dreaded \"this client did well in gradeschool so there's no way they have adhd\" assumption. *then* if it truly looks like symptoms appeared in adulthood, do more assessment to rule out other disorders before circling back to adhd: a lot of disorders can impact executive functioning besides ADHD, and that's still worth addressing\n\n\nAll this is to say, would the peace of mind of getting evaluated really be a waste of time? If not ADHD atleast you'll have a clearer idea of where to look for help.",
