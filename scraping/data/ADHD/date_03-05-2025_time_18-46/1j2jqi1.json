    "selftext": "I thought I would share how I learned to get off the couch and do complex tasks that paralyzed me.\n\nI call it the 'just do it' skill.\n\nEmpty your mind as best you can, it's important that you don't focus on what you're about to do. Try to check up on your body and maybe do a body scan.\n\nAfter that, remind yourself about the task ahead and try to focus only on one step at a time! Do not think ahead, just do one thing at a time. It helps to sort parts of the task in categories.\n\nFor example: I've got to send a email via computer with a file that I have to scan to a email address that I have to search for.\n\n(For my brain that's overwhelming because it involves many different steps that are interwoven. So I would procrastinate till last minute, since it's easier for me to do stuff when shit hit the fan already.)\n\nOkay, let's break that clusterfuck of a task down and sort it into categories, that makes it easier for me:\n\nWe've got to:\n\nPsysical task: Locate ourselves to the computer\n\nDocument: Search for Document, Scan a document\n\nFile: convert into PDF and attach to email\n\nWriting: Compose an email\n\nSearching: Search up email address\n\nSending: Send Email \n\nThat's more workable. I found my brain has difficulty to break complex tasks down, which often paralyzes me so I have to find a way around that.\n\nIt also helps to write down sometimes, if it's extra hard to start out.\n\nIf I broke the task down I've got to focus on one thing at the time to see it through.\nI can do long tasks, but I can't for the life of me do complex ones. So structuring a complex task as a long task while grounding myself and focusing on one thing at a time was a real life changer for me.\n\nHope it helps someone out there!",
