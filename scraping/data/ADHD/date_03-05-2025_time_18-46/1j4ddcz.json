ADHD is a processing/learning disorder right so would if affect this?",

            "body": "That sounds like what is called Audio Processing Disorder (APD) that\u2019s been linked as an often co-morbid disorder with ADHD, studies show as many as 1 in 2 or 50% of ADHDers have it.\nI\u2019m in that demographic too, and it impacts a lot of areas of my life. Accents like you said, especially if the person speaking isn\u2019t looking at me, I can\u2019t understand most of what they\u2019re saying. Same reason I have subtitles on anything and everything I watch, and often ask people to repeat themselves. Not because I didn\u2019t hear the volume but just not processing the words they\u2019re trying to say. It\u2019s not due to any physical malformation in the brain but rather an issue in audio processing.",
