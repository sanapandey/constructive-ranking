    "selftext": "I have never been a normal sleeper. Ever since I was a kid, I would run of minimal sleep during the weekdays, feel exhausted while the sun was still up, but then no matter how tired I felt all day, my energy spiked again at night and I am left in a cycle of sleeplessness and discomfort. Yet, if I have a day off, I will literally sleep 12-16 hours straight. It is even worse now that I am in college and there is nobody forcing me to wake up. I want to have a normal sleep schedule so bad, but no matter what, I can only sleep too much or too little. It is 5am and I have class in a couple of hours, and I am dreading the fact that I am going to wake up exhausted and then fall asleep after all of my thoughts have barely diminished just to have this cycle repeat again and again. What the hell can I do? ",
