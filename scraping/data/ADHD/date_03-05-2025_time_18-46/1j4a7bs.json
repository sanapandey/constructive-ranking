I wake up and I\u2019ll fight myself until I tell good ol\u2019 Siri on my HomePod to rock out to her music. After about 30 seconds I can feel the grove and just start feeling like the task is accomplishable. Thank you Katy Perry for existing. That\u2019s all.\n\n\nEdit: just did the laundry, cleaned both bathrooms, put away the Christmas decor (I know haha), dishes put away and old ones put into the wash, and trash taken out to the bin and to the street. Feeling powerful! Also I could get into some Sabrina NGL.",

Implementation of the redesign plan has been put off until \"tomorrow\" for the last 3000 years.",
