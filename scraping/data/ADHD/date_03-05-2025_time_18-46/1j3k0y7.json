    "selftext": "Hello!\n\nRecently diagnosed ADHD and had a couple questions!\n\nI have been knitting for about 8 years and crocheting for about 5 years. I was watching a video on swimming for ADHD, and wondered if knitting and crocheting would/could be a form of stimming. \n\nI've understood stimming as a way to regulate emotions and help with extra energy and such. That's exactly what knitting and crochet does for me. Plus I take it everywhere because I can't sit still if I'm waiting for something, in the car or even just watching a movie. \n\nWhat are people's thoughts on this? ",

            "body": "Hi!  I'm also a crochet person (a hooker, if you will), and have ADHD.  I think certain stimming could be redirected into crocheting, which is what it sounds like you're doing.  I crochet, but I have my other stims that I compulsively engage in, sometimes while crocheting, so I've not quite hit that stride.  BUT, I do like to do it while listening to a book or watching a movie, it keeps my hands busy but my mind is more receptive to, and focused on the content.  I think it can be very good for busy minds.",

            "body": "I'm a knitter/compulsive crafter of various forms and knitting is very much stimming for me. In work meetings we have a specific rule that I'm allowed to knit so that I can focus lol. It also just keeps me regulated. I always say 'i never learned how to sit still, I learned how to knit instead.' when I was in nursing school I would email my professors to let them know that this is my best means of listening and engaged with the lecture/discussion, it was never an issue. I suspect a higher than average # of hand crafters have ADHD because just sitting still is too hard for us. There are documented studies on the healing power of crafts for folks with all kinds of mental health concerns, including trauma. I don't know about any specific to ADHD.",
