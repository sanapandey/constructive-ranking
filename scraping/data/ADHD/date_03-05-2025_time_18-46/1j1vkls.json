But as soon as the weekend starts, I find myself lying in bed all day, suddenly unable to do anything.\n\nDuring the workweek, I can at least function and stay productive (at work, at least). But the moment I have no obligations, my brain just shuts down, and I end up in this weird paralysis where I want to do things, but I just\u2026 can\u2019t.\n\nMy room is a complete mess\u2014clothes all over the floor, stuff out of place, and laundry piling up. I know I need to clean, but I can\u2019t seem to get myself to start.\n\nDoes anyone else struggle with this? Any tips on how to break out of it?",

Anxiety can be a powerful motivator. Without that pressure to push you through it, your executive dysfunction comes more to the fore and so you find yourself in ADHD paralysis.\n\n\nExhaustion and burnout can also be a huge driver of executive dysfunction too, so if you find your work week hard to manage that could be contributing to the executive dysfunction and paralysis you describe.",

I think it works differently for everybody.\n\n\nThat being said, recognising executive dysfunction for what it is when it is occurring has been a huge help for me. When I realise what's going on I can take a mental pause from the pressure I'm putting on myself and give myself space to just be OK with being where I'm at. Then when I'm ready it's a matter of doing something small to begin gathering some momentum and going from there. It could be something as small as standing up and doing a tall stretch with arms overhead and physically shaking out the pent up anxiety. And then perhaps I'll put a thing back in the drawer and building from there. Phoning a friend and telling them you're stuck in adhd paralysis can be enough to break it. My friend will tell me to get the fuck up and get shit done in an assertive but caring way and that helps too.\u00a0Sometimes the recognition of executive dysfunction is enough for me to break right out of it and I can go do the thing I actually want or need to do. And other times there's just no breaking out of it and you just have to accept that that's where you're going to be for a spell, knowing you will break out of it soon.\n\n\nIt can take some experimenting to find something that works for you but you do have to do something, and that's the rub I guess.\n\n\nSelf discipline comes into play here. You can achieve a lot with good self discipline. The best thing about self discipline is that it is a learned skill and not an inherent trait. The tough thing about self discipline is that it's a sword you have to sharpen every day. It can be tough but I've lived without self discipline and that way was much harder.",

At home, I have an art room, which is supposed to be a quiet space I can do art, but I have so many things going on at home I never get to use it, so I end up doing art stuff downstairs in my living room because it's a convenience to just have my stuff where I have to spend all my time anyway. Anyway, I will really into the zone focused on it, but because I live with my mom and 6 cats and 2 dogs, someone always needs attention or my mom has to go somewhere or there's a chore that my mom won't stop bugging me about doing and all the little interruptions just end up frustrating me that when I finally just had enough and stop art stuff altogether, I just never seem to feel like going back to it some other time. I'll look at it, note that I want to work on it, and then just 'never find the time,' because I think I'm anticipating a ton of interruptions that'll just prevent me from getting very far. On the rare chance I DO get to use my art room, it's still just as chaotic because my cats HAVE to be in the same room as me and will relentlessly scratch at the door, or my mom is fed up with the dogs bothering her for a change so she has me come get them, or who knows what else. It's like, I don't get the peace I need to be creative or passionate, but when I do get the peace, I don't feel like it anymore.\n\nI just recently got diagnosed with ADHD (last week, treatment/med options discussion next appointment!) and all these years of being undiagnosed (I'm almost 31) have made me feel like my lack of what I thought was motivation, drive, and desire to do things might be caused or linked to having ADHD, and I kind of lament that I wasn't diagnosed sooner because I felt more creative and focused on art stuff when I was in school and still deep down want to at least continue to enjoy it as a hobby and try new mediums or at least draw my OCs and maybe, finally, do that comic I've been writing and rewriting and tweaking and adding to in my head since high school. With LEGOs or Nanoblocks or that kind of stuff, my brain kind of forces me to power through the distractions because if I don't finish it, I'm gonna have a ton of small pieces that WILL get lost or eaten by my pets and I don't care if it takes me from 9pm to 2am to finish one frustrating build, I HAVE to have it done so that it's less of a choking hazard to my pets. If only I could trick my brain into powering through to do my art that way!",

Come to find out we actually have an issue in our brains causing these things and its not because we are just lazy assholes.\n\na good quote i read somewhere is \"Lazy people don't feel bad about being lazy\" ADHD paralysis causes things to not get done even tho we really want to do them and it causes us stress and anxiety and even negative feelings about ourselves. Actual lazy people dont give af that they arent finishing things.\n\nIts kinda hard to come to terms with that at first but, medication does help.

Like, I'll give my mom credit- she did some Karen moves with some of my teachers to get me extra credit and make-up work to push me to the graduation line when I was in high school (I struggled a lot with getting homework done on some subjects). I wouldn't have made it out of school without her. Everyone always kept asking 'why do I do this,' and because I couldn't explain it, I would always respond 'I don't know,' because I literally did not know why I just couldn't do things I needed to do. I developed a horrible self-esteem in the later high school years, thinking that I could never do college/art school because I had a horrible school work ethic, and even wondered if I could ever hold a job (and to my relief, I can and do, and have held my job for 10 years because I hate change and don't want to work somewhere else now lol). \n\nI bust my ass at my job, come home, and just can't do things with the same energy or drive, and my mom calls me lazy for it. I do feel bad for not doing things I want and need to do, so I know I'm not truly lazy, and just don't feel like I have the energy to do another thing when I get home. Like... it's kind of like my brain is a magic 8-ball, and when a thing I need to do pops up, I have to shake the ball and ask if we're going to do the thing today, and it's like most of the time I roll a 'nah, not right now.' It's aggravating as hell. Since I got my diagnosis, my mom has definitely loosened up about her attitude about my 'laziness' because she's trying to understand. She wanted to get me tested as a kid but my dad refused to believe there was anything wrong with me so it never happened. Mom thought there was something, but didn't want to believe either, I think. I know it's hard for her to understand, so even if she's trying, she's still sometimes defaulting to the 'you're putting it off,' or 'stop being lazy' talk and it hurts extra now because I KNOW it's not by choice or desire. \n\nI really hope that if I can get on medication, it'll make it at least easier to get myself motivated to do things and loosen up a bit. I doubt there's a 'fix-all' drug out there, but I mostly just want to be able to just see something that needs done and just... do it, rather than consult the magic 8-ball every time and pray to land on the 'yeah go do it' answer.",

Parents asking why i cant do basic things like homework, chores, etc when they ask. I tell them IDK cuz i really didn't know wtf was wrong with me. They thought I'm just lazy, unmotivated. This led to terrible self esteem, depression, and anxiety as well, and i eventually dropped out of high school because i just couldn't do it. It was soooo boring, i felt like id rather die then sit at school learning about \"stupid shit\". I did get my GED very quickly so i could try community college but of course, unmedicated that didn't work out.\n\nMoving from there i struggled through my 20s and finally got diagnosed because i knew something was wrong and i couldn't do what others were doing, and i didn't know why i couldnt do it.

The first is just do SOMETHING. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s logical or makes the most sense to start with, just pick one thing and do it, because that gets momentum going and gets you out of that state of paralysis, which is the hardest part. My go to is the dishes, or taking all my unfolded clean laundry that\u2019s laying around and putting it back in the laundry bag so that at least visually I see some progress has been made, and that\u2019s usually enough to trick my brain into letting me keep going. \n\nThe second trick is something called body doubling. I\u2019ll get a friend or relative to come over or sit on FaceTime and hang out while I just get things done. The stress of having someone over by itself helps get me motivated, and for whatever reason just having a second person there, not even helping me but just being physically (or virtually) present, just flips a switch in my brain and lets me get things done. YMMV, but these have def come in clutch for me when I really needed to get things done but just couldn\u2019t get going on my own.",

I have also heard people using physical rewards (can be a food that you occasionally have etc) to motivate them to get the task done. So basically, you cannot have your reward until you get the task done.\n\n- Accountability \u2728\nI ask my friends and partner to keep me accountable with tasks that I find myself struggling to complete. My partner (who also most likely struggles with ADHD) made a spreadsheet for the both of us which helps us keep track of the good habits that we should be doing. This has TREMENDOUSLY helped me. I think the reason being that we gamified the whole thing, so the person with the most points wins hahaha. \n\n-Set a timer (pomodoro) \u2728\nSometimes I just set a 1 hour timer on my phone and something just drives me into doing the task. I'd hate for the timer to go off without me completing the task. I sometimes couple this with the accountability hack, where I'd ask my partner to call me after an hour and ask if the task is complete. \n\n-Start with another task that'd motivate you\u2728\nI love to draw, so on days that I feel paralysed to do the thing that I should be doing, I first do things that I enjoy (to feel less miserable hahah) and then slowly transition to the things I should be doing. \n\n-Break down tasks \u2728\nI had to clean multiple aspects of my room and I was feeling very demotivated, because it was too much and I was overwhelmed. What I did was to clean one aspect every weekend. \nSo last weekend I cleaned the basics of my room (mopping etc). This weekend, I cleaned out my entire wardrobe. Next weekend, I might segregate the things I noticed longer use, so that I can maybe sell them! \n\nLast but not the least, pleaseeeee rest. It could be that you are pretty exhausted from your weekday job and you don't actually have the energy to do tasks on a weekend. If that is the case, then just resting will benefit you\u2728\n\nA bit of context- I recently finished my degree and in my head I couldn't waittttt to do the tasks I wanted to do. But I didn't feel the same when I completed my degree. I was burnt out and had absolutely no motivation to do the things that I reallyyy liked doing and wanted to do. This didn't make sense to me, because when I did my internship, I didn't feel that way? As in, I was getting the tasks done and I didn't feel like I needed a break and seemed to have the energy and motivation. I took the advice of my partner and went easy on myself. I didn't force myself to do any tasks (though I reallyyy wanted to do it) and just let myself be. And this really helped. \n\nI am still finding it hard to find the motivation to do important tasks that have to be done, but because of the spreadsheet, I end up doing at least something everyday! \n\nI really hope that at least some of these tips will help you\ud83e\udd79.

For me it's easier to get back to a task that way",

If it\u2019s not done at 6 I\u2019m done! I feel I get overwhelmed if I\u2019m staring a long to do list. I feel better when I\u2019m staring at said to do list and the time slot. One of my procrastination problems is like being overwhelmed I get stuck in distractions. So if I didn\u2019t have time to vacuum then the vacuuming will be done the next day in that time slot!!",

It might not be cleaning your room, but maybe it's reading a book you love, playing a fun video game, looking through memes and sending them to friends or scrolling through pinterest getting inspired for a diy that will give you the motivation to pick up the clothes when you DO have the energy (resist the urge to white knuckle yourself into work your brain isn't ready for.) I think sometimes we really punish ourselves for downtime and fun because we've been taught to avoid it at all costs. I know there's work to do, but there's ALWAYS work to do, if we're waiting for the perfect guilt free moment to let ourselves have recovery time we will never get it.",

His example was, well he really needs to clean his office. So he'll let that thought circle back and forth. Maybe days later he'll really enjoy dinner, and think \"Huh, I'm feeling pretty good right now, I could probably tackle the office\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo instead of forcing yourself to do something, you're allowing the task to settle for when it suits you best. Or course this would work best when you're 100% aware an analyzing these thoughts and allowing yourself to be reminded in a healthy environment for you what you might still need to do\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe kicker here in how you approach everything is organization. For some tasks (This won't work for absolutes) you don't need to make yourself feel rushed or forced. Organize both internally and externally. Create habits of reminders \n\nI would find something that works for you in organizing the information you're glossing over consistently. Something like a to do list board that you have a couple of both somewherte close to where you wake up and somewhere close to when you're about to leave your place \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen you wake up, check. When you leave check. Even start putting valuables like wallet/keys near your reminders so that when you grab these items it becomes associated with reminding yourself!\n\nHope you figure out something that works! And if you wanted to check out Adam's video it was called \"Tackling Undesirable Projects (Or Quitting Smoking) When You're ADHD\"",
