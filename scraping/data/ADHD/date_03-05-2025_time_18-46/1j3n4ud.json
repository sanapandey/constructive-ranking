    "selftext": "Hi, forgive me if these type of posts are spam, I needed to get this out somewhere.\n\nI'm 35. Yesterday I finally got diagnosed with ADHD by my psychiatrist. I took my first dose of Ritalin yesterday and felt like a new man almost immediately after it kicked in. I could just be in the present because I wasn't thinking about 20 irrelevant things at the same time.\n\nI've always been considered a slob and could never understand why I just couldn't get my act together in this regard. It has been the hugest sticking point in my life and it made me feel broken and unfixable.\n\nThis morning, after the meds kicked in, I cleaned my kitchen benchtop. This took me approximately one minute and I didn't have to think about it at all. Not the order that it should be cleaned in, no where to put things. I just did it.\n\nAnd then I realized that this....state of being of just.....doing things and not having to think about it must be what normal people are just like.\n\nAnd I realized that this is why people have had issues with me about cleanliness and being organised my entire adult life.\n\nAnd I broke down crying. Both about how trivially easy this stuff was to do on medication, but how easy it could have always been, and, realising how much of a struggle my life has been for seemingly no reason. And why my family, and others, view/viewed my cleanliness issues the way they have my entire life.\n\nThanks if you've read this far, I needed to get that off my chest somewhere.",

It\u2019s crazy to think how much extra effort we put into everything because our brains don\u2019t cooperate the way we want them to or the way others expect. Take this time to learn good habits and get yourself in a place in your life where meds can help you get to where you want to be and not be the whole solution.",

Just in the last year have I realized that I have ADHD. Fighting with myself if I should just let it go, but like you I\u2019d like to be able to think close to how a normal person thinks. And yes, I always knew something was wrong. Been telling my wife for years \u201cmy thoughts are like a golf ball just bouncing around in my head, it never stops\u201d.",

I hope you have been able to cope with it all, it\u2019s a relief and comes with regret about not getting help sooner.  \n\nI took my first ever dose of Concerta today, and the changes were so immediate and obvious.  \n\nMy thoughts were slower and more accurate to what I was focusing on. \n\nI didn\u2019t misplace any items. \n\nI had easy conversations and could follow along and pay full attention.  \n\nTasks weren\u2019t painful or difficult to want to do.  \n\nI sorted 3 months of non urgent emails I had been putting off until today.  \n\nIt was so incredibly different from any other day in my life.",

Instead of having so many things to do and no energy or drive, I'm now getting things done then being aimless in the other direction. I definitely need to build a framework to utilize that for success.\n\n\nI'm optimistic about my future for the first time, well, ever to be honest.\n\n\nThanks for letting me share that.",
