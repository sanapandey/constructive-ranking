    "selftext": "I got my adhd diagnosis a couple years ago even though I\u2019d known I\u2019ve had it for a while (runs in my family) because I was going to try medication. Well I got too anxious and didn\u2019t end up trying it, but now I\u2019m considering because my therapist thinks it might help with some things. \n\nI\u2019ve been a chronic nail biter my whole life and have binge ate since elementary school. The two (with some other fidgety habits) have coexisted and been relatively under wraps. \n\nIn the past year, I\u2019ve gotten my binge eating under control after a 2+ year episode of binge eating 24/7 and I\u2019ve noticed that in place of my incessant binge eating I\u2019ve amped up my nail biting to a place of constant pain, bleeding, etc. \n\nI\u2019m trying to be good and not bite my nails but now I\u2019ve binge ate twice since I painted my nails a couple days ago and stopped ruining them\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Feeling a bit miserable. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m curious if anyone has experienced anything similar or if this is common? I never correlated the habits to adhd or thought they were doing the same thing at all so I\u2019m rethinking everything lol. I\u2019m also considering reaching out to my psych about medication because I don\u2019t want to live in a constant cycle of self-destructive habits to fill that need or whatever. \ud83e\udd72",

            "body": "I have ADHD and also struggle with nail biting and have been diagnosed with BED as well as trichotillomania. I suggest asking your psych about Topiramate. That's been the most impactful for these 3 specific areas of concern, however its not the main function of the RX, and it may come with some side effects.  For me, it's been live changing, but my psych (30 yrs experience) never heard about using it for these issues until I requested it after months of hyperfixing on how to help myself and doing my own research. I am also on ADHD meds and had been for over a year prior to adding the Topiramate. Those alone did help, but not nearly enough. Best of luck!",

I think it comes down to needing something to fixate on, needing something MORE which leads me to constant snacking and oral fixations. Thankfully I got off vaping but now it\u2019s zynning + gum",

However I\u2019ve had awful dandruff recently and now I can\u2019t stop picking my scalp. So I feel you!! I have been on ADHD meds forever and I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019ve helped me break the habits, since they may be more tied to anxiety (which I prob have, along with so many other ADHDers). But the meds are extremely helpful for focusing in class/at work and getting things done. I still have lots of bad days, but I\u2019d be worse without it lol",
