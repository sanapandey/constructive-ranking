    "selftext": "So I've been recently diagnosed within the last year. I've also been diagnosed (for a while now) with depression. I was only able to be diagnosed and medicated because I left my old provider and found a new and more compassionate psychiatrist. She prescribed me adderall, which has been life-changing. She continued my prozac and also added wellbutrin to the mix.\n\nI had to switch to my old provider again due to insurance issues, but this psychiatrist is not super convinced. I went through his verbal assessment which I said yes to about every symptom he offered. He also, in true old school psychiatrist fashion, asked how I did in school (the answer being super well because I got away with being the lazy-smart). Overall, he wasn't very pleasant and I felt a bit gaslight, especially when he was saying that I got through school because \"my majors were easy\", whatever that means.\n\nIn the past, I had mentioned to him that I struggle with daytime sleepiness and energy levels, and that could be a plethora of things--my PCOS, my depression, living in America, whatever. He had me do a sleep apnea test which I did and it came back too mild for treatment. It's since reduced significantly with the wellbutrin and adderall. However, one big reason why he's not convinced is because he says ADHD does not cause daytime sleepiness and fatigue. Have others gotten this narrative before? \n\nI understand that he's doing his due diligence in making sure he's not missing any other diagnosis that could've been overlooked, but I do feel that the daytime sleepiness is linked to ADHD in its own way, especially when it's already so difficult to keep a good sleep hygiene routine. What do you all think?",

            "body": "It is true that ADHD does not cause daytime sleepiness of fatigue, at least not directly. It can be a sign of other aspects of ADHD, such as depression or insomnia, which are comorbid with ADHD and have a higher likelihood of appearing in those who have ADHD. However in your case it definitely seems like something else may be contributing to it. \n\nSleep apnea is a good differential dx, but since you were too mild to treat, it might be something else. Have you done a general sleep study? I'd also seek out a second psychiatric opinion if you can.\n\nInterestingly, I think some stimulants are used as treatment for sleep disorders like narcolepsy. Not suggesting you have it, but it does suggest why stimulants may have improved it for you.",
