    "selftext": "I play drums and have done since I was 13 years old. I\u2019m now 40, awaiting assessment and sure I\u2019ll be confirmed as having inattentive ADHD. \n\nMy partner filled in the questionnaire for partners and naturally I wanted to know the rational behind her answers. One of the questions related to fidgeting with hands/feet and she answered top marks for that\u2026\n\nWhen I asked why, she couldn\u2019t believe I was even asking. She pointed out that i\u2019m constantly tapping a drum beat with my hands and/or feet. I do this without thinking about most of the time, but sometimes do it consciously. When working with a computer mouse, I drum my thumb and pinky on the table, either side of the mouse while I hold and use it. \n\nI spoke with a counsellor who specialises in ADHD last week who said this sounds like \u201cstimming\u201d. I can\u2019t help but feel that this is just because I play drums and I\u2019m just so used to tapping out beats. \n\nThoughts?\n\n",

Something has to be moving or I feel weird - any partner I have has resigned to the fact that I have to rub my feet on their feet to fall asleep (or rub mine together instead). When I was working in an office, I had to make sure I did not wear boots that would make a jingle noise cause my leg would be going bananas under the desk the whole day.",

When I was little apparently I always fell out of my chair at dinner which may or may not be related lol. But yeah it makes me feel more comfortable and is maybe an energy outlet when sitting still.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s considered stimming but it feels better than being completely still.",
