    "selftext": "The reason Im thinking about is because the abuse of ADHD meds is very popular in my country. For example a lot of medicine students and other hard major students using it to \"study more hours\".\n\nSo I want to go to doctor and get a diagnosis (If i am ADHD ofc) but Im afraid he will think Im an addict came for stimulant meds. But what other choice do I have really? As far as I know the only treatment for ADHD is that, no?\n\nWhat should I do?",

The proper diagnosis is fairly systematic and not generally too easy to torpedo via biased practitioners.\n\nI don't know if false diagnosis are a big problem there, but I rarely hear about it here.  It's relatively easy to get street drugs without any diagnosis, and that's what most of the abusers are doing.",

The fact you\u2019re concerned about it says you want genuine help. \n\nJust be honest, use direct experiences from your life. Document some stuff down, specific instances where you catch something that you think may be related to ADHD so they can see how it is directly impacting your life across all aspects. If one person decides not to listen and treats you like a drug seeker (I truly hope it doesn\u2019t happen) you can always see someone else for another opinion. \n\nBut if that\u2019s the case in your country I honestly wouldn\u2019t even mention medication, just mention your struggles and that you want help. Don\u2019t even talk about meds until you\u2019ve at least got them listening to you and YOUR concerns. Don\u2019t keep suffering on your own, reach out and try and get that diagnosis. It can be scary I know, but if you don\u2019t try you\u2019ll be stuck having a hard time on your own. If you do try maybe it doesn\u2019t go how you want, but it also might. You can\u2019t know that until you\u2019ve given it a go. You deserve help, and to not struggle. Reach out!",
