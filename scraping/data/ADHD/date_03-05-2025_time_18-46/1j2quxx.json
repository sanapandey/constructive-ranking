    "selftext": "Does anyone have a good method for keeping up with a long term list of multiple projects?\u00a0\n\nI love craft projects. I easily have 100 projects going at any time, plus many (many!) ideas about future projects. When I try to make a list of what is currently underway, I use a visual mapping method where I group projects by category and then connect similar projects with lines so I can see where the categories cross over. I end up with a pile of lists, or the list gets misplaced, or it gets so complicated that it\u2019s unusable, or for whatever reason it never really becomes a good solution.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy hope is that I can find a high level project tracking method that makes it easier to pick something to do when I\u2019m staring down a Saturday and thinking \u201cDo literally anything rather than just sit here all day.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAs much as I love the idea of tracking every detail, I know I\u2019ll start feeling overwhelmed with keeping the data current and end up throwing the whole thing out the window. I don\u2019t want this to devolve into a crime-board type situation with pins and red strings going everywhere (although as a metaphor for how I think about things\u2026hmm.) The basic things I need are:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n* To see projects I have underway by category, with a rough completion %\u00a0\n* Be able to update easily\u00a0\n* Must be a manual method. I have to physically write things down and stand back and look at it, so an app isn\u2019t going to work.\u00a0\n\nMy current idea is to get a large whiteboard, make columns for project categories, then put in a post-it for each project with a little progress bar at the bottom. I\u2019d update individual projects as needed, then periodically take a picture of the board for reference and do any big updates like adding columns or whatnot.\n\nThoughts? Do you have something along these lines that\u2019s working for you? \n\n",

A giant whiteboard or bulletin board, or a hoard of sticky notes can work for the brainstorming portion.\n\nAlso, dry erase markers work fine on glass, so if you have a big window or something, you can use that. :D\n\nI like XMind, as far as apps go, but there are plenty of them out there.",
