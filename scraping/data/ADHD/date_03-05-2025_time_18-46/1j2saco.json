    "selftext": "I (45M) was diagnosed around 30 and was initially medicated; however, since I had already completed my education (to PhD level) without meds and had learnt (self-taught) coping strategies, after about a year I decided to stop the meds (i think this is a lot easier to do when you're already established in your career and not having to take exams and impress people, something to think about if you're considering it too).\n\nFast-forward about a decade and I started learning Spanish for fun, but now I'm thinking about getting an official certificate by taking a test. The test is about 4 hours and covers reading, writing, listening and speaking. I've found that the test couldn't be designed better if the intention was to penalize people with ADD (mostly the listening)!! The listening component seems to be more a test of concentration than listening skills. It's about an hour of listening after which you answer questions which are often easy to misunderstand based on the volume of listening. I told my teacher I would find this part of the test very challenging in English, let alone Spanish.\n\nSo, my question is 2 fold:\n\n1. Do you think it would be a good idea to jump back on Adderall just on the day of the test? In the past it def did increase my ability to focus, as expected. Or would it be better to not use it at all? Start a week before etc? (also, I won't have an issue getting the pills from my dr, we discuss my ADD from time to time).\n2. If anyone else has taken a similar exam (DELE or SIELE) and has some tips on how to deal with the listening component I'd be glad for the tips. ",
