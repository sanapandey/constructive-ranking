    "selftext": "So I've been having a good couple of weeks, been sticking to just a couple of creative projects & really felt like I was making progress. \n\nWent to bed last night & couldn't get to sleep for thinking about what I wanted to do today, then today came & I haven't focused on any one thing for more than 10 minutes.\n\nI went out for a walk after lunch to try & reset my brain but alas, still doing nothing \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f now it's 4:30, in under an hour I need to be cooking dinner, should I just accept that today was a total bust & just hope tomorrow is better?\n\nIs it sometimes better just to accept that you're not in the right frame of mind to get something done? It seems ridiculous to me, but maybe if I can just accept it & not be too hard on myself I'll be more likely to have a good day tomorrow?",

Sometimes your future self will feel better knowing you didn't force yourself to do something because not being in the right mindset can lead to mistakes and more frustration esp if it doesn't go your way. Understand that you didn't get the sleep you needed to be the best you, you could be and that rn you are the tired equivalent of the best you, you could be. It wasn't a bust day today because you are up, you are still doing something with your day. You took the time to excercise, you will be taking the time to cook yourself a meal. That's plenty.\nI'm proud that you have taken the time to try and help yourself.\nTomorrow's a new day, make the best of what you can.\nAnd push to get yourself some more sleep tn\n\nFrom\nA stranger who didn't sleep the entire night either\nAnd it's now 8:40 am \u2764\ufe0f",

You literally can't do it, which is why you shouldn't.   \n\nUnwind, take a week off or whatever, then get back to it.   You'll find you get more done in 10 minutes when you're actually invested and dedicated to the task with \\*true\\* intention.   You could spend 20 hours and still not be nearly as productive as those 10 minutes.\n\nListen to your body, always, always, always.   That little voice in the back of your mind that \"you should\".  Give it a megaphone, listen to it, don't second guess it, that's the most important voice you will ever hear.  \n\nChillax, life is good, get some food, get some water, enjoy the day above the ground that you have been given.   Literally all of your 'progress' is meaningless, when you're buried, it doesn't matter then, so why should it matter now?\n\nFor me, there's weeks where I'm on, there's weeks where I'm off.  I can't do anything about it.  I just gotta go with the flow.  After observing myself for long time I've realized that I literally get nothing done when I'm not \"in the zone\" . it's just wasted time that makes you frustrated, angry and creates bad habits.   Nothing good, all bad.",
