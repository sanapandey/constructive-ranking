    "selftext": "Aaaaaaaah!!! So I\u2019ve read my fill on periods and how various menstrual phases\u2019 can limit effectively of stimulants.  Up until this month, I still took my meds; in fact, I would be doubling up on doses often, just trying to get some relief, to no avail. Never mind that this caused me to be short on meds before next fill. \n\n\nMy meds (Adderall XR25mg + IR10mg (booster)\u2014 provide minimal relief the week before, and NO RELIEF the entire week of my active cycle. \n\nSo this month I\u2019ve said- screw it I\u2019m not taking/wasting my meds- and.. Today. Was. Rough. A mess. \n\n(Example/context-I drove away with the gas pump still in my car- and that\u2019s the least frustrating thing on my list of \u2018happenings\u2019)\n\nSo- my question(s): Do you even bother taking your meds pre-period and during your period?? \n\nIf so/if not- ANY tips on A) helping them work and combat the hormonal limitations, or B) your tactics for getting through without your meds WHILE your hormones are raging against you? \n\nThanks in advance, for reading, and for any input/advice/experience you can share.  \n\nWith gratitude!! \n\n",
