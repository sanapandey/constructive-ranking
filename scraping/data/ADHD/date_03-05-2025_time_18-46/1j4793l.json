    "selftext": "Hi, I'm a Realtor with ADHD and have a seller that is too. I'm sure most, if not all can relate to how overwhelming it can be when we have to do things on a quick schedule, effectively, and focused.\n\nSo, I'm looking for some advice on how you would best tackle a monumental project like this when you are a parent of younger kids, a coach, a teacher, a taxi... you get it.\n\nThe big things will be paring things down so the house shows better, deep cleaning things like windowsills, doors, appliances, floorings, baseboards, touching up paint, organizing, and keeping things tidy for easier showings...\n\nDoes anyone have any guidance or direction on things that have worked well for you?",
