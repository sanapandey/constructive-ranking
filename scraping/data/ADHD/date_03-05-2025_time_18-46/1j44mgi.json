    "selftext": "I just want to begin this post with stating that I do not have an ADHD diagnosis, even if I might\u2019ve suspected that I perhaps could have it.\n\nI\u2019ve been having this issue where I lose focus during tests in school and end up either not doing the rest of the test or just waste a lot of the time I\u2019m given trying to get back my focus. \n\nI thought maybe it had to do with my sleep so I slept more, but that didn\u2019t help. I tried preparing better which only helps a little. I\u2019ve tried other methods like chewing gum but it never helps. I\u2019m not very well educated on ADHD so I don\u2019t know if this is something that is common for someone with an attention deficit or if this might just be because I am dumb. \n\nI\u2019ve been having this issue and it\u2019s starting to really(!!!) affect my grades so I was wondering  if maybe anyone on here might have some kind of advice?\n",

That would be a good place to start. Then, if diagnosed, you can get support, medication, and possibly special accommodation during exams like more time, a quiet room, etc. \n\nOther things that might help long term are things like meditation (I recommend the Balance app, you can get a year subscription for free) , and obvious things like sleep, exercise, and a high quality diet.",
