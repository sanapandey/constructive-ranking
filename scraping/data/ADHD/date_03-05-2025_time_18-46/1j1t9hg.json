    "selftext": "Okay so I currently take 30mg of Adderall XR daily and like many people I struggle to get it filled at the obvious options like CVS and mom and pop pharmacies. \n\nAlways try the mom and pop places because they are likely to work with you to secure your business. They have helped me plenty but this is not my main tip. \n\nThe solution for me came when I made a realization about state run facilities and their pharmacies.  I'm talking about your local state run Mental Health Unit. This is likely where all Medicaid patients in your area go for psychiatric care and they almost always have a pharmacy in the building. \n\nThis is the pharmacy I found that is most likely to have adderall or vyvanse, because state run facilities don't over prescribe these drugs and almost no one outside of the Mental Health Unit even knows that pharmacy exists and ANYONE can send their prescriptions there to be filled. \n\nI don't even need to be a patient and I can still get my medicine there, but guess what they have in stock? Bingo. \n\nGood luck! I hope this helps at least one other person.",
