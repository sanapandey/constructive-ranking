This fear can cause emotional pain, anxiety, and insecurity, even if there\u2019s no real rejection or criticism occurring. For example, someone with RSD might:\n\nFeel deeply hurt or anxious if a partner seems uninterested or doesn\u2019t reciprocate sexual advances in the way they expect.\n\nOveranalyze small signs or gestures from a partner, interpreting them as rejection or criticism (e.g., not being as affectionate as usual or not responding enthusiastically).\n\nAvoid intimacy out of fear of being judged or rejected.\n\nReact impulsively, withdrawing emotionally or shutting down, even if there is no real threat to the relationship.\n\n\nRSD in sexual contexts can create a cycle of anxiety, which might make it harder to be fully present or open with a partner. It\u2019s important to recognize that these feelings are often exaggerated by the brain\u2019s hypersensitivity to rejection, rather than reflecting the reality of the relationship.",

An upside for me was I got very hyper fixated on performance as a young man, so I learned to be a good partner and make sure she is satisfied before I finish. \n\nAs the subject of masturbation and porn has come up in other discussions, I\u2019ll throw in my two cents. \n\nI was raised in a very invasive fundamentalist religion, though my parents were pretty rational. I got all kinds of guilt and shame thrown at me about sex and masturbation, and it was very, very bad for me emotionally. I didn\u2019t date much and didn\u2019t get laid until my mid twenties. I had a porn addiction and made a lot of bad decisions because I was lonely and horny. But the problem wasn\u2019t porn or self gratification, it was fundamentalism and the guilt/shame cycle. \n\nMy ex wife was a malignant narcissist (which is a common pitfall for us, we are the perfect narcissistic supply), and the abuse and aftermath of that nightmare helped me recognize that cycle and how it was destroying me as a person. I still did not know I had ADHD, and I\u2019d left that religion a decade earlier, but through research and therapy I discovered that I was still hanging on to those destructive cycles and made progress in minimizing their hold on me. \n\nNow, I get sexually frustrated as my wife\u2019s medication has destroyed her libido, so I self gratify and view porn, but it is my opinion that if it is interfering with your daily life, interfering with a healthy sex life, you are developing feelings for cam performers/sex workers, or are paying a lot of money for access to them, you need to go talk to someone. For men, daily ejaculation is health for your prostate and reproductive bits, so have at it so long as it doesn\u2019t cause other problems.",
