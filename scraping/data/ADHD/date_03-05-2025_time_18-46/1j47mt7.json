    "selftext": "I was recently diagnosed and I am seeking advice on what you do or what motivates you for sex. I love it and I love it with my partner, but I never initiate and I never really feel the urge to want to have it. It was different in the beginning when we first met and I get that we've gained some weight and are older now (have been together 8.5 years, lived together 4.5 years). I am attracted to my partner and that's never been an issue, we get along so well like best friends and are still intimate, cuddly, etc.\n\nI'm not sure what to do or try if I need to try medicine or supplements but I'm worried this will continue to harm our relationship. I know it makes him feel like I don't want him or desire him. I try sticking to weekends for intimacy which has helped some, but its still very inconsistent. I get tired through the week because of work.\n\nDoes anyone else have issues with adhd and low to no libido?",

It's much more common in women \nhttps://johnkennycoaching.com/spontaneous-and-responsive-desire/\n\nIn a long established relationship, it's not unusual for people to get a little complacent and there to be much less flirting, build up, and foreplay.  A person with responsive desire won't be getting the stimulation they need to access sexual feelings \n\n\nHighly recommend reading: \n\"Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science That Will Transform Your Sex Life\" by Emily Nagoski",

Could be you need more mental stimulation to get in the mood too. Since you mentioned being stressed during the week, could be you're out of balance in general and improving your wellbeing during the week (taking more time to relax/take it slow outside of stressful or demanding situations) to have positive ripple effect in other areas of your life, possibly improving your libido too.",
