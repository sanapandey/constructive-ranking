    "selftext": "My doctor just prescribed a 20mg dose of Adderall, now this isn't my first experience with the medication so I kinda know what it is that I'm getting into... \n\nWhat I'm struggling with still this time around is that I've already seen weight loss, I have only been on it for a couple days so its raising a tad bit of concern. I am aware of Adderall being a stimulant and that you don't really want to eat while it is in your system, amongst the other side effects. \n\nI guess what my question to y'all is that, what would be a recommendation as to overcoming this side effect.

I\u2019ve always had the same problem, and I just try to force myself to snack throughout the day. Protein shakes are a great way for me to get some calories in my system. I drink one in the morning after I take my medication.",

It\u2019s always going to be a struggle with food unless you have your as I like to call it \u201cautism food\u201c unfortunately the things I only could eat to make sure I was like on track to grow and crap was ensures, protein shakes, PB&J\u2019s with bananas in it(even that would sometimes be too much for the stimulants for me to eat it) chicken nuggets, chicken tenders, pasta with butter, oddly enough sushi (imagine a seven-year-old constantly asking for sushi) pretty much anything vegetarian was more palatable for me during the Adderall. When it would crash, my mom would give me like steak, mashed potatoes and cooked greens like green beans and all that other stuff. Nothing mushy otherwise I would probably like lose my appetite really easily.\n\nThat\u2019s all I could really remember sorry if that\u2019s not helpful",
