    "selftext": "I went through the ADHD assessment process almost two years ago, and they didn\u2019t diagnose me. The main reason? I didn\u2019t show clear symptoms in childhood, and they thought my struggles could be explained by anxiety instead.\n\nBut I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I was masking\u2014so well that even I didn\u2019t realize it. I\u2019ve always been quiet, introverted, and socially anxious, but I was also a high-achieving student. School wasn\u2019t difficult for me, and I got straight A\u2019s in advanced classes without much effort. That said, I\u2019ve always been a people-pleaser and struggled with perfectionism, so failure\u2014especially academically\u2014was never an option in my mind.\n\nThings changed when I got to college. Without the structure of high school, I struggled. Between being indecisive about what to study and having difficulty keeping up with more advanced coursework, it took me nearly seven years to finish my degree. But even then, I didn\u2019t question it\u2014I just assumed I was lazy or unmotivated. ADHD never even crossed my mind.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my mid-30s\u2014well into my professional career\u2014that I started seriously considering ADHD. My struggles with focus, executive dysfunction, procrastination, and burnout became impossible to ignore, and the more I learned about ADHD, the more my past experiences started to make sense. But because I had masked so well, even professionals dismissed my concerns.\n\nFor those of you who were late-diagnosed (or dismissed at first), how did you process the idea that you had been masking for so long? How do you handle skepticism from professionals who don\u2019t take your symptoms seriously because they aren\u2019t outwardly obvious?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear from others who\u2019ve had a similar experience!",

I'm mostly through that now, so it gets better.  \n\nProfessionals who expect you to outwardly exhibit don't understand ADHD.  It's not just the behavior, its how you feel.  If possible, stand your ground and seek better professionals.",

            "body": "If you were able to successfully mask your symptoms in childhood to the point where they went unnoticed, it\u2019s highly unlikely you have ADHD.\n\nADHD is a severe disorder of inhibition and self control, having enough self control, and children with ADHD are unaware of the severity of their symptoms, so not even aware that they have something to mask.  \n\nEveryone does experience these problems to a degree, but those with ADHD have far more severe, frequent. Chronic and pervasive symptoms the difference being they are just too severe to hide.  (though people do try).\n\nThe crieteria also states that you just experience impairment, if you did not experience impairment, then your ADHD symptoms would be considered below the threshold for diagnosis.",
