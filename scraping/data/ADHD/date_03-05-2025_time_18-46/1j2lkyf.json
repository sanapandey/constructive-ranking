But once I grab a book that I am really into and I start to read, in the background I can hear a little voice listing all the things I am supposed to be doing instead, such as work related stuff, or more important stuff\u2026. And that doesn\u2019t let me focus. \n\nDo I stop my reading and go to do those things? No. I just get anxious. \n\nThen, then I am reading something work related, I get bored midway and need more than reading, like\u2026 I am not engaged. \n\nWhat strategies do you use to overcome this?
