    "selftext": "\nI am eternally crying on the inside. I am struggling in everything. I am failing at my marriage being with a narcissist man and addict. I\u2019m trying to take care of myself. I\u2019m trying to go to school to become an RN. And I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m an idiot. I have went to get tested and found out I have ADHD and with a learning disability. I am internally struggling!!! And I just don\u2019t know what the fuck I am doing anymore and don\u2019t know what the fuck to do at the moment. I feel stuck. I am trying so hard to make this marriage. My husbands family lives with us and at times they gang up on me and are disrespectful/make fun of me and have brought up my learning disability. I don\u2019t know how to put myself first . Where do I even start.??",

Don\u2019t walk away when you\u2019re able.\n\nYou have someone with npd, addiction issues, and a family that enables him & subjects you to emotional abuse. In what way are you going to be able to take care of yourself there? \n\nYou\u2019re genuinely worth more than that. \n\nThe best thing you can do for yourself would be to distance yourself from that relationship & find a therapist/psychiatrist to help you process this.\n\nJust my 0.02. Not a psychologist, not a marriage counselor. Not anyone with credentials. \n\nJust had a savior complex when I was a lad & have seen a lot of complex issues in my time.",
