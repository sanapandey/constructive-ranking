    "selftext": "I feel like all I see online from ADHD influencers and articles is to find systems that work for your brain but I have yet to find any guidance on how to understand how your brain works. Like is there an assessment or resources that help you figure out our brain\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in order to start building these systems?\n\nI feel like I\u2019m taking stabs in the dark and forcing myself to keep doing everything the way I\u2019ve always done it because all of the advice is just too open ended and ambiguous. Idk\u2026 maybe I\u2019m overthinking it but it would be great if there was an online quiz or something that essentially mapped our brains to be able to understand where to start making changes.\n\nMeds only help so much, especially since I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re helping or not. Like it would be great to be able to have a way to tell, especially since the meds I\u2019m on are non-stimulant and I feel like everything is still harder than it needs to be and even minor tasks just feel like monumental work and I\u2019m just constantly exhausted from it\u2026 so I\u2019d love to have a solid way to figure out what I need in order to help me thrive instead of feeling like I\u2019m barely surviving\u2026",

Then analyze how you feel about each step.\u00a0\n\n\nFor example, I figured out that I have a sensory issue with minty toothpaste, which is why I never brush my teeth. You stand in front of the sink. Grab your toothbrush. Grab your toothpaste. All that's fine, but when it comes to putting the toothpaste on the toothbrush, I get filled with this feeling of dread. So I tried to figure out why I was feeling dread over putting toothpaste on my toothbrush, and I eventually figured out that it's because I don't like the mintiness of toothpaste. Now I get fruity kids toothpaste.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother example is my sock garden. Basically, my feet were cold, so I'd wear them to bed, but I don't want to wear socks in bed. But I don't want to get out of bed to put the socks in the hamper. So they'd sort of just pile up on the end up my bed or on the floor. Now I have a basket underneath where I take off my socks, and then when I do laundry I dump the sock basket into the hamper.",

Occupational therapists are trained to help you find ways of getting around difficulties with doing things, whether it's body or mind. \n\nI feel there's a lot of talk about the difficulties of ADHD and not enough chatter about strategies and systems. I'd love to find some resources too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

I takes about 2.5 hours for our dishwasher to run a complete cycle. \n\nIt\u2019s only me and my husband and yet we seem to have an endless amount of dishes in wait mode on the counter. Off meds it never bothered me, on meds it drives me mad. Yet it was like a continuous unbreakable cycle. \n\nI thought about it, if the dishwasher is empty I will happily fill it, and forget about it until it is full, this could take a few days.\n\nWhen it\u2019s full, I\u2019ll happily run it. Then for a couple of days we will just use the dishes straight from the dishwasher and guess what\u2019s happens. \n\nMy husband said that now he understands what it\u2019s is like for me and so he just checks the dishwasher when he gets home in the evening and if it\u2019s full he\u2019ll happily empty it. \n\nI can\u2019t remember where I heard that we see 1 task as a series of tiny tasks (steps) .  It wasn\u2019t until I actually started thinking like this so it helps me to understand why doing some everyday domestic tasks is a soooo exhausting and feels like it\u2019s an unbearable burden.",
