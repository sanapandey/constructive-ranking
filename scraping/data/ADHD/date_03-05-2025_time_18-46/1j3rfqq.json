    "selftext": "Long story short, I (24F) have a bit of trauma when it comes to Psychiatrists\u2026 saw one a few years ago and ended up getting Serotonin syndrome and being prescribed 20 different meds despite me telling her what I knew worked best for me. blah blah blah. Stopped all meds, haven\u2019t seen a psychiatrist since then. \nI have been raw dogging my ADHD for a few years now and me and my therapist have decided it\u2019s time for me to get back on medications. I have an appointment set to see a new psychiatrist soon, and I\u2019m just a little nervous for it. \nThe only medication that worked for me\u2026 Adderall\u2026 WORKED\u2026 It was life changing.  \nI have a history of substance abuse (which I will obviously mention) so things that will \u201chelp me sleep\u201d or \u201ccalm me down\u201d are things I don\u2019t want to be on, and I had really really bad reactions to several different antidepressants, and a lot of the other \u201cadhd meds\u201d didn\u2019t really do much for me.\nI really want to go in and request Adderall but I\u2019m so afraid of them thinking I\u2019m \u201cdrug seeking\u201d or them having me try out 15 different meds.\nShould I just say screw it and go in and request the medication? And see what they say? Or do I just see what they think. I don\u2019t wan\u2019t to insult their professional opinion but I am SO scared of having the same experience I had a few years ago\u2026 :/",
