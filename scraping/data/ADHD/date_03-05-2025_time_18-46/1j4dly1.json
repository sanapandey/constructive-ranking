    "selftext": "I just joined this group, because my husband has ADHD, I would like to know how best to support him, especially since my biggest struggle is that I'm a People pleaser, and an empath. My husband is unhappy with his weight, I want to help him with it, but I'm naturally not a pushy person, I've always catered meals to whatever he feels like, because he barely eats when I don't, he's hungry, but not for what's in front of him. I'd really like to know what I can do to help him eat healthier. Would anyone have any suggestions? It's so hard for me to stop the enabling, and sometimes I feel as broken and helpless as I'm sure he does.",

            "body": "Honestly, get your own therapist and also couples counseling with an ADHD-informed therapist. Maybe think about getting tested for ADHD yourself since people-pleasing empaths are pretty common in this community.\u00a0\n\nRegardless, your husband is an adult. Part of dealing with ADHD is learning to take responsibility for ourselves. He can and should make his own choices about his body and what goes into it. Refusing to eat a meal prepared by his spouse because it\u2019s not exactly what he\u2019s in the mood for is childish.\u00a0\n\nYou\u2019re his partner not his parent. If he doesn\u2019t like the food you prepare he can prepare his own or cook for the both of you. If he wants to make changes to his health, he can work with his healthcare provider on that.\u00a0\n\nOf course, you can help support the changes he \u00a0makes, and help make them easier. But the changes have to come from him.\u00a0\n\nI know this sounds harsh and you\u2019re feeling desperate. But your husband is being manipulative in ways that have nothing to do with ADHD.\u00a0",
