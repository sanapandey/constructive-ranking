    "selftext": "Hard to get just being across the room. \n\nIf I forget where I put it, I know I can easily find it because I only lay it down in certain places. So I know it's not lost, I just don't remember exactly where I put it. \n\nAnd then when I have the urge to go on my phone, I realize I don't have it and it's like, \"Oh, I actually don't need it.\" Then I continue on with my work. \n\nHaving it on the other side of the room works less well, but it still works. I get upset that my phone is all the way on the other side of the room, so I angrily continue working while consumed with the thought of not being able to use my phone. My quality of work isn't as good because I'm upset instead of accepting, but at least the stuff gets done. But sometimes I do accept that my phone is on the other side of the room and I'm not going to get up and get it and then I'm fine.",
