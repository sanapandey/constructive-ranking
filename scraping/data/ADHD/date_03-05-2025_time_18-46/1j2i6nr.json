    "selftext": "So I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and started on two meds, one of them being Wellbutrin. While it\u2019s helped me GREATLY I do experience the side effect of grinding my teeth and especially at night when I\u2019m sleeping. \n\nFor a really long time I had issues with brushing my teeth because of the lack of routine and honestly just forgetting, causing gingivitis and my gums to bleed. After a good intervention from my parents I now have been brushing everyday for around 2 years and my gums have gone back to a nice pinkish color and no bleeding\u2026 but the teeth grinding has almost reversed all of that in the last 2-3 months. \n\nMy dad had an extra mouth guard from a \u2018Safe Guard\u2019 kit he bought for his snoring and I followed the instructions the best I could from online, dipping it in boiling water for 30 seconds then waiting 20 seconds and getting access water off before sticking it in my mouth. I couldn\u2019t find for how long I needed to put it in my mouth for though. I slept last night with the guard in and it was a mess this morning. My gums in the front and back of my four upper front teeth were kind of pushed up and while the two places that typically bleed didn\u2019t there was blood in NEW places. My lower front teeth typically don\u2019t bleed at the gum and never have but I think what happened was they were grinding against the guard. My front bottom teeth typically don\u2019t touch anything in my mouth normally, they go behind my upper front teeth but with the guard I\u2019m directly biting down on it with those teeth! \n\nSo if anyone else has to wear a mouth guard and has advice or a brand they prefer I would love to hear it. (Also any advice on taking care of teeth too because I can\u2019t really afford dental care right now and I\u2019m also very nervous about dental cleaning) ",

No. Your best luck is going to be with a custom-made one.\u00a0\n\n\nI have not yet looked into getting a custom-made one so I don't know the process, but I do know that if you don't have custom-made, you may as well not wear a mouth guard at all.",

My biggest fear is that my teeth will start to split (I know it takes years for that to happen but my dad has the same issue when he sleeps and he has split teeth so I\u2019m very motivated to find a solution lol) thank you!",

            "body": "Just a heads up - you should be cautious about wearing an overnight gum shield for prolonged periods. Ask for advice when you get fitted for your shield.\u00a0\n\n\nIt can mess with the ability to close the mouth in a relaxed way. It can increase the possibility of breathing through the mouth overnight which of course can create a different set of problems. There is something about clenching muscles as well.\u00a0\n\n\nEverything is a balance though and having cracked teeth, jaw muscles locking out, teeth so sore you can't eat semi hard food or terrible headaches after a night of grinding is also a bag of d!cks. A good overnight gum shield is worth it's weight in gold.\u00a0",
