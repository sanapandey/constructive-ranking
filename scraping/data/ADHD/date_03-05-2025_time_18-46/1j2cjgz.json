    "selftext": "So you know how your mind decides to move at 100 miles per second the moment you want to fall asleep, regardless of how exhausted you are? Has anyone else noticed how that brain chatter is silenced when you\u2019re holding someone you love and you\u2019re falling asleep together? I\u2019m single right now, but I was just thinking (as I was trying to fall asleep, but alas here I am) about how when I was in a relationship, sleeping with the girl I loved made me so content that I drifted off to sleep so easily. Nowadays I have to play something like scary stories or trip reports on YouTube, or maybe a podcast to fall asleep. Just was wondering if anyone else experienced that :) ",
