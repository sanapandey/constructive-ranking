    "selftext": "Hiii, I was officially diagnosed with inattentive ADHD yesterday. Part of me feels grateful to know that I'm not just lazy and unable to clean my room. The other part feels this deep sadness and I haven't been able to stop crying. I thought that I've just been majorly depressed this whole time. Unable to get my life together. Just wanting to lay in bed on my phone all day surrounded by my messy ass room, wishing to get my life together. As in I'm still in bed right now with my phone. Also I'm surrounded by people that think medication is terrible, that I just need more sunshine, supplements, meditation and it's big pharma way to get you. I've been researching and I'm coming to a different conclusion. But also come from that thinking and I'm worried about medication as well. Would love to hear stories about how medications have helped you if you're willing to share. Thank you kindly. I'm feeling deeply overwhelmed and lost. ",

They give you the tools to be successful, but they do not do the daily work. for me it quieted my inner monologue so i can think clearly ya know?\n\nI understand that meds may seem scary and you don't have to get on meds if you don't want to. You can totally handle it by going to a therapist, talking things out and finding solutions within your own toolbox.\n\nI will say, those of us with ADHD live life on extreme difficulty (like in a video game) Meds can help mitigate that and help you modify the settings of the game (to an extent.)\n\nI will say that i'm proud of you for taking the first step of getting a diagnosis. You stepped out of your comfort zone and you should claim it as a victory!! I know you don't know me so it doesn't carry a whole lot, but you\u2019re on the right track!

If your family doesn\u2019t fully accept it, they may never. The fight to have them accept it is not worth your mental health.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in your early 20s, it\u2019s very hard to break out of that parent-child mindset, bc you\u2019re so used to telling them the important details of your life, especially regarding ADHD.\n\nYou think it will validate the emotions you\u2019ve always felt-that you were different, that your parent\u2019s disappointment in you was wrong-but it won\u2019t. It just means their continued skepticism will hurt even more.\n\nMy parents are in their 70s. I come from a family that is super Type A, high-achieving perfectionists. They absolutely think ADHD is a moral issue, and it\u2019s just excuses for laziness.\nThey know nothing about my diagnosis or treatment. I even hide my meds when I visit them or when they visit me. I got diagnosed late in life, so all they know is their daughter, at age 38, suddenly got her shit together and became very successful in her career. And that\u2019s all they\u2019re ever going to know! My therapist even backs me up on this.\n\nYour medical history and diagnosis is nobody\u2019s business but yours.",

I know that sounds snarky when you\u2019ve just said you\u2019re feeling bad about it, but it is such a huge step to know what you\u2019re dealing with! It\u2019s hard to heal, both self esteem from just thinking were broken and just trying to come up with coping mechanisms for things we feel should be easy, but you\u2019re not stumbling about in the dark anymore and that\u2019s huge. \n\nFor me personally, medication has been life changing. I take a fairly small dose of a stimulant (aduvanz) every morning and it\u2019s made me feel so much more like myself! My emotions are more regulated which is huge for me, and it\u2019s not like having extra energy but more like that\u2026 brick wall that sometimes just springs up out of nowhere? That\u2019s hardly ever there, and it\u2019s smaller if it is! \n\nTo me it seems exactly the same as any other medication. ADHD has physical developmental changes in the brain, they\u2019re not mental barriers (which are also valid), we physically do not produce the chemicals we need to produce (or at least the receptors) to live life in a way that doesn\u2019t hurt. I take my inhaler because my lungs aren\u2019t functioning the way they should (asthma) and I take my adhd medication to correct those imbalances (to some extent). I see it as just the same as wearing glasses to see for example (although I don\u2019t). Sure, I could go through life struggling, with everything slightly blurry but why should I when I could get help for it and everybody else gets to see? \n\nMedication is a very personal choice and we all support each other here whether you want that or not, but don\u2019t let shame stop you if that\u2019s the issue. (ETA, I meant whether you want medication or not, just realised it sounded rather like an ominous threat to support you against your will) \ud83d\ude05\n\nSending lots of hugs, be gentle with yourself and remember, if you were just lazy you\u2019d be having fun!",

            "body": "My father doesn\u2019t like taking meds, I will fight tooth and nail for my meds. Everyone\u2019s different. And meds that work for me might not work for you.  One generic of a medication may work for me and another generic of the same medication might be a disaster.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll *not* want to do is assume that because the first medication, or first five medications, don\u2019t work for you that it means that medications are bad and wrong and not for you, or, even worse, not for anybody. \n\nYou are of course free to decide medications aren\u2019t for you, or that the cycle of trying meds, and titrating doses, and terrible side effects is exhausting and you don\u2019t want to do it anymore. I\u2019ve made that decision with hormonal birth control, where I\u2019ve never had results that were anything less than disastrous. (Oh, this one\u2019s different from the previous ones I tried? Is it still progesterone and/or estrogen based? Yes? Okay, yeah, pass, come back to me when you\u2019re willing to suggest something half a millimetre out of the box.) But there\u2019s a different range of medication options for adhd, some of which don\u2019t involve stimulants at all. So even if every stimulant option you try has been catastrophic, you shouldn\u2019t necessarily balk at trying something else if it\u2019s not a stimulant.\n\nI think the key is for each thing you try to keep each pro and negative discrete, and to make sure you know exactly what class of medication and mechanism of action each one you\u2019ve tried is. \n\nTried methylphenidate with increased anxiety but no help in concentration? Okay, maybe that means you\u2019re in the roughly 50% of the population for whom methylphenidate doesn\u2019t work. Make sure the next thing you try is an amphetamine class.\n\nTried vyvanse and it sort of worked but only if you pushed the dose to the point where the anxiety outweighs the benefits? Well, maybe amphetamine class meds work for you, but vyvanse\u2019s prodrug formulation doesn\u2019t. Adderall might be a better fit for you.\n\nTried a short-acting stimulant and it worked, but it sent you up and down throughout the day as you went through the cycle of it wearing off and having to take your next pill? Try a slow-release option next, that might work.\n\nSlow-release dose getting you through most of your day but not quite long enough and sending you into a crash at not-quite the end of your day? See if a booster helps bridge those last few hours and brings the crash when you\u2019re home.\n\nEverybody and every body is different. You deserve to find something that works for you. Even if that something is no meds at all. But don\u2019t let fear born of ignorance or the unknown hold you back from a better life. Ask doctors your questions, and then, when they\u2019re kind of useless about anything medication, ask pharmacists your questions. If you have access to a psychiatrist, ask them your questions (they\u2019ll be better than GPs about meds, but the nitty-gritty is still the purview of pharmacists, so their knowledge is still limited on some of the finer details we, as people taking and experiencing the medication, will notice and want information on).\n\nBe aware of what you can and can\u2019t stop cold turkey. Be aware of what is an emergency side effect and what is merely a deeply unpleasant side effect. Be honest with your doctors about whether or not you\u2019re taking the meds and the reasons why. Be very aware of what might interact badly with anything you\u2019re taking and take those warnings seriously.\n\nAll medication is a cost-benefit analysis. There are always cons to the pros. Medical professionals evaluate whether the treatment effect outweighs the potential damage to the body, and you evaluate whether the benefits the medication brings you personally outweigh the negative side effects the medication brings your personally. What you consider negative and the weight you give it is your own and just because a con seems silly to someone else, or the people around you think the pros they see outweigh the cons *you* voice, doesn\u2019t change the fact this is *your* body and *your* decision. You have the right to discontinue anything for any reason. But make sure your doctor knows, and make sure you are making an informed decision. \n\nI mean, for sure if you come here and complain about how your symptoms are destroying your life and medication helps but you had to discontinue it because the pills were blue and blue doesn\u2019t work with your aesthetic, I\u2019m going to have a hard time taking you seriously and the responses you get might display a certain degree of \u201care you for fucking real right now?\u201d, but that\u2019s still your prerogative.",

This is planned thing I have made a decision to do with knowledge about my medication, my personal needs, and approved by my psychiatrist. \nThe first time I took them it was like... The mental equivalent of my ears popping after a long flight. I felt like things were so much quieter inside because the Brain Noise had stopped and my thoughts no longer had to yell over each other. It took some getting used to and there was a bit of rage that THIS WAS IT?!\nNow? I take my dose and as it kicks in I think of it as \"Power on. Bluetooth mode. Pairing. Bluetooth connected\". I can get things done more easily, I can focus, the brain noise is quieter. I need to monitor my blood pressure and that's annoying but... To me they're worth it. You taking meds is a personal decision you don't need to share with anyone apart from those in your ongoing care.",

They have some side effects, but I will happily take those over the effects of my ADHD!  I like being able to do my job properly.  I like remembering to do things.  I like not identifying as a ditz.  I like my lazy days being a choice, instead of a default.\n\nThere are so many benefits to being on the right meds, and to getting therapy so you know how to manage your symptoms.  \n\nRemember, too, there are positives to having ADHD.  Fantastic pattern recognition, problem solving skills, creativity, empathy, being great in a crisis - all things we have going for us.  Once you learn how to max out your strengths.",

            "body": "Diagnosed with inattentive ADHD with comorbid anxiety and started Adderall about a year ago, at age 55. I lived my whole life feeling exactly like you do, I always knew I was different somehow but never could figure out why. So much shame and humiliation, just branded as lazy or a fuckup.\n\nLet me just shout it from the mountaintop here, getting on meds changed my life profoundly and completely from the very first dose. Please don't be scared, these meds have been well-tested and have been in use for many decades. Give them a chance, I hope they provided you the same relief I've experienced. You deserve to feel better!\n\nAnd above all else, DO NOT LISTEN to these people around you, they are misinformed and have no idea what they're talking about. Stimulant medication is the first-line treatment for ADHD, they are very mild and just push those neurotransmitters to the front of your brain where they're supposed to go. Take it from me, I have a decades-long meditation practice with over a dozen 1-day silent retreats under my belt, it's not a substitute for the proper meds. The whole \"big pharma\" trope is such B.S., don't fall for it. Sure, big pharma is certainly worthy of critique but you've been properly diagnosed with a mental disorder with no cure, they've designed a damn effective treatment.\n\nAnother fun fact I bet these naysayers DON'T know, people with untreated ADHD live notably shorter lifespans, there are recent scientific studies that demonstrate this. Don't hesitate to give meds a try, it's your life, not theirs. If you haven't already, check out Dr. Russell Barkley's book \"Taking Charge of Adult ADHD,\" it's essential reading. He's got a great YouTube channel too. Take care and good luck!",

We'd been trying to get the diagnosis for years, and have been in talks with my SIL (who is a pediatrician) for years about this.  When we first started to consider that my daughter might have ADHD my husband was against medication.  He grew up in a fairly medication free family.\n\nI grew up with lots of health issues and would be dead without medication, so medication was totally acceptable in my household.  My SIL told me that the medication (once you find the right one) will help with lots of the symptoms that make daily function challenging in our society.  If you don't use medication, you are more likely to self medicate. \n\nOnce my SIL told my husband that, he was much more open to her being medicated.  We didn't want our daughter to go down the path of self medicating / addiction / etc.  \n\nIf you had something other than ADHD (like asthma, as I have), would you go without your puffer?  No, because your body needs that to function.  However, like others have said, it's not a be-all/end-all.  You might have to still make some life changes to work with your ADHD rather then be fighting against it.",
