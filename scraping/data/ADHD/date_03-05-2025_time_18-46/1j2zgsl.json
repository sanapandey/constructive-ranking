    "selftext": "It\u2019s the most difficult symptom of ADHD I deal with on a daily basis. The tiniest things can set me off. Regular things most people can brush off and forget about, I\u2019ll think about it for DAYS. I\u2019m very bad at regulating my emotions, I act on impulse constantly, and I definitely have a bad habit of keeping grudges over the smallest things. And it honestly makes me feel really guilty. \n\nAnd it gets very annoying also. My mood constantly switching from happy, to annoyed, to angry, to sad, to embarrassed, etc. in the span of like.. 10 minutes and it takes a toll on me. \n\nI\u2019ve definitely tried things like going on walks, or distracting myself playing video games, and it works, sometimes. I\u2019m curious what you guys do though, and I\u2019m definitely interested in trying new things to better myself. ",

My therapist thinks it makes sense that I don\u2019t feel much difference going from 20 mg to 50 mg of Vyvanse because my most pressing problem is burnout and depression, which stimulant meds aren\u2019t addressing. It makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nAre you familiar with the concept of the Highly Sensitive Person? I haven\u2019t read the book, and I don\u2019t think the framework was developed with any connection to ADHD. But I find it helpful. There\u2019s a quiz available online. Sensitivity hurts us sometimes, but it can also be a valuable skill as we can recognize things others don\u2019t see and can extend deep empathy to others.\n\nI have very little figured out but one way I cope with hypersensitivity is remembering that I am very sensitive. Whatever I\u2019m perceiving in others or feeling hurt by may not be real, or might be much less serious than I think it is. I can\u2019t always see this in the moment, but I\u2019m working on taking things less personally. I\u2019m realizing that it has less to do with how I interact with others and more to do with how I relate to myself.",

Also trying to be grateful can be helpful (what am I grateful right now). I think being aware of your thoughts and feelings is the most helpful. Once you\u2019re aware of how you\u2019re feeling, you can take steps to reduce the impact: is this justified? Take some deep breaths or try the excellent Emotional Freedom tapping techniques.

When something triggers me, my \"knee-jerk\" reaction is usually to feel frustrated or shut down, once I've cooled off a bit I ask myself:\n\n  \nWill this matter to me in 10 minutes/days/weeks/months/years? I go down the list and put things into persepctive.\n\n\n\nIt has helped me half the time, the other half of the time I resort to screaming into a pillow, going really hard at the gym or sending a video/voice note on snapchat to my close friends with ADHD about the minor inconvenience. The good thing about my friends is that they understand that it is frustrating and they tend to respond with something that set them off recently. Them replying with an anecdote and following up with how they are now fine afterwards gives me reassurance that the horrible feelings will go away and that they're not temporary even if it feels like that in the moment.\n\nOne thing that I constantly forget about but does help when I actually do it is recording voice notes or writing about the triggering event as it happens in the moment, and the next time another triggering event happens I first write how I feel about the previous event to put things into perspective. It helps me realise that the event I initially felt so intensely negative towards now doesn't affect me, so it gives me reassurance that the feelings caused by the current event at hand will fade away eventually. One thing to keep in mind is to potentially simplify the event into 3 concise points, e.g.\n\n1. What happened\n\n2. How I currently feel about the situation\n\n3. How long do I feel I will be upset for (just so in the future I can compare how long I was actually upset for, usually I overestimate it which provides more reassurance)\n\nIf I don't do this my voice recording will not make much sense as I jump back and fourth between points, and trying to write down what happened also won't result in sentences that make sense.\n\n  \nHope at least some of this makes sense, good luck!",

Although I don't tend to get outwardly irritable, I switch from insecurity and embarrassed to depressed to panicked to happy to frustrated to super hyper really frequently, and like you said, it's often reality small things. It's exhausting for me and I know for my husband too (though he is really supportive!) \n\nI also use video games, and I feel that they can be really helpful catharsis/escapism! Idk what games you like but I'm all about the RPGs, my favorite is Baldur's Gate 3 for me and it's definitely good at distracting me. \ud83d\ude0a maybe too well sometimes though, lol. \n \nSomething I've been trying, though it's difficult, is trying to stop doing things that I know are going to trigger really strong emotions. For me that's could be not listening to music that I know makes me feel sad or even that reminds me too much of a certain situation or memory that could trigger me, even though I'm often wanting to find things that match my emotions. Maybe there's something like this you could try? \n\nI'm not sure if you've ever tried or looked up DBT, but I've found that quite helpful before!! It's usually used for BPD but also works for lots of other situations. Also, possibly bring it up a professional, if it feels safe- a psychiatrist (who was not great, but this one part was helpful) told me that I probably had \"BPD-like\", whether I actually have it or not, which she wouldn't tell me when I asked about it. \n\nI hope something in this might help a bit!! \ud83d\udc96 You're absolutely not alone",
