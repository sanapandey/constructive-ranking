    "selftext": "is this an ADHD feeling? it feels like im constantly addicted to something, whether its an actual drug or just a new hobby theres always something im craving. I cant ever feel like i can just sit down and do something just because i want to, it has to give me stimulation\n\nI never really thought about it until picking up and later quitting nicotine. im 6 months clean but it still feels like im in a deep addiction, just that its not nicotine anymore and obviously not as extreme. If anything at least nicotine would settle the cravings and i could actually feel normal for a short moment\n\ndoes anyone else understand this feeling? is it a possible ADHD thing (im still waiting for an assessment) or is it unrelated?",

Never do anything in a controlled and healthy way, then either destroy myself until I can stop, then replace it with the next. Not fun. I\u2019d say it\u2019s possibly the hardest part of adhd. Try and stay positive by remembering the good traits it hopefully gives you, kindness, empathy, helpfulness, caring, all the things that make you a good person. And try your best to stay smiling despite how hard life can be. People without it would be amazed if they knew the struggle I reckon.",

Because of my addiction to alcohol was a problem I found it extremely helpful to seek help thru an out patient program that has doctors, nurses, therapist and mentors on staff I do therapy regularly and also attend meetings. Their is a really amazing meeting for people who deal with mental health and addiction it's called Dual Diagnosis Anonymous where you are free to talk about your mental health ,prescriptions and addiction it's more open and allows the group to give the person sharing positive feedback if they want it not sure they might have online meetings you try and see if it helps you navigate this struggle I really do understand and wishe you the best!",
