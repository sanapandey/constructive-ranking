    "selftext": "I\u2019m 23 now and I feel quite old as I do not feel 23, I feel around 18 or 19. For years I had no confidence in myself, work, socialising, women, everything. I doubted myself every single step of the way. Overthinking, being ruthless to myself, beating myself up etc. It was bad, really bad. \n\nI\u2019ve been taking Ritalin for 3 months and I feel like a completely different person. It might be a combination of me changing my surroundings as well. But I think Ritalin helped with that. \n\n Especially around women, I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend before because I\u2019ve always been so down on myself and I couldn\u2019t help it. But now I feel like I could actually date properly",
