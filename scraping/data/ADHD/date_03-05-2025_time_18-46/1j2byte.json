I want to quit, but I know if I go cold turkey or even use patches/gum it's just not going to work for me, I've tried it so many times. Please give me advice",

I recently switched to vaping, and it made it so much easier that I feel like I\u2019m cheating. Whatever works though. It\u2019s not ideal: I\u2019m totally replacing one addiction with another one that\u2019s not nearly as harmful. A lot of people will say that it\u2019s just as unhealthy, but from what I understand, and from how much better my lungs feel, I disagree. It\u2019s harm reduction. Edit: the patch helped, but I\u2019m having a much easier time w/ what I\u2019m doing now.",

If you're medicated, you might need to monitor the effectiveness of your meds as smoking helps us mask and self soothe.",

It was a rough 3 days, but those were the worst. \n\nI used suckers, fidget toys, taking a walk, and picked up a new cross stitch to keep my hands busy. \n\nAnother thing to think about is not putting yourself in situations that make you think about smoking. My biggest triggers were booze, bars, sit down meals and driving. \n\nThe hardest ones to get past were my driving cigarettes. Any time I would get into my car I would have a smoke. I kept 1 cigarette in my car and just lipped it while driving. Never lit it but it helped with the driving craving. \n\nI wont lie and say I never think about it. I even tried one again after my kid was born. I gagged and threw it out. I miss them 1000000% but its manageable. It's been a little over 2 years since I actually had a full cigarette.",

            "body": "The patch didn't help me. The gum was great in class or in a pinch, but it always gave me a scratchy somewhat burning throat and it didn't help with the other rituals and things I used smoking for.  But I quit after twenty years by swapping it with vaping, old school vg pg and nic. It is not nearly as satisfying as smoking. I also breathed a lot better than when I smoked. I mixed it myself and didn't bother with flavoring. I figured if I was ok with the taste of cigs, I didn't need chocolate or raspberry or whatever, probably didn't help that the best flavoring I found was a cinnamon like atomic fireballs but it was really bad for my lungs. I had failed quitting so many times, quitting wasn't really the point. I was just trying to replace it.\n\nI was dizzy as fuck. I was getting way too much oxygen and I found when I was out of breath, I wasn't dizzy. So I started running. And I ran quite a bit. I wound up getting in pretty good shape and I followed that up with getting a pull up bar and eventually joining a gym. And the thought of those things as smoker would have probably if not disgusted me, would have at least confused the fuck out of me. \n\nAfter a while I started to get headaches. So I lowered the nic level in my ecig. And a while later, again I would start to get headaches, so I lowered it again. I weened off of nicotine on accident through vaping, but it wasn't salt nic. Eventually the nic levels were so low, that it was just enough to say it was in there because I had a hard time wrapping my head around not being addicted. I was a smoker for twenty plus years, and it was a part of my identity. That's what made vaping doable, I could still use it as an excuse to step outside and take a break a break. It worked as a fidget toy. And I still had a social shield to hide behind. \n\nThese days, I have an ecig floating around somewhere, it doesn't have any nicotine in it and I don't think I've charged it in a month on two. But sometimes it's nice to have around to use to step outside or hide behind. It's weird last week I was at the bar, it was in my pocket and I didn't even think about using it.",

Plus, at some point it gets embarrassing to ask. Aaaand before you know it, smoking makes you feel sick. \n\nI dunno, it was really easy for me.
