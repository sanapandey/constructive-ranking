    "selftext": "\nHello everyone ! \n\nI\u2019m currently on a gap year after stopping my studies because I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do. I\u2019ve been living with my parents for the past four months, and my gap year ends in August.\n\nThe issue is that I have many ideas and projects, but when it comes to organizing or setting goals, I freeze. It feels like there\u2019s an invisible wall stopping me from structuring my thoughts. I see others easily managing their projects, and it\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t even get started.\n\nI struggle with organization in both my daily life and thinking, and my lack of concentration makes things worse. I\u2019m unsure if this is due to procrastination, perfectionism, or something else like an emotional block.\n\nEach attempt to plan fails, leaving me feeling stuck and anxious. I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years, and I\u2019m starting to feel hopeless. I know I need to set goals to move forward, but I just can\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice, techniques, or personal experiences on overcoming this block and learning to plan effectively. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI really don't know if I have ADD but it could be possible, so i plan to see a doctor and do a test for it.\n\nThank you for listening.",

If you need to buy some stuff for a project but you're not sure you got everything in your cart, just buy what you have and then add stuff you need as it goes. \n\nIn meantime you should gather knowledge on how to do specific things in that area",

Write down what things you want to do and your project ideas. Next to that list, write down the things you need to do. Look over you're lists. What's the thing you want to do the least? What is it you most want to avoid? Do that first. Don't think about it, don't plan it out, a rough idea of I'll do this, then this, and this... after I will go from there. Is plenty enough plan for most things. So do it. Get the shit you don't want to do. Get it off your plate so that you have the headspace to work on your projects and you aren't avoiding doing anything, because you are avoiding doing a few things.",
