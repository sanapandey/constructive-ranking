If you are someone who dries everything I can tell you from experience you will be disappointed.\n\nThe one we have now for a load to be washed and dried it can only be max 5kg and it\u2019ll take about 4 hours for a proper wash and full dry. \n\nOur neighbor who has two small kids, so four people and their machine is going non stop through out the late afternoon and into the evening.

I was concerned I would need to do double the loads now and laundry would take forever but was pleasantly surprised. Granted, I live alone so I don't have that much laundry in the first place, but it's been a blessing to not have to wash the same load thrice before I remember to put it in the dryer. Yes, the cycle takes longer than if I had remembered on time to change the load from washer to dryer (which happened rarely, even with timers), but I can let the machine do it's thing while I work and if I forget to take out the load it's no biggie because everything is dry already and wont get funky. So right now I'm pretty sure I'll be keeping the machine even after I move to a living space that might have enough room for two machines one day.",
