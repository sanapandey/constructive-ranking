But now with a partner, I have to be on a schedule and it is so difficult.\n\nI love my partner, no doubt in that but this added responsibility makes everything difficult!\n\n- A little noise here and there and I'm distracted\n- I want to be around her and hence I'm distracted \n- Can't order online like a bachelor now and have to cook\n- Daily chores\n- Making sure you talk to all relatives \n- Make sure you not only enjoy things that you like but also give time for things your partner likes. I only have so much bandwidth \n- Sleeping on time and waking up on time becomes a little difficult \n\nHas anyone else faced these issues ?\nIf yes, how do you deal with it without hurting your partner ?\n\nEdit: Wow this post got blown up, so glad to know there are others out there who probably have the same problems. Hoping all of us will find some hacks in the near future soon :') ",

The hardest part is leaving my partner alone when she has to study or do something, and when I have to do something similar.\n\n\nIt's also hard for me to spend quality alone time with myself, rather than just playing videogames.

It starts with just asking for reminders.  Then it progresses to not doing the things you're being reminded about.  Then it progresses to resentment on both your parts because she's having to keep reminding you and you're not doing it.\n\nThat path ends in divorce.  So stay on your toes about it.  You can't use another person as your executive function for long.  The mental load is too big.  Then, her mental load will increase exponentially if you two have little ADHD babies, because children can't be their own executive function in the first place.  You guys will have to do it, and if you put that on her too, that just hastens the divorce.\n\nSo, TLDR: enjoy your relationship, but make sure you're putting in 100% too.",

I've relied too much on my partner over years, it's a natural dynamic because she is a natural care-giver and I am ADHD with a hint of true passive laziness with respect to chores. It's sounds very convenient, but leads to frustration buildup over time, for her and then also ultimately for me.\n\nI'm slowly trying to retrain myself to be a bit more thoughtful and make her feel appreciated more and do my fair part. At the same time I'm telling her to stop doing too much for me (which is difficult for her because she is a very nice person), because that basically spoils me too much.\n\nWe're still looking for the right balance and also planning to have a kid (singular, because I know with me as a partner more would be a bad idea).\n\nSo I just saved your reply as a reminder and warning for myself, to learn NOW to be the best version of myself that I can sustain over time, before having the final examination that having children seems to be.\n\nAs another piece of advice - money can solve problems too, if you are lucky enough to be able to afford it. We already improved both our lives with a robot vacuum cleaner, and will for certain hire someone to offload some weekly chores at some point. It should be fair and problems must be solved, but only the people in a relationship can figure out what can actually work as a solution or reasonable compromise. Use your strengths and work around your weaknesses.",

I was undiagnosed ADHD at the time of being with my ex for 5 years (I am a woman). He had adhd and depression and I unintentionally became his caretaker and 100% his executive function. For someone like myself with undiagnosed ADHD, this arrangement was exhausting, had me developing extra anxiety over always trying to remember his needs and responsibilities as well as my own. I became very resentful.\n\nIt started small with reminders to bring his wallet, or to set an alarm to wake up for work, or to text his mom back. Then it turned into his chores, his hygiene, getting out of unemployment. I tried to communicate to him that he needs to be on top of these things countless times and nothing changed. He told me \u201cif you just remind me to do XYZ, I\u2019ll do it\u201d. I became the manager of the household, except on top of needing to delegate tasks to him, he wouldn\u2019t do the tasks. He wouldn\u2019t do chores, even with reminders. He wouldn\u2019t pay his bills, even with reminders. He wouldn\u2019t look for a job, even with reminders. He wouldn\u2019t brush his teeth, even with reminders. He hated being told what to do, but even when I eventually stopped reminding him, he still wouldn\u2019t do anything. It was a hopeless situation. The mental, financial, and emotional load was so massive and it began effecting my health, I felt used and taken advantage of every day. \n\nAs a partnership, we can and should mutually help make one another\u2019s lives easier. But it\u2019s a slippery slope and starts small - at the end of the day, we are responsible for ourselves. Massive lessons learned from that past relationship.",

We get ready together most mornings, so I don't think she puts much effort to move my pill bottle to where I am more likely notice them. Then it's more obvious when it's moved, and at least one of us can be sure that I took my meds lol.\n\n\nAfter living on my own for so long, I'm used to solving my own problems (like what to do if I lock myself out). So it's a huge blessing that my partner is the kind of person willing to drop off my meds at work if she's home. I have coworkers who live nearby who've driven me home to grab a spare set of keys after locking myself out. I've even had my keys dropped off at work by my landlord after I forgot them at home. In this way, I rely heavily on others.\n\n\nI think it's important to note that in a relationship, it can be easy to fall into the trap of caregiving and power imbalances. I've been stuck in a relationship like that, but this seems different. (Edit to add: In this situation, I was the caregiver at the time.) We do a lot to support each other, and we are happy to exist independently... But even happier to share our lives and find a good, working balance between us.\n\n\nI'm a huge proponent of strong social systems. If it were not for very nice coworkers, neighbours, friends, and chosen family, I wouldn't be where I am today:) I don't rely on them to function on the daily, but knowing I have the supports, should anything start to go awry, is a huge weight off my shoulders.\n\n\nI used to live with this awful feeling of having to bear the burden entirely on my own, and that I could never ever inconvenience anyone, not even a little. It was misconception that I should not and could not ask for help. I'm still fiercely independent, but I am a little more likely to ask for help when I need it, and open to taking help when it's offered. People like helping, so I try to remind myself that I can accept that help without taking advantage of someone.",

I can make excuses or justifications all I want, but at the end of the day that fact remains. Had I not been in denial, I could've made the relationship work or left much earlier than I did. \n\nSo how do you deal with all of this without hurting your partner? You don't. You're gonna miss stuff and you are going to wind up hurting them. It is unavoidable. A successful relationship is less about avoiding hurting them as much as it is about resolving these conflicts in a healthy way. You have to learn as you go, but be aware of your symptoms and how they can impact your partner. But don't beat yourself up too much about it either. Try and approach it all from a problem solving mindset while keeping your symptoms in mind and work together to figure it out. Make her aware of your condition and the symptoms of it, and to not take things that are symptomatic personally. But also make an effort to prioritize the things she cares about the most. \n\nIf she isn't willing to work with you or listen to you or put in any research or anything like that, she is not a good fit for you.",

I think I am more type A personality and he is type B.\n\nI keep us on a schedule, chores, menu plans for grocery shopping, bills. This does get tiring though because I am constantly having to come up with ideas and keep track. I am a senior assistant in my day job so having to do similar things at home hurts my brain sometimes. In those situations I delegate him to pick recipes from the stack of cookbooks we have, or little projects around the house that I can't do on my own, etc. We are a team after all. I keep a calendar on my phone, as well as the list for groceries on my phone, and we have a main whiteboard calendar that I use to schedule things out for the month and a cleaning schedule that I wrote out. One room each day! He doesn't always follow it and neither do I - especially when I can see he didn't do his part or if I've had a particularly busy day at work. I have to remind him a lot about little things like not leaving clothes on the floor, putting the 10 cups on his desk in the dishwasher more often, prioritize the house before your games, put the keys in the key bowl so you don't spend 10 minutes before we have to go to work looking for them...\n\nI like to keep tidy and light my candles. I need a calm environment. I carry a lot of stress on my shoulders most of the time so coming home to a messy environment irks me and makes me feel like I can't relax until everything is put in it's place. However, once our agenda is on paper or he has his own reminders he's good at managing the reinforcement, for the most part, though. I know he, just like me, works best on a schedule but he has to create that for himself. When we lived in a one bedroom it was exceptionally frustrating because of sleep schedules and his video game time. I still sometimes have to coax him to come to bed to sleep or to wake up. \n\nI realize there is a fine line between him being his own person and using me as his executive function as another commenter wrote! I am not his mother and I am not his personal assistant. I take care of a lot of the mental load, which is unfortunately invisible, so it's not noticed as much. I am a prepper so I keep heartburn meds, antihistamines, etc on my person for when he needs it. I carry my own stuff too. I know that it would be hard for him to do those things for me and really hope that when I need it the most he will show up for me in that way. He has never lived alone, he lived with his mom, an uncle, and then his dad and now me. So prioritizing and managing time and maintaining a home are still slight learning curves for him. I lived on my own before I met him so I had most of it down but it is hard just by yourself still. \n\nWe didn't have a laundry hook up at our old place and I had a large yard so: cleaning, grocery shopping, cooking for myself, making time to go do my laundry at a laundry mat or my moms house, AND tending a yard and caring for my cat and dog felt like so much work to squeeze in on a weekend. I always felt exhausted. We have laundry on site in our new place now but sometimes adulting still feels daunting. It takes a lot mentally to do these things for even just myself sometimes so doing it for him often leaves me feeling overwhelmed and rushed (that bit is probably my own doing) and I have a hard time letting it roll off my back and relaxing. My advice to living with someone, especially if they also have ADHD, is to find ways to keep yourself on track and be supportive of one another's needs. Know when to take breaks, know when to prioritize self care, time to a hobby, even if you have to put something off. \n\nCrashing out is not fun. I have done it and am still recovering.",

For eight months, he got to know my family, and we were really close. They knew I liked him before we even started dating, so they were aware of everything from the start. But at the last minute, I made the decision to move away, and I did. That\u2019s when my life truly began as a freshly graduated high school student.\n\nAbout five or six years ago, we moved to a different state. Over the next few years, we kept moving, one place after another, experiencing different states and living away from family. It\u2019s been a roller coaster, full of ups and downs. Arguments escalated quickly, and emotions ran high. But over time, I\u2019ve learned that creating space, avoiding constant conflict, and focusing on communication are essential.\n\nBeing open and honest without gaslighting or name-calling is crucial. This is life. The beginning of adulthood. It\u2019s messy, it\u2019s hard, and keeping up with everything, especially maintaining a home, can feel overwhelming.\n\nAt first, the anxiety is intense, but as time goes on, you grow. Sometimes you grow together; other times, you grow apart. Time reveals everything. You just have to trust your intuition and follow your heart.\n\nAnd as for social media? It\u2019s mostly a joke. Facebook is full of drama, and Instagram is built on illusions. At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is your own relationship, not what anyone else thinks. Focus on that and let the rest go.",
