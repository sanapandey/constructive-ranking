    "selftext": "Currently trying to declutter my mind. Not quite sure how to put this feeling into words, but I\u2019m overwhelmed currently by my active creative brain? I have an urge to watch 50 movies in one week, read a book I didn\u2019t finish, work on a script, write a book, take photos outside, etc etc etc. it\u2019s just a non stop machine in my brain and it\u2019s suffocating me. I don\u2019t know where to start or what to do first so I just want to do everything. I also find when I\u2019m on Pinterest or tumblr : two media outlets I really love, can also be overwhelming because I get inspo from so many things so quickly . Idk if this makes any sense but yeah!",

Allow yourself to fall down the rabbit holes and see what resonates. Chances are you'll start/re-start a bunch of hobbies and will drop most, but see what sticks. It might take a week, might take a year, but just enjoy the process and all the experiences you're going to have. It's a wonderful thing if you have the right mindset.",
