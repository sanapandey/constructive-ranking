    "selftext": "Hi all, wanted to enquire if anyone have similar issues / general questions for their ADHD.\n\n1. Memory issues  \n\\-I could remember a memory from as far back as 20 years ago but would fail to remember a sentence that was spoken to me just 10 seconds ago. At this point, i genuinely think i am dumb. \n\n2. Lack of understanding  \n\\-Sometimes i hear/read the instructions but still fail to comprehend the ACTUAL instructions. Easiest explanation is corporate language. i would seek for yes or no answers, but instead of direct answers, i would get responses like\"as per the business needs/requirements, we are inclined to ....\" which would bugs me what is the answer. I would end up finding a colleague to confirm the email's answer.\n\n3. Slow career progression  \n\\-Not sure if anyone is hindered by this, but i genuinely feel that ADHD has been the key reason for my slow progression. Please dont insult me about this, it is just my genuine feeling about it as i have had trouble understanding/remembering/figuring out my next steps, and etc when i was undiagnosed. I had an inkling that i had some sort of disorder but did not diagnose it until recently. Having it diagnosed, i am slowly working it out with the therapist to understanding ADHD and how to cope with it rather than just blindly living with it. \n\n4. Active mind but... empty?   \n\\-This happens when i would like to nap/sleep. My mind would be awake but without any substances. Think of a PC that is running but there are no specific images/videos/sounds from it. Kinda like a static screen. Does anyone else experience this?\n\n5. Meds  \n\\-Wanted to know about your experiences with meds for ADHD as i was encouraged to try it but would like to know more before it. A friend has mentioned that she had an increased in suidical thoughts but also disclaimers that it could be from other meds. Can anyone explain your own experiences if it helps? What do you feel, any side effects, etc?",

            "body": ">Memory issues\n\nCommon. I often joke that if it's not in my field of vision, it doesn't exist.\n\n>Lack of understanding\n\nAlso common. It takes me time to process things I hear. I'm also allergic to corporate speak and beating around the bush. It sends me into fits of rage.\n\n>Slow career progression\n\nMost of my progression has been unintentional. I just do my job and I apparently do it well enough that higher positions have (sometimes literally) fallen onto me. I don't progress towards a career goal, I'm in a boat and I just go where the flow takes me.\n\n>Active mind but... empty?\n\nYep, that happens.\n\n>Meds\n\nI self-medicate with caffeine. Prescription meds are a fun game of finding the product that works for you, the dose that works for you, and hoping the effect doesn't wear off in a few months. It's a constant moving target for many people.\n\nThe meds are also stimulants so you have to be careful with things like caffeine and alcohol while on them.",
