Like we need life to be sped up and then we can stay focused??? Hmmm",

It's like it forces those gaps between information being output to close up.\n\nIt's like trying to cup water in your hands. If you keep opening and closing the tap over and over, the water has time to slip through the gaps in your fingers. But if you keep the tap open at full power, you could still build up enough water to fill up your hands, before it can all slip through the cracks.\n\nIdk how to explain it normally \ud83d\ude05",
