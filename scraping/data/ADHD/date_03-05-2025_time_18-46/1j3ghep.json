    "selftext": "My doctor put me on Wellbutrin for my anxiety, depression, and ADHD. It helped my anxiety and depression but did nothing for my ADHD. Yes, I understand that anxiety and depression can cause ADHD symptoms and vise versa. But I literally have an ADHD diagnosis, she has the papers for it. Yet she refuses to give me any treatment for it and just ups my antidepressants when I don't need it. And what a big fucking shocker, a higher dose of antidepressants when you don't need it, IS BAD. She's done this three times with different meds. I'm on Wellbutrin now and the 150 dose was perfect. But it wasn't treating my ADHD so she upped it to 300 and I'm fucking miserable. I'm pissed off all the time and have no control over my emotions. This happens literally every single fucking time she's unnecessarily upped my dose for any ssri I have been on. But she literally has my official diagnosis so why isn't she doing anything?! She never listens to me and my other friend with ADHD who shares the same doctor literally left her office in tears because this doctor just refuses to treat ADHD for some fucking reason. I know stimulants are bad for you long term but I've never heard of someone using them long term to begin with. Literally what is her problem.",

I could have went up a dosage but I chose not to because I just didn\u2019t think it was necessary for me to be on antidepressants. Ask her about Strattera it\u2019s a non stim adhd med so docs are less freaked out about perscribing it.",
