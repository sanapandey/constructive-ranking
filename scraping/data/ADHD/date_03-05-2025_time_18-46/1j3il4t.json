    "selftext": "I was diagnosed with ADHD around the 6th grade, after troubles focusing, and being disruptive during activities. Lo and behold, I had started medication immediately, for about a month until my mother took me off completely saying I was healed. \n\nI was not healed, but with habit-forming, and rewarding behavior I was able to complete high school, and go to college. However, I always had some issues that persisted, like focusing and being kind of disruptive during high school, things like anxiety and emotional dysregulation have always been there. College starts, and I completely mess everything up, I'm having trouble doing everything, and lose a year. Mental health at this point is at an all-time low.\n\nAt this point I'm an adult living with my mother, and I decide to bring the topic up again, but I get quickly reprimanded \"You are not sick\" \"Stop saying you're sick\". I think the one that really stuck with me, though, was \"If you wanted to, you would have already seen a doctor\".  It had me really think, at that point, why didn't I ever mention anything. She was right in the sense, I could have said something to my PCP at the time, but I didn't. It was so ingrained that I am okay, I can work everything out, even if everything is happening at once, that I don't need to mention it. I was embarrassed.\n\nI hate that I have a difficult time controlling my emotions, and sometimes lack the understanding of others. I hate that my mind just wanders, I hate all the voices that run at once when I don't want them to. I hate that even though I finally mustered up the courage to talk to my PCP, and start medication again, that I have to take medication. I don't even take it every day, and just for school, when I know I would benefit from it every day. I hate that I binge eat, just all of it. All this hate disappears as soon as I take my medication. Then I can start thinking rationally, and organized, but I hate that. I just wish, in essence, that I can just be normal. ",
