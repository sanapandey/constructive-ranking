    "selftext": "I have a question about getting diagnosed in Denmark. I am going to have my first session with a psychiatrist next week and I am scared to death. My whole life I have been struggling with my lack of focus and that I only follow my impulses. But I first realized how bad it was once I out of lack of prospects tried medicine. My brother has ADHD and gave me 4 pills of 20mg Elvanse and holly sh\\*\\* I it changed everything. There was suddenly no noise in my head, no RSD, I could focus, no racing thoughts, patience, ect.\n\nRight after I booked an appointment with a psychiatrist but now I am kind of struggling. I have in the meantime created a huge mind map with all my symptoms and my daily struggle going back to childhood. But honestly, for me the most precise and easy way to describe my symptoms is to explain the deltas of being medicated and not being medicated. \n\nHence my question: Should I tell the psychiatrist that I have self medicated with Elvanse? Reason I am asking is I've heard people have been rejected if they selvmedicate with drugs and alcohol. I fear that he is just telling me that I am a drug addict. Same goes for my alcohol usage.\n\nAny experience on getting diagnosed in Denmark would help me a lot.  \n\n\n  \n",

            "body": "Please be aware that RSD, or rejection sensitivity dysphoria, is not a syndrome or disorder recognised by any medical authority. \n\nRejection sensitivity dysphoria has not been the subject of any credible peer-reviewed scientific research, nor is it listed in the top two psychiatric diagnostic manuals, the DSM or the ICD. It has been propagated solely through blogs and the internet by William Dodson, who coined the term in the context of ADHD. Dodson's explanation of these experiences and claims about how to treat it all warrant healthy skepticism.\n\nHere are some scientific articles on ADHD and rejection:\n\n* [Rejection sensitivity and disruption of attention by social threat cues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771869/)\n* [Justice and rejection sensitivity in children and adolescents with ADHD symptoms](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24878677/)\n* [Rejection sensitivity and social outcomes of young adult men with ADHD](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17242422/)\n\nAlthough r/ADHD's rules strictly disallow discussion of other 'popular science' (aka unproven hypotheses), we find that many, many people identify with the concept of RSD, and we have **not** removed this post. We do not want to minimise or downplay your feelings, and many people use RSD as a shorthand for this shared experience of struggling with emotions. \n\nHowever, please consider using the terms 'rejection sensitivity' and 'emotional dysregulation' instead.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.
