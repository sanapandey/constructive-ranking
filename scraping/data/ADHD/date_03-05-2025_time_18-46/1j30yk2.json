    "selftext": "My god, i literally just went through this today and never in my life did I feel so dumb then I did in that moment. Cried in the car in front of the office and kept missing turns on the way home. I googled to see if people also felt like this because i genuinely feel like I walked out of there with certified dumba*s stamped on my head. \n\nLike how am I failing such simple stuff and I\u2019m good at math but I blanked so hard I could not do the math assessment. Kept clicking the damn x no matter what I did, and couldn\u2019t remember words. In one sitting my self confidence, pride, ego were crushed in one go. I refused to speak to anyone in my life about it. I just feel like an absolute failure and whatever hope I had about doing well in life, went down the mf drain. \n\nIt didn\u2019t help that after I spoke to the psych he told my adhd assessor to add learn difficulty testing and tested me with academic work. Like did I come off that dumb/stupid. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m okay now, had my little emotional moment all day yesterday, I\u2019m good to take the world on today \ud83e\udee1 thank you all for your kind words and support. Genuinely helped a lot \n\nEdit x2: I hear back in 3 weeks, wish me luck \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd",

I had mine all paper but they put me in a room all by myself for 4 hours and I cried. Please know that all of this is a normal feeling from assessment (at least it was for me too). Did they have a one on one chat prior to all of this? *Screaming \u201cyou are not a dumb*ss!\u201d at my screen* I\u2019m proud that you took the step in getting assessed despite how shitty it made you feel.",

                    "body": "Hii, \n\nThank you sm for your kind words \ud83d\udc96 for more context, the x test on the computer was one of many many tasks they asked me to do over a 3 hour period and before the testing I talked to a psychiatrist about my childhood and all that for an hour (but he seemed to look for any reason but my adhd to explain my behaviour, so hopefully the testing speaks for itself) . And thankfully I had a psychiatrist there with me explaining the tasks and everything (she was very kind) but the reason I was so upset was because they were all seemingly such easy tasks but I struggled so hard. But being in a room for 4 hours is insane, I\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\n\nAnd about the dumbass part, I was just so emotional and embarrassed (I know I should use kind words for myself but it was hard after the test) because my symptoms are so severe, they\u2019re really affecting my academics and everything. And I use to do so well with school but now my life feels like it\u2019s about to fall about while being on fire, in a tornado. So whatever hope I had about being smart kinda flew out the window after the test \ud83d\ude14(dramatic I know) but in hindsight it\u2019s good I didn\u2019t do well, because it shows that adhd is a struggle for me and it\u2019ll help me get my diagnosis and help I need :) I hear back in 3 weeks (hopefully all goes well) esp since I spent almost 2k on this assessment \ud83e\udd72",

You are spot on that it\u2019s a good thing things didn\u2019t go as well, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re not smart! I never did well on exams for math in particular even as a decent student but I could explain the \u201cWHY\u201d and concepts for each question, just my numbers were wrong. It\u2019s so easy for us to be hard and so self deprecating when we\u2019re so hyper vigilant that it is painful! Remember even when you get those results, you can always seek another opinion. I tested horribly then found another doctor who was more into interview styles of assessment which made it clear for my case. That assessment is NOT taking into the fact of how much sleep you got the night before, did you have enough to eat, did your morning routine or something get thrown off before that test? It\u2019s easier said than done to not let the read out overtake you, but keep advocating for yourself. You know you best. Rooting for you \ud83d\udc9c",

I was under the impression that thorough clinical interview was still the primary assessment. Mine was the DIVA it took a couple hours but it was just a bunch of questions regarding my childhood, academics, family history, relationships, work etc. Getting diagnosed by a computer seems...odd. I did have to follow up my diagnosis with a game like program made by Princeton but it was never brought up to me it's purpose or results. I've since been rediagnosed by a psychiatrist with 44yrs clinical experience in ADHD, mood disorders and PTSD as primary patients. I've had many bad psychiatrists including the one who diagnosed me with ADHD and it's refreshing to have one so experienced and capable. He keeps up on all new research as well. \n\nDon't feel too bad. I think it's supposed to be difficult for people who have ADHD.",

The test they're talking about measures executive functioning and impulse control and attention- three things known to be affected by ADHD. It's not used in isolation, and from what you can see of the OP's information they offered, it wasn't given in isolation and OP is receiving other testing to make their diagnosis more robust. There are some tests that are pen and paper, some are on computers, some \"testing\" is likely interviews and questionnaires talking to the client and other people in their life. \n\nYes, it would be inappropriate if OP went in, did one computerised test and a 45 minute appt and walked out with an answer. That didn't happen here.",

But just like you mentioned about being asked about child hood and everything else. That\u2019s the first portion of my assessment, did that for an hour. \n\nThen I did 3 hours worth of different tests, the x one was the only one I did alone and on a computer. All the other tests were preformed with a psychiatrist  (who was very kind) and she was asking me to do tasks. It was very comprehensive. I was just so emotional because they were all seemingly simple tasks but I struggled a lot while doing them and after three hours I was just disappointed in myself. But in hindsight it\u2019s a good thing I did bad because that backs my suspicions of adhd. And will aid in getting me my diagnosis and the help I need.\n\nEdit: Sorry for the lack of context / detail. I thought it was the standard test for all and that everyone on here would be familiar but I now understand that everyone had had different experiences :)",
