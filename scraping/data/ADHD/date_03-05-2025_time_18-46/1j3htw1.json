I think it was the ability to share lists with my other people so you can collectively modify it? Maybe the bar code scanner? I can't remember other than it was worth the 15 bucks a year, and I'm a cheapskate.\n\n\nIn any case, you can set this damn thing up so much that you can even have it organize items sorta based on location by creating category sets. It can import and store recipes, then create a shipping list from that. It also integrates with Alexa and Google, although I don't trust that shit so those permissions so that's blocked.",

I find having headphones in and listening to music helps drown out the store itself and I can kinda go into my own world and check my list and go get the shit I need. Otherwise I\u2019ll aimlessly wanted for like an hour, buy a bunch of shit I didn\u2019t need and leave without the one stupid thing I went out for in the first place \ud83d\udc80",

This one time I went to Target to buy tank tops, shorts, and undergarments because the washer and dryer at home were always filled up by someone else and I was running out of pajamas and underwear to wear, so I picked up a bunch. Then I went to the Christmas section (my favorite section) and then saw some chocolates I needed to fill up on and then had this random idea of making my boyfriend a Brrr Basket. So I grabbed some more candy and chocolate he would like and a card and then realized I was already way past $50 so I put the clothes back, checked out and left. On the way home I realized I didn\u2019t get what I actually needed and placed a pick up order. \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23",
