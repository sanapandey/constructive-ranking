    "selftext": "Im 18 and I'm going to college next year. I was accepted into a uni and it was all already unorganized like idk how fasfa works or how scholarships works but I always thought that those things wouldn't be hard to figure out. However i was told that I need to go to a community college before a uni and I felt my heart drop. My already disorganized plan got more disorganized. I have to pretty throw away what I already have planned and rework it. I'm so tired of college, why is it so hard and complicated. I tried to talk to a college guidance but I dont trust them at all in my school since they are unprofessional. \n\nEverything is so out of the place and messy that I don't know where to start. My parents knows i have ADHD but disregards it even tho I'm diagnosed. They don't wanna help me and think that simply \"getting organized\" is the solution. I'm 18 yet I haven't accomplished anything in life while everyone around me are in a sport, gotten awarded, or simply are doing things. I just here lost and blaming myself for not trying harder in the past and taking the opportunities. My mom always blames me for not taking the opportunities and makes me feel like a failure. I'm taking 2 aps classes and my reason is to make myself feel like im accomplishing something but it doesn't work at all.\n\nI wish I had a fairy or some kind entity that I can keep around and help me keep things organized. I often wish I die young just so I dont have to struggle anymore and be free.",

It\u2019s always getting the ball rolling that\u2019s the hardest.  Once you\u2019re in and have some momentum, it\u2019s gonna be great.\n\nDeep breaths.  You got this.",
