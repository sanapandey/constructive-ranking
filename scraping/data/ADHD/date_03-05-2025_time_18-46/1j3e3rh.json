    "selftext": "Hello, I was recently prescribed aderrall xr 20 mg. I also started finasteride 0.5 mg every other day about a month ago. Ever since starting aderall i feel an increase in my anxiety, feeling restless, talking fast, insomnia. Also my erections feel weaker im at a crossroads because both aderall and finasteride can cause mood related issues and sexual sides.. Anybody else on this combination can share their experience.  Thanks . Im thinking asking my psych to lower the dose to 10 mg IR.",
