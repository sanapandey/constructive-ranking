    "selftext": "So ever since I began college over 4 years ago (I have since graduated and now have a full time job) I have been struggling a lot with focusing and actually doing my work. I feel like it's ADHD, but honestly I'm doubting myself because I do not remember any symptoms from early childhood apart from doodling a lot in class and occasionally forgetting to do assignments. But I honestly can't remember elementary school at all, I only remember from middle school onward. I was never hyperactive and have always excelled in school so I guarantee my parents wouldn't have noticed a thing either.\n\nSo I tell myself this can't be ADHD, since I can't come up with any evidence to show signs of it early on. But then what else could it be? What else could explain me not being able to start tasks, or not being able to organize my ideas, or procrastinating on assignments until the very last possible minute, or taking 10 minutes to read a page because I constantly forget what I just read, or constantly biting my sleeves without realizing, or waiting until 3pm to eat lunch because I lose track of time, or forgetting to do my laundry, or planning a whole day of stuff to get done only to do absolutely nothing? The list goes on.\n\nI just don't know what to do. I keep going back and forth, thinking I need help but then blaming myself for just being lazy. I need some guidance.",
