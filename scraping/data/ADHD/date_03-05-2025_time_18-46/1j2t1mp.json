    "selftext": "Last night my boyfriend and I got food from this place that I been craving for a while, I lost interest in my safe food after eating it almost everyday for a year so I been struggling with trying to eat proper meals everyday. I even lost some weight which isn\u2019t that great because I\u2019m already really skinny. Well the food was awesome and I took the rest home with me because I knew I probably wouldn\u2019t eat if I didn\u2019t. Fast forward to this morning I found that my dad threw away all my leftovers because he\u2019s on this health kick and what I brought home wasn\u2019t exactly \u201chealthy\u201d. This made me so so mad and I know it\u2019s not even that big of a deal but in that moment I didn\u2019t want to eat anything else and I felt hurt that I wasn\u2019t even asked before it got thrown away. So out of spite I threw away some of my dad\u2019s leftovers and left a note saying \u201cdon\u2019t throw away my lunch without asking\u201d. I know it was the immature thing to do and I feel bad now for acting out on impulse. ",

Do you think your dad would\u2019ve thrown that food away if it belonged to an adult guest?

I asked him, and he had the biggest sorry face I had ever seen. \"I'll make you rice.\" He said. It's now a joke between our group. I'm still a little butt hurt after 7 years, lol.

Her reasoning was that she had seen my lunch in there for *weeks*. \n\nI used the same lunch bag/ container every day, and I guess I put it in the same spot in the work fridge every morning. This lady just assumed it had been rotting there because she saw it every time she worked, ignoring the fact that it had my name on it, and I was there beside her in retail hell for 50+ hours a week. We had eaten lunch together multiple times just that week!\n\nTo say I wanted to stab a 55 year old woman to death is an understatement. I can still feel my incredulous rage at finding the remnants of my delicious leftovers on the top of the back office garbage can. When I pointed all the facts out, she just shrugged and said it's the risk you take when you put your stuff in the community fridge. *Fuck You, Beth-Anne!*\n\nI'm sorry about your leftovers. That was a major injustice, and it makes it even worse when the culprit won't take a moment from their life to acknowledge your grief. \n\nAt a totally different job, I sat with my boss while she cried over a frozen bean burrito. A coworker had \"mistakenly\" eaten it when mooching for food, but instead of apologizing said, \"Oh honey, I did you a favor. I took one bite and spit it out. That thing was *awful* \". That terrible burrito had been my boss's one bright spot in an otherwise miserable day. Hearing that someone stole it from the freezer, microwaved knowing it wasn't theirs, took a bite, and threw it away was bad enough. Getting made fun of for it triggered her even more because she was on a diet, and she obviously knew that burrito was crappy. It was a symbol of allll the crappy things she had lied to herself about looking forward to.... we worked in a school. Pickings for snacks in schools are SLIM at the end of the day. Kids are worse than seagulls, they can smell an emergency granola bar from the next county! I held her while she quietly sobbed, and we rummaged for the least stale bag of leftover popcorn from a fundraiser event the night before.  \ud83d\ude2d",

If they're struggling with impulse control and didn't want to have done this, then it's pretty bad to reinforce that as a good thing they did it. Because it's not about the morality of the action at that point, it's about unmanaged ADHD symptoms leading to distress.\n\n\nBut if we assume that this was just an act of spite and want to litigate whether the dad deserved it...then this has nothing to do with ADHD at that point and is more of an AITA post.\n\n\nSo if we do assume this is ADHD related, it's extremely harmful to have everyone cheering OP on just because they liked the outcome when the process to get there was a lack of impulse control that distressed OP.

He may have thought it was his and threw it away to get rid of his temptations of wanting to eat it. Just from the sounds of it you still live with your dad and he pays the bills and it's his refrigerator. He has the right to do what he wants as it's his house. Doesn't make it nice still, but he will win that way if you try to shove that in his face.\n\n  \n2. Just go to your Dad and say \"Hey, you threw my food out and I was not okay with that, I wish you would have said something before throwing it away. Because i was so angry and wasn't thinking i threw away your food to get you back and I am sorry.\" I don't know if your dad understands your ADHD as my parents did not and life was extremely difficult for me. Just own up to your mistake of trying to be spiteful and move on. \n\n  \nJust my opinion. We all do impulsive things and this is obviously one of those times. Easier to deal with someone like your dad who is the \"Man of the House\" just to calm the situation.",
