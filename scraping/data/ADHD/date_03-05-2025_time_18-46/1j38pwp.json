When I asked my other group mate to put in her email, she said \u201cyou already know my name, we went to high school together\u201d and I just blanked. She know because I instantly went red and said sorry. She made abit of a deal out of it like \u201cdude how don\u2019t you know we literally went to Highschool together and were in a few of the same classes\u201d and what not.\n\nI just feel REALLY bad because we\u2019ve known each other from year 7 to year 12 and now we\u2019re in the same uni class. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s even been ages since we\u2019ve last seen each other, which was in November for our graduation dinner.\n\nAnyways, off to cry now and never show up for that class again.",
