    "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI am after some advice, or to see if anyone has had the same experience as me. For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve had songs stuck in my head, it changes everyday. I used to complain to my mum about it growing up, and struggled with sleep in my teens, and still struggle to this day. But it\u2019s not the entire song, it\u2019s just a line that plays over and over again, and can sometimes give me a headache. I wake up to these, and I struggle to fall asleep to it. Some nights I can fall asleep quite easily, listening to shows or YouTube videos, but there are times where even they won\u2019t help. \n\nSometimes I have to concentrate on thinking of different lyrics of a song to get the one that\u2019s persistent out, which can help sometimes but it is somewhat tiring. But most of the time, I listen to music really loud or podcasts really loud, and as soon as I stop, the chosen song of the day comes back. \n\nI am diagnosed with ADHD, I was in my final year of university, I am not medicated but am considering it. \n\nDo these persistent earworms link to ADHD, as I\u2019ve read articles and some says it\u2019s OCD, which I don\u2019t think I have. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this and been diagnosed with ADHD? Does anyone have any solutions to this, or coping mechanisms that have helped them if not medicated? \n\n",

It's always interesting to see what will be playing when I wake up in the morning, its always different and can even be songs I haven't heard in ages, they don't in any way reflect what I've recently heard in real life. I can't imagine life without it, I think the silence would be deafening. It keeps my mind occupied and fills the empty space between my thoughts.",
