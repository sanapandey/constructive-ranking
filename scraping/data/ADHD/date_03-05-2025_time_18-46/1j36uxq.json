    "selftext": "Hey people, im kinda new to posting/asking in these sorts of subs. I am 28M and got diagonsed 6 months ago. My doctor started me off on 10mg ritalin 2x a day. Then we bumped up to 20mg 2x a day, and now im on 30mg 2x a day. The periods between adjustments have been 2 weeks, and the reasoning for upping my dose is that on 10mg and 20mg, ive felt that ive just been lurking right under the surface of feeling the effects of the medication. \nMy question is, and the reason im asking is because my experience on the final dose (30mg x2) has been the exact oposite. The posts ive been reading here are mentioning that the beginning phase of their medication, they have felt this euphoric feeling of getting stuff done, and functioning. But myself have felt that in the beginning of finding the right dose, ive not really felt any improvments, but as time has gone on and consistenly taking my medicine ive now after a while felt theese feelings alot of people are reporting having in the beginning of their treatment. Are there any experiences that taking Ritalin gets better over time, relating to the body adjusting to the medicine (like non-stimulants that alter the chemical composition of the brain)?",
