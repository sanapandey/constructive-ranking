    "selftext": "I got diagnosed with ADHD (well, ADD if we are being technical) about 2 years ago and ever since it\u2019s been a battle finding a medicine that will help me.\n\nI struggle with anxiety and each stimulant I\u2019ve been on just causes me to get really bad anxiety. I\u2019ve started off on the lowest dose possible and worked my way up and it\u2019s still causes me to get close to having a panic attack. I\u2019ve even tried the non stimulant but it really didn\u2019t do anything for my focus (Strattera). I\u2019ve tried vyvanse, concerta, strattera, and Ritalin. \n\nAnyone struggle/struggled with this? What are your suggestions on how to better focus or a stimulant/non stimulant that has worked for you or even non medication options that have helped that I could trial.",

Strattera does take a month or so to start working. Instant Release Ritalin worked ok but only last two hours each time. \n\nNow he is in Qelbree which is an SNRI/adhd medication along with Jornay PM. Jornay PM you take the night before and time it 12hrs to when you want to wake up. For whatever reason he is more relaxed on it. He also does Dialectic Behavior Therapy to help with emotional regulation.",

So I take Lexapro now at night for Anxiety and Vyvanse in the morning for ADD...Works amazing and helps. \n\nTalk to your Dr. You might need to treat anxiety as well.",

I was on lexapro and that didn\u2019t go so well. I was also on Prozac for a long time until my body got used to it. I\u2019m nervous to switch off of my trintellix because it\u2019s worked so well for me for so long. I do think theirs options just for anxiety medication that I can take separate from my trintellix. I have an appointment with my doctor soon so I\u2019ll mention it to her! Thank you for the advice!!",

I was in college at the time so deadlines and exams made my anxiety worse while taking vyvanse. But vyvanse was a little too strong for me. I felt like i could taste colors and my anxiety was super high. I also struggle with bipolar so it was definitely close to a manic episode for sure.\n\nI\u2019d say a month at the most for all medicines I\u2019ve trialed. I think I trialed strattera for longer though since it\u2019s a non stimulant and didn\u2019t cause any anxiety.",
