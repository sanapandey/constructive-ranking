Here I am. \n\nI cannot seem to overpower the addiction of Tv, isolation or laziness. I spend whole weekends on the couch not moving and waisting time and creating stress instead of doing the task. I hate my job but when someone helps me over and over again I botch it like forget to turn something in or intentionally forget a deadline even if it\u2019s something I am excited about. \n\nIs this a ADHD thing? \n\nThis is the 4th time they have gone on. Limb to help and I botched it. Often I know better or choose to do a task for work now I know isn\u2019t important instead as an act of productivity. I know better but I am not doing better. \n\nThose who are doing better what are you doing? What did you do? I am looking for actionable things like remove all electronics or have an accountability buddy whatever. ",

Not the same issues, exactly, but yes, self-sabotage of a different sort.\n\nThis doesn't give you any tools to help you.  But I want you to know that you are seen, and you are not alone.",
