    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I need some help figuring out my ADHD medication and how it\u2019s affecting me. I\u2019ve been struggling with\u00a0**severe focus issues, dissociation, and resurfacing trauma**, and I don\u2019t know how to fix it.\n\nI lose focus every 10 seconds unless something deeply interests me, in which case Without medication, my mind is scattered, and I can\u2019t concentrate, but when I take my meds, I feel emotionally blocked and disconnected. I recently started\u00a0**T Axepta 10 mg at night**, which is the lowest dose, but I\u2019ve been having strange reactions. The first night, I felt extreme sleepiness and emotional shutdown, like I just wanted to go home and do nothing. Over time, I started experiencing\u00a0**dissociation, emotional numbness, and distress in my pelvic area**\u2014almost as if childhood trauma was being forced to the surface. When I skip the medication, I can\u2019t focus at all, but when I take it, I feel mentally paralyzed. At this point I have no friends which has been the case from from childhood I have tried everything from talking with people whenever try to strike a conversation the vibe of the person is less and whenever that same person talks with someone else they talk differently as if people dont like my energy or respect me but I give them my respect. It has become very lonely and have no idea what to do now.\n\nThe distress is so overwhelming that it makes everyday tasks difficult. No matter what I do,\u00a0**old trauma resurfaces daily**, whether I take the meds or not. I\u2019ve tried\u00a0**EMDR-style shoulder tapping with affirmations**, and while it worked for about 1.5 days, the dissociation came back even stronger afterward. I\u2019ve also noticed symptoms of\u00a0**emotional dysregulation**\u2014one moment I feel fine, and the next, I\u2019m completely disconnected from reality. I\u2019m also curious about using\u00a0**brown noise to help with focus**, but I\u2019m not sure how to use it discreetly in class.\n\nAt this point, I don\u2019t know what to do. Any suggestions?",
