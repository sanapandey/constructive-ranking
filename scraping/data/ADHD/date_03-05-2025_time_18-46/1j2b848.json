    "selftext": "I have been into loneliness from school life, till now I didn't speak much to people or went for a gathering.\n\nI used to go to some, but even in gatherings I feel lonely.\n\nI also struggle alot to learn. I take course from Udemy/Coursera, But I am very tired to complete it. I though have a good academic record. I also have imposter syndrome.\n\nI am planning for PhD in foreign universities. Are there any PhD's with the same sort of feelings and how to cope up and manage to excel in PhD.",
