    "selftext": "I've been on Vyvanse for about a month now and today I had a shower thought that I hope I can articulate here. \n\nBefore taking medication I felt like I was carrying around a giant compendium of information all day long. Every time I took in new information, my stack got heavier. But I put it there because I don't want to forget whatever it was. Every day felt like a huge burden.\n\nOver the last couple weeks it's really felt like I put my giant pile of information down nearby. It's still there, but I don't need it all right now and I can trust that it'll still be there when I need to reference it. ",
