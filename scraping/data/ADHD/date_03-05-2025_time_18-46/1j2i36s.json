    "selftext": "I recently found out I'm pregnant. I quit taking all my medications when I found out since it's a stimulant. Its been 4 weeks off my meds and I'm struggling so hard to regulate my emotions. I have zero motivation. I haven't left my house nor do I have any desire to leave. I want to cry, scream and freak out all at the same time.. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d  \n\nIdk what to do. I can't do this. My head is in such a dark place. I worked so hard to get my mental health in check and now it's all shit again. ",

You don\u2019t have to go at it alone and try to tough it out, pregnancy is hard enough. \nI tried to raw dog it through years of breastfeeding and my doctor insisted I try medication again because the benefit outweighs the risk.
