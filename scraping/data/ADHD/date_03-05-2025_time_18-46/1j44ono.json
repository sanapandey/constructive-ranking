Has anyone found ways to make the effects last longer? Could diet or other factors play a role? Any advice would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: To clarify, by \"quickly lose effectiveness\" I mean that the meds lose their effectiveness as a whole a while after I first start out on them. \n\nRepeating cycle: Start out on a different dose/meds -> works really well for a few days -> starts actively making me tired/groggy -> start doubling dose to get effects -> repeats.",

I'm 43.\n\nI recently asked my psychiatrist to *lower* my dose.\n\nWhat many perceive as a \"loss of effectiveness\" is often a loss of the initial super-power feeling of being able to function after being unable to.\n\nWhen stabalized, you're not losing all of the effectiveness of the meds. You're just... normal. You have a baseline ability to focus on purpose on par with someone who doesn't have ADHD.\n\nWhat you do is what they do. You get organized. You build habits. You make rules for your own conduct, and stick to them.\n\nLike, I never start a load of laundry if I don't have time to also dry, fold, and put it away. \"Doing laundry\" means doing all of those things.\n\nI automate as much of my bill paying as I can.\n\nI do calisthenics first thing in the morning, before the day throws things in the way.\n\nImagine who and how you *want to be,* and create small stepped plans to get there.",

I got to 40MG and found it pretty good but I did find it wore off maybe a little too early and was having issues with crashing in the evening. I bumped up to 50 and it was just too much. Anxiety and restlessness in the evenings. Dropped back to 40 for about a year now..is it powerful like it used to be? No. I barely feel it kicking in anymore. But I do feel a hell of a lot better then I did previous to Vyvanse. I don't have super powers and drive anymore but I go about my day and can be pretty damn useful. I did need to add an SSRI to the mix though to get my anxiety in order. I'm feeling better now then I have in a long, long time. Best part for me is I know that I can still go up another 40MG in the coming years if need be, but for now I'm fine with just going about my business with 40.",

I\u2019ve been medicated since I was like <10 and I\u2019m nearly 20.\n\nEdit: I have a lot going on in my life that I still need to figure out that I\u2019d imagine would make life easier outside of the bandaid that meds are though.

            "body": "I have two things to say about this:\nOne, it took me a while to realize the desired effects are separate from many of the effects you feel more intensely when you start the medication. The most obvious of which is the euphoric feeling, but there's also more 'energy' and a newness to the clarity that you get that makes it hard to ignore. However the meds are not a 'cure', you still have to use them to make good habits that work for you. You'll still have symptoms of adhd no matter your dosage and what works for you is unique so that's just introspective work that you have to do to take advantage of the therapy that meds provide. It took me maybe a year to realize the effects I thought I lost or was chasing with higher dosages was still in effect, I just wasn't really changing my life to take advantage of the mind state it put me in. I ignored that state of mind where I coudl actually sit down and do something without constantly thinking of what else I could and should be doing, so I assumed without the FEELING it gave me, it wasn't very effective.\n\nSecondly: Take. Breaks. Often. (except for certain meds like vyvanse Im pretty sure that's just daily regardless as it builds up). I used to take meds daily even when not necessarily needed. Even tho my psychiatrist advised to take breaks, I felt it helpful in weekend social settings to be able to better pay attention to my friends in busy spaces for example. Then when I did try to take breaks, not only were they less effective because they were so far in between but they were MUCH harder to take. The effects of stopping even for a weekend become much more pronounced if you're not doing it every/every other weekend.\n\nSo my advice after rambling is to try to work that other aspect of making good habits and putting yourself in a position to really make use of the meds. You need to get something done? Make sure to remove distractions as best you can when you sit down to do it. Make sure you sit down to do it when/shortly after you take your meds. I've also realized if I'm doing something stupid or unproductive the meds may just help me accidentally lock in on that unimportant thing. And as far as dosage, less is more. Take those breaks, take the minimum you need and try to make it work and only when it absolutely is lacking do you try increasing.\n\nEDIT: Oh and make sure to get good sleep and hydrate. For real.",

I think what you do when that happens will determine whether or not you think you need more meds. If you continue to chase that high as your motivation, you're going to be dismayed with the results and may think you need more meds. And you can only go so much in that direction before you see serious problems.\n\n\nI think a lot of ADHD people think that the meds will just make them \"adult\" better. The reality is that being organized, focused, and motivated to do unfun shit is a problem EVERYONE has--it's just that we with untreated ADHD simply cannot do it.

            "body": "My psychiatrist prescribed me three different doses: 36 mg + 18 mg of Concerta and 10 mg of Medikinet. Instead of giving me a fixed schedule, he suggested I experiment and find the right dosage for my daily needs.\n\nAfter months of trial and error, I\u2019ve developed a system that works for me:\n\n- High-demand days (deep focus & challenging tasks) \u2192 36 mg Concerta (my ideal functional dose)\n\n- Lighter workdays \u2192 18 mg Concerta\n\n- Rest days (holidays, low-task days) \u2192 No meds, since I still feel residual effects from previous days\n\n\nI\u2019ve been mindful of tolerance buildup, so I try to cycle my doses instead of taking the same amount every day. For example, today I have a full day of shooting (I\u2019m a documentary filmmaker), so I took 36 mg + 10 mg Medikinet\u2014a higher dose than usual, but necessary for maintaining focus throughout the day.\n\nSince September, I\u2019ve been tracking everything using TickTick, a habit-tracking app. Reviewing my weekly patterns helps me understand how different doses affect me and prevents my medication from losing effectiveness.\n\nSo far, this approach has worked well for me. Has anyone else tried a similar method? How do you manage your ADHD meds to keep them effective over time?",

One specialist recently told me that if 70mg vyvanse is not working then nothing will and I might be misdiagnosed. Even after I suggested trying Ritalin type. Is it true that people without ADHD taking stimulants will notice no effects?",

I use it more like a targeted approach, like the meds are a giant missile and I need to \"aim\" it at the task, take it, and then go because once the missile \"launches\" its hard to redirect, so you gotta pick your target lol. If I don't have a pressing project to accomplish I don't use it. Slows the tolerance build up and allows the other systems for managing it that I have to function like the little bumper rails they are.",
