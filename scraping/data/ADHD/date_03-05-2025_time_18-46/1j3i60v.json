    "selftext": "Hello, hope you're well, so I've been taking Ritalin for a couple of weeks now, together with Escitalopram for OCD and Trazodone to sleep and it has been great, I've been able to be productive and enthusiastic for the first time ever in my life, but I started to notice heart palpitations specially at night so I went to the dr. she checked my blood pressure and it's pretty high at around 140, she ordered repeated tests and a electrocardiogram. But I'm worried, I would hate to have to give up Ritalin, since it's been so good for me, there's no other reason for me to have hbp, I've taken escitalopram for years and it never affected it, I'm not obese, don't smoke or drink, my diet isn't bad, so Ritalin seems to be the culprit, I took Atomoxetine before and it had the same side effect. Has Ritalin caused high blood pressure for you? If yes, how did you deal with it? Did you have to quit? Thank you!",
