For me, it\u2019s one thing to just remember to eat even though I\u2019m not hungry\u2014that\u2019s easy for me. But eating most food is physically revolting and eating more than small portions is physically really difficult too. Like my body rejects it as it\u2019s happening. As a result, now that I have to take my meds every day for grad school I\u2019m 5\u20196 but weigh 103lb which is 15 lbs under my normal weight. I\u2019ve been problem solving this for the past two decades and I still can\u2019t find a solution for managing my weight when I have to take me meds this often. at one point i was taking an antihistamine as a appetite stimulant and it worked but it also made it really difficult to wake up in the mornings (weird i know). I drink ensures to supplement, eat breakfast before my meds (but tbh it doesn\u2019t help cus my appetite doesn\u2019t kick in fast enough) and let my late night cravings do their thing. if anyone has ideas i\u2019d love to hear them \ud83d\ude15",
