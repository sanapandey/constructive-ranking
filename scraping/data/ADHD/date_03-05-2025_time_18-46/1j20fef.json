                            "body": "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8^ Listen to this folks!\n\nThis is one of those things where you don\u2019t realize how important it is until you try it out for a bit. The thoughts you have in these moments give you personal insights and momentum.\n\nPersonal experience for whoever feels like reading:\n\nI went through a really tough time recently, to the point that scrolling/tv couldn\u2019t distract me from the sadness and doing nothing felt worse. Because of that, I was able to put screens down for a couple days, and suddenly it\u2019s like I could think quietly and deeply introspectively. And I made realizations about myself, my habits, who I want to be, etc.\n\nEven after I got out of my sad funk, those thoughts are fueling me, and now I WANT to do things like stretch, read, exercise etc. All of which sounded incredibly dull before. I used to have to sit and scroll for a while after work, or had to be watching something while I ate food, or listen to a podcast while I fold clothes. I always felt like my mind was racing, and I had to add extra stimulation to boring tasks so that my mind had something to do. \n\nBut once I stopped doing those things, my mind doesn\u2019t race around as much, which has had at least 2 monumental benefits:\n\n1. I can focus on a line of thought and go really deep with it. Before I could only get as far as \u201cI should do XYZ thing because that\u2019s a productive thing to do\u201d and then my mind jumps elsewhere because that sounds lame and I never find the motivation to do it. Now, I think \u201cI want to have more of ABC quality. Doing what I\u2019ve been doing will not get me there. I want to do XYZ so that I can become more ABC\u201d. Now it\u2019s not just a \u201cproductive\u201d thing to do, it\u2019s something I WANT to do because I understand that I want ABC and that XYZ is how I get it.\n\n2. My mind not racing combined with some better habits has allowed me to be more in tune with my body. I\u2019ve been able to recognize all the different ways my bad habits make me worse off, which makes me more motivated to stop doing them.\n\nFor example, before I would stay up late thinking \u201cI don\u2019t care if I\u2019m tired tomorrow, I\u2019m pretty good at pushing through the tired feeling\u201d. I\u2019ve now realized that even though I can push through the work day to do what needs to get done, I have no energy to do the things I WANT to do after work, and then I end up with a bunch of energy at bedtime to do all the fun things and stay up late again. Now I know that if I go to bed on time, I have energy to do what I want throughout the whole day tomorrow, and then because I\u2019ve been doing things all day I\u2019m actually tired when it\u2019s bed time again.",

I think of it like this, when I was constantly scrolling, my mind was also constantly scrolling. So trying to have a deep thought was just overwhelming because my mind was scrolling to a million other related thoughts and I was like \u201cthis is just too much to address right now. NEXT.\u201d\n\nNow that I\u2019m not constantly throwing stimulation at my brain from all angles, it\u2019s not constantly reaching out at all angles looking for stimulation to catch. So instead of my mind scrolling to a million other things that end up overwhelming me, I can now follow a thought down a mostly focused line and come to some deeper conclusion.",

It\u2019s to learn to quiet the mind by focusing on one center of attention. This can be breathing to a count (count 5 in, 7 out) or it can be focusing on the breath (sound, or sensation (feeling the breath enter your nose, or the rise and fall of your chest and belly). \n       \nYour mind will wander when you meditate. This is okay, in fact, it\u2019s the point. You\u2019re learning to notice when your mind wanders from the desired center of attention. You also want to notice where your mind goes. This is called a mindful moment. Then after you\u2019ve noticed, you just gently bring it back to that center of attention; no judgment (like how you\u2019d treat a puppy or kitten you\u2019re trying to train). \n    \nThe logic behind mindfulness meditation is two fold. It\u2019s learning to recognize the moments our minds begin \u201cdoing their own thing.\u201d It\u2019s also learning how to gently guide ourselves back to the things we want to be doing. \n     \nIt may not work for you, and it almost certainly won\u2019t help immediately. But if you can get yourself to practice this at least 5 minutes daily, you might find it incredibly valuable like I have.\n    \nIf this does interest you, I\u2019d be happy to send you some YouTube guided meditations and/or a recommendation for an app I use. I\u2019m also always happy to talk about meditation and other mindfulness practices that I\u2019ve found helpful with my ADHD and subsequent depression and anxiety.",

Nicotine is a stimulant so has a similar effect.\n\n\nIf we're going back further, most people were farmers, so my guess is either they found ways to motivate themselves (hunger being a great extrinsic motivator) or they left and found other ways to spend their time: travelled/became bandits/died/etc...\n\n\nAlso, general peace and stability for most people are relatively new things. There's some evidence/speculation that people with ADHD thrive in chaotic environments. There's a lot of things many people don't think about/have to deal with anymore that would have been on the minds of most people throughout human history (mostly having enough food to eat and making sure your family is ready for the next growing season).\u00a0",

People in the past didn\u2019t really have the luxury of not eating because they got distracted, a lot of them were fully aware of the effects of hunger. Also, in a lot of eras, they didn\u2019t have very nutritional food around, you might have been surviving off of barley gruel or straight rice or potatoes with maybe some herbs you could scavenge if it\u2019s the right season and maybe a single bite of meat if you\u2019re really lucky, for weeks or months. Due to globalization, we live in a golden age of food, poor people can eat better than many kings would have throughout history. Easier to not be able to motivate yourself to eat when we\u2019re so nutritionally well off compared to most of human kind throughout history. \n\nI totally mean all this with no judgement or anything, I hope my tone wasn\u2019t rude, just wanted to chime in on the reasoning.",

I'm quite sure just like me it would have been worse. (I'm an unmarried woman and I noticed directly when living on my own I could not juggle all those balls; but having a housewife is not a thing anymore lol)\n\nThe women with ADHD I often wonder about. I guess just secret drinking/drugs. If you were not send to an assylum.. If you were from a rich family and a city you might have gotten away with \"being excentric\". But I am afraid morest average and thus poor people, especially women and POC, well they just ended up more dead and addicted...\n\nI often think; side thing: But I never even take in account they did not even have electricity... as someone with ADHD it must be hell to live in a part of the world that just has a lot of darkness in the winter in the past. You can't even read/write/do some hobby. Just wait with all your thoughts till it is light in 14 hours or so...I think I would have started to negative stim a lot.

But most people, common people, couldn\u2019t access books or even read or write throughout many eras of history. \n\nRemember, before the printing press in the 1500\u2019s, books had to be copied by hand. That\u2019s expensive. And someone would have had to take the time to teach you to read when you were a kid, could have been impossible if your parents couldn\u2019t or if they were too busy like farming and doing chores all day. There were a couple exceptions to the printing press problem, like in China in the 1100\u2019s (I think?), Song Dynasty I believe, and in Korea around that time, there was wooden, metal, and ceramic block printing, but it still would have been mostly reserved for the well off because commoners would have been less likely to be able to read. Women even less likely so, even in some higher class families women weren\u2019t educated (not just in China, worldwide). \n\nThey might have sewn, mended, told stories, sang, maybe whittled, cooked if they had food available, drank like you said, by the fire to keep entertained.\n\nEdit: correction, solid woodblock printing was invented around the 600\u2019s. Bi Sheng invented the movable type printing that the Gutenberg printing press would later resemble around 1040 using ceramic and wooden characters that could be fit into frames and then swapped around to create different print blocks",

The closest we come to that in modern times is being a first responder. Guess what careers a lot of ADHD people gravitate to?\n\nSubsistence; the only deadlines or schedules were the ones imposed by nature. None of us were being judged by society on how early we can start writing an essay. Instead our stomach judged us on whether we got the harvest in before the first frost.  A little more motivating. \n\nMusic; one of the reasons rhythm exists in songs is that we used it to get work done in groups. A circle of villagers pounding grain into flour to the beat. A fishing party singing as they go. If you've ever been in marching band you may be familiar with this feeling. Many of us love to clean or cook with music playing; this is one reason why. \n\nAdrenaline; then as now, we tended to work best under pressure. The tribe would sometimes let our everyday \"laziness\" slide as long as we were someone that could be looked to for guidance and quick thinking in an emergency. Also related to \"survival.\" People who didn't quite fit in, and who weren't just abandoned or killed by the group, may become leaders, healers, or priests. This is also an explanation that is often offered for trans people throughout human history; some native tribes in the US, for instance, considered shamans to be genderless or a third gender.",

Kind of by being hyperfixated on all the farm tasks, he ended up saving the farm and putting the family on a good path.\n\n\nIt's probably like that throughout history.
