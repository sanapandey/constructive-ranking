    "selftext": "man oh man I've been STRESSING about the upcoming stoichiometry test in chemistry. Literally dreading it, I would rather die than get the grade in. But instead of internally panicking and avoiding the whole thing as I usually do I actually sat down, watched some videos, and used the notes my friend gave me and IT'S FINALLY CLICKING\n\nADHD may suck but it's pretty awesome when every little win feels like I won a marathon. It makes me a whole lot happier when me and my brain actually cooperate for once :)",
