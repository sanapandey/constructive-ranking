    "selftext": "I'm doing freelance work, which means that I have no strict division of time - I can work anytime, and choose not to work anytime as well. Sometimes projects require more work, sometimes less. What I'm observing is that when I have a phase (several days in a row lets say) of being productive, I work or think about work pretty much all the time. There's always something to be done, so upon waking up the first thing I do is to do it. In this phases I find little to no rest, and I have an ongoing overwhelming  feeling of urgency that I also feel physically, as if my body is working faster than usual. \n\nIn the other phases, I wake up without any energy, find it hard to get out of bed and can sleep pretty much throughout the whole day. In these phases I often feel like I'm incapable of doing much, and I let my house get messy, which then my mind gets messy. The way I have to get out of this, which works only sometimes, is to exercise, which I find hard to stay on track with. \n\nI'm a woman and have PCOS on top of that, so I've accepted that my mood and energy levels will shifts due to my hormones even more than for non-PCOS women. But I'd love to hear you thoughts - if you feel similarly, how to you find the balance between the two ends; how do you manage to rest in times of hyperfocus and overwhelm, and how do you find motivation in times of low energy.",
