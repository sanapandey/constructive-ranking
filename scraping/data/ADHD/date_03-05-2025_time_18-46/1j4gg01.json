Freaking Bonkers I know but here is the tip:\n\nJust because YOU would want to know, doesn\u2019t mean others want the information.\n\nCustomers apparently prefer to sign $10k contracts without knowing all the details. In fact, you asking for clarity is just silly. You aren\u2019t being thorough. You aren\u2019t ensuring they know what they are signing. They legitimately don\u2019t want to know more. \n\nI\u2019m typing this and I do not understand. \n\nThere is a finite amount of questions you can ask\u2026. Apparently\u2026  I do not understand \n \nThat said, if something goes wrong and you didn\u2019t ask the questions you WILL get shit about it, you will hear from your boss, and it will be your fault\u2026 because\u2026 reasons?
