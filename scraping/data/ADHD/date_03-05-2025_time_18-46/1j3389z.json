    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD about 6 months ago, and in the past 5 months, I\u2019ve tried three different medications: Vyvanse (30mg), dextroamphetamine (5 mg and 10mg), and now Ritalin IR (5mg and 10mg). So far, none of them have worked the way I hoped.\n\n30mg Vyvanse gave me some anxiety but not much improvement. 5 mg Dextroamphetamine gave me no benefit at all and 10mh made my anxiety worse, and currently with Ritalin IR. It just seems to make me feel anxious, sometimes like I\u2019m doing things on autopilot, but with no noticeable boost in focus, memory, or attention. I\u2019ve tried adjusting doses, testing lower and higher amounts, and tracking how I feel, but nothing seems to be \u201cclicking\u201d like I expected. I am still on day3 of 10 mg ritalin since 5 mg didn't do anything.\n\nNow, I\u2019m getting paranoid that maybe I was wrong about having ADHD. I mean, I did get diagnosed, but I keep second-guessing it because the meds don\u2019t seem to be helping much. What if I just convinced myself I had it? Or what if my struggles are from something else?\n\nAt the same time, my lack of focus, slow processing speed, and trouble keeping up with college and jobs have been major struggles for years. I really want meds to work because I feel like I need them to get my life on track, but now I\u2019m stuck wondering if I should keep trying different meds or if I\u2019m just one of those people where nothing works.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Did it take you multiple trials to find the right medication, or did you ever question if your diagnosis was even correct? Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated.\n",

            "body": "You mentioned multiple times that anxiety is an issue especially when trying the medications, have you tried a non-stimulant such as strattera? For some people they treat ADHD symptoms and anxiety simultaneously. With the other medications you only describe having taken quite low doses. I\u2019m on vyvanse and it\u2019s great but the effect was very very minimal until i hit 40mg, and I still think i need to increase a couple of times to be happy with its effect. It\u2019s possible you didn\u2019t try them for long enough/at a high enough dosage?",

The first medication I tried was strattera and it did absolutely nothing (though it might be different for you) and vyvanse for me as helped but I still feel I need much more help, so I also feel the fear of the medication not working out, keep in mind that there are so so many options and eventually you will find what works for you :)",

Honestly, I\u2019d be willing to be most people had a rocky start with meds, so don\u2019t take this as a sign that you\u2019ve been misdiagnosed.\n\nI started on Adderall and had the exact same thoughts you\u2019re having now, wondering when it was going to help the way people said it would. I switched to Concerta next, which was better, and then finally Vyvanse, which has worked the best for me.\n\nFunny enough, when I first started Vyvanse, it was absolutely dreadful with some pretty rough side effects. But after about a week, it started working great lol. I did end up slightly increasing my dose and eventually found a good spot with it.\n\nBottom line: Everyone\u2019s different. What works for one person might be completely ineffective for another. Trial and error is a pretty normal part of this journey, even though It can be a bit of a pain in the ass. Also, it can take some time for your body and mind to adjust before you really start feeling the benefits.",
