I need like a deadline or something but even then I still procrastinate or like you do a heap of different tasks. I hate the frozen state cause no matter how much you tell yourself in your head \u201cget up\u201d \u201cdo it\u201d you\u2019re still frozen and do nothing cause there\u2019s too much to do",
