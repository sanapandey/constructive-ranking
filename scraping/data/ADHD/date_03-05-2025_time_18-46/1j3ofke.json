My whole job is on the computer, for reference. \n\nI don\u2019t have many adhd-related symptoms but this stood out to me as something this community may be able to give me guidance on.\n\nI\u2019ve only done this for 4-5 hours at work before. Never this long. And my workload does not require this amount of focus or sacrifice. I\u2019m way ahead on all my work already. \n\nCan anyone help explain this phenomenon? And does anyone have any advice for me on being better at taking breaks? I\u2019m new to working full time and know that this won\u2019t be good for me in the long run. I have a bad back and am currently suffering the consequences of not moving all day. ",

            "body": "I suggest setting up an alarm. When I used to work at a department store nobody wanted to take their breaks on time during freight days. We were understaffed and wanted to get the work done today so tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be so nightmarish while we still had a flow going.\n\nof course, management didn\u2019t like that and started manually hunting us down to take our mandatory lunch break before our 5th hour (the maximum amount of time we could work in our state without a lunch break or else the company gets in trouble). Management acted as our alarm, forcing us to take our lunch before heading back.\n\nwhen you take your lunch eat somewhere separate from work. I also had another person who made management angry by trying to work through their lunch\u2026 which went against the contract they signed when they were hired (standard agreement of \u201cI will not work while clocked out\u201d). You want to separate yourself from even the temptation of work just to give yourself a cooldown during lunch. \n\nalso, if your work gives you small paid breaks (my state is mandated to do so) maybe do some small exercises for your back to make sure your muscles don\u2019t get too stiff.",

I\u2019ll try to take lunch halfway through the day at the same time every day and will start using my timer more. Thanks again.",
