    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been on and off stimulant medications for years , Dexedrine got me through college and helped me change my life when before I was in shambles .\n\nI took a break from it for a while and have been on and off through the years . Lately I\u2019ve been feeling stuck , I\u2019m trying my best in all areas but I still feel like I can\u2019t quite break through and accomplish my goals . \nMy new doctor will not prescribe me Dexedrine and will only let me have adderall .\nHowever although adderall feels great for the first few days, eventually I start to feel strung out like I don\u2019t sleep properly and then I need the adderall for energy. I don\u2019t remember it being like that on dex\u2026. So I tried it for 3 days and decided to take a break . The following three days were rough \u2026 I felt super anxious and down on myself and tired . Do I just need to push through with it ? Will it get better if I take it every day ? I know this sounds dumb but I\u2019m worried that if it felt like that after three days I will feel worse after longer . I\u2019m think of trying an online doctor to get dex, I\u2019m frustrated . ",
