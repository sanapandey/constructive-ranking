I have a potential anxiety disorder and dysthymia diagnosis. Does anybody have any insight to anxiety disorder versus ADHD? Also playing into consideration the persistent depressive disorder. I have a lot to process and a lot to think about, but I wanted to come here and seek any sort of information/articles/advice anyone has!",

            "body": "I have both, and basically the way my dr explain it to me was that they are both a trigger for each other, which can make each of them hard to deal with when you\u2019re under a lot of stress. For me at least, when I am under a lot of stress my ADHD makes it hard for me to do tasks, which causes my anxiety to heighten thinking about all of the stuff I am behind on and deadlines approaching. \n\nI do think being medicated has substantially decreased my anxiety for this reason. I have an easier time completing tasks, which in turn decreases my anxiety about not getting enough done. I also have a bad habit of letting my anxiety run my brain into the worst possible scenarios, and my ADHD stimulant helps ease these anxious thoughts and allows me to think a bit more rationally. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what the link is between the two, because I am still on the journey of learning how to cope with both. Hoping the insight can help even a little! Best of luck!",

Sometimes when people go on ADHD meds their anxiety goes away because they can focus, but mine didn\u2019t unfortunately lol",
