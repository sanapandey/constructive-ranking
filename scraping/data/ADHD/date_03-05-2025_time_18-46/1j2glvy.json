            "body": "Lowkey one of the only downsides of vyvanse for me was how it negatively impacted working out and playing sports. I was on 50mg, so your experience may differ. \n\nMy mouth would become so dry as to actually become an issue, and no amount of washing water around wld help as it wld be dry again 30 seconds later. Chewing gum only slightly helped with that. Think this\u2019ll be even more of a problem for you considering the heat you\u2019re playing in. \n\nI\u2019d also exert myself noticeably more on vyvanse compared to off it, with my heart rate on it consistently climbing 10-20 bpm higher when exercising at a certain set level of intensity. This had a negative effect on my cardio, and even on heavy compound lifts in the gym. I do boxing, and the warmups/warmdowns were hell on vyvanse - it\u2019s not the kind of environment where I cld say \u2018it\u2019s my meds\u2019 when I gassed out 2 mins in lol. Part of this effect cld be bc I was more \u2018locked in\u2019, meaning I pushed myself more without realising it. Either way, keep an eye on how hard you\u2019re pushing your body.\n\nAlso, vyvanse demolished my appetite, meaning I just wldnt eat lunch and work out on an empty stomach / with low blood sugar sometimes. This naturally felt horrible, so I started to make sure to have protein shakes for lunch before workouts - this mostly solved that problem and so I recommend you do the same. Also, protein rich breakfasts are essential. \n\nBest of luck mate",

I would take it at 8 am and by to 5 pm I would get hungry, sore head and really tired. Now this happens at 2 to 3 pm and I feel as if my stimming methods are coming back a little more.\n\nAt first my stimming and anxiety totally left but they are creeping in more now. Anxiety or rumination is very mild though now compared to none during the first week.",
