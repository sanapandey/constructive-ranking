    "selftext": "My (47F) inner voice has never been quite for even a second my whole life.  I remember as a child laying in bed trying to see if I could stop it, but never once did.  I always felt like my heart would stop beating if I stopped \"thinking\". I would say my inner voice has 3 channels with most of them going constantly: 1) music, 2) monkey brain (e.g. daydreaming, conversations with people etc), 3) narration of what I am doing. I got diagnosed 2 years ago with ADHD. Meds have slowed the rate at which it speaks. The monkey brain channel has chilled and maybe has even stopped occasionally. Music is still almost always there, but the volume is lower.  And I still narrate what is going on constantly.  When I try to quite the voice the closest I get is it saying \"Are we thinking now? I think we stopped thinking! Wait a minute...this sounds like thinking\"\n\nI do mindful meditation focusing on my breath. And it helps my brain for sure, but the monologue persist.  But even while I feel focused on my breath, I still have a narration going in the background saying, \"look we are focusing on our breath!, wait does it count if this narration is going on.  I should refocus on my breath, but how do I refocus on my breath if I am already focused on my breath???\"\n\nReading is probably the closest I get to not having a voice in my head.  I definitely hear the words I am reading in my head.   I am occupying the inner voice with another task then processing my thoughts.  I also found reading to me very good for my mental health.\n\nAnyway, I am curious of other struggles.  I know many of us have loud brains!\n\n  \nEdit:  I can't visualize in my head.  That is a bit of bummer, but if I could I wonder if it would lead to more channels to tame??",

My experience, having practiced meditation quite extensively, is that it can be quite difficult to stop the constant chatter entirely.\n\nInstead of wanting the chatter to end, see if you could find a \"volume dial\" for it. Then try turning the knob to make the chatter just a tiny bit quieter.",
