    "selftext": "I have been writing with the same pen since primary school and I am now in grade 12. My handwriting doesnt differ from neat to ugly, I just literally have about six different ones. My workbooks look like a bunch of people have been working on them together and this frustrates me so much since I struggle to study when my handwriting cant stay consistent, no matter what i do. My adhd medication does not change this handwriting issue at all which i think is also strange. Why is this?",
