    "selftext": "Replying to messages always stresses me out, like, I\u2019ll overthink every word, feel guilty for not responding sooner, and then dread having to explain why it took so long. On top of that, the constant flood of notifications feels impossible to keep up with, and it\u2019s so easy to get overwhelmed or distracted. Sometimes I just need to disconnect for a bit, but then the guilt creeps in, and it feels like I\u2019m making things worse by delaying.\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this? I\u2019ve been wondering if there\u2019s an app or a system for sorting notifications that actually helps make this whole process less overwhelming. How do you all handle it? Any tips, tools, or hacks that work for managing replies and staying on top of messages without it feeling like a huge mental load? Would love to hear what\u2019s helped you!\n\n",
