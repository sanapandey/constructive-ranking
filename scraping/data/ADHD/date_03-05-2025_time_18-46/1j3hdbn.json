    "selftext": "It's been almost 1 year since I stopped all medications. I would switch between \\~50 mg modafinil and 1/4 of the smallest dosage of adzensys. I would not take these together. Sometimes, I'd take modafinil for a while; then I'd stop and try Adzensys. \n\nCons:  \nComing off the medication has been tough. There are times when I'm fine, but other times when I feel lost, helpless, and despairing.   \ni sometimes feel less engaged, enthusiastic, and productive with my work. But that's probably natural.   \nThe worst part has been the fatigue, loss of interest, and low mood. I don't feel less creative, per say, but I do feel less dynamic in thought, if that makes sense.   \nThen again, maybe coming off has made me realize I don't like my job that much? \n\nPros:  \nI feel like myself again. I'm still anxious but not the way i was when medicated. My relationships with clients and others are a lot better and deeper.  It feels good not to speed everyday. I'm less tangential and can better distill complex topics to a simple point, which is a drastic improvement in communication. But I do struggle quite often. To the point where I've considered taking a low dosage again. I of course will talk to my doctor, but i'm wondering if anyone could share their experience and what's helped them. ",
