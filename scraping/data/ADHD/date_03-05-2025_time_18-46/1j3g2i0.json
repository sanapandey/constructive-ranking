And still, today, cloudy, rainy today. I am feeling like avsolute trash.   \n\nI mean, I have a mild. Yet steady headache that has lasted throughout the day. I have drank 1-1.5L of water and had trouble sleeping due to background noises last night.   \n\nI have had this since forever.  \n\nCan anyone relate in this sub?  \nWhat do you do on days like this when work is still a thing?",
