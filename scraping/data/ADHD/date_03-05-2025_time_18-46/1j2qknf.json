You could try self-medicating with caffeine, but it can be tricky to find the right amount and the tolerance builds pretty quick.\n\nIs it possible to try different pharmacies? I know here in the US there's been an Adderall shortage for *years*, but my partner hasn't had any issues getting hers while pharmacies 10 miles down the road rarely have it.",
