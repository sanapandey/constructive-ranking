    "selftext": "25F, struggling with basic living tasks. My room is a mess, I\u2019m behind on many assignments, and yet I just can\u2019t get it together. The overwhelm of it all just leaves me paralyzed. I\u2019ve been trying to get on meds for the past year, but all the places that are free have a year long wait just to book the initial appointment. \n\nMy friend has been kind enough to give me a week\u2019s worth of Vyvanse monthly for the past 3 months and it\u2019s incredible but due to the inconsistency I end up right where I started pretty quickly.\n\n I\u2019m also sad thinking about how my younger self probably wouldn\u2019t have developed the mental health issues I have today due to the severity of my ADHD if it had just been treated. I always struggled in school and idk why no one questioned it lol. Anyway, nothing can be done about that now. \n\nI just constantly scroll as it\u2019s low effort and I can avoid everything but I really just want to enjoy life. I can feel it passing me by. \n\nSo guess a question I have is how to keep it together until I can get medicated?\n\nThanks ",

The lack of color makes mindless scrolling feel like it is, boring and tedious, somehow not having colors takes away the hypnosis effect it has.\n\nWhen you get dressed, put shoes on.\n\nGet a white board or at least a big board to write the things you are working on, need to get done on. And put it in a place you can't avoid seeing it. \n\nStart your day, by journaling. Writing down how your perfect day would go. And finish by writing down three things you are grateful for.",
