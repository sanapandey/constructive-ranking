    "selftext": "Ever since I started taking ADHD meds 2 years ago, any long acting stimulant, no matter the dosage lasts me 6 to 7 hours.\n\nMy new doctor wants to increase the dosage even though I told them that it literally just makes the meds \"stronger\" for me which isn't necessarily a good thing.\n\nThey've given me the max dose of Adderall but at most it extended the duration by an hour. I'm now on Vynanse which is surprisingly more effective at managing my ADHD symptoms, but I can feel it wear off after 7 hours. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person in the world whose metabolism is so high that long acting stimulants only last me half the expected duration.",

            "body": "I develop tolerances to drugs very very rapidly, and my meds were no exception to that rule. Also, from my understanding about amphetamines, the effect that helps our executive function is triggered by the deltas (changes) of the amount of the drug in our blood. Even if the drug is releasing over the course of several hours, it's that first \"kick\" that drives the effects. So as the substance leaves the body more rapidly than it accumulates, the effects wear off because the blood levels are no longer increasing.\n\nVyvanse is interesting because the \"kick\" is delayed 30-60 minutes because it needs to be metabolized first. So having the lisdexamfetamine \"last\" 7 hours vs the typical 6-7 hours for you is to be expected unfortunately.\n\nThe solution my psych and I had was to use instant releases as needed but in smaller doses.\n\nWorked for me. And then I didn't have to stop taking it during the weekends where I was effectively trapped in a vicious addiction cycle of withdrawing and using lol",

            "body": "That depends what you mean by \"good for\". Vyvanse is still useful to me about 24 hours after I take it.\n\nBut I can first feel it \"wearing off\" after about 6-7 hours. I take 50mg at 7am, by 1-2pm I can feel it starting to be less effective. So on most days I take another 30mg between 1-4pm.\n\nIf I don't take the second dose, the first dose still helps me until the early hours of the morning. For example if I wake up at 2am I can still quiet my mind, if I wake up much after 4am, my thoughts are back to racing. But with one dose, at 7am the next morning the remaining Vyvanse in my system does help me with things like cleaning my teeth and washing.",

It's a legitimate way my brother has been told to reduce his dose in order to take it later in the day, but you could definitely use this to spread out a dose.",
