    "selftext": "Hi so Ive always been taking ADHD pills but the side affects really are bad and affective on me. How do you deal with them?? I suffer these horrible, horrible side affects for years now. I only take pills when I have tests, importent events, job interviews, etc. But the side affects drive me crazy, and my physical health really goes down and it's getting dangerous. I'm on Ritalin, I've been on other pills when I was little but they also affected me really badly. Here's some of the side affects I suffer from each time I take my pills: headache, stomach ache, toothache, fast heartbeat, vomiting, dizzy, sleepy, angry, depressed, exhaustion, mood swings, lack of hunger, dry mouth, muscle ache, etc. And I really NEED those pills because I can't focus, and my motivation is seriously not existed without those pills. I actually get things done when I take them, I actually focus, and I can't do that without those fucking pills. What the hell do I do???? I'm actually so upset and tired of this   ",

Cuz a lot of those are normal for stimulants, especially fast heartbeat, lack of hunger, and dry mouth.\n\nDrink plenty of water, eat before you take your meds, make sure you eat on a schedule and don\u2019t miss it\u2026things like that. Also, you might want to lower your dose. What\u2019s your current dose?",
