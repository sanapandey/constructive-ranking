    "selftext": "I (31M) have a history of not being able to hold down a job. For the record, I\u2019m going through the ADHD diagnosis process now, but definitely also grappling with depression and anxiety. Therapist was asking a battery of questions to see if ADHD was at play, and described me to a T. Working on scheduling a date to go through testing to confirm. \n\nI haven\u2019t been able to hold down a job. Out of undergrad, I bounced around between a few positions that I wasn\u2019t really interested in. Then I got deployed, came home, went back to school, got my MBA (thanks, GI Bill). I got a great position in a marketing role, with a company I really liked. Fast forward 9 months, and I just got notice I\u2019m being separated. \n\nI feel like an utter failure. We\u2019ve got an infant at home, and I feel like this last year has been the worst year of our marriage. I feel like I routinely let my wife down with my inability to follow through on anything. \n\nHow do y\u2019all do it? Im struggling to figure out how I can fight the constant forgetfulness, missed deadlines or un-responded to emails, or ability to focus on the \u201cboring\u201d tasks. ",

Then I read it when I'm ready but it doesn't get lost. It stays in the list until I mark it as complete.\n\nThey also go red when they're overdue so you've got a quick idea of how on top of it you are...\n\nI hope this helps a bit, good luck with getting the diagnosis (medication might also REALLY help with focus etc)",

And usually take a month or two in between my end and start dates for personal time to reset. \n\nSilver lining, when you bounce around like that, you can tell your prospective new employer when they get into salary discussions that you made/make $15-20k more at your previous job and need to stay in that range, and they\u2019ll usually accommodate that in your starting salary. One stint, I had three jobs in three years and went from making $50k year one to $130k by year three just by lying about my previous salary each time, pretty much stayed in the same field too. \n\nWhat feels like a failure right now can turn into something great, just keep your focus on finding something new ASAP rather than ruminating in the loss.",

I check work emails first thing in the morning, around noon, and at the end of my day same for cases (internal communication for customer accounts). Once I'm home I'm all wife and kids. I nearly lost my job 2 years ago and getting on medication helped me a ton and had put me on track for a leadership role in a company that was a hair's width from firing me. There's hope man",

            "body": "You need an external short term memory. I will give an example I do for the most basic things. I can't keep track of time. I am not aware and I don't have a sense time. I use alarms every hour to make me aware time is passing. And reminder alarms to for work related events. I have smart watch I use it everyday so I will definitely see every reminder.\n\nPost-its everywhere, different colors. Writing for every task to remind me of my deadlines and even for eating/showering in a journal. (online notes are not working)Also I told everyone to remind me if they did not see any feedback or response from me to X date, cause I am busy and have a lot things to think about and I would like them remind me if they need anything like their version of to-do list for me to write down.\n\nBeing efficient and fast cause I can't work for hours so had to do I a 3 hour job in 30 minutes and relax and do easier mindless task or just take a break. Most of  time those 30 minutes deep work is enough to complete tasks or even pieces of bigger projects.\n\nAlso side stimulation, like watching or listening something while working to fill out your empty focus slots a distraction so you can work better.\n\nI also do stretching or yoga like exercises as way to relax (non repeating ones)\n\nIt feels childish and immature to use notes, alarms, side videos or walking in corridors for a decent working adult but I do way more work than I could imagine this way and it is how I do it. Even non ADHD people use drugs, cigarettes, overeating, drinking just to cope with daily life. So few postits and alarms is not that bad at all.",
