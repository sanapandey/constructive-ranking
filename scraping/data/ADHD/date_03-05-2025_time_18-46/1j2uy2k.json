    "selftext": "It feels like these pieces of advice are lost on me because I am hard wired to think about it. I will hyper fixate on the one negative thing, no matter how much I or others try to convince myself not to. In fact, the more I try to fight it, the more I fix in on it because I\u2019m drawing attention to it too. Also, why are my emotions so defunct that it takes something super small to throw me over the edge? Even the smallest criticisms or triggers can feel like gut punches. And don\u2019t even get me started on what happens when I have enough caffeine that day; it\u2019s just a guaranteed panic attack. And no matter what I do to distract myself, whatever self love or self care I practice, whatever breathing or grounding exercises I do, I can\u2019t stop: once I\u2019m on the road to a panic attack, there\u2019s no veering off. Not to mention they happen at the worst times like when I\u2019m driving and unable to stop or when I\u2019m at school trying to teach preteens. And here I was taking a break to get my mental health back in order, only to end it with my mental health taking a sudden nosedive despite all my effort ",
