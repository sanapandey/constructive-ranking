I don\u2019t know how to move forward in life despite all this. I\u2019m in the lowest of the lowest pint in my life and I want to unalive myself. I don\u2019t see a reason why I wouldn\u2019t make a wrong decision again. All the decisions I took turned out to be a mistake and just staying put would\u2019ve made my life heaven. What am I doing here in the world",

The point is to learn from your mistakes. \n\nWe all make mistakes. The real lessons you need to learn hurt the most. There is no point in wallowing in self pity and there's plenty of time to be dead later.",
