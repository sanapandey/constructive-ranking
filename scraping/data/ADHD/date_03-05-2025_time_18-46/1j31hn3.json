    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nI am prescribed  adderall 30mg. I generally take anywhere from a quarter to half at noon after my morning coffee.\n\nI\u2019m Muslim and I am fasting during Ramadan. I have been struggling with my workload and grogginess during the day. Technically you can take your medicine if it\u2019s needed for your health, but I don\u2019t take it everyday and don\u2019t see a reason to be breaking my fast every day to take my dose.\n\n I\u2019d like to take be able to take my medicine during sahoor( the time before the fast begins) which is around 5/6 am. I don\u2019t want it to hit me immediately and have myself up all morning. I\u2019d like for it to work through my system and start releasing the medicine around 9/10am. Is this possible or am I crazy?!l",

Anyway the point is call your doctor and call your cvs and ask what the cost is for a visit/prescription refill without insurance \"cash in hand\" or \"out of pocket\".    Tell them you don't have insurance and ask if they have plan or discount related, check out those online discount coupons.    It's weird, but medicine and care was cheaper for me without insurance than when I was paying for insurance.   Can't explain and thinking about it makes me mad.",

Or half before and half after? \n\nWhen I was out of my xr for a while I broke my IR up over the course of the day and that helped. \n\nBut if taking anything after sahoor isn\u2019t an option i just read that high fat meals can slow the metabolism of adderall. Big fatty breakfast?",

IR meds are designed to be absorbed in the stomach and you could irritate the small intestine. It's possible that this works fine, but keep an eye out for if anything gets wacky. \n\nYou can hide the pill in this little nougat you invented if you want, but that part won't change anything.",
