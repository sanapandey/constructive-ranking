    "selftext": "Preface:\nTPN = Task Positive Network. It\u2019s the more focused, dialed in network of the brain. Flow state, positivity, etc..\n\nDMN = Default Mode Network. It\u2019s where rumination, spacing, imagination, overthinking or just thinking, feeling heady or out of body, anxiety, negativity, etc\u2026 is typically present in adhd people who don\u2019t have tasks to work on or perform.\n\nIn ADHD people, both are typically active at the same time and that is why we can get distracted, off task, break flow, and pulled into DMN, etc.. \nIf you need more information on the 2, ADHD 2.0 is a wonderful resource. I recommend audiobook version at 1.25x speed.\n\nNow my question:\nI will frequently be playing a game, music, or sports and I can warm up prior, that will usually lock me into TPN. However, because the Default Mode Network is also active. I can be pulled out of TPN at a slightest inconvenience, mistake, someone talking in a backswing in golf, my own thoughts, someone breaking my focus when I\u2019m doing something, etc.. the way to get back into this is obviously: \u201cPerform a task!\u201d Even focusing on breathing in a specific sequence, moving, dancing, etc..\n\nThis does help in normal situations and I swear it\u2019s a godsend. But it\u2019s not the best in sports situations, group activities, etc.. when the mistakes can continue to compile quickly while you\u2019re out of sync and you can\u2019t brute force yourself into a better game. Tips on quickly turning the TPN at least on? Or is it truly training a shorter recognize and perform a task pattern.\n\nTLDR: how to get back into focused state when it\u2019s broken during sports, etc..",
