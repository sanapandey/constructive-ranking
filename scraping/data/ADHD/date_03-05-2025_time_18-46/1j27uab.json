    "selftext": "Hi all. I've highly suspected I have ADHD for a long time now and I'm really struggling in a few things within my space. I live with roommates - for context.. My roommates are clean and overall it's an okay situation. I'm able to keep shared spaces clean (mostly out of fear of my outward messiness), but I walk into my room and it is ALWAYS a mess. I don't remember the last time I swept/mopped because the floor has always had clothes, or something around.\n\nI think I would benefit a lot if my room was somewhat nice to look at and also made it easy for me to live and organize. Does anyone have a room/space that is aesthetically pleasing and works well with ADHD? Do yall have any tips on how to keep it that way? Do y'all have any tips to keep stuff off of the floor with a system that actually works? This is kind of a ramble but I'm just, so tired. ",
