It had NO effect on me at all and the doctors kept upping the dose instead of changing molecules as I got worse. It took literal begging and suicidal threats before they understood I was in a bad way and Risperidone was not doing it for me.\n\nNow we know it\u2019s ADHD, there\u2019s no mention of Risperidone. I\u2019m on Ritalin. \n\nIf I were you I would clearly ask my prescriber what they\u2019re prescribing Risperidone for and what effect they expect it to have on you !",

But if without the Risperidone things are getting out of hand, then maybe taking it will help, at least for the month. Is there no way you can ask your GP at least ? Or the doctor who did the prescribing ?\n\nI\u2019m not a psychiatrist I only speak out of my own experience so what I say should be taken with a pinch of salt\u2026",
