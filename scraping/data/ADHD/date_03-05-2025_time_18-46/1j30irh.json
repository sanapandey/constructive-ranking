    "selftext": "Anyone ever get issues with their eyes when taking stimulants ? Usually it\u2019s one eye for me and it gets dry, waters up, or feels like pressure is behind it. Doesn\u2019t always happen, but often enough that it makes me want to stop taking my meds. It\u2019s happened on adderall , vyvanse and I think Ritalin gave me the same issues, but that one was a long time ago. It\u2019s annoying , painful and consistent enough that I think about stopping them or I think I have something else going on I need looked at. ",
