    "selftext": "After the diagnosis which was recent, I found out I always had ADHD. Some how I had some coping mechanisms(that I developed unconsciously)that I used to deal with ADHD related problems when I was young. For an example: I was able to perform well in my school, because I had my mother with me who always had a way to keep me going even if it meant forcing me. 3 years ago, I lost those mechanisms( a part of it is not having my mom telling me what to do in each step), and my life since is only getting worse, my performance in college is so bad. I am always escaping and living in an unconscious place of my mind. I am on strattera and some meds for anxiety, bec my anxiety is so bad. My bad performance in college( I am medical student) is the biggest reason I am miserable. I do think if that part is fixed, I would be better, evem in the other aspects. The problem is that I am drained of every bit of hope.",

Find new ways to be held accountable. Body doubling sounds like it would work for you - find someone else in the same situation (there\u2019s loads of us)z",
