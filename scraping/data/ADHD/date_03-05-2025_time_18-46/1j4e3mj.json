    "selftext": "Yea as the tiltle says, this is very frustrating. I like to do art, but I can not get myself to do it , unless I stream it , or I know it will get a lot of likes. And no I cant just fcking ignore that, otherwise I will just sit there and play video games all day and that's it. Like and if my posts are not getting enough likes, I am completely depressed and even think about offing myself and no I am not exaggerating, I would 100% do it if there was a gun nearby in those moments. So idk what to do, what am I supposed to do about this? Doesn't help that my brain has now completely turned arround and is refusing to post and draw anything because \"people aren't making me feel like they value it enough and so they won't get the privilege of seeing my art at all.\" So now I am just not posting anything because I know I will get extremly angry again.",
