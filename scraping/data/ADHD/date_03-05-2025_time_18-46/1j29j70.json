    "selftext": "Hi!(and Salam)how are you guys finding Ramadan? For me it\u2019s a bit difficult so far. My meds wear off by 1/2pm but I\u2019m a college student so i still have essentially a whole days of work to do still by that time. I\u2019m trying to work out too either in the morning when my meds are still active and I don\u2019t feel fatigue (my natural state now post covid) or a bit before Iftar when it\u2019s almost time to eat anyways so I can handle some fatigue. The issue is though, when I eat Iftar, I\u2019m not very hungry even though my body still is. So I just end up feeling tired still. How are you guys managing?\n\n(Not sure if needed but I\u2019m on Tyvense40mg)\nI will say though, alhamdulillah I\u2019ve noticed my brain is more calm when I\u2019m in a fasted state and there\u2019s not as much brain fog.",

I have an exam this week so the days i really need it i\u2019m not going to fast which i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right but ive heard some people saying to pay fidya. i\u2019ll definitely do that as well as limiting taking them this month but especially for this week with my exam ill have to take them normally.",
