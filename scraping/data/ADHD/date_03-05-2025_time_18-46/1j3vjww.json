Avoidance or not convinced your symptoms are problematic enough to be ADHD?\n\nThe direct answer that would be beneficial to you would be: We don't know. Since it's bothered you enough to post this post, a single psychiatrist consultation may either rule out ADHD or diagnose it and change your life. I see no downside.",
