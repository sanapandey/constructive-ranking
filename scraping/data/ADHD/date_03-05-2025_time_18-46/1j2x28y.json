With the anger being directed at people is always much more problematic as me smashing a box to pieces at work just makes me look crazy.  smashing a coworker to pieces.

Try to be as non-reactive as possible and go take 5 minutes to yourself.  Mindfulness is huge as far as being aware of how you\u2019re feeling and not fighting against how you\u2019re feeling (like telling yourself you\u2019re not mad and everything is fine).  If you start to, or do escalate and get mad, just say (or don\u2019t, whatever is easier/seems less likely to escalate things further) that you need take a break, or need 5 minutes, or that you\u2019ll be right back, whatever feels right.  \n\nI remember I used to get so mad as a kid and sort of hyperfocus/perseverate on it and I felt like I was going to stay mad forever and it really did take me an extra long time to calm down.  Acknowledging it with mindfulness is a big part of it not taking you by storm.  Part of you is mad, you are feeling the pose feelings, but it doesn\u2019t have to control you, define you, you exist outside of it, it\u2019s just an aspect of you.  That\u2019s mindfulness.  Meditation/Mindful meditation is another thing that I\u2019ve done a little bit of and it can definitely help (I need to do more of it).  Hope that helps!",

I would say that this is not a strong signal of ADHD if other symptoms aren\u2019t present.  There are plenty of things that can drive anger.  Really, ADHD does not make people perpetually angry, it just affects how it feels to experience that anger the odd time that it comes out.  Again, ADHD rage is always targeted as some person or thing for a (perceptibly) real reason - it is never sudden and ambiguous.\n\nThe other, more obvious stuff is indicative of the root cause behind this anger, that being impulse control.  If you feel like impulse control means \u201cnot letting the feeling well up in the first place\u201d, then to me, that\u2019s a very clear sign that this isn\u2019t it.  You\u2019ll have to check over other ADHD symptoms to know more\u2026 try a cheesy online test if you want to wait before asking a doctor!

My depression went away, what was left was was pure rage. I was so angry. After many years of therapy, and groups etc. A diagnosis of ADHD at 62 along with medication started. More therapy, CBT, DBT and hard work, I am happier then I\u2019ve ever been and I haven\u2019t been angry for a couple of years.",

And then sometimes things that I think i should be legitimately angry about,  I am not,  or at least my traction is mild. \n\nFor me, this has been decreasing for a few years.  My patience has also increased.  Exercise helps.",

I find myself crying at some of the most simple story beats in a movie like a death scene. I watched many movies with all sorts of tragedies before and didn't shed a tear. But rage. I never felt that until 2023. The real kicker about it was I mostly felt these emotions on a really good day. I enjoyed work, got home, something went wrong and I went the completely opposite way in emotion. I'm very good at not letting my emotions carry me away, but that year was the most I've ever struggled not to destroy the whole damn house over nothing but a disagreement I had with my brother.",
