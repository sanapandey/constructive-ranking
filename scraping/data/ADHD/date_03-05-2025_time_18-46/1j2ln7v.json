    "selftext": "23F So i was prescribed dextroamphetamine when i first got diagnosed with adhd about 3 years ago, and was in it for about a year and a half. I lost a significant amount of weight in that time and honestly looked sickly at one point. After a while i started to feel like it was ineffective so we switch to methylphenidate 30mg and i stuck with that for a little over a year but once again felt like i still wasn\u2019t getting full relief from my debilitating executive functioning issues and just felt like i couldn\u2019t \u201cadult\u201d the way i should. But on the adderall i remember I was waking up really early, going to bed early and working a ton. I was overall more productive (at least from what i can remember).\n\n So i asked my doctor if we could switch back to the adderall since it felt slightly better. The last time i was on adderall i had would get my refills at walgreens but now i use mariano\u2019s. Anyways, I noticed that my new bottle says Amphetamine salts xr 20mg and when i was previously on adderall it said Dextroamphetamine. \n\nI did some research and saw there was a slight difference in the two. I\u2019ve only been taking the adderall for a couple days but i definitely don\u2019t feel that kickstart in energy like i did with the methylphenidate. About 30 min after the methylphenidate i would feel slightly \u201cwired\u201d i guess, not drugged up but more energized and my heart would feel a little faster. I don\u2019t notice this with the new prescription. It feels different from the last time i was on adderall and a lot milder. Maybe it\u2019s just bc the dose is smaller? Or does the dextroamphetamine have a stronger affect than the amphetamine salts? Anyone else have a similar experience? Also sorry for the potentially poor grammar and punctuation i wrote this in a rush lol",

Dexedrine aka plain dextroamphetamine, is supposed to be stronger than Adderall but to me it feels mild. Idk I was expecting to feel more concentrated so I could focus on my tasks but I don\u2019t really feel that much different from Adderall.",

            "body": "Adderall is made of up 4 amphetamine salts, the majority of it is made of Dextroamphetamine. So they are similar in make up and effect. I think it varies a bit per person, my experience has been that Dex worked a bit better than most of the generic Adderalls I've taken, but it was less effective than generic Adderall by Sandoz or Teva.",
