    "selftext": "Hello.\nI currently take 36 mg concerta just to do daily things. When I have class or study, I need to take ritalin, but I don't think concerta nor ritalin lasts the time it should be. (Concerta crash is minimal but takes place after 6 hours of intake, not 8, and ritalin 3 instead of 4) \nI am thinking of requesting a higher dose of Concerta the next time I visit, but I am not sure. I'm scared the doctor will decrease my ritalin prescription.\nSo I decided to ask here. Any suggestions?",
