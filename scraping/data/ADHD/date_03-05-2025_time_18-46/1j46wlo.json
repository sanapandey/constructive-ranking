    "selftext": "Recently got diagnosed with ADD. My main symptoms have been intense brain fog throughout my life. Feeling like brain is clogged. Slow processing speed. Difficult to conversate with others as I have a extremely hard time processing what they are saying to me. Because of this, I have always been very shy with new people as I am insecure of my mental capabilities. It\u2019s hard to remember things so I have to write everything on reminders on my phone everyday. Hard time staying still in classroom (adhd symptom?) etc.\n\nI took my first dosage today (Adderall 20mg XR) before I head to class. I felt more confident. Social anxiety was at ease. I was finally about to sit still in my chair with no desires so squirm around as I usually do. My heart rate has even been lowered a tad. (is this normal?)\nBut that brain fog and slow processing speed are still there. Maybe a bit more clear but it was not this \u201cday and night\u201d difference I have heard others talk about. \n\nThis makes me question if the adderall is actually doing its job, or I just feel good because I\u2019m on a stimulant. I question if maybe I just have a low IQ and this has nothing to do with ADD. Are there any tell tail signs to see if it\u2019s really working or not? \nThank you guys \n\n\n\n\n\n",

I've been here for a little over a month and I remember my expectations and uncertainties from the first day. I was unlucky, my doctor hardly knows anything about ADHD or medication and he gave me a dose almost double what I take now. I spent 5 nightmare days. Better to start little by little and work your way up.",

One time I stopped taking the medication one weekend and felt way off, as soon as I started taking the pill again, immediately felt much better, that's how I know it's working for me.\n\nOver time, your doc could increase your dose and you'll begin to adapt much better.",

            "body": "I can relate to this so much. When I first started medication, I expected that \u201cnight and day\u201d transformation too, but instead, it was more subtle. I felt a little calmer, a little more in control, but that brain fog? It didn\u2019t just vanish. It took time to figure out how the meds actually helped me rather than expecting them to fix everything instantly.\n\n\nOne thing I realized is that meds don\u2019t make you smarter or suddenly give you skills you never had\u2014they just make it easier to access what was already there. The processing speed and brain fog can take time to improve, and sometimes it takes adjustments in dosage or even the specific medication. Also, being on meds doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still have ADHD symptoms; it just means you have a tool to work with now.\n\n\nIf you relate to this, this video really captures the reality of starting ADHD meds and adjusting to them: https://youtu.be/bQ_wDpISzGY. It might give you some insight into what\u2019s happening. Hang in there!",
