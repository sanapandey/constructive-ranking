Since my diagnosis i'm super aware of them and that since now I know everyone doesn't' do that it's more upsetting.\n\nIt's worse when one of the really annoying ones pop in my head and I know it's going to go all day.  In the movie \"Spaceballs\" Pizza The Hutt says \"unfair to the payor, not the payee hehehe\"  - all damn day.\n\nGood luck with your meds, they can help a lot but don't stress if it takes time to dial in the right ones.  Go easy on yourself :)",
