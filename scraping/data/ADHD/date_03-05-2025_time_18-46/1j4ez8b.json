    "selftext": "I'm trying to figure out what university course I wanna do, which may seem easy, \"just do what you want\". Problem is, I want 2 different things for 2 different reasons.\n\nThere's a software development course and a language learning course. I'm obsessed with the idea of learning languages cause i think they're cool and I even like learning about etymology. I watch content about language learning all the time and have wanted to learn Japanese for years. The idea of doing translation work, like translating books or subtitles or any media appeals to me a lot. Even teaching a language sounds fun.\n\nSoftware development is fun, more challenging and can earn me way more money. I'm worried that I'll get burnt out quickly if I'm learning to code. I think coding can be enjoyable but it gets very frustrating when I can't figure stuff out. I'd love to earn lots of money and I like the idea of creating things like apps and websites.\n\nOne thing I can say for sure is that I hate the idea of working for someone else. Other people seem to often do things in strange ways that make no sense to me so I'd rather do things my own way. So working for myself is definitely preferable.\n\nHonestly I just need some advice cause I'm lost. I keep alternating between the 2 courses and I really can't make up my mind. Maybe this isn't specifically an adhd thing but it seems to be magnified by it cause I have a huge interest in them both",

You'll have to be creative and work harder for career opportunities, but you'll find yourself in a career that you're more apt for. \n\nI'm in an American, in the US university students can major in one subject and minor in another subject. Is that a possibility for you? If so, then you can minor in computer science or an IT major",
