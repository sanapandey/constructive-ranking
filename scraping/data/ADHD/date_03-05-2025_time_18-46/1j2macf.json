It's literally the worst thing any creative person could ever imagine! It always happens to me, and it's so annoying. I just need a way to concentrate on one thing, but i cant seem to find the way how. Any advice would be nice.",

I then move on to the shiny thing and i never finish anything i started even tho it might be an amazing idea.\n\nSeems to be very very common. Follow through doesnt exist in ADHD people. Its very hard to follow something long term.",
