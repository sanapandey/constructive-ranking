    "selftext": "Many of you can probably relate. I'm usually very non-confrontational, but sometimes I see things that I just can't let go of. Unfortunately, it seems like the times I do speak up about something, I end up misinterpreting the situation completely or am just wrong. Well, I just did it again. I'm a member of some local Facebook pages where people post properties for rent, and I've seen some posts recently that seem suspicious, but today I actually looked into it. A couple posts from this business page advertised rental properties and included a link for you to apply. I went to the page's profile and red flags began to appear. There was no number listed and I could not find any information about the business when I googled it. On top of that most of the reviews on their page were fake/bot reviews that had nothing to do with the business itself. I googled the address and found a different management company had posted the listing. I called the company and asked if they worked with them and the person I spoke to told me they did not.\n\nWell then I sprung into action. I replied to the post I saw telling people it was a scam. Then I made a post to the group to warn others. This page replied and stated they are working with that company. Then I used our state website to see who the owner of the property was and I saw the company name.\n\nNow I feel bad for accusing this person but I really genuinely thought it was a scam and that I was protecting people. I\u2019m currently planning my next steps but I was just hoping maybe you all could relate/commisserate.\n\nGeez it makes it so much harder to stand up for myself when you feel like you can\u2019t trust your judgement of a situation.",
