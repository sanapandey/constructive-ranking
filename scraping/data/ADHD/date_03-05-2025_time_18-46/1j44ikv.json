Is it\n\na) You feel the same amount of emotion as  a normal person but you can't regulate and stop yourself from expressing it\n\nb) You feel more emotion than a normal person and struggle to regulate and not express it.\n\nc) You feel the same amount of emotion as a normal person but it \"hits harder\" and also you struggle to regulate and not express it.",

I know that not being perfect or failing is part of the learning. Emotionally, I might get flustered or frustrated, then think I'm worthless beccause I couldn't do something, and rebound back into something else.  \n\n2) Road rage if someone tries to do something that a sign clearly indicates otherwise (ie, turn only lanes and they continue straight). There's no real reason for it, but it sometimes comes out. \n\n3) Impulsive behaviors, like hoarding or feeling there's a need for that item, and realizing that I don't need it later, and should have let it go.",

Aggressive behavior. \n\nIt sucks.",

A common example for me is that I might end up attending a funeral for somebody I didn\u2019t know well but I knew a friend or family member of the deceased. The deceased is just a rando to me honestly. But if I see their family or friends crying I\u2019ll feel sad for them a little which seems like it should be normal but if I don\u2019t fully gather myself and focus on the paper program or something like that I\u2019ll end up bawling and I\u2019m a 41 year old man.",
