    "selftext": "Had a revelation about me studying. And I feel silly for not consciously realizing it sooner. Obviously I struggled studying in school. But even when I've tried self teaching myself something that I want to do or learn I struggle. And then it hit me that even on my own I still try to study how you're \"supposed to\" In school I ended up with this really rigid mindset of what studying is supposed to look like. And thats how you have to learn. Now that I'm back in my phase of learning German I realized part of why I always dropped it in the past is because I wasn't learning in a way that works for me. I was trying to force myself to learn how I thought people are \"supposed to learn\" Very rigid, you start at point a then go to point b then point c. \n\nBut when I'm learning, the basics are the worst. I understand they are necessary but they aren't interesting at all. But now that I'm self teaching a language again I'm letting myself bounce around and use the things I already like. I love audiobooks so audiobooks at work to help teach the basics, then I'm also doing something else and keeping from being bored. In my minf how I'm supposed to do the next step is something like flashcards with a bunch of words, or memorizing grammar. Instead I'll jump a little bit. I love music so I'm using some German bands that I like and trying to translate their songs. Using a mix of my own knowledge and Google. \n\nUsually by now my interest would be starting to sputter or it would start to feel like a chore, but since I'm allowing myself to do whatever I please, as long as it involves German, I'm still enthusiastic about learning.
