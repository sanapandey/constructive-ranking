            "body": "I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist after being referred to him from my therapist. I had started therapy in Nov, and we got around to talking about how I thought I was undiagnosed and wanted some sort of validation that I did in fact have it. He then referred me, I setup an initial appointment with him which was literally a FaceTime call, and then after about 20 mins of conversation with him, he did agree that I have ADHD, and we started talking about treating it. He then wrote me a prescription at a pharmacy he knew would have it, I picked it up and started it the next day. I think in your case, you should find a psychiatrist who specializes in ADHD, and ask for an initial consultation because you think you have it.",

            "body": "Assuming you're not in Canada, I don't know if this will apply, but here in Canada, there is about a 2-year waiting list before getting seen for ADHD. And any medication adjustment takes forever. Which, finding the right dose can be a long and frustrating journey. But, that's when you want to do it for free. If you're ok with covering costs for the appointments, then something like [https://mycompasshealth.ca](https://mycompasshealth.ca) works well. It's what I used to get re-diagnosed (was diagnosed in the 90's but needed to re-up my diagnosis to get on meds) and medicated. Took less than a week to get a meeting and a prescription. Then working with the NP to find the right medication and dose is super easy. \n\nDoubtful, but I hope this helps.",
