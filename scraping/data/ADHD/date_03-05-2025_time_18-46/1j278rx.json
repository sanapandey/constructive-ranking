    "selftext": "I recently got diagnosed and have told people about it but u find it rather hard to tell people how much I really struggle like what am I supposed to say? Like my parents have been very supportive especially about medication considering my moms a \u201cherb lady\u201d and my dads a bit anti-med. it took them seeing my attendance, substance abuse, and general mood to finally really understand what I was going through. But also it\u2019s not their fault at all because I just have no idea how to explain to people what I\u2019m going through. I actually have a zoom call tomorrow about medications which is nice but like how can I tell people what I\u2019m really going through? I mean I don\u2019t even know how to explain this to a bunch of strangers on Reddit lol so I\u2019m going to just paste some kind of results from some thing I took just so you guys can get a good idea.

            "body": "Tried giving my pcp a rundown of my medical history which included some dark undertones (practically unavoidable when you are informing them of medications you have been through and reactions) and some current depressive circumstances due to insurance loss and financial loss while she was out of town.  This was to help her understand and set the record straight going forward since I felt the previous doctor had become so out of touch and my medical history seemed to be forgotten.  Turned into a prescription refill routine with no attempt of making forward progress or hearing me out.\n\n\nThe appointment ended with a suggestion for checking out therapy and a prescription for 7 pills of Wellbutrin?  What the actual heck.  Also I think she forgot to send in any prescriptions I take including a very important one for anxiety so I literally don't cease to stop functioning until the withdraw finishes me off.  I can understand not sending one in for ADHD as it would not be affordable without insurance but the other is.\n\n\nNow I have some insurance and have to call to see which one of us had worse ADHD brain going on.  She has ADHD to lol.  Also the antidepressants were trash as I suspected they would be but I felt she had been more helpful so I wanted to give her a shot despite having a hatred for antidepressants never helping and making things worse like I was a foggy brained zombie.\n\n\nThink I will try to tone it down some so she doesn't go on an antidepressant rampage and I play guinea pig again.  Just give me my dang anxiety medication and ADHD meds and here is my insurance card.  Thanks and bye.",

Don\u2019t use buzzwords like anxiety or depression or anything like that. Speak in simple terms and break the symptoms down. \n\nRestlessness\u201d- I can\u2019t sit still at work and focus. My legs shake and I need to move! \n\nDepression\u201d (lack of motivation)- I just can\u2019t get anything done sometimes and every single thing feels like a chore. *depression and lack of motivation are twins but not really the same thing at all! Depression meds will not treat lack of motivation. Don\u2019t make this mistake like I did, it inhibits treatment.*\n\nInattentive- Talk about impact outside of school and work (every fucking body hates school and work, but we don\u2019t all need 7 AirTags to keep up with basic things)\n\nTime blindness- My entire school career I was never on time, coming OR going. I was never ready for the bus either. Everyone else was always on rhythm and I just wasn\u2019t.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain everything in one go either. I would start with prominent issues and go from there. Hope it goes well! I can explain more if you\u2019d like",
