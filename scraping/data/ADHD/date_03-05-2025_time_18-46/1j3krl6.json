    "selftext": "I'm just writing this I guess to vent because this is really getting on my nerves. One of the things I'm sure a lot of people, including myself struggle with is *doing* tasks. Like we can plan and do everything else, but when it comes to the actual task it feels impossible.   \nI'm just going through a burn-out period I guess or something. Because, while I'm not going into details, there are currently a lot of stressors in my life. (one of which being college)  \nAnd it's frustrating that I can't do the things I need to do, or that I don't have the energy for them. I was trying to explain it to my mom like this:   \nIt's like, I have all the puzzle pieces. I can see about where they are supposed to go, I know how to put a puzzle together, I want to do the puzzle. But either I can't do the puzzle, or for some reason I can't get it to fit together.   \nI guess this has been building for weeks, which makes sense. But it has gotten to the point where any time I sit down and try to relax I keep repeating to myself \"you're just being lazy, if you weren't sitting here you could get the task done. You shouldn't be relaxing right now, you don't deserve it.\"  \nIt's just frustrating because I can articulate why I am having an issue with my work, I can identify solutions, I can plan a course for what I need to do, but I can't fricking do it. Like, I just want my brain to be normal and be able to do tasks without all this extra stuff crowding my head.  \nAnyway, I guess rant over? If I continue, I'll just end up repeating what I've already said again in different words. ",
