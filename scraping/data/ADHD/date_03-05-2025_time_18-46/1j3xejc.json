    "selftext": "Three things I've always had problems with and I'm just starting to wonder whether these things to do with my HDHD. I'm noticing that these things aren't necessarily difficult for most people.  I'm hoping to hear about others' experiences.  \n\nOften when I know something I'm a bit dysfunctional about typical ADHD behaviour, I get better at it because then I get more conscious and apply ADHD strategies. (Put the voice message on a list instead of just ignoring it for ever, that sort of thing.)\n\nVOICE MESSAGES: I get an almost physical discomfort when I get a voice message. Feelings of anxiety, impatience, and irritation. I put off listening to it for ages - sometimes I never listen to it - but it weighs on me. \n\nLIBRARY BOOKS: I love using libraries, but always take books back late. Once I realise they are late they weigh on me daily, but I don't seem to be able to take them back. \n\nRECIPES: I generally cook the same things. Recipes also often give me physical discomfort. I've only just begun to see this through an ADHD filter. There's a list of ingredients, some of which I have, some I don't have, some I might have but would have to check the cupboard. Then so many things to do. I can't see to the end of it. \n\nNow that I've written these things down they DO seem ADHD related!",
