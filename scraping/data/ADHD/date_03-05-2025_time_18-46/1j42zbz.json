    "selftext": "I\u2019m so sick of it all rn. My driver\u2019s side car window exploded two months ago out of nowhere and I haven\u2019t been able to afford to fix it. I\u2019ve been driving to work with loud ass packing tape on my window 6 days a week just so I can barely scrape by after my sister\u2019s ex moved out, bought tinder gold after a week and bailed on paying his third of rent even though he said he would. I was just unable to work for 9 days because I came down with the flu and I still feel like shit going to work. The temptation to call out is so strong every day that I can\u2019t even show up on time anymore. I have a rotted car that doesn\u2019t start bc of a dead battery getting covered in snow by my house registered in florida (I currently live in colorado) that I need to plug in, get the title for, register in CO, get a new license plate for, get insurance for (which I cannot afford, of course). on top of the fact that the car I currently use  needs a license plate bc the temp plate says \u201cDec 26 2024.\u201d and i\u2019m constantly afraid of being pulled over. The dealership had me waiting for 130 days for a license plate to come in the mail and it turns out they kept giving me the wrong information, I\u2019m supposed to get that shit myself at the DMV. I have to move houses by the end of the month. Neither of the toilets work in my fucking house right now I\u2019ve been pissing in the shower and shitting in bags. I genuinely don\u2019t know how some of you can live, I\u2019m starting to feel my will slip. This is just the tip of the iceberg. Everything is too much. ",
