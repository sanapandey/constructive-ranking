    "selftext": "So after a month of taking Equasym XL and graduating from 20 to 30, I am now at 40MG. (two 20s). After the first hour when I feel great and focussed, I keep wanting to have lots of coffee to 'maintain' that focus as I feel it disappearing. Anybody else ever get this?\n\nI tried Ritalin LA for a few days but it was horrific. I was restless, angry, irritable and scattered. Although now that seems to be happening with the Equasym too.",
