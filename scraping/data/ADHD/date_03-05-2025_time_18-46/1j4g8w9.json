    "selftext": "I am very confused, and very frustrated. So, I'm going to rant. \n\n  \nTwo days ago at my appointment, I asked my provider, who I have been seeing for 6-9 months, to increase my 10mg Adderall IR booster to 20mg. I also take 70mg Vyvanse, which I set an alarm for at 5am to take,  then go back to sleep for 2-3 more hours, because that's legit how long it feels it takes to start working. She told me \"no,\" because the 70mg vyvanse with the 10mg adderall IR is equivalent to 120mg vyvanse, which puts me OVER the FDA recommended amount. \n\nFirstly, I've been on 70mg Vyvanse with a 20mg IR booster. It was while I was in graduate school 7-8 years ago. The only reason I went off of this combo is because I quit my full time job to focus on school and lost my insurance. So, I switched to 20mg IR Adderall 3x day due to cost. I much prefer the Vyvanse with a booster, because the up/down/up/down and crash from the IRs made me feel awful, mentally and physically. The Vyvanse just doesn't last long enough for me unfortunately. \n\nSecondly, the max amount recommended by the FDA for Adderall is 60mg. So, if 10mg Adderall = 50mg Vyvanse, then wouldn't the max for Adderall be equivalent to 300mg of Vyvanse??? I want to point this out so badly, but I figure it would be a wasted effort. \n\n  \nI'm requesting the increase now, because my husband deployed 6 weeks ago, leaving me as the sole caregiver for our 1 yo, 5yo, and 2 dogs. Plus, I work part time as a therapist. I am slowly working towards full licensure still, so taking a break from work would be quite detrimental to that goal. We don't have family locally, and they only visit maybe once per month. We have the kids in daycare/pre-k full time. It doesn't matter. There's so much to do and remember; our life has been built for two adults to handle, not just one. The worst part is I feel so weak and whiny when complaining, because I feel that a \"normal\" person with typical executive functioning abilities could handle everything just fine. ",

Like, you\u2019d think that the prescribing Dr would say \u201cok so 70mg vyvanse + a 10mg adderal booster in the afternoon is the most i am legally allowed to prescribe, so if this doesn\u2019t work, we can\u2019t just raise the dose, we\u2019ll have to consider if other medications can help more.\u201d",

The way your body processes lisdexamfetamine is different to IR dexamfetamime. But, 10mg being equivalent to 50mg doesn't sound right. 40\\15 is 2.66, applying that to your dose, 10mg would be equivalent to 26.6mg vyvanse. Which sounds about right, when I changed from IR to vyvanse, I was started on 20mg and had terrible withdrawals. Bumped up to 40mg and felt exactly the same as my 3 IR a day.",

And if that were truly accurate, then that would mean the max amount of Adderall per day, according to the FDA guidelines, which is 60 mg, is equivalent to 300 mg of Vyvanse. Which is *significantly* more than the 70 mg maximum established. I am aware that they are two different drugs and are processed in the body differently. I just don\u2019t appreciate how she\u2019s making it sound like increasing the IR is preposterous, because I am so \u201covermedicated\u201dalready.",
