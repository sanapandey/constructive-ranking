    "selftext": "So I started Concerta like 2 days ago. Yes I know that\u2019s not a very long time to really make a judgement, but it made me feel very weird. The first day I took it I took it at 11 in the afternoon and I had no issue with my appetite. In fact I think I ate a bit too much. I wrote like 4 pages worth of random shit on a hyperfixtation of mine. Other than that it was pretty good. Today I took it at 8 on an empty stomach and I\u2019ve struggled to eat all day. When I did eat it was just so unappetizing and it was my favorite food. Not only that but my head was so quiet it was almost uncomfortable and I felt super under stimulated. So much so that I would keep tearing up, shaking my head, flapping my hands, rocking, and just trying to soothe myself I guess. Then socializing was really hard. I had to think really hard on what to say and when to say it. Like I couldn\u2019t formulate words. And I couldn\u2019t laugh. When I did laugh it felt SO automated. Talking felt automated. It all felt so uncomfortable and weird and fake and I hated it. Things I usually found funny didn\u2019t make me laugh at all and I felt bad for not laughing at my friends jokes because I usually do all the time. But when I laughed it just felt so forced and I hated it. Then around 6-8 I was just really pissed off and super angry. Like angrier than I had been in a really long time. I wanted to scream and yell and curse everyone out. \n\nWhat I\u2019m more concerned about is the socializing part because it\u2019s bothering me the most (besides the under stimulation). This post https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/s/cc9SttgS6e describes EXACTLY how I felt today. And I\u2019m wondering because of a comment there, if this is because of my autism? I\u2019m also on the spectrum so is that coming through now that the Concerta is kind of suppressing the ADHD? Help :(",
