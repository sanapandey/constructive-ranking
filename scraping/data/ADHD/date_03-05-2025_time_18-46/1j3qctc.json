Total disaster. I can\u2019t hold eye contact, my brain either blanks completely or races so fast that I can\u2019t form a normal sentence. \n\nHalf the time, I don\u2019t even realize someone\u2019s talking to me until they repeat themselves.\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing, two of my coworkers recently told me that this girl at work was hitting on me. And I had no idea. Like, zero. \n\nLooking back, I remember she made a few comments about how my haircut suited me or how a certain shirt looked good on me, but I just thought she was being nice. \n\nTurns out, those were hints. Apparently, she was flirting. And I missed it. Completely.\n\nNow I\u2019m sitting here realizing I probably blew my chance, and I don\u2019t even know if I ever had one to begin with. I don\u2019t know if my coworkers were exaggerating or if I actually fumbled something that could\u2019ve gone somewhere. \n\nBut I do know that this happens a lot. I miss cues. I don\u2019t pick up on social dynamics the way other people do. My brain is always going a mile a minute, and by the time I process what happened, it\u2019s already too late.\n\nI see other people at work joke around, talk effortlessly, make connections. \n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m over here hyper-focusing on a random thought while someone is probably waiting for me to respond to a conversation I didn\u2019t even realize I was in. It\u2019s frustrating as hell. \n\nI feel like I should be better at this by now, but nope.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I just needed to get this off my chest. Maybe I\u2019ll figure it out one day. Or maybe I\u2019ll just keep missing things and realizing them way too late.\n\n",

(But even if true, that not a perfect stat, as the quantity of dates from those sources will vary a lot... I'd expect that kind of stat just because the work relationship has a lot of pre-selection criteria vs dating apps being more about volume.

One of my students, who came to my school was good enough in her English ability that we'd regularly talk about different things going on, and different topics came up during class. \n\nSomehow the topic of 'crushes' had come up (I think literally my student asked if I had a girlfriend) and I had mentioned the story of seeing a movie with a girl who later offered me her umbrella on the way home back to the train station who insisted on me taking it even though I said I was fine. My umbrella which was left on the umbrella stand outside of the movie theater had been taken by someone else and it was pouring down rain. After the back and forth that's common in Japanese (lots of 'No thank you, you can take it'), I eventually took the umbrella, as she insisted on that she lived near the station. A couple of months later, when I actually went to her house for the first time, it was a good 10 minute walk from the station.\n\nExplaining this, and what led up to seeing a movie (iirc, I think it was the first Kung Fu Panda movie dubbed into Japanese), my student was like 'so, she asked you on a *date*' which I had not thought about and denied. I later told her that I had asked the girl what she was doing for Christmas, which my student point-blank told me that I had done a 'soft' confession to my friend. As a side note to this story, Christmas is second only to Valentine's Day for romance in Japan. By asking a person what they'd be doing for Christmas or Christmas Eve, it's considered a 'soft' way of confessing liking or love. She was busy during the holiday as she had already said she was traveling with family to South Korea during that time, but met up afterward during the new year. \n\nNow, this friend was one of the girls I did like while I was over there, but I had been oblivious to at least two times we had done something together and not really acknowledged that it was more than hanging out and being friends. And the 'soft' confession must have messed everything up. Honestly looking back on it now, it was plainly obvious she liked me, but I feel she didn't really know what to do around foreign men and so it was a lot of playful back and forth when we would meet up. I was running out of time unfortunately for my study abroad period, so it didn't progress to anything more beyond that, but it was not my proudest moment of being like that 'dense af' main character in a romcom anime.",

Well this guy came over out of NOWHERE and asked for her number and she shot him down and after he walked away she was like \"can you believe that?\" and as we laughed together about it in my head I was like \"oh shit I'm not gonna ask her now\", but maybe a month later I wanted to punch myself, even if she said no I'd be right were I am now not knowing her... oops\n\nedit: I wish the norm adapted to woman asking men out more ;(",

One of her friends was a dude who had dated her other friend for a while and then they broke up.  That\u2019s the only reason I ever hung out with the dude in question.\n\nSo one night I was in the studio working on a painting assignment and I was by myself at like 12am playing music (they didn\u2019t close the building until super late because of night classes) and he wanders over from the music wing and I\u2019m in hyperfocus work mode, because I have 2 hours to finish this painting because I don\u2019t have an easel in my dorm.  He sits down and he\u2019s talking to me and I\u2019m sort of listening and we chat about anime or whatever.  I mention I have season 1 of Bleach on DVD, he\u2019s never seen it, he asked if I\u2019d seen FLCL, I hadn\u2019t.\n\nSo he invites me over on like a Thursday night to swap favorite animes and I\u2019m like yeah cool, thinking that it would be a buddy hangout.  I get there, and instead of hanging out in the common area, he\u2019s like \u201coh no let\u2019s watch in my room\u201d.\n\nAnd I\u2019m like *oh no.*\n\nAnd then he\u2019s like \u201cI don\u2019t have an extra chair you can sit on the bed.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019m like *oh NO*.\n\nNeedless to say it was super awkward and I never hung out with him again \ud83d\ude02",

            "body": "This. I always found out later (often with help) when a guy had a crush on me. \n\nThis was true even when it was mutual. Like one of my high school classmates I had a crush on for at least 3 years, and who tried to hit on me without me even noticing during all those years. \n\nBut the worst or best is my story with my now husband. We met through a uni classmate in an online youth community in the 2000's, and I got a crush on him pretty soon. For months I was so busy hitting on him that it never occurred to me that he was doing it too, or that it had already worked out somehow. \n\nI even joked when he asked for my number that it was like he wanted to pick me up. I was also too busy in my head to realize what was going on, when he called me every day for months and we talked for hours, same when he finally invited me to visit him in another city, where things happened between us. I still didn't get it when he visited me 2 weeks later, and we picked up where we left off the last time. \n\nThe sudden realization that we were probably dating hit me only when he got a call and I heard him say he was \"at his girlfriend's.\" But even then, I got angry first and it took me a few minutes to figure out that the girlfriend could only be me. It still cracks me up when I remember that or the baffled look on his face after I asked him if I was right. He later said that he found my sense of humor a little weird sometimes, but he also thought it was cute and funny.",

And that is because she wanted to kiss me after the first date we had.\n\nI also doubt that she even really loves me... We've been together for 24 years and married for 16 years now. She loves me a whole heap of a lot, that's for sure. And still I doubt.\n\nI now see that it's my ADD/Autism that causes me to doubt.",

If you are only thinking about her now because your co-workers put the idea in your head, it\u2019s likely you didn\u2019t have those feelings for her in the first place. If she\u2019s still single, and you ACTUALLY like her, no chance was missed. Ask her out (if you want).",
