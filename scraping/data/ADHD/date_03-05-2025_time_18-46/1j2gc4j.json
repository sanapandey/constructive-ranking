I\u2019ve been living with my parents for the past four months, and my gap year ends in August.\n\nThe issue is that I have many ideas and projects, but when it comes to organizing or setting goals, I freeze. It feels like there\u2019s an invisible wall stopping me from structuring my thoughts. I see others easily managing their projects, and it\u2019s frustrating because I can\u2019t even get started.\n\nI struggle with organization in both my daily life and thinking, and my lack of concentration makes things worse. I\u2019m unsure if this is due to procrastination, perfectionism, or something else like an emotional block.\n\nEach attempt to plan fails, leaving me feeling stuck and anxious. I\u2019ve been stuck in this cycle for years, and I\u2019m starting to feel hopeless. I know I need to set goals to move forward, but I just can\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m seeking advice, techniques, or personal experiences on overcoming this block and learning to plan effectively. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI really don't know if I have ADD but it could be possible, so i plan to see a doctor and do a test for it.\n\nThank you for listening.",
