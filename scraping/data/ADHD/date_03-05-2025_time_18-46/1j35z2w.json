Is there anything fun I can do that doesn't take too much energy but isn't just doom-scrolling til I go to bed?",

For me it's always easier going for walks with someone or else I'll likely stay in on my phone!\n\nI try to set a 20 minute timer to tidy one part of my room seeing as it is always a mess.
