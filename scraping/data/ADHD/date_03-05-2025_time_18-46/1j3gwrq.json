    "selftext": "i have a really hard time paying attention to other people speaking in conversations and it\u2019s starting to affect how people are feeling about our relationships. i want to try to improve my attention span so that people don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re having one-way conversations with me. would adhd medication help with that? i\u2019m unmedicated right now, but i would consider medication if it would help with that. i also think medication would help me stay focused and on-task at school and work. i think other tactics like fidgets and adding small responses to engage with what other people are saying would help too, but i don\u2019t think that would fully fix things.
