    "selftext": "I usually post about my struggles at work, and today I want to talk about how I sometimes do things automatically\u2014without stopping to think\u2014and see if anyone has tips to help with this.\n\nThe problem is, I\u2019m a lawyer with a lot on my plate, and I often act on autopilot. For example, today I received a document that needed to be translated, and I sent it straight to the translator without even checking if it was correct, if it was the right document, if I needed to scan it first etc.\n\nI also tend to start tasks without fully reading emails, and when I finally do, I realize the assignment was something completely different from what I thought. These little mistakes happen a lot\u2014especially with bureaucratic tasks.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips on how to PAUSE and be more intentional with what I\u2019m doing?\n\nThanks in advance!",
