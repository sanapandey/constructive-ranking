I guess I was still stuck on the stigma of Adderall being all so powerful that one pill would be super strong for at least like 12 hours lol. My pills worked really well for the first 3 hours and then stop and I would be so confused. Never took more than prescribed though because I told myself If I\u2019m going to be on Adderall, I\u2019m going to be as responsible as possible with my meds. I did in fact voice my concerns with my doctor about my pills not working and he told me suck it up buttercup so I found a new doctor and she said if she were to put me back on IR, she would probably advise me to take it 2-3 times a day lol",

Taking 3 a day is kind of rough, but common. \n\nAdderall XR (6-8 hours) and Vyvanse (12 hours) are generally easier to deal with",

And it doesn't tend to interfere with my sleep this way either.",

Maybe if it was a higher dose which is what it sounded like my doc was going to do. She mentioned increasing my dosage but proceeds to give me 25 mg total like before its just now a larger single dose is XR. It's still better than not being medicated at all, but the IR definitely feels more beneficial in the long run because the effects kick in so much more quickly",

I think it\u2019s less up and down\u2019s to be on a consistent dose, meaning at least twice a day with IR or once a day with XR. If once a day is working for you then by all means stick to that for now. Otherwise keep your dose but try something like 5mg IR or 7.5mg IR twice a day, or 10mg AM with a 5mg booster, etc. There\u2019s a lot of options and no right or wrong way to medicate, so long as you and your doctor are on the same page.",

Twice per day is definitely the norm (four hours apart, so you have eight hours of treatment coverage). Some docs do three per day if you want it.\n\nA while back, I had a prescription for Adderall IR twice per day, but I'd often forget to take the second one.\n\nNow I have a prescription for Adderall IR once per day in addition to Vyvanse (and for a while, in addition to Adderall XR instead of Vyvanse)... but again, always forgetting to take it \ud83d\ude11\n\nAdderall XR is made to simulate taking two IR pills four hours apart, though in practice, it tends to be a little more gradual than that.",

Sometimes I take 5mg to start the day when I have school or work, and then 2.5 whenever I feel it wearing off (I can always tell because I feel the sleepiness creeping in). Ritalin and adderall dosages are pretty much the same, my dose is considered lower than even a child starter dose lol. I\u2019m thankful I had a doctor that let me experiment with my own dosage (mainly because I wanted to go lower and not higher) because before this, it was WAYYY too much for me.\n\nI feel like a lot of people who get that horrific \u201chigh\u201d when trying stims probably are like me, and are being given way too much. Even 10mg would obliterate me. My first doc gave me 20mg XR adderall to start and it ruined a whole semester of my schooling.\n\nBut yeah point being, 1 dose would never last me the whole day. If 10mg feels too much, you may be like me and may need to cut into halves or even quarters. I\u2019m prescribed up to 20mg per day, 10mg pills, which I cut into quarters.",
