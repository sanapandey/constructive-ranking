    "selftext": "I had to switch off of Focalin just because of the horrible physical side effects and my memory has been horrible. Executive function has also been lacking a lot. It has been nearly 5 months and I think I have seen a little improvement. It takes me 20 seconds just to remember what I did yesterday. No joke. \n\nWhat is happening?!\n\nP.S. \n\nI am on Adderall IR currently, have tried Vyvanse concerta and XR Adderall in the last 5 months and none seem to do the same for my brain as focalin.",

Also there's no chance I'm going to keep subjecting myself to medications that aren't even made how I remember.",
