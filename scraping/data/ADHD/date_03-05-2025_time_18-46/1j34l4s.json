    "selftext": "I\u2019m wondering if anyone has ever experienced nausea when starting adderall, but delayed onset? I took my first 5mg XR and was totally fine that day, but the next day I threw up at my workout which was relatively easy and has never happened.\nTook it the next two days, today I was in bed all day with vertigo (so, took it yesterday but not today).\nThe only other thing I can think of is I stopped 40 mg Strattera at the time of starting Adderall. My doctor said there would be no withdrawal but this really feels like it!\n\nHas either delayed nausea from Adderall or Strattera withdrawal happened to anyone? How did you cope? \n",
