    "selftext": "I am about to graduate (yay class of 25), and have been diagnosed since I was about 3. I started to take medication at about 5 or 6 and have been switching between medications every few years (methylphenidate seems to be working for me as I've been on it for a few years.) I have the all too fun severe verity of combined type, so I'm taking a decently high dosage of my adhd meds and also have been and am being medicated for depression (bupropion.) Surprisingly, I tested negative for autism \nI have found a very deep passion for programming that started back in 7th grade, and definitely plan to pursue programming as a career after hs. Though I'm also extremely concerned about how to truly manage my adhd as while the medication definitely helps with hyperactivity and general focus, I still find myself always getting side-tracked with whatever personal project I'm working on during class, which is for sure reflecting in my grades. As someone who will have to go into the workforce very soon, I'm concerned with jobs that require a bit more brainpower than a standard gas station/fast food job and how I myself will be able to focus on tasks that I obviously can't just fix at a later date.\nAm I too concerned due to me almost comparing my high school workload vs a job?",
