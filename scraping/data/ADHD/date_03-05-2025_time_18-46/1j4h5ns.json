I never intended to end up with a role like this, but the moneys good, but I find it so mentally draining dealing with everyone\u2019s issues, managing the in fighting and constant power plays by the folks at the top of the contry.  \n\nHow does anyone else cope with the constant peopling, BS meetings and chaos of corporate life?  I\u2019m constantly tired, don\u2019t have time to exercise and don\u2019t sleep as I worry too much about work (damm you inner voice!)\n\n",
