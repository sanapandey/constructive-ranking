    "selftext": "I have primarily hyperactive ADHD (diagnosed November, and so far I've not seen anyone with the same diagnosis anywhere), and I wanted to know what other people's experiences are with the pros/cons of hyperactivity and inattentiveness, separately or together.\n\nFor me, I move constantly. Some part of me is always moving. This gets annoying when I'm tired, as I almost physically cannot stop moving, but is really useful when I'm doing physical exercise (football or climbing), as I don't want to stop moving, and will push through even when a bit tired.\nI also overthink a lot, which is bad for the obvious reasons, but good when problem solving, as I can often find a way around by just thinking about multiple possibilities at once.",

Especially if someone wants to talk or interact with me, I need to start moving.  I've only noticed it in the last few months, and I'm 38.   I've never paid attention to myself before I guess.",

I find it incredibly difficult to stop my brain from racing. \n\nI do sometimes struggle to stay seated, especially when I\u2019m talking but I have a physical disability so standing and moving is difficult.",

It makes me get lost in thought, bad at listening, interrupting without noticing, a but forgetful of things not in my direct sensory (I would say line of sight, but usually if I can hear something I don\u2019t forget about it). It also makes reading boring things a total pain. Most people can just push through while my mind makes it so painful just to read it, not processing the words\u2026 \n\nfunnily enough, I\u2019m also know for being good at organizing\u2026 because I have to write lists for every routine I have to do so I don\u2019t miss vital steps (such as closing a register for the night at work so I don\u2019t accidentally leave the till open or forget the cash on the table or something).",
