    "selftext": "\nHey everyone,\n\nLast year, I was diagnosed with ADHD, but unfortunately, medication has had the opposite effect on me. I\u2019m getting pretty desperate at this point.\n\nI used to work in a warehouse, but the pay was terrible. This week, I started a new job as an IT Specialist in a nice office, but\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014sitting still and focusing all day is absolute torture for me. I hate it.\n\nI\u2019m 26, and I really need to move out one day, but my family gets frustrated with me because I never seem to hold down a job. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, I just can\u2019t.\n\nSo what should I do? Should I stick it out for a while or start looking for something else? And if you have any tips, I\u2019d really appreciate them!\n\nThanks in advance, everyone!",

I always say no point staying at a job you\u2019re miserable at cause it\u2019ll make you feel worse but it\u2019s hard to with the current situation of the world. I\u2019m looking for jobs but there\u2019s none. I would say stick at it but maybe look for other jobs in the side if in a few weeks nothing has changed. Is there anything you really enjoy and don\u2019t dread hobbies wise?",
