    "selftext": "Hi, has anyone accidentally taken 2 of their Vyvanse tabs? I did today and feeling very racey but hoping I\u2019ll be okay, when do you seek medical attention as per the pamphlet that came with the meds? My dose is 50mg so I have had 100mg. I have in the past had 70mg and been fine so I\u2019m guessing nothing to worry about. But it\u2019s sure as hell got me fired up. Stomach is tight like a knot. But my blood pressure and heart rate seem \nok just wanted to hear from others that have done the same and how to manage it. ",

But ofc it depends on your body weight and health etc. Just be alert on any changes in your body and dont hesitate to call someone if you get a bad feeling. Always better to stay safe \u263a\ufe0f",

I would recommend the same.\n\nI have done this twice or something during times on XR meds and am obviously okay, though one of those times I felt sweaty and nauseous. I have a blood pressure lowering anxiety med for my panic attacks and so took that and rested until I felt better. Slowly eating and drinking water helped too but it was hard. But that was a case where I couldn\u2019t call the pharmacy so I self-managed, and that can, of course, go wrong so I don\u2019t want to suggest that without pharmacist or doctor advice first",
