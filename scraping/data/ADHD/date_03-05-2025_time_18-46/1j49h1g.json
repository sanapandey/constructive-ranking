I'm trying to avoid being put on sleeping pills like I was as a kid, those didn't really work anyways.\n\nEdit: I take my meds normally at about 730-800 in the morning and i still ted to have issues sleeping at night, I can probably ask my doctor about my dosage tho I'm already taking less than I did before ",

For me what Adderall helps with is allowing me to focus on what I want to focus on, and if I decide to focus on sleeping, then that\u2019s what happens.\n\nWhat helps me generally though, whether on Adderall or not, is gradually winding down through the night nearing bedtime. I have ceiling lights be for day and early evening only, then once it\u2019s dark/after dinner I switch to lamps with warm light bulbs. And gradually turn off those lamps throughout the rest of the night until right before bed I\u2019m just guided by my phone flashlight, although I\u2019ve thought about getting an oil lamp or candle holder or something instead lol.\n\nWriting or reading doesn\u2019t help me because it gets my brain too worked up. I have extremely vivid thoughts, so reading a book (that I\u2019m interested in) is almost as stimulating as watching TV. \n\nI will be on my phone despite it not being recommended, it makes my eyes more tired. But I avoid certain apps and try to cap it immediately as soon as I get the feeling that I can\u2019t keep my eyes open, I close them and try to sleep. I\u2019m one of the ASMR-watching freaks which is a miracle for me, but if that isn\u2019t your thing you could try some meditation videos/audios or listening to anything you find relaxing. \n\nAnd honestly, if you can\u2019t fall asleep within an hour, get up. Go to the bathroom, get some water, maybe do the dishes or try to prep something for breakfast, until you\u2019re tired again and then immediately get back to bed and close your eyes.",

Wake up at the same time every day, medication at the same time every day; as some others have mentioned, set an alarm for an hour before you need to be up, take the meds and let them wake you up- taking an earlier timed dose may help you wind down earlier.  \nBrisk exercise in the morning, stretching at night. I need high intensity exercise earlier in the day to stay regulated and feel tired at night.  \nMonitor/limit your caffeine intake-  I found that any caffeine after 11am means my night will be spent laying awake.   \n\nBasically train your *body* to do these activities on a schedule even if you and your brain don\u2019t feel tired.    \n\nI take ER as well, and do still struggle with sleep sometimes- but it\u2019s typically when my routine gets thrown off or I pull some dumb shit like eating dark chocolate before bed. When all else fails (for me), pancakes at night, a low dose edible, and/or an audiobook while laying in bed. Even if I don\u2019t fall asleep for a while, my body is resting, and the audio keeps me from fully falling into racing/restless thoughts.",
