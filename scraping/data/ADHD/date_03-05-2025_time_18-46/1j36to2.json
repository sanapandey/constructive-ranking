    "selftext": "So I've always struggled with being on time. I've tried Idk how many different strategies, but for whatever reason something always happens that ends up making me 5-10 minutes late. Never had any issue with being very late, just about 5 minutes and rarely over 10 minutes.\n\nThe best strategy I've found so far is planning to be e.g. 20 minutes early, but even that one has provided very limited results. What is your own experience with time management, and have any of you found an effective strategy to be on time consistently?",

She asked \u201cdo you care about being on time or do you WISH you cared about being on time?\u201d I said\u2026tbh the second one.\u00a0\n\nThen she asked what I felt when I was running late and I said stress, anxiety, worry that I won\u2019t make a good impression, etc etc. Now it\u2019s less about being on time and more about taking care of myself\u2026I know I\u2019ll feel ashamed if I\u2019m late, therefore I make choices that ensure I\u2019ll be early.\u00a0\n\nThere is always a \u201cdecision point.\u201d I would set an alarm, then ignore the alarm, then be late and anxious. It became a well ingrained habit\u2026so ingrained that I wrote it off as the inevitable reality of having ADHD. My bad habit of allowing myself to make the same decision over and over (ignoring my warning alarms) always ended with me feeling bad. I had to break the habit and become aware of that decision point when I *could* ignore the alarm and instead choose to start getting ready to leave.\u00a0\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t actually care about being on time? I don\u2019t. But I do care about not feeling ashamed or anxious after the fact. Figure out why you\u2019re concerned work improving your punctuality and use that motivation to change your behavior, and be brutally honest about it with yourself.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest hurdle to ADHD is holding yourself accountable without beating yourself up. To improve, you need to be willing to acknowledge that time blindness and lack of executive function is a *challenge* for folks with ADHD\u2026not an impossible problem. Holding yourself accountable is harder for us but it\u2019s really the only way.\u00a0",

            "body": "I have a couple strategies but mostly I do my best to schedule appointments and such in mornings or at least before mid-day. This helps a lot, but it is not always possible.\n\nNext, I have a series of alarms. In an effort to prevent or appease \"waiting mode\" I set a \"its okay to stress now\" alarm when I need to get ready to leave for the appointment. Then, I have other alarms for other steps like if its 30 minutes driving time then I have an alarm 10-15 minutes before that to head to the car. Takes me about that much time to walk to the car, get in, get everything settled, start the car and leave - so basically these alarms keep me in sequence and usually do a great job of keeping me more or less on time (usually early).\n\nThe biggest thing for me though is to just sit down and figure out what it will take me to get there on time, then set alarms for when I need to start thinking about it - then do my best to just not think about it until I hear that alarm. I do have to remind myself a few times when my mind drifts to the impending appointment, but I need to stop, and push my thinking back to whatever I am working on. Trust the process. The alarm will give me plenty of time to worry about it once it goes off - until then I do not need to worry about it. \n\nSecondary to all of that, I have my bag usually ready or close to ready to go. The bag has all the stuff I want to take with me so I just need to move any specific items for that trip over. Then, when it is time to go I just grab my bag and do not need to stop and think about all the things that should be inside the bag (this can easily lead to being late so I did this very early on and it has served me well for decades).",
