    "selftext": "Im just curious how many of us are \"different\" here in any way. For example I hate popular music because it's boring which mostly means it's silent in lower registers.\n\nMeanwhile I love anything with strong rhythmic section and here's the best part: heavy metal music makes me fall asleep! Especially when I'm on a train, have my headphones on, full volume and somehow it makes me fall asleep more easily than in silence.\n\nIs it common for us? Do you have any other unusual reactions to music?\n\nEdit: I mean mostly this kind of music putting me to sleep",

Heavy metal is soaked in distortion and saturation, which fills the frequency spectrum with noise, creating that fuzzy sound. It's a step closer to white noise, which is just an equal distribution of all frequencies at once.\n\nIt mostly just boils down to preference. People can find it calming because it blocks out other noise and gives you a consistent sound to focus on. It probably also involves some classical conditioning, and placebo effect. But there's no evidence to suggest that it would have anything to do with ADHD",

I'm kinder to myself about it and when I do practice, I use it as I'm supposed to. \n\nAs for music listening... Lately I've been on a trance/techno kick and I'm playing catch-up on the Armin Van Buuren A State Of Trance episodes. Lots of variety and can help keep me focused.  I cycle through. Get sick of something and move on to the next genre, and eventually find myself back around again. My favorite always changes.",

The kind of music i like is chaotic and intricate, like, imagine a song starts with guitar, then they add drums, then another instrument until the sound is so complex it makes me euphoric. In the same fashion, music that starts quiet and becomes louder as it progresses or music that change completely into the end. My favorite band has a song that's metal and very elaborate and in the last 10 seconds it becomes Bossa Nova. It always gives me the chills",

I was exposed to kpop a lot as a child in the 90's and gravitated to whatever tunes appealed to me personally. Some friends love metal, some love hip hop, some love punk rock, and some only listened to indie, etc... I think it's just personal preference.

In the past, I had felt alone and alien. But among colleagues and peers I feel both weird and deeply understood. Not everybody may think quite like you. But everybody is able to think alike and see the connections on a deeper level.\n\ni wonder if you may feel at home among musicians, and perhaps wish to create music yourself. I highly recommend it. But I am biased as this is simply the most important meaningful pursuit in my life. That\u2019s unusual as a relationship with Music.

But I do have some sick setups and lyrics that pop up on all my screens when music comes on \ud83d\ude02 I also love to help homies with their setups so they can pighy back on my research\n\nI also have a broad ass taste. Punk, tons of hip hop, select pop, indie, tons of EDM, singer song-writer, jazz, heavy metal, classic rock, avant garde, and so on. The first CD I got was Space Jam soundtrack and the first album I bought myself was Marshall Mathers LP and I still love both!\n\nI collect records and love going to the record store and rifling through physical media. Nothing like wine and records for a Sunday. No destination driving just to feel the air and listen to music is also \ud83e\udd0c\n\nI had a rough time when I was a kid and music was how I escaped.
