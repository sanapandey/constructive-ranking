Now after almost four decades, I\u2019m told my struggles and failures aren\u2019t my fault. What recommendations do you have as I navigate this new diagnosis and adapt to medication?\n\nI\u2019ve began watching Dr. Barkley\u2019s lecture that\u2019s pinned here. I\u2019m current waiting on his book, \u201cTaking Charge of Adult ADHD.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m anxious but hopeful. I\u2019m just super bummed I spent my entire life wishing I was as smart as other people, when it was just a matter of getting a diagnosis and finding treatment. Thank you for your time and any feedback. ",

I am a little way behind you (awaiting main assessment) but having received an autism diagnosis 5 years ago I can totally identify with your upset and frustrations.\n\n\nI feel short changed and let down. I'm pushing 50. Thinking about all the lost years and struggles.\n\n\nI know I can be quite resourceful and maybe 20, or even 10 years ago I might have had more positivity about future possibilities.\n\n\nCurrently, not so sure I've got anything left in the tank. Time will tell once I am diagnosed and medicated.\n\n\nI have received some very thoughtful and positive replies from others late diagnosed like us, who feel energised and ready to take on new challenges, hopefully we will too.\n\n\nGood luck fellow traveller.",

I\u2019m sorry to hear that you found out about your autism later in life, but I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019re working to get an ADHD diagnosis. \n\nNot having much in the tank has to resonate with so many with a late life diagnosis. I hope I have enough left to take advantage of the treatment and start living life normally as possible. \n\nThanks again for your insight and sharing your story. It means a lot to have a community of supporters.",
