    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been feeling so drained lately, and I can\u2019t help but wonder\u2014why do 4 college classes feel so much more exhausting than the 6 or 7 I took in high school? I\u2019m already burnt out, and it\u2019s only my second semester. I can see why the statistics on college completion are so low\u2014this is harder than I expected.\n\nIn high school, there were many classes, but they were more structured. You had teachers constantly checking in, and there was more support when things got tough. Now in college, it\u2019s like you\u2019re expected to figure everything out on your own, and the material is far more complex. It\u2019s not just about attending class\u2014there\u2019s hours of independent study, multiple assignments due in the same week, and exams that can make or break your grade. It\u2019s a lot of mental and emotional effort, and it feels like I\u2019m always chasing deadlines, even with just 4 classes.\n\nI\u2019m considering cutting back to 3 classes next year, even though it will take longer to finish my degree. At this point, I\u2019d rather focus on quality rather than rush through and risk burning out completely. I\u2019m typically an A-B student, sometimes a C when things aren\u2019t going well, but right now I\u2019ve got 2 A\u2019s, a D+, and an F in my science courses. It\u2019s a lot to handle, and it\u2019s discouraging when you feel like you\u2019re giving it your all but the results aren\u2019t what you expect.\n\nWhat helped you push through burnout? I know it\u2019s a holiday, so no need to respond immediately, but I\u2019d appreciate hearing your thoughts.\n\n",

Sooner or later you\u2019ll realise everyone else is too, to a greater or lesser extent.\n\n\nLife isn\u2019t a sprint, it\u2019s a marathon. Unless you\u2019ve got some kind of visa requirement, you don\u2019t NEED to take a full study load. Cut back to 3 classes. Maybe 2. Pick up an extra curricular activity. Spend time outdoors. Enjoy your time, because it can\u2019t be rewound and done again.\u00a0",

So, you're practically taking the equivalent of 6 college-level classes (at least in my perspective). I've been trying to look for a way I can keep my science class on my schedule, but I think it would just be best for me to cut it off this semester so I can get my mental state in order. And hey, just think of it like this, you can always take it again at a later time, when you're more prepared.",
