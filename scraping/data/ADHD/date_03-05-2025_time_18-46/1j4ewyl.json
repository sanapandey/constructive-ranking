    "selftext": "I was diagnosed early 2023 with ADHD (comorbid GAD and ASD) but can't be medicated for other health reasons. I struggle a lot in school (organisation, time management, assigned reading, random forgetfulness of things I've known for years) and with pretty basic stuff like consistent personal hygiene and keeping my living and study space clean (nothing new to you all, I'm sure).\n\nI've been given some pretty vague tips on how to manage symptoms as well as dietary adjustments (generally, I think I eat pretty well, but I'm almost constantly craving carbs and salt), but I haven't been able to consistently implement them, both because of difficulty building routine and fluctuating energy levels.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for managing ADHD, especially in regards to study? If anyone has any tips or advice regarding other facets of life, they'd be appreciated as well.",
