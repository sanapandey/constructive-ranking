    "selftext": "Hi! ADHD inattentive type here. Like many of us, my mind is busy and I\u2019m thinking about too many things at once nearly all the time. However, there are a few activities that truly seem to clear my mind when I do them, like skiing and riding horses. When I do these things, I\u2019ve realized that I am entirely focused on the activity and my mind doesn\u2019t wander. Running, cycling, tennis and other forms of exercise I\u2019ve tried don\u2019t work. I suspect it is the combination of physical activity and a bit of fear that successfully centers me.\n\nWhat activities successfully clear your mind? Does anyone have suggestions for hobbies like skiing and riding horses that are physical and have a bit of an adrenaline rush? \n\nEdit: Ski season is over for me and I haven\u2019t ridden horses in years because of an accident. Looking for something I can do in the ski off season (spring, summer, fall). I\u2019m thinking about trying sailing\u2014anyone had luck with it? I suspect surfing could work but I don\u2019t live where I can surf. \n\n",

Flat lake water is pretty boring. High winds and choppy waters add just enough danger and keep it interesting.",

I live in the mid Atlantic US, though, so our ski season is over and I have no plans to travel for skiing anymore this season (already had my big ski trips). I prefer skiing the Alps or the Rockies (Alps villages are amazing but Canadian Rockies powder is amazing). I think east coast skiing is fine in a pinch but we don\u2019t get much powder (or any) where I am.\n\nI haven\u2019t actually ridden horses in over 5 years. That\u2019s why I need new hobbies!",

There are most likely some skate parks nearby if you live in a city but an empty parking lot or a sidewalk is best for beginning. It could also transfer over to snowboarding if you want to try that",
