    "selftext": "As the title says I started Vyvanse pretty recently, and it\u2019s been working wonders for me in the day time, but it is making it almost impossible for me to get a reasonable amount of sleep. I typically go to bed at 10-11 but I\u2019m not falling asleep until 2 am most of the time and waking up at 7-7:30. Is this something that gets better with time, or will it only devolve further? ",

It\u2019s been a while since I started on it and I remember now it took a few days for my hunger cues to return. My doctor had a follow up to go over how the first month went before re-prescribing, and by then everything had settled.",

It feels like I hadn't taken any medication at all that day, neither a stimulant that's keeping me awake, nor a sleep aid that makes me extremely drowsy. It's how it felt to go to sleep before I had an ADHD diagnosis and was medicated. \n\nMaybe I got lucky that I found something that works so well for me, but I'd encourage anyone who struggles with stimulant-induced insomnia to give it a try.",

Are there other serious stress factors or any anxiety/depression you are dealing with? (For some ADHD meds can actually help with anxiety but could also amplify anxiety in others). What is your bedtime routine like? You may need to be a bit more strict about this given the new medication. \n\nI\u2019d consult your doctor if this keeps happening and see if they have recommendations, it\u2019s also possible that Vyvanse might not be the best medication for you. As others have said as well, magnesium is great if you take it routinely as well as melatonin can help if not taken long term, but you don\u2019t want to become dependent on melatonin in order to be able to fall asleep.",

And natural daylight also works great if you live in a place where there is enough of that. Would really recommend giving it a try. Both the luminette\u2019s and the ayolight have a trial period.
