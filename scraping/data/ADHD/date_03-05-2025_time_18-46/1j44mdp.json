    "selftext": "I was diagnosed almost four years ago, but thanks to the NHS, I was finally approved for medication only last September. However, I was actually given the prescription only two days ago (lol)  \n  \nI was put on titration with Elvanse 20mg, and oh boy, the effects were absolutely terrifying. On the first day, I just felt super sleepy and dizzy around midday, but nothing too concerning, I took a quick nap and was a bit better. However, yesterday, I genuinely thought I was going to die \ud83e\udd72   \nI developed the worst migraine I\u2019ve probably ever experienced in my life and kept vomiting for a solid 6\u20137 hours. Yes, I took the medication after food. I do have a sensitive stomach, so that could have been a contributing factor.\n\nThis experience has made me really scared to try other medications. Maybe stimulants are just too strong for me (I can\u2019t even tolerate coffee\u2014it gives me tachycardia and dizziness), so I probably should\u2019ve expected this \ud83d\ude1e  I feel a bit defeated and concerned that my body might not be cooperative when it comes to these kinds of medications, and I might have to accept that I cannot be medicated.\n\n  \nHas anyone had similar experiences when introducing adhd meds?",
