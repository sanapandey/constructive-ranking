    "selftext": "I'm a 49 year old male who has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder (I don't believe that one), anxiety, and depression. I've always thought I had mild OCD, too but never considered ADHD because I'm a clutter-phobe and hyperfocused on straightening, arranging, and organizing my physical space. I thought that disqualified me. So.... over the last year I've been taking drum lessons (I've drummed since a kid but never had the patience to learn \"the right\" way... hmmmm). One day my drum teacher says \"I'm not trying to pry but do you have ADHD\"? I went home and told my wife what he said, and we looked up ADHD symptoms and I WAS FLOORED. Like, I was crying. I couldn't believe what I was reading. It was me to a T. \n\nEspecially hyperfocusing/obsessing about something (a hobby, interest, job, tangible thing) for days, months, or years, and then out of nowhere, moving on to something else. This behavior has tormented me since I was a kid. I had no idea this is a symptom of ADHD. \n\nI could talk about the other symptoms too but I'm very curious to hear other's experience with this specific trait, if you wouldn't mind sharing. \n\nFYI - I have not been diagnosed yet but have an appointment with a counselor tomorrow. \n\n",

Quick note: if you get an older psychologist they may be stuck on an old understanding of ADHD, so if they're dismissive I'd advise a second opinion.\n\n For me (figured it out in my mid 30's, then got diagnosed), it was like a weight lifting, and so many things suddenly making sense. Hyper focus on things that interest me (gaming, sciences, etc) but major struggle with boring stuff. Executive dysfunction making it quite difficult at times to even do things I wanted to do. \n\nAnd realizing that \"I'm not just a lazy sack of crap, my brain is literally wired a bit differently from most people\" was...quite nice",

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and on all kinds of different medicines that never fucking worked for me and nobody would listen to me just kept diagnosing me with bipolar disorder, I finally got somebody to actually listen to me and give me the correct diagnosis which I know is correct. I had the same epiphany that you had when I read what symptoms of ADHD and then I got irritated with my family for not not helping me when I was a child child I constantly was in trouble for talking and not being able to focus, but I got good grades and got along with people good socially, but always in trouble for fucking talking and not focusing on schoolwork.",

For a VERY long time, ADHD only was diagnosed in young boys who were physically disruptive in school, because our understanding of it was very ... limited.  Slowly, more and more people who were overlooked when they were young are finally, belatedly, getting diagnoses and help.  \n\nWhether you do or do not, I wish you luck in assessment and, if appropriate, treatment.",

            "body": "Hey man - I was diagnosed a year ago at 48(m) and I hope this finds you.\n\nI think there is a cohort of us late Gen-X who grew up latch-key and ADHD wasn't well managed and then we hit this time in history with youtube, tiktok and redditors bringing so much awareness to give us a holy shit moment but also caught up in the \"everybody has adhd\" universe.\n\nWe had some major neglect and trauma and it's hard to be grouped in with everyone else but here we are.\n\nSo moving on - your counselor may just pull out a copy of DSM, ask you the standard questions and if you check enough boxes you'll get a diagnosis based on the choose-your-own-adventure Q&A chapter of the book you land on.  There is a chance, especially if the counselor is online video chat one, they'll just say yeah you've got it, but can't prescribe.\n\nA psychiatrist trained in regular meds like SSRIs won't script ADHD meds unless they have a brick-and-mortar office depending on where you live. US?\n\nI can't understate the importance of an actual diagnosis from a neuropsychological assessment which is a long multi-day testing process that'll tell you exactly what's up.  That's something you can take to a doctor for the right meds.  They're everywhere and all they do all day is test and write up diagnosis.\n\nAnyway I just went through this last year so i'm info-dumping :)",

My wife has lived with me for 8 years and she couldn't believe how much the symptoms fit me. \n\nThanks for the info dump. I appreciate it.",

Yeah, I get super fixated on things, but it's not exactly mania, just a hyper-focused obsession... until it's not. For example, I'm a music lover and record collector. I get CRAZY obsessed with a record or band and will chase that record down until I get it and/or listen to a record 50 times until the good feeling is gone. Same with other things. I was a bowler as a kid and I took up bowling again a bunch of years back. Joined a league at a new \"hip\" alley in my town. I bowled EVERY DAY for years. Completely obsessed.... until I wasn't and I didn't step foot in there for 6 years. \n\nHonestly, it would be a relief to be diagnosed.",

It really hasn't changed anything except knowing that this is who i am and i have to figure how (somehow) to succeed after a lifetime of failure. \n\nThe Vayvanse used to help with my mood but if my depression is too deep it doesn't help at all.  im finding this out as i had a horrible case the past week. \n\nMaybe it actually doesn't work. I feel like i am getting even worse and i am completely uninspired and procrastinating on everything. I just sleep and stare at my wall or doomscroll till i go to work at my shitty part time job at 5pm.\n\nAnd yes, i do jump from hobby to hobby and it gets quite annoying. Also i try and do art and im so damn inconsistant in my style, subject matter etc. i always switch focus and get tired of what i do. Shit, i do that for everything, alot of the time i switch because i failed at it and then give up though. I have alot of problems lol",
