    "selftext": "I just realised that i can't think sequentially. I find taking notes in the form of bullet points is useless for me. My thoughts always jump from one thing to another. I have a bunch of note books but I always end up scratching my notes on a random sheet of paper somewhere and I end up losing most of them because I suck at organizing. I've been trying to find a method that suits me the best.\n\nThe closest thing that has helped me so far is mind mapping, but not too rigid. I notice that I have a good spatial awareness, so I can remember where things are easily, for example it is easy for me to remember the street i have to take to reach a destination after I've been there once, I develop familiarity to places really quick, but I don't bother too much remembering the name of the street (I don't even know the name of the streets near my house)\n\nSo now i use a mindmapping tool and I can access the memory by remembering things like \"Oh this info is next to that info\", \"I remember it's somewhere on the upper right corner next to that annoying theory I've learned\"\n\nAnd the mindmap is huge and untidy, not the usual block and writings connecting to each other, sometimes i just scratch randomly, but I know where everything is.\n\nI wonder what works for others who also have an unorganized way of thinking, please share your method with me maybe I can integrate it to my system.\n\n\n\n",
