    "selftext": "Ok ok I KNOW it\u2019s ridiculous to have this many tabs open but I had so many things in there that I wanted to go back to. \n\nHere\u2019s what happened: I have 300 tabs open on my iPhone safari and I accidentally hit \u201cclose all other tabs\u201d. Ok don\u2019t panic, I can re-open all recently closed tabs. The problem is that the list must cap off at 200 because there\u2019s still about 100 that aren\u2019t on the list, and therefore I can\u2019t reopen them. \n\nAnyway I\u2019ve been googling and can\u2019t seem to find a solution to salvaging the rest of my precious tabs and so I came here looking for commiseration. \n\nI promise I will never let my tabs get out of hand like that again (maybe) ",
