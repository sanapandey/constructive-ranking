    "selftext": "I\u2019m 4 weeks into medication titration. I\u2019ve been started on Methylphenidate, specifically Meflynate XL. I started on 20mg and have increased to 60mg. From the first dose this medication seems to have cured chronic pain that I\u2019ve been living with but hasn\u2019t helped my concentration or focus so my healthcare provider has suggested changing to Elvanse. Has anyone experienced similar chronic pain that they think is linked to their ADHD or improvements to that pain from the medication? Does anyone have any experience of Elvanse doing the same? \n\nUntil I started this medication, I\u2019d never acknowledged the pain I was in as chronic- I knew it was bad but thought everyone experienced it and just didn\u2019t complain. I\u2019d never been to the doctor about it. I was never aware that \u2018chronic pain\u2019 was a symptom of ADHD. And I still struggle to find much that says it definitely is. I have reported this side effect to my titration nurse, but they\u2019ve not made any real comment on it. \n\nHowever, on this medication I\u2019m not finding myself to have any more focus, or concentration or ability to start or complete tasks that I\u2019ve been putting off. And those are quite important for me. My prescriber has suggested changing to Elvanse to see if it is better. So I\u2019m going to try it. I\u2019ve had two days off of medication completely while I\u2019m waiting on my new prescription and for those two days I have immediately felt the return of the aching and pain. And this has really opened my eyes to what I was living with. \n\nI now find myself in a dilemma- if Elvanse improves my concentration etc, but not the pain. I genuinely don\u2019t know which solution I would prefer. I know medication is different for everyone, really just looking for anyone to share if they\u2019ve experienced anything similar. \n\nMy titration period is only supposed to span 12 weeks with a private consultant before an annual prescription will be handed off to my GP so I\u2019m keen to get as much out of this time as I can. \n",

            "body": "I remember reading that for some people, because they\u2019re less stressed and have some symptom relief when on the right ADHD medication, they notice fewer aches and some of their chronic pain decreases or goes away. \n\nI\u2019ve had low back issues since my early 20s. (And I keep stress in my neck/shoulders.) Prior to me being prescribed Adderall, I would wake up each morning feeling like I got hit by a truck. I felt like someone in their 60s maybe. Not mid-30s. And I would experience my back pain off/on depending on my activity level, especially sitting on the floor with my toddlers. And I would also have off/on neck pain/stiffness. \n\nSince being on the medication, I have very few days where I have back and neck pain. It\u2019s still there, but it\u2019s so much less frequent. I wake up feeling more my age.\n\nEdit to add: I think because I just mentally feel so much better on the medication, my physical \u2018stress\u2019 has significantly decreased.",

It would work a little maybe for a day or two. Both therapists used to always comment on how much tension they could feel in my back, in particular across my shoulders and neck. I had a massage booked in that happened to be during my first week of medication, almost immediately the masseuse stopped to ask me what had changed as she couldn\u2019t feel any tension. It was such an unusual massage because where I used to find the pain of it extremely satisfying because it would ultimately work out some tension I didn\u2019t feel any pain or tension for the whole 90 minutes. The downside though- was that I felt I couldn\u2019t zone out at all like you usually would in a massage. I was so aware of where her hands were and how unusual it was for me not to be feeling any pain in my muscles. It really wasn\u2019t relaxing in the way I was used to! All of that to say I think my body has shown a physical response to the pain going away.",
