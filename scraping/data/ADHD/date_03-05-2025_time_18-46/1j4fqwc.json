Monkey wanna do this, monkey do it.\n\nI spent a tenner on Harry Potter figures the other day, for no reason other than I wanted it. I just ordered a 45rpm vinyl of Surfin Bird by the Trashmen just because birds the word. (It cost me 15 quid) \n\nI absolutely hate being like this, so does anyone have advice for not being so goddamn impulsive? ",

Not checking my bank account, that shit\u2019s fuckin\u2019 scary, but I have a spreadsheet that I have numbered 1-27, and I can only purchase 27 games this year. I\u2019ve been writing each title down, along with the date.\n\nIt\u2019s already been working for me, too. I strained and moaned when I REALLY wanted a game, but I had juuuuuust gotten game number 2 last month. But the rule stayed in place.\n\nPersonal accountability is hard, too, so I\u2019ve told my friend about it, and she\u2019s been a little helpful in reminding me that it exists, and that I can do it.",

Balancing them on my head or shoulder while reaching in and pulling out items to drop them on the ground apparently taught me nothing because I did it again with other cabinets a few weeks later.",

The problem isn\u2019t just impulsivity, it\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re not putting up any barriers between the thought and the action.\n\nStart forcing a pause before acting. Seriously, just 10 seconds. See something you want to buy? Count to 10 before making a move. If you still want it after, count to 30. Then an hour. Make waiting a habit. Impulse thrives on speed\u2014slow it down.\n\nSecond, create friction between you and your impulses. Want to buy something stupid? Delete your saved payment methods, make it a pain in the ass to check out. Want to smash something? Put it in a box first, walk away, and come back in an hour. By then, you\u2019ll probably have cooled off.\n\nThird, channel the energy elsewhere. You\u2019re acting on impulses because your brain is constantly craving stimulation. If you don\u2019t direct that energy somewhere productive\u2014gym, music, creative hobbies, literally anything that engages your brain\u2014it\u2019s going to keep manifesting in destructive ways.\n\nYou\u2019re not a \u201cmonkey brain,\u201d you just haven\u2019t built systems to override this yet. But you can. And if you don\u2019t, this cycle will only get worse.",
