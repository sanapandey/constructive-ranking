Or, looking at a menu or a big display at a fast food resturaunt, and completely not seeing the info, **despite it plainly being there.** maybe asking a friend where it says something, and its obviously there. For me, I'm then stunned I didn't see it before, my brain completely ignored it. \n\n",

I walked inside, looked at the list of businesses outside of the elevator, then called the office to ask for help finding it. Told them I didn\u2019t see their office listed, but that I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the right place. I turned around while talking to them and there it was, third one down on the sign. I swear it wasn\u2019t there the first time I looked.\n\nI also can\u2019t stand signs that have a phrase split by another phrase in the middle. Like if it said Smith, Smoth, and Smath, Attorneys\u2014but I reads top to bottom\u00a0\nSmith, Smoth\nATTORNEYS\nand Smath\n\nI will never read that the way you want me to read it.",

It confuses people around me because they think I'm a smart guy but I miss very obvious things all the time.\n\nI'm an engineer and am really good at understanding how things work because my curiosity is endless.  But it doesn't happen instantly.  I can only take in certain details at a time at the expense of the \"big picture\".  \n\nEventually I will put it all together but it takes a while to hit that tipping point.  Until that point, I sound like a moron.\n\nIt's like if I was in a group learning about an elephant and after a few days they ask me how many legs it has. I'd have to guess and everyone would laugh at how stupid that is.  Well, I noticed something fascinating about the trunk, then how the ears moved, and why was it discolored on that right foot and and and....  Then a few weeks later we'd all know for sure how many legs it has but I'm the only one that can figure out if has cancer.  \n\nBut I've also taken my entire washing machine apart looking for a sock in the water pump because I didn't realize that it wasn't running because the lid was open.\n\nThat's why I'm not an electrician or a crane operator.  I could have been an electrical engineer or a crane designer but I can never trust that I won't miss something obvious in any particular moment.",

There will be huge signs saying \"use other door\" or \"emergency exit only\" and people will still walk right past the working door with the open sign, go the the locked door, \"read\" the sign, then still pull or push on the door 3 or 4 times before either banging on it or finally actually reading the sign and going to the working one.",
