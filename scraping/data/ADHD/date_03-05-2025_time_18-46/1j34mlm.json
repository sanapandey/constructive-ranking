    "selftext": "i got diagnosed with adhd this summer, but it\u2019s something i\u2019ve been struggling with for years. i thought that i was managing my adhd moderately well. i struggle a bit with paying attention in meetings and classes, and i sometimes zone out in conversations, but i thought things were mild and manageable. today i had a friend text me about wanting to take a break from our relationship. they told me that our conversations felt one-way and that i never listened or paid attention to them when they were speaking. i am devastated. i thought i was managing my adhd well and was able to converse and pay attention to people well, but i guess from an outside perspective, it doesn\u2019t seem that way. i feel awful about all the other people in my life who might be feeling the same way and i don\u2019t want to be hurting anyone in any way. i\u2019ve always been unmedicated and i\u2019ve never even considered taking adhd medication, but i\u2019m considering it now. it doesn\u2019t help that my attention has been worse lately and that i\u2019ve been struggling more with focusing on work and school. i\u2019m definitely going to talk to my therapist and psychiatrist about this, but i just feel bad for the people in my life who are impacted by this.
