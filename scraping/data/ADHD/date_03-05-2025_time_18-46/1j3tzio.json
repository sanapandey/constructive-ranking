    "selftext": "I have spent the last few years doing therapy processing the major cornerstones of my childhood trauma. And before that another few years doing therapy but not really knowing much. Anyways I felt like I was finally \" face the real world\" only to realize that my ADHD was sabotaging my relationships. I feel so lost. It's so frustrating. I'm 29M in Toronto. I'm on anxiety and ADHD medications. I'm trying to be more active and artistic. But I can't people lol. If anyone wants, my dms are open. Thanks ",
