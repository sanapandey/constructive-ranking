    "selftext": "First appointment - they refer me to standard mental health services as predictable who respond with 'this has nothing to do with us we can't help'.\n\nSecond appointment I ask for right to choose, the GP has no clue how to do it.\n\nThird appointment at the end of this week. \n\nBeing in the UK, the wait list for any asd / adhd stuff is 10+ years, unless it goes through right to choose in which case it might now take 5 years.\n\nAll this I've been asking for for over 16 years, and all that ever happens is that I get sent to basic mental health services for minimal mood quiz based assessments.\n\nHow do I know I have ADHD? I literally work at an ASD / ADHD / Learning Disability centre, everyone there can spot it, and I talk as much and the same as other hyperverbal ADHDers. My temporaral lobes are always on constant 'throb throb throb pounding as heck' mode. I can't shut up and talk like a freaking god. People just sit stumped and keep calling me intelligent or clever when actually I just have my entire brain overridden with verbal / logic IQ and little other function other than endless blabbering.",
