    "selftext": "My manager is on vacation. While they are out, I've gotten to collaborate with two different managers. \n\nIn this time, I've had to lead two urgent ad-hoc projects which would have felt stressful for me if I was taking lead from my current manager. However, working with different managers, the projects felt easy. I always knew how to locate the inputs I needed, I knew what was expected of me, and if I had a question it was resolved quickly and easily. \n\nWith my current manager, I have trouble understanding their explanations or instructions and often feel very lost throughout my projects. When I ask questions, I feel they tend to respond defensively or in a condescending tone and I end up not leaving with the full understanding I was looking for. I often only truly learn after the project is done and I am able to reflect on how I managed to get to the finish line. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? How can I can make this situation better in the short term assuming I remain in my role? \n\nThank you in advance! ",

I think you might get some value from analysing communication styles and differences between these managers. You might be asking questions in a way that gells well with some people but not others (i.e. your manager).\u00a0\n\n\nAlternatively, you might be doing nothing wrong at all. Speaking from experience, some people irrationality interpret asking questions as questioning their authority/competence. Such people should not be managers.\u00a0",
