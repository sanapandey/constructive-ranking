It was petty and we both got angrier than we should have.\nI\u2019ve been doing my best to watch my mouth during these moments and not impulsively saying something stupid that makes things worse.\nI\u2019ve made improvements the last couple years, but I slipped today and made a comment in anger that came out much worse than intended. I\u2019m angry with myself because I wanted to stop and couldn\u2019t.\nHow do you stop yourself in the heat of the moment?",

Taking even just a few minutes is an incredibly effective way to interrupt chains of thought that may be more reactionary rather than productive (i.e. that work towards a place of mutual understanding).",

My ex and I used to have the understanding that it\u2019s okay to need some time to cool off, but not the understanding that if you\u2019re the one that needs to cool off you also should be the one to start the conversation back up. My ex was big on needing cool down times, and honestly so was I. The difference was that I ended up being the one to start the conversation back up, every. single. time. Because he wouldn\u2019t, so if I didn\u2019t, we\u2019d just move on without the issue ever being resolved or even discussed, which isn\u2019t healthy. But if it\u2019s always one person initiating the solution-oriented conversation, that\u2019s not healthy either.",

When I get mad I make myself step away for a while and I like to continue the argument in my head to let off steam lolol. It really helps me to allow myself to be angry for a while, just not out loud to the other person in the heat of the moment! Being mad- fine. Lashing out- not fine. Once I cool off, I look at the situation from a problem-solving standpoint, and only then do I go back to whoever I\u2019m in the situation with and tackle the issue. My husband and I have had two fights, they were both over within a couple hours. No one screamed. \n\nWhen I return to the conversation it usually goes like this: \nI start by stating what bothered me, then invite them to explain their side. I do this without interrupting so we both feel like we\u2019ve said our piece without being told our feelings/thoughts are wrong or whatever. Then go through it again together bit by bit, getting to what each of us did that negatively effected the other through both our points of view (I felt this way because of that thing that was said, so in return I said the other thing) etc, etc. Usually some explanations and apologies happen here. Then I explain my idea for a solution and why I think it would work, then invite them to do the same. If I want to be heard and understood, I must also listen and attempt to understand. \n\n\nThe only other people ever really I argue with are my family. My brother is pretty level-headed so that\u2019s easy. My mother is challenging because she\u2019s incredibly reactive, interrupts a lot and doesn\u2019t really think before she speaks. We tend to be loud, hand-talking people in general so when we really argue it can get overwhelming pretty fast. I immediately lower my tone, take a deep breath and tell her we both need to cool our heads for a sec. \n\nI hope this made sense idk haha.",
