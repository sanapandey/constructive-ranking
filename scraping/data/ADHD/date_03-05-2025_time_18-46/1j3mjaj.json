    "selftext": "I just found out from my supervisors that I made another mistake at work. I work with those who have developmental disabilities like myself and support them in our own homes. Sunday, I forgot to write an incident report for their trip to hospital and I have to meet with my boss at their head office on Friday. I\u2019m panicking. I tried so hard not to make a mistake because I know that I don\u2019t wanna get fired because I love my job. And I know these things are very important for the clients to make sure that they are safe and that staff taking over my shift knows what happened but for some reason, I was so tired on Sunday and I forgot to write one because we didn\u2019t get back to their home until about midnight And it was past my shift time. I\u2019ve already had about three other write ups for other things and my supervisor says, she wants to meet with me for a supervision note. I\u2019m trying not to panic, but I\u2019m trying to look further jobs in case I get fired on the spot. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for someone who makes mistakes at work? I know it\u2019s my responsibility and I\u2019m trying hard not to defend myself and just try and do better next time but I\u2019m worried I won\u2019t have the next time and I\u2019m not gonna be able to find a job.
