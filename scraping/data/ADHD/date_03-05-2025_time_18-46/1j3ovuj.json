    "selftext": "If when I die, I get my own hell, it's going to be a dentist. It is the perfect combination of everything single thing that bothers me and makes me uncomfortable. You start out with waiting forever to be called. Then you're sat down in the room and forced to wait again, this time in a weird smelling room, that doesn't smell good or bad, but you still hate it. Then the real torture starts. You're forced to sit completely still, no fidgeting, no wandering, just building up restlessness. All the while, people are standing around you playing in your mouth (pause). There's a bright light shining right into your eyes, your entire mouth is painfully dry and stuck open, and don't forget the industrial machinery. You're constantly hearing some sort of obnoxiously loud whining, and they make your teeth feel awful. Also, everything tastes awful, no amount of jolly mint paste hides the awful taste of metal and dentist poison. And then after it's all done, they charge you an arm and a leg and act as if they did you a favor. I'm never going to the dentist again. I tried, I really did, but I can't do this again. I'm literally dreading it for weeks before the appointment to the point it genuinely affects my mood. Ftd.",

Not not going can cause a range of issues from seriously bad breath (goodbye dating), to heart infections. \n\nIf you simply can't tolerate it, consider sedation dentistry. They give you twilight sedation so you're out of it enough to not really be aware of what's happening and to typically not remember any of it.\n\nSometimes just switching dentists helps. Try visiting a couple offices and seeing what they're like. \n\nI'm ditching my current dentist  so I'm making a point of trying to find a solo practitioner again since they tend to have smaller, calmer offices with fewer sounds and smells.",

I need to go in and get two cavities fixed and I've been putting it off for like a month and a half because I am not looking forward to the torture and extreme anxiety \ud83d\ude2d \n\nI have a friend who is also terrified of the dentist but she's lucky because they can afford to actually have her knocked out for any dental work, wish I could have that. Oh also the numbing stuff they use has epinephrine in it so that also makes my heart race on top of my anxiety so my heart is legit pounding out of my chest. I hate it \ud83d\ude2d",
