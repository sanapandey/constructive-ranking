    "selftext": "Hi, so I\u2019m 24. I currently live with my sister and brother in law. I have been applying and searching online for rooms to rent in our city. I have been living with my sister and BIL for almost three years now. I have autism and inattentive ADHD. There have been a lot of issues over the past three years and I believe a lot of them are due to my autism and especially my ADHD. I just feel like they don\u2019t care or just simply think that since I\u2019m 24 and will be 25 soon that I shouldn\u2019t be having these issues. They think I should have a car, a house, kids etc by my age. I\u2019ve tried talking to them about it. They are well aware of my diagnoses. There have been a few mistakes that have popped up. Like I accidentally broke the toaster when I got a pop tart stuck in it. And now because I didn\u2019t mop the floors at like 8:30 at night when everybody went to bed and I didn\u2019t vacuum right because I\u2019m out of my ADHD meds currently so I didn\u2019t start vacuuming at the right time. So I kind of had to rush to get it done. I\u2019m just exhausted and I have begun to hate the feeling of having a day off of work or going home because I know there\u2019s going to be something new that I have done wrong. I just need to know if I am letting my emotions take over or am I doing the right thing for myself? If I plan to go forward to rent a room i intend to move out by the 4th of next month. They have already decided to take away my responsibilities and do it themselves or have the kids do it. I just feel like they\u2019re heading towards kicking me out so like they say I need to care about myself. I just don\u2019t know. I\u2019m emotionally and mentally drained. ",

I feel for you, and I want you to know that your feelings about this are valid.\n\nFor AuADHD, emotions are resource heavy to process. It feels almost as if there's only so much that can be processed each day before hitting a limit. The most important thing to do is to prioritize sleep, eat enough calories, and stay hydrated. Keeping up with all of these are going to do wonders to help process emotions and figure out how you want to proceed.\n\nAn impulse is acting quickly on a situation. Taking steps to plan out your thoughts and a path forward is a great way to help make sure you'll find a desirable outcome. If it'll help, I'm happy to brainstorm some options to consider.",
