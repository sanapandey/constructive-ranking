    "selftext": "Hi all! I\u2019ve been trying to do some research about having coffee with adderall er. I know it\u2019s not recommended to have caffeine with a stim but I can\u2019t give up the caffeine just yet lol. Everything I\u2019ve seen so far say to avoid anything acidic (like coffee and energy drinks) for an hour before or after taking meds. Most of the info I\u2019ve seen is related to IR though not ER, so my question is if anyone has experience with coffee/energy drinks affecting ER version if waiting for 2+ hours after taking meds. For context I usually take my meds at 6:15ish and I won\u2019t have coffee until 9. Thanks!",

I say this as someone who used to drink a Monster a day AFTER my two coffees.\n\n\nAs for the acidic or caffeine timing? Never heard that before, and I doubt it's anything to worry about.\n\n\nYou'll see a lot of people talk about OJ or acid and absorption rates blah blah blah, but you know what you won't see? Studies that support the statement. Because it's false. I'm pretty sure it's just stoner/tripper mythology sourced from actual science related to BP medications and grapefruit juice.\n\n\nThere's nothing you can safely consume that's going to be more acidic than your stomach acid, and even if you could, it's not going to increase the bioavailability of the drug. Grapefruit juice impacts some medications because it inhibits an enzyme in the intestine that breaks down some drugs. That's why there's a warning they attach to BP meds--such a warning doesn't exist on ADHD meds.",

            "body": "It really depends on your caffeine tolerance and also adderall dosage, tbh! I\u2019m on 40 mg IR and I wait an hour before having coffee. My heart is pretty sensitive to caffeine. I can definitely feel the adderall be less effective if I have coffee or any kind of acid before the hour is up. I suggest you avoid energy drinks forever!\nWhen I was on ER, I couldn\u2019t have caffeine at all. No matter how long I waited after taking it, the coffee would keep me up at night AND it made the adderall less effective. I ended up switching to IR because ER messed with my sleep too much. \nIf you\u2019re just starting adderall for the first time, I would be really careful because it\u2019s very intense at the beginning. \nGood luck!",
