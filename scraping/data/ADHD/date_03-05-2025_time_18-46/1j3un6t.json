    "selftext": "I recently got back on D-amphetamine and I don\u2019t know what it is but I feel so much better in my day to day life. Of course, I still experience a lot of symptoms, but I\u2019m also more in control of myself and my emotions. Maybe it\u2019s the amphetamine or maybe it\u2019s the feeling of impending doom if I don\u2019t succeed, but I\u2019ve been able to motivate myself to keep a consistent schedule. As of now, I\u2019m super proud of how far I\u2019ve come, knowing how much of a wreck I was in my freshman year of college. I really hope it stays this way, even if I one day decide to lean off the meds. ",

I tell people the reason I graduated high school is my teachers felt sorry for me. They didn\u2019t look for things like this back then. I can look back and see how things could have been different if I were on the right meds, O well, too late now. What has helped me is I now know why. That alone has changed how I see myself, and judge myself. Getting late here, but the best advice I could give you, don\u2019t look at the past if it going to cause you pain, look to today and the future and decide to do better, too be better. Good luck my friend",

I think there's outstanding evidence to show our environments, depressive-economical state, and medication refills have been altered. In a unsavory way. I hear the newcomers saying it's the turn-around. Understandably. The drug is considered a crutch by a lot of unforgiving parties. Your lucky to wrestle the sensitivity around being judged. Nearly escaping a 10 year tenure myself. It's never going to be a light-hearted adventure. I don't believe in happy-ending with these drugs. Especially for people like myself who were forced initially. Also weaponized against me later in life. \n\nNo one is prepared to psychologically come off these drugs. People are cruel with the shortages. Offering no cut and dry solutions here in America or anywhere in the world. \n\n  \nAnyways if you read any of this. I don't think your side-effects are your fault alone. I suspect there's forces at bay causing most people abnormalities.",
