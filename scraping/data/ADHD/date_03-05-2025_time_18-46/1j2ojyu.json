    "selftext": "I am at a loss. I don\u2019t know what else I can do. The worst part about this is that my psychiatrist is actually a very good person. She\u2019s the first psychiatrist I\u2019ve been able to speak to and get more info regarding my treatments and medication. She\u2019s leveled with me, she\u2019s explained her reasoning for certain medications, we talk back and fourth, this is unlike any of my previous psychiatrists.\n\nYet, when I brought up the fact that I feel I am lacking concentration, motivation, any drive, and that I feel like I\u2019d benefit from trying a stimulant again (I was diagnosed ADHD early on and given Adderall for a few years then Vyvanse up into my 20s) she basically said she doesn\u2019t feel like I need it because I was only working as a cashier and not even going to school. As if to say that these types of medications are only for those that are working specific jobs and going to school.\n\nI accepted her answer, albeit somewhat reluctantly but in the back of my mind I felt she was wrong. I talked to other people in my life about this and all of them have expressed they feel I\u2019m not getting the help I need.\n\nNow, I\u2019m unemployed. I\u2019m task hopping, I\u2019m trying to clean our apartment but I can\u2019t ever finish. I am trying to get a drivers license as I\u2019ve never had one and it\u2019s been so difficult trying to study and pass the damn learners permit test. I\u2019ve told her this, she knows this, and there has still been no change in my medication. \n\nI\u2019m getting frustrated. I feel hopeless. 80mg of Atomoxitine in the morning just doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s helping all too much and I\u2019m terrified I\u2019m going to be stagnant forever. \n\nIs there something I don\u2019t know? Could there be something on my patient record? Is everyone that is prescribed stimulant medication working a specific type of job and or going to school? \n\n\nI\u2019m lost. I want to do better for myself but I\u2019m struggling every day. I feel like an idiot.\n ",

It works almost the same as regular health insurance, except not all doctors take it. Medicaid already knows ADHD treatment is necessary medical care, they aren't going to fight you to get it covered like some private insurances do. \n\nDefinitely ask the facility, but also you can find other doctors who take Medicaid. It's a pain in the ass to find them because not every mental health doc takes it, but there's no reason you can't.",

Your concerns about your health are always real. Always. If it doesn't feel right, find a second opinion. Your insurance might delay you, but until you hear it from them don't assume they will. In my experience Medicaid never bounced me back on anything important. \n\nYou can always seek a second opinion, for any reason, and any doctor understands that. Doctors are human, they make judgement calls based on opinions, and occasionally they make mistakes. Even hyper serious things like cancer treatments can have a measure of opinion-based decisions. You can talk to another doctor same as you double check any other important decisions in your life. You are the only one who's able to fight for yourself, doctors don't have the time to do it for you. And even when your doctors are doing a good job, or have done a good job in the past, they're still only human.",

In the meantime, the argument that your life demands don't warrant a stimulant has failed; you are out of a job, and it's possible you've been limited in your ability to advance occupationally due to this missing treatment component.  You've given your current regimen three years to prove effective, but you still struggle.   Continue to press for what you need; ask what happens when a Medicaid patient is prescribed a stimulant.  Does it require more paperwork or patient follow-up from the provider?  Does something blow up at the pharmacy?  There may be more to this than meets the eye.",
