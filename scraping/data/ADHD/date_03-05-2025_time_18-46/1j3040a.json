I wasnt just not doing it, ive told my teachers this, with a doctors note and they still dont give me an extension. They say i had time to do it in class, but i cant focus in loud environments like that. Is it a law somewhere that i get accommodations for it??",

            "body": "So when I was diagnosed with ADD (in 1992) and struggled through school. My teacher gave me access to a resource room. It was a room with teachers in it where I could take my test in (without any distractions) and they would help teach the subjects I was struggling with. it helped me tremendously. My grades improved so much that they were going to kick me out of it. My teacher knew it helped me out so he would smug my grades a little so I could stay in it. That was in 4th grade. In my high school they had classes that accommodated kids with learning disabilities. I\u2019m in the US. You should ask your teacher and or counselor to see if there are any resources they can recommend. I hope this helps.",

            "body": "Yeah like others have said, the best way would be to go through whatever the schools IEP/504 plan or equivalent. You\u2019ll definitely need a diagnosis and a list of specific things your doctor recommends that would make your schooling easier. Best things to explicitly state in the plan (if allowed) would be extensions on turned-in work and supervised alternate/alone testing usually held in the guidance office or somewhere else. Heads up tho, they\u2019ll most likely have some type of screening process where you\u2019ll be vetted to some degree. My 504 allowed me to actually graduate high school with a decent gpa, so I highly recommend if that\u2019s available to you!",

Your parents and your teachers should meet, possibly with your guidance counselor to come up with an Individual Education Plan based on your specific needs.\n\nUnfortunately, after my diagnosis, my parents were like \"ok, go tell your teachers,\" and then nothing happened. So, I don't actually know much about how the process is *supposed* to work, other than not the way I did it.",
