    "selftext": "I have an appointment today with a psychiatrist to talk about what me and pretty much everyone around me think is ADHD. The thing is, I don\u2019t know how to tell the psychiatrist about my issues. Like it\u2019s a ton of small things like not being able to do a task for two minutes, getting distracted by literally anything, being extremely disorganized, among other things which I have noticed have gotten significantly worse when I started working. What should I tell my doctor on my first appointment? I don\u2019t want to simply get there and say \u201cYeah, I think I have this\u201d. How did you guys initially engage with your doctors about this?",

They will probably ask something like \"why do you think you have adhd?\" And it's perfectly fine to say that you have done research and find yourself in xyz symptoms, plus other people also suspecting you to have adhd. \n\nPsychiatrists and psychologists can only learn so much about their field in uni, it's impossible to know everything about every disorder. Eerybody in the field that i know agrees that the patient is always the expert in their disorders, in the sense that they are the only ones knowing what's going on inside their head. The doc is only there to apply the symptoms they get told to a broad definition of what we know as core symptoms and then rule out different things to land on what is most likely the disorder. There are definitely a lot of narrow minded people in the medical profession that simply won't learn anything other than what they've learned in school. But a decent doc will appreciate a patient that has put in work to try to understand what's going on with them.",

First of all - the doctor/medical professional will ask you some standard diagnostic questions to determine your symptoms and how they affect you/your everyday life. Second - if you do have ADHD, it'll probably be noticeable lol. My sibling was nervous (which is understandable), so they were jumping from topic to topic, forgetting the questions, finishing nurses sentences etc. To a person without deep knowledge of ADHD it might look like just a quirk of a character, but to us (ADHD folk) it's a pretty solid give-away lol. Not saying that that's going to be your exact behaviour, because symptoms and degree of them varies drastically, but it'll likely still be noticeable to the person who's diagnosing you.",
