The Enabling Act basically gave Hitler power to create new laws unchecked. I mused that it would probably be a left leaning person or organization blamed for it so Trump could, say, enact a state of emergency ban the sale of firearms to anyone who has made negative comments about him or his administration. They would use AI to scan social media to determine who the \"enemies of the state\" would be, and then the shit storm would start.\n\nI thought I was just being paranoid, but this fucker is doing some wild shit right now.",

And that means day after day of the soldiers feeling insulted, threatened, attacked by these ~~vermin~~ people whose safety they are there to ensure. If it went on long enough, Trump wouldn't have to order them to shoot, just let them know that he'd back anyone who opened fire in reasonable self-defense.",

Last night Trump said he is going to institute a mandatory death penalty if it\u2019s against police officers.\n\nMurder is a state crime, not a federal crime, unless against a federal agent.  Part of Project 2025 calls for federalizing state and local police.  They are already doing this in some locations for immigration.  Guess what, now those deputized local police are defacto federal agents and federal laws apply, including Trump\u2019s mandatory death penalty.\n\nI think it\u2019s more likely the state and local police forces and federalized militia with no formal training will be mobilized against citizens first (they have no oath to the constitution), though many of them are veterans.\n\nIt\u2019s shaping up that we may have a manufactured crisis to help keep the military occupied with something else off American soil.\n\nIf you look to the Gestapo/SS as an example, they were started as a federalization of local police forces rather than the active military.",

Think about it:  \nAs long as one person here and there is \"taken away\" for saying or doing something wrong the people around them will let it happen because they don't want to be next.  \nFor that to work people have to believe there is a way to avoid that fate.  \nIf too many people are targeted everyone's gonna get mad, cause it obviously could hit anyone, there's no clear way to avoid becoming a target - so the masses revolt against the system.  \nPeople want to avoid the \"bad thing\", whatever that may be, and most people (not all), will choose the easiest path. That's keeping low, staying silent in a surveillance state.  \nBut if the only path left to avoid the \"bad thing\" is toppling the system, people will go after the system.\n\nIf enough people are resisting, the surveillance state can only go after people on masse.  \nIf it does that it will show the people around them that it's pretty indiscriminate. That anyone could be next. Leading more and more people to join the fight.\n\nSo there's a \"critical mass\" of people. If enough percent of the American population resist, the coup will fail.   \nBut you CANNOT fall below that critical mass. Saying a revolution won't work is counter-productive.   \nEvery single person counts. Every word counts. Every action counts.",

The public can operate with a reasonable assumption that people taken away or shot deserved it in some way. The state can publish propaganda that any terrorism committed by revolutionaries is reasonably endangering their safety. Thus that paradigm is flipped, people are more likely to side with the state over revolutionaries because they're afraid of revolutionaries.\n\nTo an extent that is true for non-violent revolutions too because the state can simply lie and paint good, peaceful people as terrorists which they have done. But that's why revolutions are hard. Our propaganda simply has to be more effective than the government's.\n\nFor a violent revolution it is more difficult because the people's actions and rhetoric is going to make propaganda a lot more difficult.",

If Ukraine is backed by the EU and perhaps has EU boots on the ground that makes the EU our enemy and thus potential WWIII.\n\nAdd to that we going to leave NATO because Trump can't invade Greenland; they're currently a military ally. Leaving NATO paves the way for taking Greenland, thus alienating the EU. Trump's continual talking point of Canada as the 51st state is, in his mind, a way of preventing a military invasion. Regarding Mexico, they'll use the cartel violence as an excuse for military incursion into Mexico, which they hope will end as Mexico as a US territory similar to Puerto Rico (same with Panama). edit: renaming the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America is foreshadowing.\n\nI don't believe Trump is a Russian agent, but I do believe that Trump and Putin are collaborating with the shared goals of reunifying the USSR for Russia, weakening the EU, and the US 'unifying' all of North America.\n\nThe attack on Zelensky was obviously a setup to consolidate the GOP base.  The speech last night was a loyalty test for the rank and file.\n\nThis is all just a big hot take, but when I look for patterns of 'reasoning' behind tariffs and alienating our allies and all of the talking points, it all seems to add up. All of this is very far away, but based on what we've seen they're operating on a predefined timeline. Also worth noting that I believe DOGE is just a troll, a distraction. Obviously they don't care to actually accomplish anything meaningful or save any money. They're just a way to distract from the real goal...\n\nThe US is pivoting.

Did the general seem a bit nervous?\n\nAnd considering his recent post about protesting on campus, his overall rhetoric, and the free rein he gives to musk and others to sew chaos far and wide, it\u2019s hard for not to conclude that something is afoot.  \n\nMy view:  trump is not a natural aggressor. He\u2019s a reactor.  He needs others to move against him first.  Then he hits back x100 and justifies by saying he didn\u2019t start it.  He can claim he\u2019s just defending (himself, America, whoever). It\u2019s how he runs his bizz too.  If he wants to screw you over, he gets you to do something that allows him to justify his overblown reaction.  \n\nBut what do you do if the \u201cother\u201d doesn\u2019t cooperate?  You instigate.  Get rude, get ugly, diminish, defy, denigrate, whatever it takes to rile your \u201cenemy\u201d into acting with any type of aggression.  \n\nYou know that bully who poked and prodded people in school trying to get a reaction?  Eventually the victim gets fed up and goes berserk.  Then the bully moves hard.  The teacher didn\u2019t see all the stuff that let up to it and the bully claims that he didn\u2019t start it.  He was just defending himself.  The bully gets a slap on wrist.  The victim gets kicked out of school \u201cas an example\u201d.  That\u2019s trump",

Which in turn means that they are no subject to the jurisdiction thereof when it comes to immigration either. he could try to argue that our laws state that they can't come here illegally but that in turn means that they are subject to the jurisdiction thereof, which incidentally means they are citizens. he created a stupid loophole and who ever wrote that EO should have caught the clearly bad faith legal argument.",

He could try to argue that people are going against the law of the law by hiding immigrants but that is not against the law in this country as far as I know and therefore would be hard to uphold legally.\\* It also in certain situations requires the assistance of state and local officials. It is a dumb act that he is going to use to build his damn wall. He is only invoking the construction and money transfer laws in that EO and he keeps sending troops to the border. He is going to have the army build his wall, have money moved for it (which can only legally total $100 million if it is on US soil), and then say Mexico should have paid for it but they were going to slow so I, Donald J Trump, had to build it to protect this beautiful country from all those illegal immigrants and the gangs with their fentanyl from crossing and killing your children.\n\nHe just wants to have a massive show of strength at the border and then point to lowered illegal crossings. By the way it is impossible to actually calculate the number of illegal crossings because they don't have eyes on the whole border so they could just be better at hiding from border patrol.\n\n\\*Yes I don't need anyone telling me he doesn't care about the law I get it.",

Trump can say that federal funding isn\u2019t going to states but he doesn\u2019t actually decide where the money gets spent he is just in garage of making sure it gets spent how Congress tells him.\n\nNow just saying, well he isn\u2019t going to do that could be true but it doesn\u2019t do anything other than naysay the fact that real people are pushing back right now and using the power that they have to push back.

That is not what people want to hear and I get it I would rather he just stop doing anything but alas that is not how it will work.\n\nThis decision about the USAID money just came down this morning and he will continue to appeal it but it looks like he will have to pay those bills and will capitulate to it. Same with being told OPM does not have the authority to fire probationary employees, they just issued a memo last night, OPM, saying that the firing of probationary employees is on hold.\n\nThings are happening, not exactly like the majority wants or even on the side of good but things are happening and they will continue to happen. He knows he doesn't have a mandate and he knows he will need Congress to approve all of the things he wants to do or he loses what little power he has. Our government is flawed but it is not built for an authoritarian regime to flourish. they will try and they will sure as hell make some headway but the slow climb of progress is happening.\n\nAgain I could be wrong but I am hoping that the small things will start to snowball. Flipping the vacant house and senate seats is the first step and reduces their majorities to almost nothing. Then we hunker down, put out fires and build the war chests for the upcoming mid-terms and blow all of them out of the water. We don't have anything else in place to help other then outright rebellion and that will just empower him to do what you say. Peaceful protests and getting out to vote are how we stop this.
