As opposed to say aluminum and potash on the US side, which might be hard to source. \n\nWhat\u2019s more interesting is the amount of \u201cbuy anything but made in USA\u201d that is being practiced by a large swath of Canadians these days. There\u2019s even an app, and many grocery stores have helpful signage in their stores. That has the potential to be very damaging to US exporters as well as the very real US tourism cancellations that are happening through Canada. These are going to be there whether or not the tariffs stay. \n\nHowever mad you think the average Canadian is right now, you have almost certainly underestimated it.",

It\u2019s just a simple anti-dumping measure. It was negotiated in NAFTA, reaffirmed in USMCA. Canada imports a set amount of American dairy to fit into the existing national supply management system. After that set point is hit (something agreed upon by both countries), the 270% tariffs are imposed and trade stops. No actual dairy products are being tariffed at 270%. America has a >$1B dairy trade surplus with Canada, great deal for America. Yet this is being framed as exploitation and abuse by Canadians of American dairy farmers.\n\nLike I knew Trump and Republicans lie about essentially everything, but damn, it really is an art form for them.",

Bovine/meat, cheese, butter, sausages, eggs, etc.. are all part of Canada\u2019s [supply management system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_and_poultry_supply_management_in_Canada). It\u2019s discussed [here, under allowable quotas](https://www.unifor.org/sites/default/files/legacy/attachments/usmca_uniforanalysis_oct2018_eng_0.pdf). It\u2019s simply a method to discourage American exporters from selling more to Canada than is agreed upon by both countries. I can find no record of any tariffs on TVs, vehicles, and others. USMCA [maintained and expanded NAFTA zero tariff policies](https://www.trade.gov/usmca-overview). What I [HAVE found](https://www.trade.gov/fta-tariff-tool-search) was that 45% of a vehicles parts need to come from Canada, US, or Mexico to qualify for the tariff free status. All three countries agreed what does and does not apply for free trade. There is nothing that Canada or Mexico is doing that Trump himself didn\u2019t negotiate. Americans can trade freely with Canada up until agreed upon quotas. That\u2019s about all there is to say about it. \n\nTldr: None of it is true, or is at best a wild misrepresentation of the truth. Canada and Mexico have abided by the free trade agreement trump himself negotiated in 2020.",
