But while this is the boogeyman we've been told to fear, it's less true than textbooks would have you believe. Because people already use credit cards. A person making $50K/year may already be spending the equivalent of $82k. Giving them $32k doesn't change their spending habits, it just allows them to pay off debt.\n\nHow free money leads to inflation: \n\n**First**: You give everybody $32k, which is about a 50% raise for most Americans. \n\n**Second**: People buy stuff with their new money. Demand for certain items goes up, like wood in 2021. But supply chains can't make goods fast enough to satisfy the new demand.\n\n**Third**: Companies raise prices.  Partially out of greed, partially to cover the costs they incur trying to expand and speed up supply chains. \n\n**Fourth**: The price of *everything* goes up. That's inflation. And it snowballs as people and companies panic or just get greedy. \n\n**Fifth**: Prices are too high even for someone with $32k in their pocket. We're right back where we started. Money is simply worth less, you can't buy the same things with the same amount of money as a year before. $75k income now is just the same as $50k income last year. \n\n**Sixth**: Employees don't raise wages as quickly as inflation goes up. People are effectively poorer than they were before",

So how would we get this 9.6 trillion dollars to everyone?\n\nAlso because of the fed reserve laws the banks would need to have a certain amount of actual cash on hand when 300,000,000 people have $32,000 each in the bank. \n\nSo then the question is where are they going to get that money they will likely also borrow 9.6 trillion dollars from the Fed to hold off a run on the banking system.\n\nSo now we have 20 trillion dollars in circulation the value of the dollar would plummet overnight, everyone would move their assets out of US currency and likely into the yen or pound sterling. This would also cause the value of the dollar to plumet. By morning the value of that dollar would be 6:1  doing quick math.\n\nNone of that matters though because logistically it would take the fed probably 20 years to print 20 trillion dollars.\n\nUnfortunately money actually doesn't grow on trees.
