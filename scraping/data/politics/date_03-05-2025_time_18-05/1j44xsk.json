Makes me feel like no matter how much things escalate we'll just get to \"I, for one, do not support the extermination camps.\"\n\n\nThen again maybe this is something a lot of countries and demographics have been experiencing for a long time - the destruction of human lives being a dry issue we can agree to disagree on - and all that's different is it's finally coming home.",

One thing I haven\u2019t seen many people talk about is how Trump has made most of his \u201cmoney\u201d in real estate and commercial real estate is tanking all over the nation. How many open rooms are in Trump towers all around the world since work from home is such a huge thing? I know here in Minnesota there a lot of agility needed and happening in downtown Minneapolis. We have so many huge Fortune 500 companies here, but for example with Target not requiring people to return to office, it also means people don\u2019t have to travel here and we have a massive hotel vacancy, coincidentally we also had a hotel boom right before the pandemic to accommodate all of that work travel. So it\u2019s easy to see why he targets return to work for the government and so many other companies. Just another example of where this is and will always be about money.",

Zinn writes about how race was a construct that colonialists introduced to divide and conquer. Indentured servants and slaves had started to unite against their oppressors; creating a caste system allowed wealthy landowners to maintain control even though they were a numerical minority.\n\nSo now\u2019s the time to learn that lesson and make sure that the Musks and Thiels and Yarvins learn it and our kids and their kids remember it.

You have the authority to enforce consequences against the bully and if the bullying is strictly verbal you can ask them to stop and punish them if they don\u2019t. \n\nBut if the bully is beating a kid up and won\u2019t stop? You need to physically intervene. You can\u2019t just stand back and say \u201cplease stop this, this is wrong\u201d as the kid gets beat to death. If it puts you at risk, so be it. \n\nEven worse, if a *teacher* is acting as the bully and is the one with the authority to punish kids, you can\u2019t operate within the typical confines of authority to put a stop to the bullying/abuse. You need to do whatever you can at all costs to protect them/yourself, even if that means fighting back or calling the police/another authority who typically wouldn\u2019t be involved. \n\nInstead, Dems are content to just go, \u201cwell, the bully is the teacher now and what they are doing is wrong. Have they no shame? Oh well, hopefully they hire a new teacher next year.\u201d",

You need to brush up on your WW2 history; not only did we contribute to the problem by fostering our own racism and antisemitism at home, we (and many other countries) refused to take in Jewish refugees for quite a long time, resulting in a lot more Jews dying in the Holocaust because they weren\u2019t granted asylum anywhere else. We also resisted conflict about as long as we possibly could (in part because a war to help Jews was not popular with the American public due to widespread antisemitism). \n\n2. If the modern Democratic Party had leaders (or even a single one) who behaved as FDR did, we wouldn\u2019t be in this position. Instead, we have Elissa Slotkin giving a dem rebuttal speech talking about how she\u2019s glad Reagan was president when she was growing up lmao. \u201cWe\u201d are so far removed from the party of FDR that you can hardly call it the same party.

Even if you get someone like Bernie in you\u2019ve basically made them useless by not giving them a supportive Congress and the backing of a majority of state legislatures.",

Also maybe helpful to mention, I remember Kucinich running in the '08 primary on the most progressive platform at the time and he got nowhere.\n\nIn 2020, Biden was ahead in the polls for most of lead up to his super Tuesday victory, and the dropout of Pete and Klobuchar and their subsequent endorsements were only the friday right before that super tuesday. Even after when the field narrowed, Bernie significantly lost Michigan and narrowly lost Washington, both where he had won in '16. And from anecdotal experience, I personally canvassed for Bernie for 4 straight weekends in a moderately liberal Californian city and tried my hardest to lobby my middle/working class family to vote for the guy and the support just kinda wasnt there. Im sorry to harp, but the failure to accept after all these years that the voters really, reaallllyyy just didnt vote for Bernie and he lost on his own terms bothers me",

Then he stopped bullying me. Fast forward to my late 20\u2019s, a grown man still had bully mentality and tried that against me, and I over bullied him back, after months of keeping cool and not speaking up, because I had hoped it was just a temporary thing, and he stopped and he regretted messing with me, because at that age, I can use the courts. I dropped all charges, because I didn\u2019t want to exploit the guy, I honestly wanted him to change and be a better person. Anyways, adults who bully do not change if you stand back and hope that\u2019s it. They need to be shocked that you stand up to them. It\u2019s a developmental psychological disorder to become a bully, and it takes a strong shock to get them out of that mode of thought.",

Watching Al Green stand up like a boss just made their little ping pong paddles even more infuriating to me. The whole stunt seemed timid and totally out-of-scale with the threat the GOP poses.

WELL THEY CANT!! ITS TOO FUCKING LATE!! \n\nElections have consequences people and when not enough voters vote for the party that likes to govern and make government work for the American people versus voting for someone who\u2019s only intention is to systematically destroy our Democracy and restructure our republic as an autocracy like Russia, this is what we get. \n\nNot only did America re-elect this Russian agent as our President, they kept the U.S. House under MAGA Republican control and gave the U.S. Senate control to MAGA Republicans. \n\nThe only saving grace in the Senate is that they don\u2019t have a super majority of 60 Senators to pass most legislation in the Senate but there\u2019s little to stop the Senate Majority Leader Republican John Thune (R-SD) from deciding to change the Senate rules so that only a simple majority, or 50 Senators, is required to pass legislation. \n\nDems were faced with that same dilemma when they had the majority during Bidens term but ultimately couldn\u2019t get the votes to do it because of the ramifications it would wreak once Dems had to give control of the Senate back to Republicans, and so the rule remains a super majority.\n\nIn effect, Congress (House & Senate), as the legislative branch, is 1 of 3 branches of our system of government -the others being the executive branch (President) and judicial (Supreme Court) branch. \n\nAll three branches share equal power and are supposed to provide checks and balances on one another. \n\nBut when MAGA Republicans are the majority in both chambers of Congress (legislative) and the U.S. Supreme Court (judicial), and have vowed not to break ranks with the President and his army of billionaire oligarchs like Musk, there is very little the minority party can do until voters decide to vote for enough Dems in 2026 to put some checks back in place. \n\nThis is what we all get to live with for at least the next 20 months before the November 3, 2026 midterm elections. Say all you want about Dems and their lack of platform or messaging we are fucked until then. If we even have a country or elections to vote in when that time rolls around.",

Until and unless there is something that happens and takes the comfort out of comfortable lives in massive numbers, you just won't have the kind of momentum that most extraordinary responses would require.\n\nIt is not a good idea to throw all of your cards down when you know that you have no chance, unless you literally have no other option. As bad as this is, I still don't think we are at either the top or the bottom. Things can still get both much better and much worse.\n\nEven if arguing that some kind of massive and risky action is the only way out of this, the popular support for it just isn't there. The most engaged people in the left leaning political parts of reddit, safely on the internet, are not representative of the wider population, at least not yet.\n\nPeople are calling for drastic action, and it's hard not to see why, even if the situation isn't as certain as they make it out to be. But there is a difference between risking it all when you have a legitimate chance to succeed and risking it all just so that you can say you tried (maybe posthumously). If you are too quick to do the latter, you will probably never get a chance to do the former. Rushing in like that is probably more likely to make things worse than better.\n\nI hate that the best option seems to be protest and file lawsuits, biding time while things get worse in hope that conditions change so they can start to get better, but I don't see a better plan. It's not attractive to throw everything you have away with no real chance of success, just so you can say you did something, especially since you probably have a better chance of making things worse. The election was the opportunity to prevent this, and people didn't care enough to show up and do it. If there was some hard proof of cheating that might provide a suitable moment to galvanize people, but there would need to be hard proof and even then I don't even know if it would be enough.",

[https://theatln.tc/0wHIEquQ](https://theatln.tc/0wHIEquQ)\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it was a good speech, Nichols continues. Slotkin skipped the staginess or folksy posturing that can sometimes characterize these responses, and \u201cstayed away from wonkery, speaking in the kind of clear language people use in daily conversation.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cSlotkin\u2014like so many in her party lately\u2014failed to convey any sense of real urgency or alarm. Her speech could have been given in Trump\u2019s first term, perhaps in 2017 or 2018, but we are no longer in that moment \u2026 As a former Republican, I nodded when Slotkin said that Ronald Reagan would be rolling in his grave at what Slotkin called the \u2018spectacle\u2019 of last week\u2019s Oval Office attack on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But is that really the message of a fighting opposition? \u2026 Isn\u2019t the threat facing America far greater than that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSlotkin\u2019s response reflected the fractured approach of the Democrats to Trump in general,\u201d Nichols writes. \u201cWhen Trump referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as \u2018Pocahontas,\u2019 they could have left en bloc, declaring once they were outside that they would take no part in any further demeaning of the House chamber\u2014or, for that matter, of American democracy. Instead, they sat there and took it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlotkin is a centrist\u2014as she noted, she won in areas that also voted for Trump\u2014and her victory in Michigan proved that centrism can be a powerful anchor against extremists. But centrism is not the same as meekness,\u201d Nichols continues at the link in our bio. \u201cAmerica does not need a \u2018resistance,\u2019 or stale slogans, or people putting those slogans on little paddles. It needs an opposition party that boldly defends the nation\u2019s virtues, the rule of law, and the rights of its people.\u201d\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/0wHIEquQ](https://theatln.tc/0wHIEquQ)",

It was someone speaking calmly and respectfully with centrist language about how there's a better path, while the building is on fire.\n\nShe needed to cut to the chase, she needed to show fire in her belly and a clear vision of what needs to be done about it, because otherwise it's just words. Even the Atlantic author seemed to understate just how out-of-touch it sounded.\n\nShe should\u2019ve started by saying \u201cThis speech is going to be 10 minutes, not 2 hours or whatever that rambling mess was you just saw. I respect your time.\u201d\n\nShe should\u2019ve had visuals and not just the same old backdrop of flags. Every element of this \"production\" looked like any old day in Washington. It set the wrong tone. They needed stage direction, not interns or whoever put this together. They needed stuff people could look at while she's talking, bullet points, charts, whatever:\n\n* Ways Putin is winning right now, which are the same ways our country is weakening. It\u2019s not about Ukraine per se, it\u2019s about us. Trump is weakening us not coincidentally in ways that directly benefit Putin. This it the five-alarm fire in the shitstorm that has been the past six weeks.\n* Ways he\u2019s hurting Americans\u2019 wallets, through job cuts, tax cuts for the rich, tariffs that will make everything more expensive. He's saying there will be pain. He won't feel it. The billionaires in his cabinet running the government won't feel it. That's why they're fine with doing it.\n* Ways he\u2019s hurting veterans. He's firing them from civil service jobs, he's arresting them through border patrol actions, he's threatening to cut their benefits.\n\nAll of those points are winners with centrists, they're winners with everybody but the nutbags on the far right that aren't gettable anyway.\n\nAnd she should've made some major announcement that would get headlines better than \"Trump still wants Greenland,\" which seems to be what got the most traction. Announce an impeachment. Announce that Democrats are going to do a town hall in every district once a week until this reign of terror ends. Do the Democrats still not understand how the news business works?\n\nAlso, her tone sounded like a thespian performance. She was doing that whispy \"I'm concerned\" intonation and inflection that came off as an act, and that's in spite of me believing she does care. It was too polished. People are sick of polished. Polished politicians are the reason we've got the biggest income gap in a long time, maybe ever. Polished politicians are the reason our jobs went overseas and we still don't have the sort of worker protections every other westernized nation has.\n\nIt was a good speech, but not for this time. People badly want the system to change and that speech could\u2019ve happened in any year since World War II. People are sick of this.\n\nBottom line, we needed someone more plain-spoken getting to the damn point about the clear and present danger our country is in.",

The opposite of that is defending the status quo, which is the role the Democrats are falling into. But they can't do it too loudly or effectively, because, as you said, people badly want the system to change. And note that none of your suggestions address that issue - they are all versions of Democrats loudly proclaiming \"Trump policies bad, go back to status quo\".\n\nIf the Democrats want to win, they only really have two strategies available to them. The first is to just wait, hoping that Trump's changes cause enough pain that Trump's supporters turn on them and decide a reversion to the status quo would be better. The second is to articulate a different vision for radical change. Caveat: it has to be a vision for radical change that every faction in the Democratic Party can agree on, because they just lost an election and can't afford to jettison a chunk of their existing base. Good luck with that.",

Every action they take comes off as curated or means-tested to be the most palatable response to every political ideology. The problem is that everything about their response comes off as hollow and bland.\n\nThe lady (Slotkin) they had do the response even approached it by introducing herself as this middle-ground lady with shared values who was a vet and worked under both Obama and Bush. I wouldn't be surprised if she's the person the DNC and Pelosi are trying to groom to be the next \"up-and-coming democrat star\" because, much like Pete Buttigieg, she has this palatable generic air around her that doesn't scare off donors.\n\nEverything about how the Party is moving (as a whole) tells me they haven't learned anything from the election and are planning to just let trump destroy stuff so they can piggyback off of that to a victory and claim is an indictment on the republican party only to not address or give a lukewarm response to the real shit people are complaining about. You have Hakeem Jeffries talking about taking money from good billionaires when people are frustrated with billionaires regardless of party.\n\nThe only positive is that you have guys like Walz, AOC, Bernie and Jasmin Crockett calling out bullshit (admittedly from somewhat different angles but largely seem to be inline with one another). but for some reason, the democratic party refuses to listen to where its base is moving because it cares about catering to the donor class they they for some reason believe isn't also fine with hedging its bets on Trump.",

If you're asking about her voting record, she largely voted with Biden's agenda and largely voted against Trump. If you're asking about what she does for the party in the fact of Donald Trump, she is consistently out countering the admins narratives (either through IG live streams, speaking at rallies, or Interviews). I know she has a YouTube channel and does some of that stuff there.\n\nIf by asking what has she accomplished is to draw some form of line between her form of resistance and a more standard democrat like Hakeem Jeffries, then sure neither of them supports Trump and most likely neither of them will vote for this budget bill (I don't know the future). However, the issue between these two is perception. \n\nWhen it comes to politics, perception is what matters the most. When it comes to AOC, there's a reason why in her district; there was a crossover of AOC Trump voters because people perceive her as being real and less establishment as well as being for them. However, that sentiment doesn't extend to the democratic party as a whole because of inconsistencies. For example, Jeffries called out republicans \"simply doing the bidding of their wealthy donors and puppeteers\" back in December, but then last month, a report came out saying he met privately with Silicon Valley donors to mend fences. The perception of that is he is just a standard lying politician.\n\nSo if you're asking what she's accomplished on that front, she convinced people to believe she means what she says, and it's not just democrats she convinced. If you can confidently name other democrats who have done that on a similar level, I would like to know who.\n\nIts why i phrased it in the way i did. The people I mentioned are all at least visible at the moment and are publicly attempting to address people's concerns about what this admin is doing. They aren't doing things exactly the same way, but I'm always hearing their names come up as trying.\n\nOn a side note, I'm aware Walz is only just starting to talk, but him coming out and saying he might run, and If republicans aren't willing to host a town hall in their districts, then maybe he will host them to help a local dem beat them. That second part is the kind of messaging we should be hearing from Jeffries.",

His crimes were investigated and proven, those reports were released to the public. Then Trump won by a comfortable margin, with Republicans taking every branch of government.\n\nAnd now that he is in office, Trump thrives on stirring up controversy at a fast enough rate that no one can keep up. I'm convinced that he wants Democrats to start really focusing on his ridiculous \"I'm going to get Greenland\" comments so that they can't focus as much on all of the other stupid, dangerous, corrupt things he is doing. His base will not turn on him for wanting to expand the US empire, so it's a safe topic for him to distract the opposition with. And if he feels too much heat from any one thing, he just rolls in the next controversy. Maybe he'll bring up sending troops into Mexico again, or back to his plans to turn Gaza into a luxury resort.\n\nThey don't know the right way to fight this, and no one here does either. Maybe the battle was lost years ago in local governments across the country. Maybe it was lost when Mitch stole a SCOTUS seat from Obama and created a court that will allow Trump to do whatever he wants.\n\nYou can blame it on bad leadership or corruption, if you want. Both of those might be true. But at this point in time, there is not much Democrats can accomplish. Frankly, the people who voted for Trump need to start feeling the pain from his choices before the Democrats can really start fighting back. Sadly, the population is clearly not receptive to just being told what a danger Trump is. And I doubt very many people that voted for him are going to be turned off by him saying he wants to add a 51st state. Unfortunately, I do not think many of them care all that much about anything outside of their immediate lives.\n\nYou can say that all Democrats need to be putting all of their effort into really highlighting how dangerous Trump continues to be. Who knows, maybe that's true. But I'll bet that a large portion of the public has grown number to it after 8 years.",

One of the things I have noticed when talking to many whom are not too politically engaged is that premature alarm-ism is not helpful, it is detrimental. When people perceive us as being hyperbolic (regardless if that is in fact the case) they tend to be distrustful. Informational overloading such people is not helpful. Trump is certainly not normal but as of now he has a normal approval rating, so Democrats for the time being are forced to treat him as such.\n\nPeople don't like being told what to believe, people get defensive. Sometimes you have to let people come to their own conclusions themselves. IMO the best thing Democrats can do is to the best of their explain in as good faith as possible the things he is doing that are problematic, particularly on the issues/positions that are so indefensible there can be no good faith rebuttal. Voters don't like being lied to, you have to hope that eventually they will pick up on who is engaging with the political process in good faith and come to their own conclusions themselves.\n\nJumping the gun doesn't help, to treat him as an unpopular president, he needs to become an unpopular president. Until then, Democrats need to treat him like someone whom has the backing of half of this country, which like it or not (and I most certainly do not) right now at-least he does.",

They'll side with the loudest in the room, as seen with the right gaining complete control of the gov. Not to mention how hard it is to reach the ears of voters in today's media environment. You really gotta cause a scene to get noticed, and only a few on the left seem to understand that.",

It's already happening, even the MAGA chuds are getting upset with what he's doing. Six months from now, it'll be even worse, and people will be even madder. The best time for Dems to get their shit together will be the mid-terms, because by then the damage done by Trump will be affecting everyone, and that's when they need to start hammering the Republicans. Taking back at least the House will allow them to stop some of his actions. \n\nThat's \\*if\\* Dems get it together.",

He hardly had the \"exact politics and beliefs\" of every Republican voter, or even every Republican politician - he faced massive resistance in his first term from a lot of lifelong Republicans. But he tapped into something real among voters and was able to harness that to get his own party in line and then to win elections. So I think people here want a Democratic version of that, especially the progressives who are far to the left of the rest of the party. They yearn for a leader who will take control of the Democratic Party and pull it to where they are, the way Trump did with the Republican Party. The problem, of course, is that Trump was really a one-off. He won because the Republican establishment didn't think he could and so didn't take him seriously. The Democratic establishment saw that, and they aren't going to make the same mistake.",

He won by standing out as someone who talked like his base talked.\n\nThe average voter wants results. It's why Trump's blatant lies about fixing everything on day one haven't lost him that much support, because they don't care that they were lied to as long as they think the result they want will come eventually. If Trump declared himself king, their first question would be if the new king will bring grocery prices down.\n\nWith that protest yesterday, Democrats are currently not representing the anger and desperation of the average Dem voter, they're representing the mild disapproval of the *rich* Dem voter. Harris lost because of a lack of motivation on the left for people to vote for her, and this proves that in five months they still don't understand that.",

The liberal agenda is often scoffed at for its strong emphasis on things that just don\u2019t affect the majority of citizens. This isn\u2019t to say that trans-women in sports, abortion, safety nets, aren\u2019t important\u2014but making them prominent issues instead of things that are naturally improved by true Democracy, our messaging is lacking broad appeal. \n\nThe economy should be the most urgent issue. Voters need to be (re)educated about performance under D\u2019s vs R\u2019s. There needs to be a comprehensive economic plan. We need to educate more people about how the top tax rates work, because a whole lot of people making under $100K believe that a tax increase for the wealthy and corporations is going to lower their paychecks. We need to stop the tax cut bleed from the super rich and their mega-corps. \n\nAnd damn it, immigration needs an actual change in law, not just arguments over whether or not undocumented people get to stay. The system needs a complete overhaul. The process needs to be streamlined and law-abiding dreamers and their parents need to have a clear path to citizenship. \n\nIf Universal health care isn\u2019t passable right now, then how can we encourage the development of not-for-profit health insurance companies for those not eligible for Medicaid/Medicare? (Believe it or not, Blue Cross started off as a nonprofit and in a short time back then the insured population went from 10% to 60%. Source: https://stanmed.stanford.edu/how-health-insurance-changed-from-protecting-patients-to-seek ). \n\nThere\u2019s just so much more that needs to be front and center in the Democratic platform in order for us to take back the Senate, Presidency, and States. We need to truly speak to the homeowners and those wishing to buy a home. To those who are concerned about the unstable job market. To the parents struggling to buy groceries. Everything else on the agenda \u2014 inclusivity, equal rights for all, women\u2019s reproductive rights\u2014is known. They are important. But they shouldn\u2019t be the dominant focus when trying to persuade independents and Republicans to swing.",

If they go that route, the Republicans will just double and triple down on portraying all Democrats as being the \"unreasonable\", \"deranged\" ones while putting on a calm act themselves. It fools dumb people all the time.\n\nDidn't you ever go to elementary school and see those times when one kid will provoke another by poking them in the back or saying mean stuff while the teacher's not looking, and then, when the kid who's being picked on finally loses it and blows up, the bully kid puts on that calm, innocent act like, \"What did I do? I didn't do anything. I'm being calm over here.\" Then, the teacher believes the calm kid because people often equate \"calm\" with \"reasonable\" and looks at the kid who just got upset like they're the problem and acting out for no reason, maybe even punishing that kid and letting the bully off completely. Republicans these days live their whole lives like that bully kid from the classroom, trying to provoke other people and then putting on an act like they didn't do anything so nobody can criticize them, probably because they *were* that bully kid when they were younger, they saw how easily fooled dumb teachers are, and they've been doing that stuff ever since *because it always works for them*. It always works for them because other people aren't smart enough to figure it out, even though I'm sure they've seen the trick over and over, and they are easily manipulated into playing their elementary school games. Too many voters are exactly like the pushover teachers who can't figure out what's going on or just find it easier to side with the bully, and the bullies know it.\n\nI think what Democrats are doing right now might actually be the best thing they can do - let it all hit the fan. Too many voters wanted this or at least where okay with it, and if they raise a fuss and try to stop what the voters (apparently) wanted, they're just going to get a lot of unfair flak. It would be pointlessly painful, so instead, they're giving the babies their rattles and let them see what's wrong with everything they thought they wanted. Sometimes, the only way people without imagination or broader vision can understand something is to experience it themselves, so Democrats are, for the most part, standing back and letting the full experience hit people fully in the face. By neither taking part in it nor trying to stop it, they can honestly say, \"We never supported this. YOU supported this. You got what you wanted, and if you're not happy, you can let us know at any time when you're ready to stop. We'll be waiting.\" Then sit back, calm and collected, and watch the Republicans face the fact that they've got no one to blame but themselves.",

My physical therapist tried to get me to look at them and I just refused to do so. I could not face seeing the reality of what had happened. Sure I still had fingers but they had chunks taken out of them and to me they would be hideous no matter what. I could not face that. So I get it. If I just didn't look at them it would still be the same. Things would be normal. Our elected Democrats desperately need and want things to be normal. There is also for them a strategy to this. They truly think that if they present themselves as the 'normal', adult people in the room then voters will see that they are the ones who should be elected. They really don't and won't get it. We are no longer in Kansas Toto and something has to be done.\n\nEdit: note that it is the American people who have to act. Our representatives won't without us having their backs and giving our support. AOC, Sanders and others do what they are doing because they have the support of their constituents.

Dem leadership needs to shift gears and treat the GOP leadership like the narcissists and pyschopaths they are. \n\nThe GOP won't like it, they will throw a fit, and they will threaten. But that it to be expected and only works if the Dem leadership wants to try and stay safe. \n\nDem leadership needs training on how to negotiate and manage a family dynamic when there is a narcissist at the helm. They need to be willing to take the risk in the short term of their safety and calm, to allow (and even speed up) the narcissist rage long enough for the narcs to learn that it no longer works.\n\nI understand they are trying not to make things worse, but narcissists depend on their flying monkies to feel this way, because it allows them to do what they want. There is always worse to threaten. At what point does the current situation get bad enough that the Dem leadership stops trying to be safe, and instead is willing to take the hit, be unsafe for a little while, to push the GOP leadership out, regardless of their threats or their feelings?",

They are not the party of trump and I would like to know what they are supposed to do against people that voted trump into office.

However all of the red states felt that a rich man with his rich cabinet could do a better job, but they did not know that after the election, that they would eliminate benefits needed for them through the government for which they now know they need, and I really think it is unfair for people to keep thinking that the democrats should do the heavy lifting to get people back to understanding that the government is for the people and their security, and not to give the rich tax breaks on the backs of the benefits people need to survive. Maybe this is the democrat's way of letting the people come further who voted him in, my question? what more can they do. The old saying, sometimes you have to hit rock bottom before you realize what you had wasn't that bad after all. Even if democrats go into the red states, will people listen and understand that the government is govern by the people, for the people.
