You should check out district maps of Texas and North Carolina sometime; it's utterly heinous shit.\n\nThat's part of why Republicans have been constantly screaming about voter fraud down here for the past 15 years - though there is no evidence to suggest voter fraud is at all prevalent, much less in numbers that would sway a vote, it (much like Trump's claim that fentanyl is the reason for the tarrifs on Canada & Mexico) is complete bullshit and an utter fabrication meant to afford lip-service justification for disenfranchisement of registered voters.\n\nConsequently laws that disproportionately affect non-whites and other demographics likely to vote against the GOP get passed, and people usually do not find out about their removal from the rolls until they arrive at a polling station - provided their polling station wasn't closed down to nebulous \"budget constraints.\"\n\nAll this results in lower reported voter turn-out and it ultimately is a type of election manipulation.",

As a western observer, I disagree with Ford on all policy positions but I get the impression that is sincerely on Team Canada. Ford seems like a unique standout within the Canadian conservative sphere in that he isn't a MAGA-style conservative. His policies are still garbage, but I don't think he'd sell out to Americans.\n\nIf you want to see what a complete MAGA sellout looks like for comparison check out Premier Smith in Alberta. [Ford has been aggressive and unapologetic about retaliation against America](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ford-election-win-tariffs-eve-1.7472940), meanwhile [Smith went to Florida to personally grovel for an oil exception on tarrifs](https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/bell-what-went-down-donald-trump-danielle-smith-mar-a-lago) while also [being the only Premier to refuse to present a unified front.](https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/braid-danielle-smith-national-demon-shattering-premiers-unity)",

It will help us figure out which to shoot, if you guys try to invade us.\n\nPissing off all Canadians is a feat bordering on a holy miracle, we're very hard to piss off as a people. But, somehow, you found Trump/Musk, who apparently, are uniquely qualified for that particular job. Well done...I guess?...\n\nAmericans and Canadians have spilled blood together on many battlefields , and this is the thanks we get. Fix your shit ASAP, before global economic collapse, preferably,, please and thank-you, from your very worried and concerned friend, Canada..\n\nNo one else can save you, but yourselves...So, Don't wait to be saved...It'll be too late..You guys got yourselves into a nightmare no one else but you can pull yourselves out of. You allowed the wrong sort of people to acquire too much power. (root cause = \"Citizens United\").\n\nI suggest brushing up on Ghandi's, \"Passive Resistance\" movement for starters. Blue states control most of the USA's strategic naval facilities, (Naval Power being the foundation of military power projection since WWII, putting naval blockading red states on the table)), 2/3 of the US economy and more than half its population. Trump/Musk can't control you if you don't allow him to.,\n\nDon't be sheep waiting meekly to be sent to the slaughterhouse, we see where that got the Germans and Japanese under similar circumstances....Find a way to leverage whatever power you have remaining while you still have it....Your children's future literally depends on you right at this very moment in time. Future historians are watching closely, and ALL of you will be judged accordingly based on your actions or inactions.....There's no such thing as an \"innocent by-stander\" anymore...",

Being hateful and spite driven is just going to turn more people away from love and doing good in the world.  Reddit needs to follow Mr. Ford\u2019s example here.  Let\u2019s come together and do good together.  We can defeat evil, but evil doesn\u2019t defeat evil, it just breeds more evil.  Peace and love everyone.  We will make it together.",
