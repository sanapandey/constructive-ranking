Per the majority:\n\n> The present application does **not challenge the Government\u2019s obligation to follow that order**. Given that the deadline in the challenged order has now passed, and in light of the ongoing preliminary injunction proceedings, the District Court should clarify what obligations the Government must fulfill to ensure compliance \n\nEssentially, the District Court used a temporary restraining order to stop the pausing of payments. This is unappealable compared to a preliminary injunction. The dissent argues:\n\n> As a result, the Government must apparently pay the $2 billion posthaste\u2014not because the law requires it, but simply because a District Judge so ordered. (...) A TRO, as its name suggests, is\u201ctemporary,\u201d and its proper role is to \u201crestrain\u201d challenged conduct for a short time while the court considers whether more lasting relief is warranted. The order here, which commanded the payment of a vast sum (...) is in no sense temporary.\n\nBasically, the District Court found that they were \"likely\" to succeed on the merits, and then issued a essentially unappealable temporary order with permanent effects. These types of actions are heavily scrutinized by both Democrats and Republicans nowadays, especially when it comes to nationwide injunctions. A Trump-appointed judge tried to use a nationwide injunction in 2023 to limit mifepristone (abortion pill) to great Democrat outrage. Some Justices have said they are thinking of limiting it.\n\nIn your logic behind the purse power, imagine if a single Congressperson could use the power of the purse and fund or not fund things on a personal whim. That's essentially what the dissent is alleging.",

It's not \"taxpayer dollars\", but Treasury dollars. Government money does not belong to \"the taxpayer\" - it is the money remaining *after* tax is paid that is taxpayer money.\n\nMore substantively, what is the argument for not paying? Is it lack of performance? some irregularity in the contract? or is it simply \"Executive Order says so\", which isn't a legal basis for ignoring public debt.\n\nThe lesson going forward needs to be that everyone must hestitate to do contract work for the executive, because the executive believes it can just declare that it doesn't owe debt anymore, and nearly a majority of SCOTUS justices are cool with that.",
