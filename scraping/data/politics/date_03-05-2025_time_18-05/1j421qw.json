Every non-comatose American voter can tell you Trump's calls to action in 2024:\n\n* Close the border!\n\n* Kill DEI!\n\n* Cut inflation!\n\nAll specific, clear, and direct promises. Of course they were premised on a mountain of deeply anti-American principles, false promises, shitty \"alternative\" facts, and bad-faith arguments - but they rallied conservative voters, even some Biden voters, to pull the lever for Trump.\n\nWhat corresponding views did Democrats project in 2024?\n\n* \"Protect abortion\" is a valid position, but, clearly, not nearly as compelling as the opposition.\n\n* \"Promote diversity,\" \"protect LGBTQ people,\" and \"preserve democracy\" are too nebulous to inspire any specific action, and they sound way too much like \"maintain the status quo.\"\n\n* The remaining substantive issues - health insurance, labor laws, unions, wealth distribution, tax policy, defunding the police, energy independence, the Middle East - range from \"Democrats have no consensus\" to \"Democrats are viciously divided.\"\n\nI've spent 25 years watching Obama, Biden, Harris, Schumer, and Pelosi push this vague, big-tent, only-pursue-politically-uncontroversial-issues approach. The 2024 election demonstrates its utter and abject failure, and Democrats have shown no inclination to learn anything from it.\n\nThe big-picture result of this difference is a downward spiral. Republicans get in power and push everything to the right, hard and fast, without regard to what breaks in the process. Democrats return to power and spend all of their energy fixing stuff, stabilizing the economy, and just trying to maintain the status quo. Leather, rinse, repeat, as the country lurches ever rightward, and we're stuck with a 6-3 Federalist-Society Court that will probably never return to a politically neutral bench for the rest of our lives.\n\nThe long-term trends all seem so fucking obvious, and it's depressing and exhausting that Democratic leadership doesn't get it.",
