Second, the joke about Trump having tiny hands has been out in the internet ether for a while now. And third, a shell game is a magic trick where a small object or pea is hidden under one of three cups or shells. The cups are then quickly moved around, and the player guesses which cup the object is under. In practice, the game is almost always run as a scam that uses sleight of hand to transfer the pea between shells while the player is distracted.",
