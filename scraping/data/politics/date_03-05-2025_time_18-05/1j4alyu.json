                                    "body": "Yet the very structure of the system itself encouraged a two party political system to be able to gain enough power to do anything. Our government works for one side to have a majority, doesn\u2019t work well for a plurality or coalition system of governance. Even coalitions now need parties, but the only way to truly have a government system without parties would be to have a caucus type system where people get together on shared values but don\u2019t closely organize. It was a lack of foresight, and parliamentary governments seem to function a bit better and without the same issues. Can\u2019t blame America too much messing it up being so early to the democracy party, but it is pretty damn hard to change it to a better system because of the design of the system in the first place.\u00a0\n\nI guess the ideal democratic republic would be representatives voting on issues without heavy gerrymandering and with less power and organization from the national politics and party but more autonomy for each individual representative to vote and present bills in the way that is most advantageous to those they are representing. But the idea, kind of like a socialist or communist ideal, is just that. Much harder to actually implement in practice and if major parties with power didn\u2019t exist then it would probably be easier for an authoritarian to exploit the government with a smaller amount of representation. There is about a 30-40% threshold with this two party government where enough people can become part of the cult to oppress the rest. If there weren\u2019t major political parties it could be a lower percentage of a cult to overwhelm the government. Perhaps all democracies have what I\u2019d call a populism threshold, where the system of governance leads itself to be broken if a large enough amount of people vote for an authoritarian fascist.\u00a0\n\nIt may also be that democracies, like capitalism, have a life cycle. They form from a collection of vastly different people or cities as a necessity to maintain unity amount diversity, and then over time as they become two fighting majorities that increase in conflict they eventually break down and die until there is disunity and civil war, and then the winner of the war picks up the pieces and births a new democracy to help compromise between all the different people, and the whole thing starts again.\u00a0\n\nIf there is an arrow pointing at the \u201cyou are here\u201d on the life cycle, we are heading towards our second civil war and then reconstruction led by the winner, but ultimately reliant on democratic ideals to end the conflict. Peaceful transfers of power happen when the democracy has matured but hadn\u2019t yet divided.\u00a0\n\nSimilar to late stage capitalism where the collection of wealth, continued need for growth and consumption eventually leads to oligarchy and depletion of resources. We just happen to be doing both at the same time in the wake of a major pandemic to shine light on the cracks between the parties and the system. As capitalism booms or busts, eventually it collapses in revolution when the wealth accumulates too far to the top, and the wealthy horde too much of it. The middle class and poor folks lose everything and have nothing left to do then to fight. We either fight each other, or we try to reclaim the wealth from those hoarding it.\u00a0",

Maybe that\u2019s our way out of this. Almost convinced me a general strike would work, but folks still can\u2019t afford to do that and enough haven\u2019t lost enough yet to have no other options. That is where boycotting instead of a general strike could be more effective. It\u2019s easier to get people involved in a protest if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t have to do or buy versed you do have to commit a lot of money too. Tea is also perfect because you don\u2019t need it to live so you can protest by giving up paying for luxuries. Probably the best way to protest in a capitalist society is not purchasing or consuming luxuries until those in power need to cave. Stop buying anything Elon Musk related until he gets his ass out of the White House.\u00a0\n\nIf Canada wants their sovereignty they will pour the bourbon in the lake and stop buying it anymore.\u00a0",

The only thing stopping the president from serving in perpetuity was following Washington's lead. Almost half of the states drafting the constitution were on board with a president serving \"in good behavior\" like SCOTUS. There were objections raised to a lot of it, but the most important fact is this - we have a system that is working pretty much as designed. It was designed for the wealthy - they created the imbalanced Senate with the hope of it being the aristocratic chamber, and even wanted longer terms for it. We've made some adjustments, sure, but the framers ostensibly designed the constitution to deliver a nation favoring the wealthy and powerful. We're seeing the repercussions of that now. The only way forward is fundamentally changing the country with a raft of new amendments. That's out of reach for now, and how soon we may be able to have a chance at doing it depends only on how inept Trump can be. With how quick his admin's been at enacting Project 2025, I'm losing hope his first term ineptitude will transfer to this term.",
