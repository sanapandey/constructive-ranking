And they could have expanded it, but chose not to. They could have removed lifetime appointments, but chose not to. For the past 30 years liberals have allowed the right wint to gain more and more control of government, and stood by and let it happen. When in the 90s they went after Clinton for what was essentially consensual sex between 2 adults, they stood by. The Republican Speaker of the House was convicted of child sex crimes and they didnt even try to go after him publicly because it would have gone against decorum. In the 2000s none of them made any push bsck against the dranonian messures put in place by Bush. Many such as Hilary deeply supported them. And many other prominent Democrats in congress also supporting them.\n\nIt's been a long going process of watching the Democrats go in 2 separate directions. One part being progressive socially,  but still limited progress economically, but almost no political power due to how few of them there are. And then the socially moderate/conservative but economically sold out to capitalism and it's billionaires. The progressives were never going to win that battle and today the voter base is much more progressive than their representives. Perfectly example is people like Joe Manchin, a republican in everything but name, ran as a Democrat and no one in the DNC opposed it. You also see others who turned heel as soon as they got elected, see Christin Sinema and John Fetterman. They ran as progressive candidates, and then did a 180 once elected and became conservatives and obstructionists. They also regularly help remove more progressive candidates, most recently see Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman.\n\nIts much more than the courts. The entire congress is full of elected officials working for large corporations, and billionaires. And as long as money controls our politics progressives, let alone leftists, will never gain any power. And we will continue falling farther and farther right.",

Most of the US is willfully ignorant, and many of them are happy to vote for Trump if we won't cater to them.  When the Democrats refuse to cater to the majority, how will they win?  Right now the majority (supermajority?) are pretty head-in-the-sand.\n\n> Maybe y\u2019all will really make people realize they aren\u2019t democrats and democrats don\u2019t represent progressive values\n\nAbout 70% of Democratic voters are moderates or neoliberals.  We progressives and socdems are a minority in the Democratic party.  But at least the party is willing to compromise with us a little.  The GOP wants us rounded up, denaturalized, and deported.\n\n> I\u2019m trying to be less reactive so I\u2019m going to take a sec and say I appreciate where you are coming from and you are right for a certain amount of people but this will not wake them up to the fact that clinging to decorum will make them complicit eventually\n\nTotally fair.  I think we who are on the same side need to learn to work together and argue more peacibly.  I can be guilty of this as well.\n\nTrump didn't just win in 2024, *he got more votes than Harris*.  Even if election fraud happened to his benefit (probable at this point), we as a country make a bad showing if someone like Trump gets more than 20-30% of the popular vote.  The *reality* is that he didn't just get MAGA votes.  I think we should take *dead seriously* the reasons that non-MAGAs and even non-conservatives voted for him.  I KNOW non-conservatives who admitted voting for him that I just wanted to smack; we need to do something more than just hate on them because *they don't pay attention to the news enough to regret their vote*.\n\nPeople are (unreasonably) mad about a perceived lack of decorum by Democrats.  Some of those people (again, incorrectly) think the Democrats attempted to silence a political opponent by drowning him in prosecutions.  *Democrats will not win without many of those votes.*  So for us, it's decorum, or nonviability.",

And Clinton before him.  Similarly, Dubya was **comfortably** to the Right of his father.  Biden's no progressive but he's **far** to the left of either of them.  \n\nIf he didn't pick up a country in shambles, he could've brought about more positive change.\n\nAnd Harris, despite her history as a prosecutor, is closer to Biden than Obama.  In fairness, her winning would have continued a march to the Left.\n\n> We need to step up and lead. We need to show we care.\n\nBy rejecting the wants of people we *hope* will vote for us?  How does that work?  Remember, you're defending the attitude that our Congressmen should have thrown public temper tantrums that wouldn't change anything, and that maybe those Congressmen don't deserve our votes if they won't.  Do you not see the problem the rest of us might have with that?\n\nSome of us won't vote for congressmen who compromise their legislative power over stupid fits.  Others won't vote for congressmen who won't.  In the end, the Democrats can't get enough votes to win.  Again and again and again.\n\nWe all need to stop attacking the Democrats.  In the words of one of the 20th century's great thinkers: \"So why don't we start making a history worth being proud of and start fighting the real fucking enemy?\"",

We're talking about how people expect some sort of decorum, and even you're admitting that you don't want to elect the party you personally see as \"hey look, we're not the evil one\".  Can you not see how most people in your shoes would prefer their congressmen fighting for bills for their constituents over blowing their political capitol on protests and getting kicked out?\n\n> I\u2019m pissed they set up Kamala to get pushed off the glass cliff and take the fall. I\u2019m pissed they made us choose that way. \n\nYou are oversimplifying what actually happened to the point that it's inaccurate.  I can't, however, tell if you're doing so out of ignorance or hyperbole.  The biggest thing you're missing is that **yet again** Democratic voters believed a lie originated by Trump and it affected an election.  They believed him about Obama.  They believed him about Hillary.  They believed him about Biden.  They believed him about Warren.  Hell, they even believed him about Bernie.\n\n> They should have supported her from the start if they were going to push her on us as VP in 2020 with the understanding she was our person in 2024.\n\nNobody EVER thought Kamala Harris would have to be the Democratic Party frontrunner running in the General in 2024.  She wasn't planned as an \"heir\".  She was picked to strengthen Biden's 2020 campaign.  The plan was that by 2024, MAGA would be in shambles with its one \"charismatic leader\" booted and in prison.  In fact, that's one of the things BOTH parties seemed to agree on by the end of January 2021.  Nobody in DC likes Trump, but he has the power and resources to win elections despite that.",

What does decorum have to do with one's course?  At some point, we need a peacible and stable government.

My Democrats actually are responsible for why we have some of the lowest crime rates, the best healthcare, the best quality-of-life in the country.\n\nMaybe if people in Arkansas were willing to elect a couple of those \"Educated Elite\" New England Democrats they'd see the difference.  Seems to me you're blaming the actually-successful Democrats for not coming into power in a state that even Blue voters *wouldn't freaking vote for them*.  It sorta reiterates my prolem.",

Which is totally fair.  \n\nAs for #3...why?  I can see some value in a subset of that, but this is sorta antithetical to my left-leaning viewpoint.  We've HAD #3 in the tech space quite a few times, and it was HORRIFIC because it was only really used for things like child porn, stolen credit card trading, and \"how to make drugs/bombs/etc\".  \n\nAs for #4, I'm all in.  As are most Democrats in congress.  The Democrats have simply never had the votes to consider overturning it with legislature - the closest they came was 2 years of a \"tiebreaker\" congress.  Blame a few Conservative Democrats for not having the power to deal with something like Citizens United then.  As much as I hate Blue Dogs, I prefer them in the DNC than the GOP.  Would you disagree?  At least some of the time they vote right.\n\n> I want to remove big tech\u2019s influence and get money out of politics.\n\nCouldn't agree more.",

I said a public data cloud with truly anonymized data is TERRIBLE in practice because I've seen it.  It's worst-case-scenario.  I think you don't get it.  The original ones **had assassinations traded on them** with the entire transaction happening in plain view and being untraceable.  Imagine some group posting a list of names of Democrats and how much they would anonymously transfer in bitcoin in the event of those Democrats having accidents.  *That's the kind of shit that happened.*  WE DONT WANT THAT.\n\n> If you weren\u2019t so set on seeing my state as something less than yours and wanted to lift us up too maybe\n\nI don't see your state as less than mine.  I see your voters as not wanting what we have.  Look, we're kinda sensitive here right now about states thinking they're more/less than each other.  NH ran all its campaigns the last year on \"we're so much better than MA\".  The government there can go fuck itself; the people there are caught in the crossfire.\n\nBut more importantly, it's not our job to clean up the politics in NH.  Or in AR.  At this point, you're complaining that you and your neighbors can't elect competent people *in your state.*  If you catch me bitching to you about MA sales tax, I expect you to roll your eyes at me the same.  Not because I think either state is better but because state politicians *especially* represent the will of their people better.  \n\nIt's not MY Problem that your state doesn't want what you want.  Run for office and bloody change their minds.\n\n> maybe we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess but we\u2019ve been abandoned since 2008 by our national party\n\nHow exactly is your state not electing anybody useful the same as the national party abandoning you?  Democrats try to make all 50 states better, with mixed results.  Compare to Republicans who only favor Red states (some of the time).  But what **exactly** are you expecting of the Democratic party Federally?  Nobody gives us in MA any more special attention than they give you in AR because neither of us are swing states.  \n\nI'm lost on how you feel abandoned, and I can guarantee more voters would like to see the Democrats focus on winnable states.  Arkansas entered \"DEEP RED UNWINNABLE\" territory in 2008.  Clearly the message coming out of Arkansas is \"we don't want any of the things Democrats are offering\".  I mean, you're not in the \"dirty 10\" who refused Medicare Expansion money to intentionally hurt its own citizens, but there's only so much you can help somebody that doesn't want to help themselves.",

Y'all have a Democrat in congress.  Start voting for Democrats in local government.  The guy who ran for governor in 2022 as a Democrat got some national attention.  He looked like he might really represent more than half of voters and make some good changes.  Smart guy, too.  Nuclear Engineer from MIT.  I'd heard of him.\n\nWhat ever happened to him, anyway?  Where is he now?  Did ya'll vote for him? He *exceeded expectation* and managed to get ALMOST 40% of the vote....... Or as we would say, he still lost by a landslide.  How is that Democrats running away?",

This also seemed like a bigger deal than piracy law to me.  As much as I hate the DMCA for idealistic reasons (even if I'm one those who benefit from it), if it were at least paired with *something* like every person owning a copyright on their personal information and protections on that, it would be somewhat defensible.\n\nBut of all things, IMO that should not be public.  I used to work at a collection company and employees were being fired for looking up their favorite celebrities in the collections system.  It's the polar opposite of privacy.  Some redditor who doesn't like you could look up your username and find your home address, your medical history, your credit history, your kids' names, what school they go to, and so on.  That shit's terrifying.  I don't want big businesses to have that info; and I certainly don't want EVERYONE having it.\n\n> Even now with the AI boom, we just see more bots pushing crypto scams and who benefits from those? \n\nI don't disagree.  Republicans are too busy stealing the country to care about AI, and Democrats are too busy blaming the various factions of the DNC to care about AI.  We REALLY need AI regulations that make sense, both for job protection and to prevent misuse.  When companies *can* race to the bottom, they will not hesitate to.",

This is where we have the most agency, and we can start by donating exclusively to AOC to represent this new movement. By making her the *de-facto* treasurer of the party, she can then allocate that money accordingly as leverage as well as to promote new primary candidates.\n\nWe need fighters in the Democratic party. We need people willing to push a Progressive Economic Populist message  that points the finger at the rich and unites the working class across the spectrum.

Look at Trump's pretext for his trade wars: hysteria over fentanyl. \n\nSo we're expecting the Democrats to stand up to this? You mean the ones who foisted Joe Biden, the architect of the War on Drugs, upon us. Biden used the exact same hysterics about \"drug addict predators\" to push the Republicans to the right on mass incarceration. \n\nIn his 1991 response to the Republican Drug Policy Address, Biden concluded his hysterical rant about \"predator\" drug users with a savagely bigoted account about how he had nightmares of his wife, Jill Biden, being raped in a grocery story parking lot by \"predator\" drug users. \n\nThat man was later foisted upon us as \"The New Bernie\", served his entire term and never addressed the crime he had committed against his fellow citizens. He never once begged for forgiveness because in his mind, he had done nothing wrong and those \"predators\" (the citizens, his enemies) deserved to rot in the Hell he created for them. \n\nYeah, those guys. . . they are not going to help you here. They're on the same fucking team. You and I are their enemy. They are on the same team, the money team. There will be no resistance from the Blue Team. They're loving this.\n\nAnything that divides the citizens against themselves benefits them directly. Their stock-in-trade is self-hatred.

When you\u2019re the only one talking about it, the solution can be whatever you want. \n\nTrump is clearly tapping into a lot of Americans\u2019 frustrations and using them to his advantage. Democrats could tap into Americans\u2019 frustrations just as easily, but they don\u2019t because they wouldn\u2019t be able to sell their voters a fake solution like Trump does. They would have to actually take steps to combat the real reasons why Americans are so miserable, and it\u2019s because of the rich. They\u2019re just as bought and paid for as the Republicans (minus a few members) and they don\u2019t want to go against their donors, so they largely stay quiet on the real issues and instead opt for band-aids when we need a whole fucking surgery at this point.\n\nWhen you abandon the working class, you don\u2019t get to be surprised when voters turn to a fascist strong man like Trump. History has proven time and again that when things get bad, people choose fascism. Whether that\u2019s justified or not is a different conversation altogether. Failure to understand this is what has put democrats in such a bad spot.",

As sad as it is, I do agree with your assessment. Even as a little kid that didn't know anything about politics or the government (not that I know much more about them now), I always saw the repugs as the party of the rich and Dems as the party of the poor. And as long as money controls politics, that is the problem. Because the poor have no money to donate, no time to volunteer because they're too busy working and little influence for the same reasons. This is why the wealthiest will always control our country. I feel like our country is irretrievably broken and there's no fixing it. Unless we're all willing to risk our lives in a civil war, I think we're past the point of no return. I'm old, unhealthy and expect to die in the next few years anyway, but I feel terrible for our kids and grandkids. The future is looking rather bleak.",

Look, if you think these politicians are all bought and paid for from these political donations, I've got an Octopus to sell you. I don't like it but I don't think it necessarily implicates these reps, certainly not at that amount. If it did then countless regular Americans would go out and buy their very own politican for $7k. Citizens United is one of the most consequential, foundationally damaging rulings in recent history but prior to the 2010 ruling, PACs could and did give the maximum amount of $5k per politico as had long been the case. This isn't far from it. Again, worth putting into perspective. My eyes are always on the big dollar local races. The GOP worked very hard to oust good, effective Dems like Farmer Jim Tester and Sherrod Brown. The latter's losing reelection bid is now the most expensive Senatorial race in history. Why? Because his brand of meat and potato old labor democratic party politics is a threat to the GOP and long has been and, more concerning, he's the real deal. He's listened and acted in the interests of his actual constituents and maintained a link to working class America in his decades in Ohio politics and he was well liked across the gamut. And he was among a rarefied few who never used their position for enrichment in the speculative markets as he believed it was at cross purposes with the job. The legal trading on information to benefit personal portfolios is a problem that plagues both parties. Alas, Brown was narrowly beaten after more than 3 decades working for Ohioans and Americans by a new, malleable GOP favorite, the idiot outsider, proving once again that with enough money you can draw out enough bozos to vote for a former used car salesman cum crypto entrepeneur with 0 experience in politics but, sure, continue excoriating the less than two dozen Dems who took 7k each from Elon in their campaigns.",

When you view the world at it has panned out in their lifetime, with their experience as the lens, one sees that they are the bullies of the generation that was in elementary school in the 1950's and early 1960's. That was when integration  was happening. And the younger in Congress were children, in early school years during that time.  They saw their bullies fight kids that were integrated. They were raised in a time where schools were violent but they justified why they were violent. They were protected by the bullies in that generation from the kids that were integrated. And they went home and their parents told them the same thing.\n\nSo I am not surprised they elect bullies. Especially not when the current biggest fad among that generation is reconnecting with those peers on Facebook. Where they can recreate the social structure they had when there was last some semblance of authority being executed against the bads. They don't just reconnect with their friends, they reconnect with the bullies. And they can lead them on Facebook just like they did in school.\n\nI am convinced this is why the generation that is between 65 and 74 are the way they are. They are trying to recreate segregation because they still think integration was wrong. Because what they remember is social stability. They were not on the lowest rung of the social ladder then because that was occupied by the integrated kids.\n\nThen there is Vietnam. The same generation was too young to serve. It was their older brothers, upper class men, and fathers that fought in Vietnam. They missed their war. And they are worried that without their war they will be a generation remembered for being weak. So they will throw out all the good that we have to see what is worth its merit and remains after the Capital burns. They think it will be them. That the new social stratification will guarantee their spot as not being weak failures.\n\nThey are basically the good guy at the end of The Mist movie. About to off everything left that he loves because he thinks the world is ending.",

But what's the Democrat's game plan here, does anyone know? I mean if this is the level of opposition they're going to show, they are going to lose the country. In a very real sense, they're not going to be in a position to win the next presidential election and even if they did, it could take *decades* to undo the damage.\n\nShouldn't they have completely cratered this propaganda opportunity for Trump by, at least, mass heckling? Shouldn't they be out protesting, like every day? Stage sit-ins in their respective lawmaking bodies? Block every proceeding possible? Shouldn't democrat-run states directly attack the federal government in every non-violent way there is?\n\nI'm not levelling criticism as much as trying to understand what the game plan is. I mean the GOP tried to stage a violent coup. Now they're back in power, the Democratic party cannot be so naive as to believe the GOP is just going to give up power come next election?",

This is a 4 alarm fire and you can\u2019t expect Democrats to show up with a small fire extinguisher or a cup of water and say \u201cwell they did their best\u201d. Democratic Party needs some leadership and some energy but right now they\u2019re mostly just quietly muttering in the corner \u201cthis is not cool guys\u201d and rolling over, which is almost as infuriating as all the shit Trump and Co are doing.",

Last week the House of Reps passed a budget proposal that calls for $2 trillion in cuts, which... surprise surprise, will potentially be impacting Medicaid and other health care programs. The program isn't dead, but there will be people who rely on Medicaid who will lose it. These guys aren't meticulously trimming the fat, but taking a fucking chainsaw to it.\n\nAl Green was trying to stand up for those people and yet everywhere I look I find the same copy/pasted negative comments.

And you expect better from Dems in the Senate? Schumer is an Israeli stooge, so there's that. And their all bought and paid for by Big Bank, Big Corp, and AIPAC.\n\nThese are the facts and the cold, hard truth. Now what will you do? The current duopoly is NOT the answer.",
