They were projecting their intention the entire time.  Think back to every accusation the Trump/MAGA/QAnon campaign made against the Obama and Biden administration, from election fraud to shadow government, chances are the majority of them were projections of their own actions or intent.\n\n> The shadow government, also referred to as cryptocracy, secret government, or invisible government, is a family of theories based on the notion that real and actual political power resides not only with publicly elected representatives but with private individuals who are exercising power behind the scenes, beyond the scrutiny of democratic institutions. According to this belief, the official elected government is subservient to the shadow government, which is the true executive power.",

We've learned that since Jan 2021, Biden was being handled by unelected bureaucrats who tried to run him again in 2024. Those people should be under investigation, barred from politics, and ideally rotting in prison. He chose Harris, who got nearly last in the 2020 primaries, as his VP...and she was chosen as our candidate without any voter input as a result of Biden and his handlers' shenanigans.\n\nSo we had 4 years of unelected bureaucrats managing the president into a voter-*rejected* candidate being anointed as the candidate.\n\nObviously what's happening right now is far, far worse. But we made ourselves really vulnerable to something like this through grotesque and deeply unethical mismanagement of our party.",
