But I\u2019m guessing it has something to do with the FDA\u2019s advisory panel for this year\u2019s flu vaccine being cancelled.

That said, the cancelling of the advisory panel meeting will result in a flu vaccine not being chosen for later this years unless they do end up convening).",

The government is half shutdown at this point, on a whim.",

I worry that this constant state of crisis is shortening our attention spans, eroding our trust in institutions, and even desensitizing us to suffering.\n\nI remember a time when a single controversy could last for weeks, even months. We had time to delve into the issues, have meaningful conversations, and form informed opinions. Now, it seems like controversies barely last for hours before they're replaced by the next outrage. It's exhausting, and I wonder what the long-term consequences of this rapid-fire news cycle will be.\n\nI can only hope that something good will come out of the rampant onslaught of terrible things happening each day with this administration.

                            "body": "The Congress, which is the legislative body (writes laws), is bicameral, meaning consisting of two chambers - the lower chamber is the House of Representatives (with 435 members (though not representative of the population since the apportionment act of 1911) and the upper chamber is the Senate (with 100 senators (two from each state)).  \nWhile people inexplicably do use Congress and HoR interchangeably, you really shouldn't if you're educating someone about your system of government.  \n\nThe executive branch, whose head is the President/White House (i.e. DJT himself), is responsible for the enforcement of laws, so taking the Congress does nothing for that. Judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate so they can't affect the judiciary either, other than by refusing to confirm any replacement judges should any retire.  \n\nImpeachment passes the House on a simple majority vote (50%+1). This alone simply besmirches a president's honor. The trial is held by the Senate, who by a 2/3 majority can remove the president from office. So unless America decides it wants at least 67 Democratic Senators by then, or a decent chunk of Senate Republicans are suddenly overcome with a sense of civic duty, there's almost nothing they can do if they retake the Congress, with the exception of the yearly budget reconciliation bill, which can pass on a simple majority.  \n\nYou also didn't mention that you hold elections in November and they're called mid-terms because a presidential term is 4 years and they happen half-way through. A representative's term is two years, and a senator's term is six. So you elect the whole House every presidential election year and every mid-term, but only a subset of the full senate is up for election at either of those times.  \n\nHaving said all that, I will admit I don't understand what congressional committees do, so maybe there's something there, but I doubt it.",

                            "body": "Over the past month, several legal challenges have arisen in response to actions taken by President Trump. Notable instances include:\n\n1. Press Access Restrictions:\n\nThe Associated Press (AP) amended its lawsuit against the Trump administration after the White House restricted AP journalists' access to presidential events. This action followed AP's refusal to adopt the term \"Gulf of America\" instead of \"Gulf of Mexico,\" as mandated by an executive order. AP argues that these restrictions violate the First and Fifth Amendments, viewing them as unconstitutional attempts to control free speech. A federal judge described the ban as \"problematic,\" though immediate restoration of access was denied. The next hearing is scheduled for March 20. \n\n\n\n2. Foreign Aid Payment Dispute:\n\nThe Supreme Court denied President Trump's request to block a $2 billion payment to foreign-aid contractors. This decision stems from the administration's suspension of funds from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) at the start of Trump's second term. The Court's 5-4 ruling upheld a lower court's decision that prohibits withholding congressionally appropriated assistance funds. The administration's appeal was hindered by procedural errors, leading to this outcome. \n\n\n\n3. FCPA Enforcement Suspension:\n\nOn February 10, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order temporarily halting investigations and enforcement actions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for 180 days. This pause aims to allow the Attorney General to review existing guidelines and policies governing the FCPA. \n\n\n\n4. Anti-Diversity Executive Orders:\n\nA federal court temporarily blocked enforcement of President Trump's executive orders aimed at ending certain diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The court's injunction suggests potential legal issues with these orders, though a final decision is pending. \n\n\n\n\nThese incidents highlight ongoing legal disputes concerning the administration's recent actions. It's important to note that while these challenges allege constitutional or legal violations, formal determinations of lawbreaking are subject to judicial proceedings and outcomes.\n\nIn addition to the legal challenges previously mentioned, another significant development involves President Trump's executive order affecting the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). On February 10, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order temporarily halting new FCPA investigations and enforcement actions for 180 days. This pause is intended to allow the Attorney General to review and update guidelines and policies governing the FCPA. The order has raised concerns among legal experts and anti-corruption advocates, who argue that it could undermine efforts to combat corporate bribery and corruption. \n\n\nCopy/paste from Chatgtp. \n\nlegal experts and political figures argued that Trump should have been disqualified from running for office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars individuals who have engaged in insurrection from holding public office. This argument was based on his role in the January 6th, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nSome states, including Colorado and Maine, initially ruled to remove Trump from the ballot based on this constitutional provision. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately overturned these decisions, ruling that individual states do not have the authority to enforce Section 3 in federal elections without congressional action.\n\nThis decision allowed Trump to remain on the ballot nationwide, despite ongoing debates about whether his actions should have disqualified him.\n\nAlso copy/paste",

Prices are still set by supply and demand.\n\nFor some extreme examples: if the imported case of beer now has a $5 tariff, and if increasing the sales price of the case of beer $5 would not change the total demand, the price will go up $5. If the demand would drop to zero, the imported beer would go up less than the $5 tariff, with the supply chain (unclear where) taking the hit, reducing their per-unit profitability. If it would reduce the profitability for any link of the supply chain below 0, you'll just stop seeing imports. If the demand is lowered but not to zero, the burden is shared, and the price increases but not by the full amount of the tariff.\n\nThe same is true for the domestic beers.\n\nThe more goods are seen as essential to life, the more price inelastic the demand probably is, and therefore, more of the tariff gets shifted to customers. Price elastic goods are those that the population will collectively cut back on when the price goes up, and what we'll see is fewer units bought and sold with the cost of the tariff effectively falling to both buyers (by way of somewhat higher costs) and sellers (by way of less volume and/or less profit per unit).\n\nYou can see this by also imagining extreme tariffs. If you have a $1000 tariffs per case of imported beer, the price of imported beers won't rise $1000 - people aren't going to pay $1000 more for an imported beer. There's maybe demand for an imported beer that's $200 more per case (consider imported beer becoming a status symbol like Cuban cigars) but as legal suppliers won't make a profit in those conditions (the cost to them exceeds the marginal revenue from a possible sale) they will shut down. And a black market potentially emerges, of people who will bypass the tariff to sell the case at $200 more than what it used to cost (assuming that's still profitable for them, which has to deal with their costs and risks of getting caught).",

You might be located closer to one of those breweries than an American one; making it more cost effective to supply you out of that closer plant.

Trying to make a simple example can help some with understanding, but let\u2019s make sure the example isn\u2019t leaving out critical parts.  Because right now American Steel is 20% more expensive than Chinese steel.  We slap a tariff on chinese steel and suddenly it is 5% cheaper  to use American steel.  Let\u2019s say American steel companies raise their prices by 4%.  Still cheaper, but steel is now slightly more expensive.  Of course, American steel companies have massive increases in demand.  They need to produce more.  We invest in jobs and automation.  Americas GDP consequently gets a bump.  Will it offset the slight increase in steel? Hopefully, but let\u2019s not ignore their other aspects you conveniently leave out.",

Everything is going to reduce bottom lines in ways that can spiral. \n\nThe loss of federal funding wipes out huge sectors that usually spend lots of money. Without federal funding or international trade, a lot of companies will have to raise costs on services beyond what most of their consumers can afford, which will put them in a death spiral. The loss of their goods / services will ripple through the economy.   \n\nThe loss of critical public services like NOAA weather forecasting means that companies will be spending more for worse products, or straight up unable to complete projects. That will drive up costs everywhere and increase lead times, driving up costs an insane amount.  \n\n The trade war means that imported goods they rely on are more expensive, so the cost of raw materials and basic goods goes way up.  That cost will get passed on to customers or other companies. \n\nLabor costs are going to go up due to inflation, rising costs, and the loss of foreign workers in all segments. That's everything from white collar skilled labor costs going up to deal with inflation, to blue collar unskilled labor going up since all the seasonal immigrant workers leave or get deported. That cost gets passed on to consumers. \n\n The loss of government contracts and purchasing across the federal, state, and NGO sectors means that reliable income is drying up for these companies and impacting their bottom line. Companies will also be looking to reduce spending to compensate, so there will be ripple effects across the market. \n\nThe increased pressure on the stock market and the rising costs will drive up risk and reduce venture capital / investment. Insurance companies will charge more, banks will offer worse loans, and the workforce is less willing to do things like move for jobs. \n\nUsually, this would drive workers back to school or into safer private sector jobs, but cuts to education and private spending mean that they have to stay in the private sector. \n\nSo everything costs more, people want more pay but are trying to spend less, everything is riskier and slower,  there's less job mobility and hiring, companies are going out of business, and services are vanishing. It's going to be an economic death spiral.",

This will lead to increasing prices for those with insurance to try to stay afloat. It also means the doctors like me relying on reimbursements won't get paid anywhere near as much. My personal health insurance will also likely become more expensive. And this also affects private hospitals because patients end up all over the place, and they won't get reimbursed by Medicaid (which is already the insurance that pays providers the least) . This will be disastrous for healthcare all around, and 8-10k savings isn't worth it at all for me, much more negligible for average earners.",

To take Marx for example,\n\n>Marx defined the proletariat as the social class having no significant ownership of the means of production (factories, machines, land, mines, buildings, vehicles) and whose only means of subsistence is to sell their labour power for a wage or salary.\n\nEdit: I think in reality, the world is far more complicated and muddied now than the one Marx and Engles lived in.\n\nedit: your CEO point is a good example, Marx didn\u2019t live in a world with Publicly Traded companies as we know them today being managed by a large class of executives.

So many on the right still believe some form of either \"25% tariffs mean for every $100 I spend, Canada sends America $25 of its own money\" to \"It doesn't matter who pays it because Canada has to lower the price to sell it to us!\"  \n  \nThat's why the administration is talking about relaxing certain items from tariffs, because either there is nowhere else to get it from, there is a strong enough market for Canada to sell it elsewhere.  Which means the tariffs don't even hurt those Canadian sectors while pummeling Americans with the price increase.  I fully believe anything Trump tries to ease tariffs off of, Canada immediately places an equivalent export tax that keeps it at the current American tariff level.  This way it's a tax that Americans get to pay to Canada for trumps stupidity.  And the whole while this goes on, make America a lower priority for the commodities they need.  Need $10b in potash from Canada?  Sorry, sold a bunch to actual trade partners, we can sell you about half of what you need.",

I think in the current scenario, when the time comes to say you did something, they will fall back on this notion of \"I don't like Trump but the things he said he wanted to do, were in line with my constituency, even though he lied about wanting to do them. So I had no choice\". They do have a choice. But right now, they want to protect their careers and they will side with Trump because it has the best outcome for their careers. But if they could vote anonymously without fear of retribution or attack on their career, I'm very certain the vote for impeachment would go very differently(assuming we aren't compromised and these Republicans think that such a vote wouldn't *actually* be anonymous)",

It's only been one month.\n\nIt starts with Green, AOC, Crockett, Pritzker, etc., and every time they make their stand more and more people will be confident in speaking out.  Until then we need to gather hope and strength and continue to support those voices of dissent, because they're the ones with the platform and access to the political mechanisms of change who are willing to stick their necks out right now.    \n  \nPeople at large are not typically inclined to lead in that way.  It's just human nature.  When the voices of the few become the voices of the many is when true change is much more likely to happen.  It sucks having to wait for the tide but that tide can be massive if the cause is just.  In the relatively brief history of the US we've seen it happen.    \n  \nIt can happen again.",

He ended up getting Clinton in court for some land deals in Arkansas.  These weren't great, but nothing actually illegal happened (per the outcome of the trial).  During the trial, Starr managed to work Clinton's infidelity into the picture.  It was a huge stretch on relevance grounds, but the judge was sympathetic to Starr's cause and allowed it.\n\nThen, Starr got Clinton to say (on the witness stand, under oath) that he had not had sexual relations with Lewinski.  Starr then provided evidence that Lewinski blew Clinton.  Thus, Clinton was on record as saying something apparently false, perjuring himself.\n\nHe was then impeached for perjury and stood trial before Congress for it.  The right-wing propaganda machines did their utmost to blow this up into a major thing.  To be fair, it wasn't tiny - perjury is a crime, and a President committing perjury was a serious offense then (as opposed to now, when it has been reclassified to 'Tuesday').\n\nThe Senate cleared Clinton of charges for a number of reasons: first, Starr was clearly out of line for the line of questioning; second, the most damning 'evidence' was moral outrage at infidelity, which isn't actually illegal.  Most importantly though, in the trial and the line of questioning that lead to Clinton's statement, a definition of 'sexual relations' and 'sex' was agreed on which required vaginal penetration by a penis.  Under this definition, Clinton had ***not*** engaged in sexual relations with Lewinski.\n\nIt was like the McDonald's Hot Coffee incident - popular culture shaped the narrative into something if absolutely was not and painted the target of the propaganda campaign as being deceptive, exploitative, and morally bankrupt.",

Republicans now throw a shit fit if you propose a tax rate of any higher than 37% on highest bracket. More conservative now. \n\n  \nUnion membership just hit a record low, and has steadily trended downwards since 1980 thanks to Reagan. More conservative now. \n\n  \nLowest minimum wage adjusted for inflation in nation's history. More conservative now. \n\n  \nThe US has never been more against immigration since it was an isolationist nation pre-WWII. More conservative now. \n\n  \nThe US gov has never been more entangled in Christianity than it is right now. Note that Reagan was the one to create the unity of evangelicals and Republicans but Trump took it to its very peak (somehow, despite being a adulterer/philanderer/non-Christian). Overturning Roe v Wade with zero precedent is not something Reagan could have ever dreamed of doing. More conservative now. \n\n  \nFor LGBT rights/issues we've progressed since the AIDS pandemonium of the 80s that Reagan started, but we are going backwards and it wouldn't surprise me if in 10 years we are worse off. Just 15 years ago Iowa was one of the first states to legalize gay marriage and now they are making bills taking away civil rights from people and legalizing discrimination based on sexuality and gender identity. Slightly less conservative but maybe a wash.\n\n  \nSentiment on drugs is generally less conservative than 40 years ago. \n\n  \nEnvironmentally we are far more conservative. Nixon created the EPA and conservativism used to actually be somewhat aligned with environmentalism. Reagan killed that by aligning conservativism with anything that helps corporations. More conservative now. 40 years ago conservatives would freak out if it was proposed to open our national parks and forests for oil and lumber like Trump is proposing. \n\n  \nForeign policy - maybe a wash as Reagan did some awful shit like instilling fascist dictators in Central America, and invaded Grenada, similar to Trump supporting a fash in Putin and the discussions of annexing Gaza. Trump's stupid tariffs and trade war make me leaning slightly more conservative now but not by a lot because Reagan spent like 99% of his foreign policy time fighting communism, including protecting the fucking Pol Pot regime which is just ridiculous on so many levels.",

At the same time, anything that the democrats attempt to get is going to get gutted by DOGE, so I just wanted people to start talking about the idea of asking the democrats to get a change to the power of Presidential pardons.\n\nHere's what I think would be worth a budget deal:\n\n\n\n\"Limit the presidential pardon to only be allowed for periods prior to the President's current term, effective immediately upon passing for all pardons going forward.\"\n\n\n\nThe power would still exist, but the President would be unable to pardon any federal crimes that happen during the current term. It would be up to the next president or a reelection for those crimes to be pardoned.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nThere are already laws and statues that defend against what Musk is currently doing. He is only able to circumvent all of them because he knows that a blanket pardon is coming. This makes the rule of law a joke. I don't like the idea of a game without rules, so let's restore the rules. If we play off the board, we start using the rules of the dark board, and no good will come out of that for anyone in the long run. Once these rules are back in play because there is no longer an expectation of getting away with things, the system of checks and balances will add some resistance.\n\nIf you think that this is a good idea, please help by passing this idea on.",

My company, for example, had no quotas on hiring or promotions--this was actually forbidden. But our DEI policies did require hiring managers to demonstrate that they had considered all suitable candidates, rather than just picking the guy they already liked.

But there are those who seek to divide us\u2014pitting Americans against one another for political gain. In defending our way of life, we have often looked outward for threats, but the greatest danger has always come from within.\n\nThere are forces, both in government and beyond, that have sought to manipulate the people, fueling division and distrust. They have used deception to maintain power, disguising their true intentions behind lofty rhetoric and empty promises. But the truth can no longer be hidden.\n\nThere came a day when the hypocrisy of the elite could no longer be ignored. Politicians, driven by self-interest, sought to undermine the will of the people. They worked behind the scenes, attempting to consolidate control, using fear, misinformation, and economic hardship to force compliance. But the American people are strong, and we will not be ruled by those who put their own ambitions above the good of the nation.\n\nThe struggle for our country\u2019s future has been hard-fought, but those who stood against division and corruption have prevailed. The forces that sought to weaken America have been exposed, and their influence is waning. We stand now on the threshold of a new beginning.\n\nThe attempt on my life has left me scarred and changed, but I assure you\u2014my resolve has never been stronger. The battle for this nation\u2019s soul has been waged, and we have emerged victorious. The division, the corruption, the deceit\u2014it all ends now.\n\nTo ensure the security and stability of our nation, we must reaffirm the principles that have guided us from the beginning\u2014principles of unity, strength, and patriotism. No longer will we be subject to a system that benefits only the elite while hardworking Americans struggle. No longer will political gamesmanship override the needs of the people.\n\nFrom this day forward, America will be ruled not by special interests, not by backroom deals, but by a government that truly represents its citizens. A government that values strength, loyalty, and unwavering resolve. A government that does not bow to foreign influence or internal division.\n\nUnder this new era, we will restore our traditions and reinforce the rule of law. Our institutions will be strengthened, and those who seek to weaken them will be held accountable. We will build a military that is second to none, ensuring that no enemy\u2014foreign or domestic\u2014threatens our way of life.\n\nLet those who oppose American unity take heed: Those who seek to divide us, who wish to see America falter, will not succeed. We will stand together. We will not waver. We will not be broken.\n\nThis task will not be easy. The challenges ahead will test us. But we are Americans, and we do not back down. Because of our efforts, our nation will trade division for unity, and uncertainty for strength. Millions of Americans will once again have faith in their future, and our country will stand as an unshakable force of stability in the world.\n\nEvery citizen must do their part. Stand with your country. Protect its ideals. Be vigilant in defending the values that have made America great. Support those who serve, from our military to our law enforcement, who work tirelessly to keep us safe. Build, innovate, and strive for greatness\u2014so that future generations will look back and know that this was the moment when America was reborn.\n\nThose who have fought for this nation, who have sacrificed in the name of freedom, must never be forgotten. Their example is our guide. Their dedication is our foundation.\n\nA new era for America begins today. We will move forward, stronger than ever. I will lead this country to glories beyond imagination.\u201d\n\nIf you made it this far and agree with most of this, you can now realize that this is General Palpatine\u2019s speech from when he took over the senate that I slightly edited ( empire edited to America, Jedi edited to Democrat etc.) weird how much it sounds like Donald tho right?",

ITS POSSIBLE.\n\nIt\u2019s an extremely slim chance, as two of those seats are in DEEP RED \u201cSAFE\u201d DISTRICTS IN FLORIDA (being voted on April 1, makes me wonder if this is the ACTUAL reason Trump is waiting until April 2 for reciprocal tariffs, not the BS excuse of April Fools Day).

One of those seats is MATT GAETZ\u2019 POSITION, which is vacant without an incumbent. Another reason we could grab at least that seat! But as long as we even just win TWO, there would be a complete tie in the House, and Congress would be crippled. Then we would just need a SINGLE Republican to defect from Trump to gain a slim majority for any number of things. Or a Republican could just be absent, making democrats a temporary majority.
