You know why?\n\nIf you give up the Trump Admin has already won, and that\u2019s what they want. Rough estimate of all government enforcement vs total USA population- there is 121 citizens for every 1 agent/ soldier. They are not ready for hard enforcement- what they want is your obedience.\n\nIf you are afraid of being a target for speaking up, everyone will be a target in an Authoritarian regime no matter how invisible you make yourself.\n\nWe are NOT past the point of no return. America can be saved, and you can help save it. This is our country, not Trump\u2019s or Elon\u2019s. You must voice your opinions and start organizing. To voice your opinions:\n\nCall: The White House: (202) 456-1111\u00a0 Phone has very limited hours and days to leave a message. You can send a message to the White House here: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/) The cloudflare validation sucks, click on it 5-8 times to submit. It\u2019s annoying but don\u2019t be deterred.\n\nRepublican Majority Whip: Tom Emmer \u00a0(202) 225-2210 \u00a0[https://www.majoritywhip.gov/contact/default.aspx](https://www.majoritywhip.gov/contact/default.aspx)\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson: (202) 225-4000\n\nUse [https://5calls.org/](https://5calls.org/) to find your senators and congressmen\n\n\u00a0Be polite on the phone. Even if you don\u2019t think they will be listening, call volume will still send a message, as well as topics. Keep it brief and write down what you want to say so you can just read it.\n\n\u201cSupport Ukraine with money and weapons, maintain sanctions and pressure against Russia. Stop dismantling Government agencies and firing Federal employees. Congress needs to take back the power of the purse. Stop Musk, get him under oath, and explain what he is doing and did. Stop the enforcement of anti-DEI policies. End the tariffs.\u201d\n\nTo organize: Find like-minded people and work together to protest and send stronger messages. Get them to call message the above contacts on certain days.\n\nFind and offer small monthly donations to organizations that will stand up to the Admin, like AP News or the ACLU.\n\n\u00a0MAGA reps refusing town halls? Do coordinated mass emails and snail mail to them so they can\u2019t ignore the noise. Invite Dems to townhalls instead. Convince them to step down and have a new election. DO. NOT. GIVE. UP.\n\nThis is our moment- and our duty to stop this before we get worse. We could lose our economy, our personal freedoms and live like prisoners every day. We will not become Russia.",
