If you let it crash, more people will wake up, but if you let them slowly implement things like medicaid cuts, medicare cuts, social security cuts, etc, those won';t come back.\n\nUltimately, unity of purpose is what is needed and that seems like a fantasy sold in movies about fascism.",

You seemed to be saying that the countries you posted are becoming more isolationist. That is not true: the United States is threatening Greenland and Canada, Russia has invaded a sovereign nation on its borders, and China is constantly threatening the sovereignty of basically everyone else in the East China Sea (and talking about annexing Taiwan). **None** of those countries can be accurately described as isolationist.\u00a0",
