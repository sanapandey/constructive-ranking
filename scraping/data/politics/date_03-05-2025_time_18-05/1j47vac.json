What do you think \"dignified means in this context? Clearly he's advocating for decorum as he has in countless other instances\n\nAnother instance showing this is his response to a question about Greens protest at the speech:\n\u201c[An] overwhelming majority of House Democrats approached the speech with the seriousness that it deserved on behalf of the American people\"\n\nEdit: also do you really think last night's appearance by the Dems showcased \"significant opposition\" to Trump as hakeem states? All the headlines are about how weak the Dems are and that they're not putting up any opposition...\n\nAnd the article headline is literally \"Hakeem Jeffries cracks down on Trump speech disruptions\"...

Instead it is more bitching about supposed \"decorum\"",

I\u2019ve seen it quite regularly on Reddit and out in the world. A good sized portion of the party, and the populace to be fair, just isn\u2019t prepared to hate fascists in the same visceral way that the right wing is fully embracing hatred of progressive ideals.\n\nThere\u2019s endless hand wringing about being \u201cbetter\u201d than they are. Surprise! Fighting fair means you\u2019re gonna lose. They(the GOP) have believed for 40+ years that these fights were existential. And guess what? They fought like it. They fought DIRTY. And right now, even though the fight isn\u2019t necessarily over, they\u2019ve DEFINITELY got the upper hand. \n\nThank shit the SC just decided that the administration has to pay their USAID debts due to Congresses power of the Purse. That means they\u2019re not entirely dismantling the separation of powers. Yet. \n\nThe fact is, Democrats and the left have been too fucking soft.

They\u2019re owned by the same interests who are supporting the GOP. \n\nSo sure, there\u2019s some that are doing the work, but they\u2019re held back by a bunch of milquetoast, corporate backed, feeble shits who don\u2019t have the willingness to fight. They\u2019re too comfortable, too safe, and too distanced from the working class. They can\u2019t even fake like they\u2019re close like Trump and his shitheels. \n\nI don\u2019t have the answers, but being the soft side isn\u2019t cutting it.

It hasn\u2019t worked. \n\nAs one example - Trickle Down policies don\u2019t work. How do we know? History, combined with studies, with the author of the literal book on it saying that he was wrong.

They\u2019ve failed to get the message out that tax breaks for the rich don\u2019t create jobs or middle class expansion. \n\nThis allowed for more tax cuts, deregulation, the rise of billionaires, and the formation of an oligarchy. \n\nWhy did they fail? They. Went. High. They were soft. They didn\u2019t ruthlessly play politics like the other side. They didn\u2019t organize major buyouts of news media through billionaire donors. They didn\u2019t gather around talking points. They didn\u2019t vote in a monolithic way for decades. \n\nThey didn\u2019t take the fight seriously enough.

And now we\u2019re staring down the barrel of losing our democracy. \n\nForgive me for \u201cnot respecting their work,\u201d but we don\u2019t have time to respect a losing strategy after the fact.

Has not been proven yet but that\u2019s why doge is wants to do an audit because any regular citizen would have been investigated by the SEC and FBI with a sky rocketing income like that. But she\u2019s spewing hate getting her voice heard the demises the audits to have people against them. Many have thoughts she\u2019s involved with the deep state. So ig my statement of being a crook is incorrect until proven otherwise but she needs to be investigated along with many others and anyone who stands in the way of that (democrat politicians) need investigated too.
