Fascists are hard to get rid of, once they're in power.  I'm sorry to see an ally go down this path, but you'll have to excuse us as we point ourselves in a different direction while waiting for the US to sort itself out.  \n\nAll of us Canadians are pretty much unified that we're just going to cut ties with the States until this is over.

Why did the entire world anxiously watch our election? Because America\u2019s greatness has ***never*** depended on one man\u2014it has always come from its people.\n\nRather than America\u2019s people cowering and succumbing to irresponsible nihilism from the media, we need to show the world how and why we are first. We\u2019ve never been cowards and we don\u2019t run. That narrative/ attitude along with the dementia patient are what is making America look weak.",
