All the republicans are doing is doubling down, that's all they know how to do, tow the line and kiss feet and ass. They'll NEVER admit to making a mistake on this. They all know it and have made a choice (to protect their money from special interest groups) to do nothing or risk retaliation. Our government is now a system of fear, intimidation and blatant disregard for the rule of law. So here is a question for everyone, when will the republican party unite to say \"hey, this isn't right\" No one will admit they've fallen for a con man. Anyone who thinks this guy is doing a good job has fallen for the con and become a cult member. I know, it's had to swallow isn't it?",
