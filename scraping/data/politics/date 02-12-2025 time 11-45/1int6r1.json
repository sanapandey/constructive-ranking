So many around me have never left this valley, much less the State itself. They seem to think all 350+ million people think and behave the same as they do, but they dare not go and see for themselves, as the perils of visiting a big city would result in getting mugged, or shot, or raped, or worse. But hey at least they have a community FB echo-chamber that confirms their beliefs.\n\nI'm not sure how to deprogram it all. The lack of education and the simple-minded confirmation of prejudice that they share is shocking.  Many of them surely don't want to be proved wrong, instead they'd rather naively believe they are correct.",
