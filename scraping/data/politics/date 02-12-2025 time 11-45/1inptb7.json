They're doing so much bullshit that people can't keep up, and any action against it is delayed, questioned, and interrupted for as long as humanly possible. Before (most) people have figured out one thing they're doing, it's no longer relevant in the news cycle because they have done 3 new illegal things since then. Then, after about a week, Chuck Schumer will come out with some \"strong words\" about just one of the things. \n\nI don't see how the US, as we know it, can survive this",

But when it\u2019s clear the American people don\u2019t even agree on basic premises for what benefits the country, or what the country should be, it means the republic has failed. When Trump supporters are ready to let him fundamentally change the way the executive functions, expanding its power, empowering unelected billionaires to the degree he has, planning to ignore courts, because they no longer subscribe to the notion that the institution as it exists serves them, the republic has failed. When democrats at best react with pearl clutching, and the president pardons his own family because he fears they\u2019ll be targeted by the next administration, and yet out of respect for tradition took no action to prevent the administration targeting everyone else, the republic has failed. It has failed. Whatever comes next will require a new constitution, a new form of democracy, a new form of union, if we choose to move forward as a union at all.",

He believes his legacy is to get to Mars because civilization here is doomed. His ends completely justify his means in his mind. The problem is, this thinking has been HIGHLY rewarded with his success. **my interpretation through basic brain science: this means those reward systems in his brain have been used over and over again, in a process called myelination. He has no off switch, no yield sign anymore. He won\u2019t stop of his own volition, he is chemically incapable of that kind of restraint any more. \n\nMy crazy conspiracy: over abundance and \u201cfailing upward\u201d has changed the brain chemistry of many wealthy and political figures.
