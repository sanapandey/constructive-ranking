It was inspired by a Kansas farmer, signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later championed by U.S. Sen. Bob Dole.\n\nKansas has consistently voted Republican since it became a state in 1861. Today's Republicans clearly are much, much more short sighted than Eisenhower or Dole.",

He is their identity, so to say he is wrong is to admit that who they are at their core is wrong, which is hard for anyone to do. It's easier to have that break once their life starts taking a hit. So far we are hearing farmers and teachers, most immediately effected, going \"hey wait a minute\" so hopefully we will see more and more as the punishment comes.

They believed that if Hitler knew what was happening, he would set things right.\u00a0\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_cult_of_personality\n\n\nWhat you see with these people is the same cult of personality: any fault or flaw in anything Trump ever does cannot and will not ever land on his feet. It's the deep state. Or his people who were great and loyal until they were secret Democrats or whatever. But fault can never lay with Trump. You see this when they claim anything insane he says is just \"blister\" but how they also love how he means exactly what he says. The cognitive dissonance won't let them ever lay fault with him because the cult doesn't allow it.",

He then went to all the food production companies and pressured them, using a combination of carrots and sticks, to switch to using corn as their primary ingredient.  When that didn't use up enough corn, he traveled to Japan, found out what corn syrup was, and brought it back to the U.S., telling food producers to cram it into as many foods as possible to ensure there was an ample market for corn crops.\n\nAny crop that wasn't corn wasn't supplemented, causing it to fall way out of favor.  Doesn't matter if it was a better choice or a better product, it was pushed out by cheap corn and government subsidies.\n\nBy going nearly mono-culture at the farm and mono-culture consumption at the manufacturing step, it caused U.S. consumers to follow suit.",

Also there is no evidence that Nixon was forcing or pressuring food producers into using HFCS, HFCS just became popular because there was so much cheap corn (only partly due to Nixon) and there were sugar tariffs and embargos that made cane sugar relatively expensive compared to HFCS.\n\n> Any crop that wasn't corn wasn't supplemented\n\nLike Cane sugar was subsidised and protected by the US government as well and it is a direct competitor to HFCS.

It imported around $1 billion worth per year until April 2018, when it imposed retaliatory tariffs as part of a trade war.[59] By 2020, the tariffs had been waived, and trade volumes increased [60] before declining again as China began buying sorghum from other countries.[61] As of 2020, China is the world's largest sorghum importer, importing more than all other countries combined.[60] Mexico also accounts for 7% of global sorghum production.[62]",

Bands of Farmers defended their homesteads against Confederate raiding parties from Missouri and made incursions into Missouri to do the same. Kansans also repelled Confederates who would cross state lines to illegally vote in Kansas elections in an attempt to make Kansas a slave holding state. \n\nJohn Brown is a state hero and his mural with outstretched arms, a bible in one hand and a rifle in the other, is painted in our state house. We have beers named after him at local breweries. In 1863 a Confederate named William Quantrill raided Lawrence and burned most of the city down, destroyed printing presses and murdered newspaper owners. Voter fraud and violent suppression of the media are old tactics here.\n\nIn 1954 Brown V Board of Education of Topeka overturned the separate but equal principle of racial segregation. Even in recent years Kansans have regularly elected Democrat governors, the current being Laura Kelly. \n\nKansas has a complicated identity. Ultimately, the people who live here vote for those that they think will help them over party identity. Living here is hard. A full days work goes half as far due to our chaotic weather. \n\nWith that said, Kansas deserve what they voted for. I hope that one day our people wake up and see that the big city, fascist, lazy, petulant child they elected as president is their opposite and wants to take what little we have. Kansas was born liberal and maybe will be again some day.",

It's not really \"two birds with one stone\" because we have to replace the weapons we're giving away and then subsidizing the MIC to produce more missiles and other items which they wouldn't have needed to in the first place if we didn't give those systems away.

They can't, it's extremely complicated and they don't know what they are doing (obviously) and they don't know what's important to find (they can't, we find a lot of things by accident) people who believe in eugenics never seen to also believe in history and facts, and never realize they aren't superior and don't have special genes that make special smarter than everyone. They are probably the opposite direction - if you think you're exceptional for no reason, what incentive do you have to actually learn anything?

The Sahel has been taken over by warlords disgusted with government corruption and foreign aid dependence and have  kicked out the west because the west has spent decades doing everything in their power to trap them in a spiral of economic catastrophe and dependence on foreign aid just to feed their people while the conditions of this aid required them to give away whatever assets they possessed to foreign companies to exploit and profit from.\n\nThe west tries to label Traore and company as terrorists but what they are doing to improve their nations and the lives of their people is undeniable.\n\nThis movement is spreading like wildfire across Africa so the suspension of USAID now could be just what Africa needs to actually get its vast economy on a new path of self relia\n\nIt also means the end of the US influence as these nations become more self reliant. No longer dependent on western aid they are kicking the US and France from military bases on their territory, establishing control over their natural resources and moving heavily into local development.\n\nThis move is a boon for Africa and the US Farmer is paying for it",

Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.\n\nThere is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot. The people come with nets to fish for potatoes in the river, and the guards hold them back; they come in rattling cars to get the dumped oranges, but the kerosene is sprayed. And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quick-lime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\u201d\n\u2015 John Steinbeck, The Grapes of Wrath",
