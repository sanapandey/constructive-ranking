Like this whole thing about a white genocide in South Africa makes literally zero sense if you just look at the data and see that the people Trump is taking in as \"refugees\" on average have a better quality of life than the average American or the average South African.

The entire political concept was coined during the fall of the monarchies in Europe by people who wanted to preserve the aristocracy. Societal betters and lessers. In groups and out groups. People who the law protects but does not bind, and people who the law binds but does not protect.\n\nThey're cool with burning this stuff down because these are tools that ultimately go against conservatism. Federal education standards harm their ability to teach/enforce hierarchy. They've gotta go. Chopping up USAID and other programs might harm them personally, but that's ok as long as it does more damage to those they view as below them. How much any given person has isn't as important as the hierarchy. They believe that USAID is helping poor people, brown people, and foreign people more than them, so it's gotta go. Those people are supposed to be lower on the hierarchy. If they suffer as a result, well maybe they're just supposed to suffer. As long as they believe the suffering was cast upon them by a worthy ruler, it's ok. They're a part of the hierarchy too, and they have betters who they defer to. \n\nI used to believe the Steinbeck quote about \"temporarily embarrassed millionaires\", but the last ten or so years have made me think differently. I don't think conservatives act against \"their own interests\" because they imagine some day they may be rich. They do it because they think they deserve it. They do it because they think rich people are their betters and deserve more, and they, the poors, deserve less. And that's all good, as long as the black poors and the women poors are below them, and they can still murder gay poors on sight. They believe if they get the right king in the right place, he'll make their lives comfortable and put the lessers in their place.\n\nThey cheer the billionaire robbing them, because he's a worthy king. He deserves to rob them, as they think the robbery will hurt you more. They think this gets them closer to the correct social hierarchy.",

He is not personally a neo-con (although his first cabinet was packed with them), but that doesn't mean he's not a conservative. His talk was certainly different, but most of what he did was pretty bog standard conservative stuff after 2016. And most of what he's doing now has been conservative goals for at least the last 20 years. Chop up the \"welfare state\". End the DoE. Attacking minorities. Fox news has been pining for a strongman dictator like Putin since Obama. Trump's biggest difference is probably his economic protectionism, but attacking our allies and bullying them into compliance with us is nothing new. Look what we did during the Iraq war. This is all a natural progression. \n\nThere is an ideology to MAGA, and it's conservatism. It certainly has allegiances. Look at how Trump treats Putin and other dictators. Game recognizes game. There's a long *long* history to it and to fascists movements in general, both in American and abroad. I just outlined the principles in the last post. Hierarchy and the enforcement of it and deferral to it. \n\nNone of this is beyond explanation. It just depends on not believing what conservatives say, and rather watching what they do.",

But I find it very funny that you consider that corruption when the people currently getting rid of it are so intransparent that you have no idea if corruption is happening or not\n\n(Safe to say that in any country, in any organisation, with that much money involved and that lack of transparency, if there isn't already corruption then it's a fertile breeding ground for corruption)\n\nAlso, these things that Elon and others keep saying they've found from USAID, it's all been on the public record for years. They didn't need to raid the computer systems to see any of this. Their claims of intransparency from USAID mostly don't hold up from what I've seen\n\nIt's officials using bad faith arguments to trick people into believing lies. Don't fall for it",

It outlines the powers of the executive branch. Appropriating funds is not in there. Article 1 outlines the powers to appropriate funds, and that is given to Congress.\n\nSo when Congress says \u201cx dollars are going to USAID for these projects\u201d the president doesn\u2019t get to over rule Congress. Well that is until a president comes along who\u2019s willing to ignore judicial review. \n\nTrump and musk believe they are above the law. They are currently spitting into the face of the rule of law and the constitution.\n\nThis has nothing to do with reversing things Biden did. Trump did the same to Obama when he came in during 2017. It\u2019s about following the proper procedures and respecting the checks and balances outlined in the constitution.",

It lists some number of things that he thinks is ridiculous for the government to be spending our money on.  Most of the time he misrepresents how much is being spent and why.  From his 2024 report, here is an example:\n\n1. The federal government spent $7,026,689 on various magical projects - This last trick we\u2019ll reveal is a mind-boggling $6,293,820 from the Department of Defense (DOD) on a Magic City Discovery Center.\n\nSo, to note here, Rand is tying spending to 'magic,' and making it seem as though the government is funding research into studying or promoting magic.  With the actual example (where most the spending in this section went), we find that what actually happened was that a \"Discovery Center\" was funded to be built in Minot, ND and the Department of Defense helped pay for that because Minot, ND is the home of an Air Force base.  So, they built a STEM museum for kids near a military base in order to serve military families in a city with the nickname 'The Magic City,' and Rand wants you to believe that it is somehow related to actual magic and that it was wasteful spending.\n\nAnyway, I point this out because Paul has put out this stupid report for a decade and not once have I ever seen a Republican cite this report and claim to be upset about the spending listed within.  Not a single time.  Yet now that Trump and Elon are allegedly looking into spending, they all claim to be experts on it and claim that it is a great thing and that it should have been done years ago and all that bull shit.  Why is it they have never cared until Emperor Elon and his viceroy Trump told them to?",

Like DrDisrespect meeting up with teenagers he's been sexting with, who are under a police investigation.\n\n'Chud streamer says something controversial and immoral but not illegal' doesn't matter to them when you make them that much cash.

It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty\u2019s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at one-hundred-and-forty-five million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than one-hundred-and-forty-five millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.\u201d\n\n-George Orwell, 1984",

I work on energy so I get the Energy newsletter and the Tech newsletter. My colleagues get the Environmental Newsletter and the Competition Law newsletter. We don't pay for all of them but there are some variants for Paris and Berlin too.\n\n* The gossip. It's less true than it used to be but you can assume that if something was published in the newsletters, everyone knows it and everyone knows that everyone knows it. And given that they have weekly gossip newsletters, it's worth a read if you can make the time.\n\n* Exclusive Analysis reports. They're fine.\n\n* Early access to some articles and some articles are Subscriber only. Eh. Nothing that's not already in the newsletters. Or in the FT.\n\n* A tracking platform. I don't use it everyday but when I need it, it's a godsend. If some law pops on my desk and I have never heard of it, being able to look it up in the database, read a summary of the file, the history of the file and the names of all associated policymakers in one place is really valuable. Some companies will offer just this as its own service. Politico's isn't the best one out there but you're paying for the newspaper anyway so might as well use the tracking platform thrown in with the contract. (Also useful to get an automated ping when your boss gets mentioned in the press.)\n\n* Events. Politico host a number of policy events and conferences and the like, many of which are exclusive to subscribers. Value varies, some of them are just soapboxes for some sponsor to make the same point again. Personally, I find their Council Pre-Presidency events worth going to, they're once every six months. Some of their more very exclusive events are apparently amazing but can't speak to those personally.\n\n* Leaks. The fact that you could read leaked copies of draft work from the Commission used to be a big deal. Within my field though, Contexte now always beats them to it and has better technical analysis. Plus, people with subscriptions share the leaks with those who don't so you're only gaining a day or two on the competition, which rarely matters. Still, my office is looking into getting an extra subscription with Contexte.\n\ntl;dr: it's not so much a newspaper subscription as a few vaguely related services thrown together in the same contract. If you need to know what's happening in the Bubble every day of the week, you probably need their newsletters and/or tracking platform.",

Political strategist Steve Bannon has read and admired his work. Vice President JD Vance has cited Yarvin as an influence. The Director of Policy Planning during Trump\u2019s second presidency, Michael Anton, has also discussed Yarvin\u2019s ideas. In January 2025, Yarvin attended a Trump inaugural gala in Washington; Politico reported he was \u201can informal guest of honor\u201d due to his \u201coutsize influence over the Trumpian right.\u201d",

This was to help reduce the spread of aids in Mozambique. Aka reduce human suffering and loss of life. You'll notice a trend in that.\n\n#2, #3, #4, #5, & #7 - Anyone with a partially functioning brain should realize that a big part of DEI and Transgender inclusion is to combat hostility and bigotry towards those groups via integration into society and depicting said integration as non-harmful. Ignorance born fear is the biggest proponent to hate. So these projects aim to tackle that ignorance. \n\nI would also like to point out that the cost of these projects are pennies in comparison. Pennies for the purpose of reducing human suffering and encouraging human equality. You know? The goal of human betterment as a species at the cost of a pittance? If you have an issue with that, you're a bad person. Full stop.\n\n> 37 million to the world health organization. \n\nGood. moving on. \n\n> 4 million of funding for the center for climate positive development. \n\nThat is shockingly lower than it needs to be. Add more zeros to that. Do you understand this is for large scale urban projects to grow cities in ways that are good for the climate? Our fucking streets are horrible, completely unwalkable because they are built on a dependence for vehicles. America's street planning is internationally recognized as absolutely atrocious. I'd love to see that shit fixed. \n\n> 12 million in support services to the bureau for resilience, environment, and food security. \n\nAlso shockingly low. Fun fact you live on earth. Your life is dependent on that fact. Mother earth is your second mother, treat her nicely and she won't poison you with e.coli from a raw carrot. \n\n> $6 million in non-emergency funding for redundant administrative supports for the Center of Excellence\n\nCoE's are models of specialized or esoteric resource refinement and sharing as to across the board increase efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation. It's kind of like a library but specialists to refer to. It's something you want more of. Not less. Less of this means more people running around clueless with no guiding body or standard to refer to. \n\n> $3 million in non-emergency funding to provide evaluation services for planning and learning programs\n\nEducation is important and this is pathetically low for how important it is. \n\n> $600,000 to fund technical assistance for family planning in Latin America\n\nInfrastructure maintenance cost for supplying contraceptives and sexual health guidance to  woman in Latin America. Again, a goal orientated around reducing human suffering. This helps women, you'd have to be a colossal asshole to have issue with this. \n\n    \nIn conclusion, don't be a dick and be kind to your fellow human being.

Programs like food stamps or distributed food like 'government cheese' found their initial justification in addressing what they noticed at the time was the nations malnourished population making poor soldiers. Our population is absolutely facing both a health crisis and a housing crisis.\n\nIt should be the easiest argument to advocate a fraction of military budget get diverted to maintaining the health of the population so that should they ever need to be called upon, they'd be functional.

An organization like USAID likely rarely ever even needs to reference case law for anything at all.  They're not lawyers or judges. They're likely using it for policy, the explanations of that policy, budget analysis, bill tracking, government initiatives, foreign policy guidelines, etc.\n\nFor that kind of thing they'd have to hire multiple people to keep up with it.
