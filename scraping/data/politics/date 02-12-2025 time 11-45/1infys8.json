I'm disabled and my ability to participate outside my house is extremely limited. I am 100% dependent on others for my physical safety when I attend a protest. I still go when I can, but millions of others do not have the ability/opportunity to do that.\n\nThey have telephones, and they have time.\n\nMy voice is all I have. I am well aware I will be ignored by republicans. I recently escaped from Kentucky.\n\nIt is vital that I, and people like me, make use of all the tools we have at our disposal to the best of our ability until those tools are taken away. To your point, yes, most of our calls will be ignored. Sometimes the best we can do is protest the crime being committed against us because we do not have the tools, training, or ability to do more.\n\nI don't want anyone to give up. If you can get out and make a peaceful ruckus in the streets, I highly encourage all to participate. If you have limitations on how you spend your time, resources, energy, and safety, phone calls are the most effective way to make your voice \"officially\" heard by elected representatives.\n\nI was urging you not to give up on calls from my own perspective, so I apologize for misunderstanding. I do stand by what I said, though, in that we all need to keep doing what we have the ability to do, not roll over for these chucklefucks.\n\nI'm a former federal employee and lifetime public servant. My colleagues are not taking this shit lying down, but many don't know what to do beyond holding the line in their individual jobs. They need our vocal support as well to know that they are not alone. That's why I said not to stop using our voices. Not said as judgement, but as encouragement.",

It is the Republican party's responsibility to govern, it is the Republican party's responsibility to keep the government running.  If they want Democratic votes, they need to give them something.  That something can be very simple, Leon and his goons need to follow the law and the normal processes for auditing and reforming government.  Its not even a policy concession, its not even something that impacts congressional Republicans, its just asking them to do their jobs.  \n\nIf they don't want to do that, they have majorities in both houses and they can pass a spending bill themselves.  Moral Orel can only afford to lose 5 votes in the house, good luck getting that caucus to agree on anything.  The Dems should not bail him out this time.  \n\nAgain, Americans voted for this.  Let them see what they bought.",

It was infuriating and indicative of the fact that Democrats still have no clue what they're doing and no long term strategy. There is no clear effort to plan ahead. There is no effort to organize within the community at all.\n\nThe start of the call was spent explaining how organizations should try to write job postings to continue DEI efforts without coming under fire. With all due respect, I think there are more important concerns than helping people reword job postings.  Then they asked organizations to continue staying in touch to get updates on funding. When they finally got around to discussing the looming constitutional crisis they patted themselves on the back for doing such a great job standing up to Republicans because they spent a few moments outside government offices and promised that they'll \"do their best\" to introduce legislation and appeal to Republicans to stand up to the Whitehouse. They even tried to take credit for the injunctions filed by Federal judges.\n\nWhen someone asked what happens if the executive branch ignores the rule of law, as recently suggested by Vance, they had absolutely no answers. They assume that the administration will respond to subpoenas and the overall theme was \"we'll ask them nicely\" and if they refuse we'll say \"pretty please\". Because we all know how well subpoenas worked during the Jan 6th investigation and I'm sure we can count of the DOJ to step in. /s\n\nThe rhetoric was cliche political pandering and Rep. Beatty ended the call with what came across to me as a campaign stump speech. They'll never learn until it's too late. We need a third party or at least Dems with a clue and a backbone.",
