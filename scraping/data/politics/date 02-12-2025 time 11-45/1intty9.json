InItelligent software would need capabilities to separate dollar amounts, order numbers, payees, quantity and service/product from scanned or uploaded information. That info would need to populate a database accurately 85%+ of the time.\n\nAn external AI/LLM tool would have to be used. Your bank wouldn\u2019t even feed your data in external AI tools.\n\nSome companies create tons of shell organizations to increase complexity of identifying ownership. \n\nEx: You own 30 businesses. Each business is owned by a business, which is also owned by another business. That other business is also owned by a different business.\n\n\ud83c\udff0  \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude91  \u27a1\ufe0f \ud83d\ude80  \u27a1\ufe0f \u26fd\ufe0f \u27a1\ufe0f  \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\nShell companies are frequently in multiple countries.
