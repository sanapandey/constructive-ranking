It is something that makes him look weak in the eyes of Trump himself and makes him seem weak in Trumps opinion to his MAGA base. \n\nIt could be something sexual, but it would have to be something extremely graphic or something like Trump being pegged or doing something gay and as a bottom. If he was taking some big muscular guy in the ass, it would probably be bad, but could be spun to be positive. It would have to be some pretty young guy topping Trump. Likely skinny and pale.\n\nIf it\u2019s not that, it would be something deplorable, something could make the Christians turn their heads and shy away from Trump. Problem is, he is so deplorable that I can\u2019t think of anything his fan base would see negative besides sex stuff and even then it has to be somewhat specific.\n\nIt could be a video of people yelling at Trump like a child, into his face and Trump folding like a bitch. Not necessarily someone bigger than him, just more powerful in presence. Like someone able to play him like a fiddle, make him laugh, then scares him, then tells him how weak he is and makes him feel incredibly vulnerable. Which would make sense to me. And could turn his base to see him as a weak man. \n\nHe is a strong man, of conservative \u201cstrong man\u201d values, but the traditional scandals don\u2019t work. Him raping someone won\u2019t do it. That\u2019s considered \u201cpowerful\u201d. Him killing someone wouldn\u2019t do it either, it\u2019s considered \u201cstrong\u201d. Stealing from kids, hitting an old lady or punching his daughter won\u2019t make his fan base turn. Having billions from stealing from charities is too convoluted, too abstract.\n\nSurely it has to be something very explicit, simple to understand, revolting to his base and undermines everything he pretends to be. Something that makes him weak in the eyes of his supporters.\n\nBut the worrying thing is, if he falls, his fan base is likely to turn to and cling onto Musk. I think Musk is trying to change the dynamic so that Trump\u2019s base turns largely to Musk, another very visible conman of similar values to Trump and able to play the game of having no morals but what benefits him. To have no actual standards that can make him fall over. \n\nIt has to be some pleasure Trump feels guilty about and makes him look weak to his supporters",

He has to be completely exhausted, and I imagine lacks the stamina and personal power to turn this around on Musk like he might have even in his first term.

Eventually, the Industrial Revolution and wide embrace/enforcement of capitalism happened. This was certainly the long game in the 70s when anti-intellectualism got off the ground and education became progressively shittier. Then we got Reaganomics, which is the foundation of the situation we find ourselves in. Next there was a steady social engineering campaign to turn people into the worst versions of themselves, rabid for revenge on all the people who have \u201cwronged\u201d them-women, black people, immigrants, trans people, whatever the flavour of the week they\u2019re told is. \n\nRampant capitalism making their lives utterly nightmarish, and constant disasters due to its effects, makes people see how precarious their lives are. Add in a global pandemic, which always precipitates the descent into world war and fascism. So now they\u2019re uneducated, completely lacking critical thinking skills (and covid causes brain damage, which has been proven over and over), and poor, and they turn to someone who promises them that everything will be better if he\u2019s in charge. They\u2019ve already accepted fascism in a million little ways by the time someone like Trump or Hitler is in power. People were all too happy to ignore climate change, rampant police violence and cop cities, women\u2019s autonomy being taken away, protests for sane shit like not committing genocide being deemed terrorism, disabled people being forcibly institutionalized, legal slavery, homeless people being criminalized and school shootings every single week. They accepted every false narrative that they were fed, even if it ended in the death of those they\u2019ve been told to hate and fear-or people they loved. They accepted a multimillionaire convicted criminal and insurrectionist telling them for four years while out of office that he\u2019s one of them. \n\nThe US has been a fascist influence in the world for the entire time it\u2019s been around. Citizens have been propagandized to accept their country couping, destabilizing and waging war on every single country with resources around the world, and blame THOSE countries. The chickens are coming home to roost, because the US has shown its leaders what it will accept. It\u2019s terribly sad, because people accept it due to the dire straights capitalism and the ultra rich have put them in.

So you know that was a rhetorical question to save his ass about whether or not they were in business. \n\nEverybody's praying that the bromance will end because Trump discards everybody that works for him after a while, but the thing is - is that massive damage has already been done to us Americans because of Musk - 2.  the amount of money Musk poured into his Presidency may make it difficult for Trump to break up the bromance.",

Been on camera creeply touching his youngest son. Hiding among the one party that looks the other way when its members are charged for pedophilia. \"Buddy pal\" with a president that does not mind men and women \"that like'em young\" (his description of Epstein).   \n  \nThis is however all just wild speculation. However what's not speculation is the typical MO of actual pedofiles. They often seek positions of power. Next they ensure to set up situations where it's normal for them to be unsupervised with kids/young adults for prolonged times. The final step is to isolate their victim/victims away from society.  \nMost childe molestation are done by trusted family members (even parents) or trusted leaders (priests/community leaders/etc).   \nThere's no proof he's one, but he's awfully close to their MO. Only wanting male children, and only employing males half his age. Even his \"DOGE staff\" seems to be young adults that are already isolated from society.",

Neither of those innovations are being enthusiastically accepted by workers. Much of the highly visible writers and actors strikes were about the future of AI in the production business, and the strike went on because the studios held the line for so long. They clearly want to expand their use of AI, and so does every other company.\n\nWith the Party of Tre45on & Corruption in control, they will get their wish. The result will be a 30+% permanent unemployment rate, possibly higher, over the next decade. What do we do with that many people who cant be retrained to be software developers, or robotic technicians? They need to eat like anyone else.  Without jobs, or any prospect of jobs, we will quickly devolve to a Robin Hood Economy (take from the rich, give to the poor)\n\nTo avoid that, we will have 2 choices: Universal Basic Income, or reducing the population by the unemployment rate. Which strategy do you think the two parties will embrace, and how will they achieve it? How likely is it that the current ruling party will accept giving money to people for NOT working? \n\nOr will they make unemployment a crime, and detain people at Guantanamo, where nobody will ever see them disappear?",

While we can usually obtain this number for recent surveys by calling up the firm, sometimes we have to make informed guesses.\n\nIncludes polls where they have no data about the sample size, where they just 'guess' the sample instead of just... Not including the poll. \n\n>Starting in 2025, we now weight polls that go into our presidential approval averages by their firm's 538 pollster rating \n\nAllows them to adjust a polls weighting based on their own rating of the polls reliability and transparency\n\nThere's more on that page. But the TL;DR is that their new 'methodology' doesn't actually seem to aggregate the actual results of multiple polls. It collects the polling results, then 538 decides what the polling results actually are based on a bunch of arbitrary, nebulously defined factors, then 538 gives the output on their page as though it's an aggregate tracker.",

Though I hope that in time we may see and feel that security again, that a strong leader can provide. \n\nSeeing Elon in the oval office amongst suits and ties, wearing a hat, a blazer over a t shirt, perhaps trying to relate to us common people, standing and doing all the talking, while the president elect is sitting, looking up at him...quiet. \n\nThis does not feel like like how the greatest strongest country should be represented.

He argued these discrepancies were pushed by America\u2019s \u201cruling communists\u201d, who invented political correctness as an \u201cextremely elaborate mechanism for persecuting racists and fascists\u201d. \u201cIf Americans want to change their government,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to get over their dictator phobia.\u201d\n\n\u201cYarvin has influenced some prominent Silicon Valley investors and Republican politicians, with venture capitalist Peter Thiel described as his \u201cmost important connection\u201d. Political strategist Steve Bannon has read and admired his work. Vice President JD Vance has cited Yarvin as an influence. The Director of Policy Planning during Trump\u2019s second presidency, Michael Anton, has also discussed Yarvin\u2019s ideas. In January 2025, Yarvin attended a Trump inaugural gala in Washington; Politico reported he was \u201can informal guest of honor\u201d due to his \u201coutsize influence over the Trumpian right.\u201d",
