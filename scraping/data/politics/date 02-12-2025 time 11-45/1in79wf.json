On Friday, the Trump administration\u2014under the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s direction\u2014announced it would cut billions of dollars in biomedical research funding, scheduled to take effect by Monday. The slashed spending was intended to affect $4 billion in \u201cindirect funding\u201d for research, a category that encompasses administrative overhead, facilities, and operations. But researchers that spoke with The Washington Post decried the move as a \u201csurefire\u201d way to \u201ccripple lifesaving research and innovation,\u201d and one that will contribute to \u201chigher degrees of disease and death in the country.\u201d",

Symptoms can include:\n\nPersistent depression\n\nAnxiety\n\nCognitive impairment\n\nSexual dysfunction\n\nThe exact cause of PFS is not well understood, and some medical professionals remain skeptical of its existence, but many users report significant lingering issues.\n\n*  Sleep Disturbances\n\nSome individuals report insomnia or changes in sleep patterns while on finasteride or dutasteride, possibly due to hormonal shifts.\n\n*  Emotional Blunting & Low Motivation\n\nSome users feel less emotionally engaged, flat, or unmotivated while taking these drugs.

Then Fox News will give them credibility by picking them up to 'just as questions', and of course our 'president' will then elevate them further by repeating 'many people are saying...'.\n\nTo me this is the smoking gun that Musk monkeyed with the election returns, and has close ties to Putin or Xi.

Had to dig up 7 years of attendance records for classes I'd taught during that time period, as well as the other instructors I supervised. It took fuckin' *months*, because 3 of those years were documented by hand rather than electronically. So tedious. It went well and everything turned out fine, but I was terrified of making a mistake the whole time and basically walked on eggshells. How someone just can't see the gravity of the situation when it comes to auditing an entire goddamn country. Baffling.",

We are SCRAMBLING, trying to find office space after spending the last 8-10 years significantly reducing our real estate footprint (and thus overhead cost). My agency has already reduced our headcount by thousands a few years ago to streamline but we've been running with vacancies because it is hard to find people with our specialized skillset who want to work for less pay.\n\nAnyone hired after 2013?

Tuition reimbursement was killed over a decade ago (and was honestly a joke at around $100/credit max) for most everyone and instead we get the joke that is DAU (laughable they are a .edu to their domain). But it's ok because they give us a digital library subscription because that's absolutely the equivalent to what we lost.  It's a terrible training approach that assumes everyone is an ACAT 1 acquisition program manager.  We have the same basic health insurance options that are offered by any other company.  We have been operating on continuing resolutions for what seems like over a decade so it's nearly impossible to make long term decisions.\n\nThe only bargaining chip we really had in attracting talent was an appeal to patriotism and a sense of duty and honor to the country.  Unfortunately TrumpMuskHegseth have likely damaged that beyond repair by intentionally trying to harm patriotic civil servants.\n\nIt's always been a relatively thankless job and now we don't even get the minimum of respect in banal platitudes like \"thank you for your service\"\n\nMy apologies for the rant.  I can't do it at work because I still believe in maintaining a professional work environment, the more fool I.\n\nOh we also just had one of our specialists quit today because they now have a 2.5 hour one way commute and can't move closer because their spouse works in the other direction of the nearest \"base\".  The walked away from their passion project of making us more resilient to foreign trade embargos.  Ain't that a bitch",

All foreign aid was frozen so that entire programme of 700 almost entirely local staff are now working their notice and all operations will stop. \n\nThey will probably bring back some funding and clearance in Vietnam tends to be looked on quite favourable by US administrations. But by then the damage will have been done. Many of our talented and experienced staff will have had to move on. Decades of expert knowledge just arbitrarily set on fire in the name of any cuts will do. Many people will die as a direct result of these cuts and the world will be less safe and less prosperous.",

Universities typically charge a 40% to 60% \"overhead\" on research grants. \n\nWhat that means is: If a scientist using grant money to buy, say, a case of glassware for $100, the university gets $40 to $60 \"just because\".  If they use the money to hire a research assistant it's the same thing.  It's just completely preposterous.\n\nThe reason so many universities have such large on-campus research labs is because it is immensely profitable for them to do so.\n\n>  They don't consider that the scientists in the lab aren't ordering the materials they're using.\n\nActually, yes they are.  Or a PhD or undergraduate research assistant is.  My research advisor even had eBay alerts set up so that we could buy used lab equipment for cheaper.  \n\nI don't know where you get this idea that a scientist just tells an admin \"get me ___\".  What they need is usually so specific that do that would be a recipe for disaster.",

The universities are absolutely using indirect costs as a profit centre to subsidise operations that have nothing to do with research.  It's the size of the fees that's the issue, not the existence.\n\nWhat's your personal experience on this?  Honestly, it doesn't seem like you have any if this is your take.",

So.. how did that happen?\n\nContrarily, I voted, along with a LOT of other Americans. To the extent I could, I voted against the concentration camps in Guantanamo and Palestinian genocide. But - that wasn't on the ballot. The best option I had was to vote for a Presidential candidate that was absolutely non-committal on many issues that are critical to me, and where there was commitment - also often on the wrong side of things, just less so. So that is who I got to vote for. Did I have the option of voting for that person to BE the Presidential candidate among others candidates in the party? Nope. Nor did anyone else at all. There was no primary! Did I have a realistic option of voting 3rd party without throwing away my vote? Nope. \n\nDid my vote count at all? Depends on which state I live in. \n\nVoting is never enough, and it is now clear that the only way there won't be concentration camps in Guantanamo and even more genocide in Gaza is if democratic actions OTHER than voting take place. Like the ones that got women and POC the vote, slaves freed and civil rights to happen at all.\n\nWe'll see how apathetic people are, and about what, I guess, as measured by ALL democratic actions but you cannot just measure it by how many people don't vote.",

Do a LOT more than just voting, including learning the fundamentals of how it works, and how it breaks. Fight to make it MORE democratic because I guarantee you it isn't as democratic as it could be.\n\nIn my opinion, the US barely even has a democracy. It started \"against monarchy\" - a very narrowly specific form of tyranny. But it also started only allowing white landowners to vote.  6% of the population! \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\\_of\\_voting\\_rights\\_in\\_the\\_United\\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_voting_rights_in_the_United_States)\n\nEvery single person who gets to vote since then was hard fought, hard won, and still in contention. Project 2025 is working hard to take us back to that - I guess a variant of white Christian landowning men probably. Voter suppression is still happening at a huge scale - for instance, we don't have Election Day as a paid holiday off work and many states force in-person polling and reduce polling stations in select areas.\n\nOur President is still elected by the Electoral College, which invalidates the Presidential votes of a massive number of people in a massive number of states.\n\nAnd those Electoral College representatives themselves are not elected. \n\nAnd we have a strict 2 party system with lockouts at almost every level preventing any additional parties. Don't want to vote for EITHER party? Good luck.\n\nAnd since 2010 we allow unlimited corporate money to support political candidates.  But as a corporation can effectively be controlled by just one person - that means there are no limits on what an individual, or wealthy people as a class can do.",

I say all of that to point out that, at least some people have been pointing out the weaknesses for decades, it makes me wonder what else I am blind to.",

In a restaurant, you obviously need your cook. You're not making any food without cooking and having them at the grill is your direct funding. So he then said \"I'll just cut everything around the cook\" without thinking it through. What happens to your restaurant if there's no waiter? What about a dish washer? What if you don't order any produce to fill your fridge or pots and pans to cook with? How do you pay them if you cut funding to payroll?\n\nA lab is the same way. You have someone at the bench doing experiments and all that. But you also need someone to take orders on experiments. You need someone to clean and sterilize the equipment. You need someone to order new beakers, and buffer solutions, and reagents. And you need someone to pay the person at the bench.\n\nElon's plan is basically hiring a cook, have them stand around with no knives or pans, no food to prepare, no orders to take, and nobody paying them, and then stand there like a fucking idiot and wonder why they haven't cured cancer.",

The satellite launches are expensive, but it made 6.6 billion in revenue last year and is expected to be 11 billion this year. It's going to remain a money printing machine for years before competitors are able to make meaningful deployments.\n\nNASA is funding a lot of the development work to make starship viable as a moon lander. A side effect of that will be even less per satellite than his current massively cheap and reusable falcon 9's, mostly because both stages will be reusable and it'll be able to deploy 3 times the payload volume wise at once, but 6 times the weight at once. This will lead to starlink satellites that are more robust than the current ones.",

Thats 1.1 billion a year. \n\nThey are on track to make 11 billion in revenue this year. Probably even more next year. Even if non launch operating costs are 3-4 billion, that is still 5 billion to pay back design costs and make profit (or put right back in to starship development, which will make the launch cost drop significantly)\n\nYes, anybody with a laser can shoot those down. Guess what? They can do a lot more to planes flying around full of cargo or ships full of cargo. Shooting down the satellites poses the same risk as any other military action. \n\nMilitary satellites have been in orbit for decades. Communication satellites too. How many of those have been lost to enemy action on purpose?\n\nIt could always happen, but there are consequences for that. There are 4 different gps constellations that can be shot down too. Again, the biggest issue is what happens when there\u2019s four different competing Internet satellite providers at that point it becomes much more critical on the cost of maintaining that network and right now SpaceX has the biggest lead in cost of launches, and it\u2019s not even close.",

If anything, the war in Ukraine has shown how valuable the systems are from a logistics and military standpoint. Europe is finally coming to the table again to set up something new that is less of a bureaucratic nightmare that the European space agency is to build and maintain reusable launch systems. One of the primary motivations of this is to build their own starlink system can\u2019t be shut down because the US is mad at Europe.\n\nI think the primary thing that they need to do with any of the systems is not grant licenses for many satellites at higher orbits. if a satellite fails, it will deorbit itself and burn up in the atmosphere within 30 to 60 days. You're still going to need some satellites in higher orbits but those slots should be more limited.",

I really do think Jack Dorsey wanted out of Twitter and found the perfect sucker to offload it to. Elon paid a huge premium *right* when interest rates started increasing. The sole reason he fired everyone at Twitter is because he was pissed he had to buy the company and took it out on the employees. Because he's that much of petulant child.\n\nOh, and you can also see in the text messages that he had no intent to buy Twitter in the beginning. He got in a fight with the prior CEO (Parag Agrawl) and got mad and bought Twitter. Back when there was some discussion on him being on the board of Twitter. You can also see he had all sorts of terrible ideas. Such as every message on the blockchain and you have to pay to place a tweet on there. The dude simply does things and doesn't think about it at all.",
