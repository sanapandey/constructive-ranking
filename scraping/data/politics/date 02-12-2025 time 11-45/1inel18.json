GOP old hands had to come out of the woodwork to kill that surge. If Dems did similar, they would be crucified for stacking the deck or DNC fixing an election. Its really a fine line between keeping the candidate viable to the bigger electorate and finding someone who can create a surge of excitement. Competence and steadiness are never exciting. Unfortunately, some key Dem issues like reproductive rights, minority rights, the environment, and worker issues seem to fly straight out the window with any hint of economic uncertainty. \n\nDems also have the same problem they've faced for 25 years- voter distribution. Running up a tally in CA, NY, and Ill earns them nothing if Rs can squeak out Wi, MI, and PA with 1% margins.",

I think one consistent flaw that the centre-left has over the right is they're too beholden to certain visions of \"common sense\" that actually ignore what it means to operate in a situation of widespread disillusionment and discontent. The right is quicker to capitalize on that because ultimately they are more willing to simply accept that as long as they get to win, they can live with the means.",

AOC herself does not shy from radical and progressive positions, though compared to Sanders she has more of a biting and less diplomatic approach, in addition to possessing certain characteristics that make her unpalatable for the least open-minded. \n\nThis is to say that it is neither conviction nor her ability that I doubt, but simply that I'm not sure whether she will be able to embody what Bernie does; when I muse of a 'successor' to him I think not only about the merit of values and positions, but also of the capacity to properly represent a 'third way' with authority. \n\nThen again Bernie earned this weight in decades of career, and comparisons with much younger figures is bound to be unfair. Not to forget the fact that it's not necessarily a Bernie clone that is needed. But whoever and however the torchbearer of progressive ideals may be, they will need to possess a certain eminence of character which is not that common in politicians.",

And there is no just putting it back. Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt that this is not an outright coup, once they dissolve an agency, reestablishment would have to go back through Congress and be signed by the President (again this assumes that there is a will and desire to re-establish these things).
