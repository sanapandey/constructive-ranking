If you call their office and yell at them to protect trans kids, they won\u2019t care. But they\u2019re signaling that they\u2019re receptive to complaints about attacks on the judiciary, so called them about that. Or call them about your grandma\u2019s Social Security check. Or call them because you\u2019re worried that messing with Medicaid payments will make the local hospital go under. Or that changes in grant rules are going to ruin your state university system.",
