If enough pissed off Trump voters join the opposition we could pull it off. The GOP has a very narrow majority in both houses. Theoretically we could recall a GOP candidate and replace them with another candidate who might align with the opposition. This is one of our most powerful tools when elected officials act against the constituents who voted them in.  It is however a wild card as the states have very strict rules that must be followed to get a recall election started. In my state for instance it has to be for crimes, or failure to perform duties. And requires 40% of their election votes with 90 days of filing or it will fail to get on ballot. And it may fail. As Trumps administration goes full Hitler the base will be fractured. \n\nWe only need a simple majority in House to remove Trump and 60 seats in Senate. When their own asses are on the line they may break party. \n\nWe also have the option to pressure the heck out of elected officials to push back against this unconstitutional takeover. They know the policies are unpopular. They will not be re-elected if they toe the line. In my state one of the senators has already broke ranks and publicly denounced the administration\u2019s shut down of USAID. Another GOP senator in neighboring state broke ranks and denounced the shut down of government grants. \n\nTheoretically they could say he is unfit under amendment 25 section 4. Or they could go scorched earth and use article II section 4. It didn\u2019t work the last 2 times. But even our shady GOP politicians will not want the next 4 years to continue like the last month if they believe their own lives will be ruined. \n\nI am hesitant to endorse the protestor route as I genuinely believe he will use that civil unrest to declare martial law and go full on dictatorship. I believe that is the intent. \n\nWe must try to use the judiciary and legislative branch to protect ourselves. \n\nhttps://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/recall-of-state-officials\n\nhttps://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/republican-lawmaker-wants-to-update-the-rules-for-recalls-in-colorado/73-f62c4626-eb02-492d-9716-f7ebd947feb9",

The secretary of state decided to run for governor backed by Trump all kinds of shenanigans with the voting machines, literally the night before the feds were coming to investigate the servers \"accidentally\" got wiped. Kemp, who was running for governor and was in charge of the election as secretary of state said that it was to close to the election and we had to use these machines anyway. Trump defies all logic and polls and stats and wins. Fast forward to 2019 and the new secretary of state says hey Trump just called me trying to rig the election. I will stake my life on the fact Kemp got a call in 2015 and did not tell anyone.

Kamala had an awful approval rating as VP and was not a popular candidate. She almost clinched it just by virtue of not being Trump, but a huge reason for the mess that we're in right now is this whole concept of \"You have to vote for this person you dislike, because you dislike the other person even more\" rather than voting for someone you actually think will be a good fucking president.

The solution to this problem is a revolution that truly implements democracy, but for that to happen the oligarchs must be overthrown, as well as all the institutional mechanisms that favored their accumulation of power and wealth for 250 years, but especially during the last 50, which is when the system really began to implode in the same way that happened in the Roman Republic. In fact, the founding fathers copied Rome, that was their big mistake. The Roman Republic became corrupt due to the accumulation of power and wealth of its oligarchs, who did everything they could to prevent democratic and social reforms. In the end, popular dissatisfaction was channeled by populist military figures, which gave rise to the Caesarist dictatorship that lasted for centuries and led to decline. If this autocratic regime were to be overthrown, it would be necessary to refound the republic, but this time Athens, not Rome, should be the example.",

Before he goes though, he's going to make as much of a mess as he can. Either way, Trump is not in charge. He is nothing but a hand to sign Project 2025 exec orders, a mouth to spout Project 2025 rhetoric, and a face to keep the cult going. Elon is just a pawn too, but both of them are too arrogant to admit it.\n\nWhat's happening is an unelected group of people are taking over. They rigged the election, they have their pawns in place, and now we are seeing the fruition of Project 2025 in its entirety. We need to all be ready for the inevitable at this point.\n\nHonestly, I'm on my way out. This is not a ship I want to go down with, I didn't vote for it, and I'm sick and tired of going about every single day, looking at every single person that is wearing an Trump hat or a Trump sign/flag on their property or vehicle, and looking at them as a potential enemy. This is not a way to live.",

                            "body": "I think generally it is good that it is difficult to change the Constitution. This has to be a legislation that is protected by high quorums and high obstacles. It is the same with any modern constitution of other countries (I am from Austria and our constitution (B-VG, Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz) and constitutional laws have a special protection too and cannot be changed easily, even though it is only about 100 years old).\n\nBut the thing in the US is, at least this is the impression that I have, that the citizens and the politicians see the constitution as something holy and unchangeable that they refuse to adapt it to current times. It doesn't help that the partisanship is at such a high level that both parties refuse to work together to meet the quorum on essential legislation that should be at a constitutional level.\n\nFor instance, here in Austria, the constitution is not static and has been changed during its existence, because, while the political parties might disagree on many things, there are topics which they agree on. There are certain basic principles in our constitution which cannot be changed by the parliament and need a referendum, but this has also been done in the past (Austria joining the European Union was one of these, as it had a deep impact and therefore a referendum was held, and the result allowed us to join the EU and apply the necessary changes to our constition for it).\n\nAdditionally we have laws that are not directly part of our constitution (B-VG) but which are laws that have the rank of constitutional laws and are declared as such. These are laws that had to meet the requirements regarding the quorum and attendance in parliament (2/3 of the votes, at least 50% of the members taking part in the vote) and must be declared as such. This will grant them special protection from being changed and qualify them as being part of our constitution. This happens more regularily than changes to the constitution (B-VG) itself.\n\nLittle tidbit about the Austrian constitution and its \"father\" Hans Kelsen: Hans Kelsen emigrated to the US in the 1940s and then continued his work as a law scholar first at Harvard and later as a Professor at the University of California Berkeley and became an US citizen in 1945.",

We have no branches of government that aren't in Trump's pocket right now, therefore there's nobody that can do anything to stop him. It doesn't matter whether the Constitution is updated frequently and well if everybody that is supposed to uphold it is wiping their asses with it.  \n  \nThe whole system of checks and balances is in place in the first place to make something like this impossible, and for 250 years, it has been. Things had to align VERY specifically for anyone to be able to screw the government like Trump has, whether the Constitution got updated or not.",

I\u2019m not saying the British system is perfect, mind you - it\u2019s just significantly more flexible than ours, which is sort of ironic considering our origins. If we\u2019d given it a few more years and not thrown an epic tantrum over a taxation situation we caused, world history might look very different right now. (Although not sure if better or worse - it\u2019s not like British empire was exactly great for humanity any more than slavery was.) \n\nA thing can be changeable and easily adaptable and even evolve on its own without it being subject to the whims of a tyrannical minority. I\u2019d argue the tyrannical minority is still the problem anyway, considering our reliance on a politicized body of judges to decide what people really meant 250 years ago to determine the status of our entire republic and our civil rights. (To be clear, I know they don\u2019t care what anyone meant 250 years ago and are just using originalism as an excuse for their machinations.) \n\nAnyway, that was the whole point of common law and legal precedent, too. We retained quite a bit of this, but unlike the Brits, our constitution was this static, written thing, instead of something that evolved because people recognized a thing had changed. From Magna Carta to Parliament\u2019s power of the purse to the prime minister to a constitutional monarchy, I won\u2019t say evolution in British government has exactly been a rapid-fire affair, but it *has* happened, and without the need for a very specific formal vote from 3/4 of the states and 2/3 of congress. It just\u2026changes along with the people who live there. \n\nTrump unfortunately really isn\u2019t the problem; he\u2019s *a* problem, and a big one, but the root of the problem is us. We\u2019ve never been interested in addressing the inherent flaws in our system, whether those flaws are moral (slavery) or legal (those whom the law protects but does not bind) and American exceptionalism is a hell of a drug that we\u2019ve been shooting up for 250 years. There was always going to be a comeuppance for that if we didn\u2019t address it, and Trump is in office because rather than look to Germany as an example for how to redress grievous harm, we would literally vote our own republic into the ground rather than acknowledge our racism and our complicity in a system that destroys people and feeds their lives into the meat grinder of inequity and capitalism. At this point the whole thing is a tainted enterprise that cannot be salvaged, and if we get a chance to build something from the ashes, it had better be something better that includes the lessons we\u2019ve learned and those other nations have tried to teach us.",

And social media is driving the universality of it, at a much faster pace than what we were prepared for.\u00a0\n\n\nThe dreamers of the early internet recognized it as the potential Tower of Babel that it could be... And unfortunately we're so excited by what was in this newly formed dream that they forgot to look to their history books, to remind themselves of how those dreams can be exploited, using the wealth and cruelty of the capitalists, and the ignorance and apathy of the lowest common denominators of the human species.\u00a0\n\n\nSo here we are, at a time and place where we can reach anyone or anywhere in the world in a matter of milliseconds, and rather than use that unfathomable access to gain wisdom and knowledge and broader viewpoints, so many of the human race use it to simply confirm their worst beliefs, ideas, and desires.... And there are so many people waiting in the wings to profit from and encourage those base instincts.\n\n\nTearing down the internet would only continue to drive the isolationist tendencies that are already in play across the globe, and the arctically cold shock of shutting down all social media\u00a0would likely be enough of a flashpoint to create an explosion that we are not fully prepared for yet, much like cold turkeying heroin.\u00a0\n\n\nSo what do we do.... How do we simply command humanity at large to be better.... because truthfully that's what's needed.\n\n\nIt's not a puzzle I am sure we will ever have the answer to, but if we don't figure it out I'd rather see our species ended then watch us exponentially spread this to a universe I MUST hope, does not deserve it",

It was the legislature passing these new laws to empower the federal government to enforce these rulings. It was the president of the time ordering the military to enforce these laws and decisions. Jim Crow ended because a government finally got into power to enforce the laws that were already on the books; and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were simply public declarations of their intentions to do so.\n\nJim Crow was never constitutionally legal; and every one that participated in it, top to bottom; the politicians, businessmen,  the lawyers, the judges, the police officers, and not mention the NGOs that push hate, all of them? They should have gone to prison for violating the law so blatantly. Instead we let these politicians groom successors who'd pass new laws to undermine this new course; let businessmen and these lawyers form think tanks to get around the new laws again as well anyway they could; Judges with bias stayed on the bench long after they should have been removed; police of the time were allowed to influence the culture, training and policies that persist to this day; and the NGOs? Stuff like the \"Daughters of the Confederacy\" are still around pushing garbage like the \"lost cause\" myth and the KKK, despite being a literal domestic terror organization, is still around.\n\nWe had a second opportunity to correct our mistakes from the civil war, and we declined it.",

Should the military have overthrown every previous president for this?\n\nTrump is of course going further but there's no clear line for the military to remove an elected president that congress won't even impeach and convict. Maybe, if there was an impeachment and conviction and Trump refused to leave then they'd act. But this isn't going to happen.\n\nThe fact is, too many of the mechanisms of democratic government are pro-Trump, and Trump has too much support from the Republican electorate to imagine this happening.",

Giving good media time to solid all-around candidates who focus on unity, respect, decency, and a strong economy based on long-term investing in every American and soon-to-be American. \n\nBut they won't. We'll just.. yell at the avalanche coming down on us until it's too late.",

Whether or not DOGE and what it does falls into this category is what\u2019s up to question, not the end statement.\n\nHe was also asked if he would listen to the court if the results were unfavorable, and he said *yes*, that he always listens to the courts and his next move would be to start the appeal process. \n\nThe only way this comes out as a threat is if you assume he meant that denying something he thinks is good would always be a violation.

I'll also add I have a college education in American history and politics.  \n  \nIn 2008 we were in a massive financial crisis that destroyed most of the middle class. Many older republicans are former democrats who blame their former party for a wide range of social and economic problems that have been present since the end of the Bush era. The republican party of the 2000's does not exist anymore and has largely become a platform for anti-democrats. Concerningly, the opposite can be said of the democratic party today, which is to day, are largely anti-republican focused in action.\n\nThis is a really unsustainable platform for either party, as the first that breaks will always do so unwillingly, and the latter never fares so well. Historically, factions in that position almost always disbands or splinters.\n\nDemocracy is not a perfect system, and neither are republics. They both have problems that can really only be overcome through unity. Disunity exacerbates the problem, and well, here we are. Democracies and republics always fall, and we are experiencing several of the telltale signs of severe political turmoil.\n\nThe only thing I would amend of ops comment is that, America has been in a tail spin since 2003/04, with a large wedge issue stemming from interventions in the middle east among the American right and left wings.",
