There are a lot of former addicts and abusers in the faith because it is a very easy transference of addiction or controlling behavior without accountability or even meaningful change. It's the easiest thing in the world to say, \"I'm saved and born again\" and then every time you go back to the same behavior either justify it by a verse from Ephesians that says you are God's appointed ruler of your family/household OR just pretend to repent again. It actually became a status symbol for modern Evangelical men to be \"formerly\" abusive, dangerous, out-of-control addicts who are \"saved by grace\" or \"elect\" if you're Calvinists. They can claim to be the most radical in their faith and still enjoy the identity of being a selfish, controlling, abusive POS. \n\nOh and evangelicals will conveniently align with tradcaths and even moderate to progressive Catholics when it's convenient like anti-abortion movements, but then turn around and say to each they are going to hell because they aren't \"saved by grace.\"",

Ordo caritatis was devised by Thomas of Aquinus, who was a christian scholar, a monk even, but there was a lot of philosophical thought that didn't make it into the canonical teachings of catholicism, and this one didn't either. Add to that the protestants, and Vance is one, widely despised Thomas' work, and it makes for a really ignorant statement.",
