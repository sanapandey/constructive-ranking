This isn't Rome where individual consuls pay soldiers in land and booty, and a man like Marius can persuade a legion to support him over the republic. How, realistically, do you get entire units to secede? You don't, not unless the individuals at their head have their loyalty and the ability to pay them and foster them with weapons, vehicles, and equipment.",

Incumbent parties, regardless of what that party was, got absolutely hammered all around the world in 2024 as a result of the pandemic recovery economy. People just aren't that smart and don't think critically. Things are expensive = the current party's fault, full stop. And the media didn't help at all to correct that notion. The \"good\" thing about that is, if we ever get another remotely fair election, democrats will clean house due to all the economic fuckery from the orange admin. But that's a big if.\u00a0",

Harris performed worse than Biden in only 3 swing states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. In the other four, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nevada, she outperformed Biden. In the three states where she did worse, she would have still lost had she matched his numbers. Why? Because he simply got more voters to show up for him in those places than Biden did in 2020. That\u2019s the level of \u201cdone\u201d people were with the Democratic Party.

I was part of the Bernie coalition in the 2016 and 2020 primaries, and while we all talk about DNC sabotage and the DNC's tendency to work on \"turns\" rather than policy, it is also an unavoidable reality that Bernie did not have support among Black voters and many other necessary blocs.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) The bureau was an answer to the devastation of the 2008 financial crisis \u2014 created by Congress to safeguard Americans from abusive and irresponsible lenders, as well as to provide a bulwark against systemic financial risks.\n\nThe CFPB has been a rare bright spot for working people in Washington, returning more than $20 billion to consumers who were tricked or cheated by payday lenders, repo men, big banks, and other financial fraudsters.\n\nOn Monday, Warren joined a protest by CFPB union members to rally Americans in defense of the bureau\u2019s work, and to condemn Musk, who aims to launch his own payments network, likening him to \u201ca bank robber trying to fire the cops and turn off the alarms just before he strolls into the lobby.\u201d\n\nMusk is leading Donald Trump\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was granted sweeping access to sensitive CFPB data systems before the administration moved to effectively shutter the bureau, as it had done earlier with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nWarren spoke by phone, decrying a lawless Republican administration that has drawn America to the doorstep of a \u201cconstitutional crisis.\u201d\n\nRead: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elizabeth-warren-elon-musk-interview-cfpb-doge-conflicts-1235264256/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/elizabeth-warren-elon-musk-interview-cfpb-doge-conflicts-1235264256/)",
