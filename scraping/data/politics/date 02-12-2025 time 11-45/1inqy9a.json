The pain will increase until morale improves, I guess.\n\nElecting someone who relies on tariffs without the ability to reshore supply before they take effect, and demanding tax cuts as their only economic levers is never going to result in strong economic development for a nation as complex as the U.S.  The only real question at this point is whether those who fell for the con will realize and admit that they were conned.  I\u2019d guess they\u2019ll just project the blame onto another scapegoat.",
