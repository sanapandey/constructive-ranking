I think at that time the US was being classified as a liberal oligarchy, which meant that the power sharing of the elites was bound by some normalized structure of rules that were connected to governing principles and documents as well as commonly accepted set of national values.  At this time we have become an illiberal oligarchy as our leaders have no connection to a commonly accepted of national values, the cases that allowed for the types of contributions we have seen have widened the gap in political influence for the elites, and we now seem to have no structure of rules and a vague disinterest to the nation's governing documents.  Hopefully this is a brief forray into illiberalism and we can then move back towards the old days where we have at least a passing connection to governmental documents and the ethos of America.",
