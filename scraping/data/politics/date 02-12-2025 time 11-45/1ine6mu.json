I liked almost everything he did or tried to do, with the major exception of the Israel-Hamas conflict. Aside from that, he was probably the best, most progressive president of my lifetime by a fairly wide margin.\n\nBut failing to deal with MAGA may very well have doomed the country. Letting his pride get in the way of what's right may have doomed the country. \n\nWhen he announced he wasn't running, I still had hope. Kamala appeared to run a good campaign and my support for her sort of blinded me to her shortcomings. I thought him dropping out would be remembered as one of the greatest acts of the office. \n\nBut I think we know now that he dropped out too late. Before he even became president he was indicating that he might step down during his term. If we at the very least had a primary, things almost certainly would've been different. Trump barely won, and may have even cheated.\n\nIt's like he believed that Trump couldn't happen again. He made sure the Justice Department played softball with Trump and his goons, presumably because he didn't think Trump had a chance of winning again.",

The problem isn't that a court couldn't order a general not to do a strike but that there usually is not enough time to stop it before it occurs making any legal proceedings until afterwards. \n\nJust look at Guantanamo Bay detention of enemy combatants. Courts ordered the military (Generals/Admirals) to do things like provide access to legal counsel and that habeas corpus applies.\n\nThe entire basis of our military is that it is civilian run. A civilian is the Commander in Chief, civilians run the budget and set operational priorities, and civilians decide if we will take military action. The whole idea that a federal judge could not order a general/admiral not to do something is laughable and flies in the face of the entire structure of our republic.",
