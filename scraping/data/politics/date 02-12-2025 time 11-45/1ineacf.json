Similarly, it will look into how Russian intelligence penetrated Epstein\u2019s operation and placed within it **Russian nationals who infiltrated the highest level of Silicon Valley and America\u2019s tech sector as part of Vladimir Putin\u2019s assault on America.**\n\n...\n\n>Then, just in case you haven\u2019t had enough of the rabbit hole, Unger tells the story of the former Palm Beach deputy sheriff John Mark Dougan [who ends up in Moscow with some of Epstein\u2019s tapes.](https://i.imgur.com/udVXviE.jpeg)[!]\n\nElmo is another Putin puppet chomo alongside Trump.",
