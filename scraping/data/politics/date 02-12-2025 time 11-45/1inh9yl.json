Many involved in the protest, she said, also were concerned with how the Trump administration\u2019s directives would affect people in the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nLittle badasses",

I graduated High School on a US Air Force base in Germany and know a few of my classmates that ended up staying, but typically they continue working civilian jobs on the base, so they're still covered by that employment and would have to return to the US if they left/lost that job. That said a higher percentage of kids in DoDEA schools compared to state-side schools are multi-nationals because one or both of their parents are from another country. If its from a EU country then they can stay without any problems in Germany.\n\nThese kids though are still pretty young, so odds are they'll move to another base with their parent(s) before they graduate. Most active duty military families move every 2-4 years.",

I've googled the question in enough variations to land on a CIA watchlist, but I found nothing supporting that claim. It also makes no sense because everyone on US bases is subject to special military jurisdictions, and I'm pretty certain the US is not routinely putting foreign civilians in front of US military courts.\n\n>Not sure what distinction you're trying to make but US bases overseas are an extension of the US\n\nThe distinction I'm trying to make is that they only are extensions of the US *TO YOU*. In the eyes of the host countries and international law, you're guests who are being granted special liberties in a designated area. That doesn't give you any legal authority over the host countries citizens beyond evicting them from the premises and handing them over to the host countries' civilian police. In fact, the other way around, US service members committing crimes off base can and will be tried in the host countries' civilian courts - if they can be caught and proven guilty before returning to actual US soil. Though of course that isn't the case in all host countries, particularly not in the less voluntary ones.",

Complaining about bone spurs? Maybe the nation was sick of waging unnecessary wars, and student protests amplified that message. It's what democracies do when their representatives don't listen.\n\n>[In the early hours](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nixon-meets-anti-war-protestors-lincoln-memorial) of May 9, 1970, a frazzled [President Richard Nixon](https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/richard-m-nixon) embarks upon what his chief of staff will describe as \"the weirdest day so far\" of his presidency. Preoccupied with the recent [Kent State shootings](https://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/kent-state-shooting) and the unrest that has spread to college campuses across the country, Nixon makes an [impromptu and bizarre visit to a group of anti-war protesters](https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2020/05/fifty-years-ago-president-nixon-visits-lincoln-memorial/?mc_cid=892fe7d8bd&mc_eid=[fb2d6e82d5) at the [Lincoln Memorial](https://www.history.com/news/the-lincoln-memorials-bizarre-rejected-designs).\n\n>On the Friday after the Kent State massacre, in which Ohio National Guard killed four students and wounded nine during an anti-war protest, Nixon was unable to sleep. Around 4 in the morning, after spending several hours making phone calls, he roused his personal valet, Manolo Sanchez, and asked him if he had ever seen the Lincoln Memorial at night. Knowing he would encounter a crowd of student protesters that had camped out on the National Mall, Nixon set off with Sanchez, his physician and a Secret Service team.\n\nIt made Nixon lose sleep, and that's good enough. \n\n>[Yet over the past two decades](https://jacobin.com/2020/04/kent-state-shooting-vietnam-war-protest-student-organizing), college and high-school students have walked out again, across the country, in highly visible and coordinated fashion. In March 2003, they poured out of 350 schools to protest the impending US invasion of Iraq. Fifteen years later, about 1 million students at 3,000 schools walked out to join a seventeen-minute vigil organized in response to the mass shooting at Parkland High School in Florida. And just last September, hundreds of thousands of students left school to join rallies and marches organized as part of a Global Climate Strike.\n\nAgain, student protests are, bar an exception or two, on the right side of history every time. Maybe the issue is a significant portion of society doesn't care about education or children nor their opinions.",
