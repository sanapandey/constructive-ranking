If people actually researched anything that he explicitly said he was going to do it was all inflationary. All he has to do is just say he will do something and these people believe it even his proposed policies say otherwise. They honestly think there is some kind of magic wand he can wave and have no interest in learning how these things actually work and why it\u2019s been such a process to bring down inflation and avoid a recession. It was just easier to blame Biden and therefore Harris.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve heard of any attempts on bringing down prices, he\u2019s too busy worrying about plastic straws and harassing our neighbors with tariffs.\u00a0",

Just wait until the effects of the tariffs and removing immigrant labor fully take effect. Thankfully the Fed is ignoring Trump\u2019s repeated requests to lower interest rates or else inflation would get even worse.\u00a0",
