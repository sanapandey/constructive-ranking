So here's a math lesson for you:\n\nOut of that 245 million eligible voters, 155,211,283 voted in 2024. Out of them, 77,302,580 voted for Trump.\n\n    155,211,283 - 77,302,580 = 77,908,703\n\nThat's how many people didn't vote for Trump. Most voted for Harris, the rest voted for third party candidates like Stein. Now, I'm not a math professor but my calculator says that 77,908,703 is higher than 77,302,580 by 606,123. Which means that Trump didn't get a majority of the popular vote, exactly as the AP article above stated.\n\nNow, here's the difficult part, stay with me:\n\n245 million (all eligible voters) divided by 77.3 million (number of Trump voters) = 3.17. Now take 100% and divide it by that number and you'll get the exact percentage of eligible voters who voted for Trump. Well, what do you know, we're now at 31.5%! Better than 27.6% I quoted using your earlier number, but still a long cry from 50%, let alone above that.\n\nAnd of course these are eligible voters. If you follow these steps for the overall population of about 345 million, you'll get 22.4% I gave you earlier. Hope this helped.\n\n[If Less Than 115,000 Votes Had Switched in Three Battleground States, Harris Would Have Beaten Trump](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/three-battleground-states-defeated-trump/)",

Radio broadcasts and ten-cent machetes to use Rwanda as an example. In a US hypothetical, a smartphone app, pocket pistols, and AR-15s.\n\nIt sounds insane, but not all that difficult to bait otherwise reasonable people into unrestrained deadly rage for the necessary amount of time. It doesn't have to be sustained forever, nearly a million people were slaughtered in Rwanda in only 100 days.\n\nEDIT: typo",

Eventually, other students get into it, and it gets out of control; the teacher has an assembly to explain what was going on.\n\nBut in the TV movie, there was one student who wasn't very good, kind of lazy and unliked. And when he realized he was part of this special class, part of this group, part of the \"in\" crowd, he cleaned up. He dressed better. He was attentive in class. He would participate. As I recall, he was devastated (in the movie) when he found out that there was no national leader, no national movement. I don't know if there was a real character like this in the actual class or not.\n\nBut that appeal to the folks who felt they were the underdogs, the unwanted...that's very much part of what makes fascism work. If they can do their part, they are welcome. But you can ask [Ernst R\u00f6hm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm#Personal_life_and_death) how his career in Nazi Germany worked out.",

If lucky they got taken in by halfway decent folks and treated like a household or farm appliance depending on gender.

For context, IQ consists of multiple indexes (which differ between tests) which form an aggregate, known as the Full Scale IQ. The gold standard tests (those by Weschler) include a verbal IQ index, and my understanding is that intelligence and the corresponding FSIQ score (as it's conceived of by the psychological community) is weighted far more heavily by verbal than most other domains.\n\n\nI can tell you without a doubt that based on the way Trump speaks, his verbal IQ score would be well under 95. It would, at best, be an 89 (upper cut off of Low Average), and I would not be remotely surprised if it's actually quite a bit lower than that.\n\n\nI won't really hazard a guess as to his other cognitive functioning, but it's telling that he speaks in the manner he does. He either has a low verbal IQ or has a neurodegenerative condition which deteriorates his verbal ability and would artificially lower the score he would receive if tested.",

Florida expanded its death penalty and lowered the threshold for it to be prescribed by a jury. Trump wants to do speedy cases without proper jurisprudence through military tribunals. \n\nIt's a bit morbid and entertaining to see threads like these and people laughing and joking about it all in a way that down plays the seriousness of the America we live in. You all both disgust and intrigue me. All content to let it happen and unfold rather than do something. The people are the last line left here ans the people are content to bicker about musk and trumps hair styles or other inane details of the going ons.

Beginning in the late 1930s, proponents rationalized involuntary sterilization as protecting vulnerable women from unwanted pregnancy. By World War II, programs in the United States had sterilized approximately 60,000 persons. After the horrific revelations concerning Nazi eugenics (German Hereditary Health Courts approved at least 400,000 sterilization operations in less than a decade), eugenic sterilization programs in the United States declined rapidly.

At some point, she was able to get a job as a waitress, I believe, and was successful in the position. I\u2019m not sure if she was still living in the institution, but she decided she wanted to have a baby (I can\u2019t remember if she\u2019d gotten married) and someone reported her somehow and then she had to go to trial to see if she was deemed to be smart enough to have a baby. The presiding judge was on the fence but ultimately decided that the woman should be sterilized, and she was then subjected to forced sterilization. \n\nI couldn\u2019t find this particular story, but here is a link associated with that case [Forced Sterilization in the US, PBS link](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/unwanted-sterilization-and-eugenics-programs-in-the-united-states/)\n\nHere is not the exact same story, but an even more interesting one:\n\n[NPR Podcast- Emma, Carrie, Vivian: How a family became a test case for forced sterilizations](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/17/695574984/emma-carrie-vivian-how-a-family-became-a-test-case-for-forced-sterilizations)",

It's impossible to make a test that covers human knowledge in general so there will always be bias, your results depend heavily on how you prepped beforehand, you can always retake the test etc. To be honest, you have to lack critical thinking skills to grant that much credence to the IQ test.\n\nCalling someone \"low IQ\" also implies that intelligence is inherent and unchanging in a person, which is exactly what people like Musk and Trump believe. Trump has stated multiple times that he is so great because of his genes. Musk has spent his entire life paying people to make him look better in any way he can think of including paying people to play video games for him.\n\nThey are both perfect demonstrations of what it looks like when an idiot tries to look smart and they're going to get a lot of people killed.",

What's even weirder is that Trump wants tax cuts for corporations and people making > 400 k a year, but not the middle class & his tariffs would disproportionately affect the pockets of middle and lower class Americans compared to the wealthy. I'm sick of the republicans acting like they're the ones in support of the low and middle class. You want to strip welfare and food stamps. You reverse caps on the costs of inhalers. Interestingly enough, today in my education class I learned that 90% of democrats think teachers are underpaid, while only 66% of republicans did. You guys don't actually care about the working class, at least not to the extent that the democrats do. And in which case, you're supporting something that the people you cheerfully elected aren't even supporting. \n\n\nTariffs on foreign manufactured goods? Ah, so you don't believe the vast majority of economists. I have a question for you, what well known and well respected economist that are in favor of tariffs do you know? Can you give me any source that indicates that tariffs will have a net positive on the average American?\n\nFree trade, but you just mentioned tariffs? What? Free trade does not restrict imports and exports. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods. How are you going to argue in favor of tariffs and then bring up something that completely contradicts that? Are you serious? \n\nRequiring all government sources to source their labor 100% from American sources. Oh like the Trump watches made from non-American sources? Also can you give me any example of this being mandated and carried out? \n\nSupply side economics- tax cuts on individuals and businesses and allowing free trade. Again, Trump only wants tax cuts for the wealthy and tariffs restrict free trade. I'm waiting for a modern republican response that's actually a good thing. \n\nReduced taxes- we're under Trump tax policy right now and we have been for the entire Biden administration. If you think your taxes are high, thank Trump. Again, hes not lowering your taxes. And the proposed tariffs will disproportionately affect the middle class.\n\nBringing back trade and vocational training in schools- literally what are you talking about? Most decent sized school districts now have college prep/career tech programs. My school had several of these. \n\nReturning to two genders- not sure how you think this affects the middle class, but gender is a cultural and sociological term, while sex refers to biology. So, when you say that, you're really trying to say two sexes, but you're wrong. There are intersex people. There are people with chromosome abnormalities and the absence of reproductive organs. Also, the Trump executive made us all females. It defined gender as what it is at conception, but everyone is a female at conception. God, thought you were the party of facts over feelings. \n\nSo, I debunked every single one of your points quite easily.\n\nNow here's what the Biden administration did or Kamala Harris called for:\n- pay raises for teachers \n- caps on prescription drug costs \n- Unemployment back down to pre-pandemic levels \n- A 25k house credit for first time home buyers \n- Not imposing unreasonable tariffs on two of our closest trading partners \n- Actually had a healthcare and childcare policy rather than \"concepts\" \n- Expanding the child tax credit \n- Spending trillions less than Trump \n- Inflation reduction act \n- Not calling for the gutting of  programs such as social security and food stamps \nI didn't have to go back to the 70s or blatantly contradict myself to defend my side, but you did.",
