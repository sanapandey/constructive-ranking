Then he tries to pretend it's because he thinks meeting \"the troops\" is more important. That's not your job Peter, you're in a civilian, mostly administrative position, not the [Warlord Barbecue ](https://youtu.be/ED_V4R-LnmA). Just shut the fuck up and make sure everybody\u2019s paychecks arrive on time. Just a thought, but maybe Peter should put some time into answering that Pentagon Townhall question about procurement as it relates to our long-term national defense strategy that Peter answered with \"I just found the Pentagon bathroom\". Yeah, maybe less worrying about bathrooms and more about the job responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense would be a good idea. \n\nThen, the military servicemembers, their families, federal workers, and host nation personnel on the base in Germany all ignore Peter and boo him. Turns out \"the troops\" care about upholding the constitution, not having Jim Crow 2.0/fascism thrust upon them, hate book bans, and don't like seeing their families and friends targeted for no reason. I saw a post that said Peter was walking near a base street and didn't appear to be paying attention to traffic, so someone yelled, \"Hey, look out, Fascist.\" And the craziest thing is everyone immediately knew where to look, even the kid with the balloon knew where to look!",
