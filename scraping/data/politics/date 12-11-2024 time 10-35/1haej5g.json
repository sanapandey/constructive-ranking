Smith, investigative reporters with the AP, and Aaron Kessler, a data journalist and investigative reporter with the AP.\n\nJason and Michelle have covered extremism for years, and it grabbed our attention when University of Maryland researcher Michael Jensen, a leading extremism researcher, found a \u201chuge spike\u201d in the number of extremists with a military background starting in 2017. Jensen agreed to provide his group\u2019s exclusive data to AP for deeper analysis. We've interviewed dozens of researchers, service members, advocacy groups and extremism experts to understand the problem. We found that since 2017, more than 480 people with a military background were accused of ideologically driven extremist crimes, while nearly 100 people were killed or injured in plots involving current or former military members, most in service of a far-right agenda. Among the findings was that extremist plots involving service members or veterans were more likely to involve weapons training or firearms than plots that didn\u2019t include someone with a military background. And that such attacks were more deadly.\n\nThe AP\u2019s main story focused on Chris Arthur, a former National Guardsman and Iraq War veteran, who began preparing for civil war and training civilians, one of whom got into a gun battle with police. Our story presented new evidence that countered official accounts of the growth of extremism among the nation\u2019s military service members and veterans, and painted a damning picture of years of inaction by the Pentagon and federal law enforcement. A follow-up story looked into a study the Pentagon funded into extremism in the military after veterans and service members were among the crowd that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The study\u2019s findings downplayed the issue, but our reporting found that it relied on old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence. As a result, the AP found the study grossly undercounted the number of military and veterans arrested for Jan. 6 and provided a misleading picture of the severity of the growing problem.\n\nWe're here to talk about this project and how we were able to tell this story.

Smith, reporters for AP\u2019s global investigations team\n* Aaron Kessler, a data and investigative journalist for AP\n\nRead the full investigation: [https://apnews.com/article/military-extremism-pentagon-veterans-terrorism-capitol-riot-jan-6-0c1fdd7b6b761e9c9e8556a9b9e45dc9](https://apnews.com/article/military-extremism-pentagon-veterans-terrorism-capitol-riot-jan-6-0c1fdd7b6b761e9c9e8556a9b9e45dc9)\n\nThe follow-up: [https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-military-extremism-jan-6-pete-hegseth-ea43535cd37abded5a0ed6aaba514115](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-military-extremism-jan-6-pete-hegseth-ea43535cd37abded5a0ed6aaba514115)\n\nWatch the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9O9A832Qmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9O9A832Qmo)\n\nPROOF: [https://bsky.app/profile/apnews.com/post/3lcobm7qjys2q](https://bsky.app/profile/apnews.com/post/3lcobm7qjys2q)",

He called the oversight \u201cproblematic\u201d given his, and the working group\u2019s, mission.  \n\n> \u201cI am very surprised by the existence of the report.\u201d  \n\n> A defense official did not address why the report was not sent directly to the working group.  \n\nIn what ways does the US military as a system have norms that might attract or make it harder to root out extremists? \n\nFor example, is there resistance from members to seeing the military disparaged, or is there maybe ideological sympathy that\u2019s repeated in the system?",

                    "body": "Extremism among military members and veterans isn\u2019t a new issue \u2013 you can find reports dating back decades dealing with Ku Klux Klan cells in the Marines to other groups who used their access to military training and weaponry to train and arm other extremists. Even so, the military is such a vast organization that coming up with a one-size-fits-all way of combating extremism has so far eluded it.\n\nThere have been many efforts over the years. For example, after the white supremacist and anti-government Army veteran Timothy McVeigh bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City, and the murder of two Black people by active duty soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg in the 1990s, military leaders then were forced to address the issue. After the Bragg murders, the Army launched an effort to learn how pervasive extremism was. A survey of about 17,000 soldiers conducted by the Army in 1996 reported that only a small number identified with extremist beliefs in a force of millions. The DoD instituted a ban on tattoos of some extremist imagery, such as swastikas, but did little to improve deterrence.  \n\nBut over the next two decades, racist murders, mass shootings and other extremist-linked violence conducted by service members and veterans nonetheless began to increase, AP\u2019s data analysis and records review found.  \n\nIn 2017, the data show another spike in extremist crimes committed by active duty and veterans, most of them aligned with far-right, white supremacist and anti-government ideologies.  \n\nImmediately after the Jan. 6 insurrection, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin took some action. He ordered a force-wide \u201cstand down\u201d to give time to local military commanders to discuss the issue with personnel. He empaneled a Countering Extremist Activity Working Group to study and recommend solutions. Among the group\u2019s recommendations was to clarify what was prohibited under the military\u2019s ban on extremist activity. The revised policy, released in December 2021, now specifies that\u00a0anti-government or anti-democratic actions\u00a0are violations of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice.  \n\nThose experts who tracked the Pentagon\u2019s post-Jan. 6 efforts say they made some strides, but that it fizzled largely due to pushback from Republicans in Congress who held up funding on any bills that included measures to address extremism.  \n\nToday the military still mostly relies on unit commanders to police those in their charge, and to report them when issues arise. This branch-by-branch, unit-by-unit approach complicates efforts to measure extremism military-wide.  \n\nIn terms of norms, many we talked with said the culture of relying on your fellow military brothers and sisters to survive and thrive was antithetical to racist beliefs. Many said that people with extremist beliefs would erode unit cohesion, which makes it even more important to put better systems in place to root out extremists, but also to better track it so that there\u2019s a better understanding of the scope of the problem.\n\n\\--Jason Dearen\u00a0",

It tried to address that issue, and it was deliberately and intentionally hampered by Republicans in congress.\n\nRemind me, what's the terminology for someone who actively hampers the readiness of the US Armed Forces, and the punishments for that?\n\n18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2387 \nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2387",

The military is subordinate to civilian elected officials. It is important to remain capable of loyally serving whoever wins an election. That doesn\u2019t mean individuals don\u2019t have strong opinions. It does mean there is organizational resistance to questioning the politics of individuals lest it seem that there is an official policy of what politics are permitted.",

At the time, no one really talked about trump. It was always \"just another president\" but before I left, which was only a few months ago, Trump supporters were far more vocal. They also spewed alot more of the hateful rhetoric that he did. Shit pertaining to Illegals, welfare participants, and pure disdain for the current commander and chief. There was no loyalty in the ranks for alot of those people. And they generally werent typical E-1 -> E-4 shit bags just being contrarian for the sake of pissing people off. These were Section NCOIC's, PSG's even command teams. Theres a Trump epidemic in the ranks, and no one believes me. It seems theyre all going off older polling data that says the military is surprisingly liberal. They dont take into account that service members,in my humble opinion, are just as, if not MORE likely to fall for propaganda and disinformation than the average American. Mostly because the military is built on the pretense of, \"do as I say, not as I do\", and a lack of perceived ability to question the authority of those above them in the CoC.\n\nBit of a rant, sorry",

You may think that everyone joins for the same reason, but it is simply not true.  People go into the military for a variety of reasons.  I enlisted because I was simply bored, and had no direction in life.  Fresh out of high school, I was book smart, but hated sitting in classrooms.  No idea what to do for a career, but I also knew that I would have the same feeling of \"boredom\" going to college.\n\nTalking to others throughout my single tour of duty, I met people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, who joined for a variety of reasons.  Some joined because there was a tradition in the family of military service, some joined because of a sense of service to the country, some joined because they had machinations of being a mercenary, some joined because a judge said \"jail or military\", some joined for the education benefits, some joined because it was \"a job\".\n\n> the desire to withstand the \"harsh\" conditions of bootcamp\n\nThat is not a \"desire\".  It is a stubborness, or a willpower thing.  A \"not give up during adversity\".  I tell people that boot camp is more mental that physical.  Yes, there is a physical aspect, but the biggest thing is the ability to persevere...to work under pressure.  That is a trait that is desired in many fields, not just the military.  The ability to ignore the chaos and remain focused.\n\nI work in IT now, and the ability to remain calm when \"shit is burning\" is a good thing.\n\n> very group think environment filters \"society\" down to a very select few who are successful in the military.\n\nAnd sports.  And the business world.  Every company in the world wants its' employees to work together for a common goal.  And I would also mention that leadership comes in many forms, even in the military.  Some lead by intimidation/fear, some lead by cheer leading, some lead by example, some lead by intelligence.  And the subordinates all respond differently to the different types of leadership.\n\n> the ability to assimilate to a very group think environment filters \"society\" down to a very select few who are successful in the military.\n\nBut a vast majority of people do one tour and are done.  I guess we need to define what \"successful\" means.  Making a career of it, or just \"honorable discharge\", regardless of time served?  Lots of people hate the military after joining.",

Recruits all had different desires, goals, lack of goals, intelligence levels, personalities and family backgrounds . These backgrounds exists throughout society and a particular set, given all those variables, all chose the military. Unless you think the choice is random, that is a great filter to evaluate.\n\nYou want to redefine desire to stubborness. That's fine. Now you have a put one defining characteristic on this dataset.\n\nIn regards to group think. You're right it is everywhere, but not at the level found in the military. There is no civilian organization legally allowed to impose strict adherence to group think. Not judging good or bad just stating reality. To defy group think in the military is to risk facing consequences to your physical person, ranging from deprivation of liberty to in some cases, death. There is no choice, as in a civilian workplace to say \" I'm out this doesnt' work for me.\"\n\nFinally, I wouldn't define success as an honorable discharge, but the perfection of any skills valuable for a combative situation or its support, and that would benefit an extremist group.\n\nIn short, a microcosm of society would produce individuals with the same psychological characteristics of the society at large. Zammyboobs was trying to use a microcosm model to predict whether Trump woud have have the backing of the military. While I believe most would follow orders, I think trying to create an analogy between between the citizens of the US and US military is not an accurate predictor. In the end, the researchers, I believe, are trying to determine whether the miltary could be used in manners anethema to the U.S. Constitution. Based on my exposure I would say unequivocally yes. There is no Constitutional law class in bootcamp so the average soldier is not equipped to determine an unconstitutional order.",

Of those 311 were enlisted, 116 were non-commissioned officers and 42 were officers.\n\nThere are examples at many ranks: from the\u00a0[Green Beret with 20 years in the Army](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/04/10/former-green-beret-jan-6-rioter-and-gop-candidate-sent-prison-stockpile-of-ammo-guns-and-grenades.html)\u00a0being charged with storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 to an Army specialist who said\u00a0[he enlisted so he could get better at killing Black people](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/soldier-dismissed-army-allegedly-said-enlisted-become-proficient-killi-rcna46900).  \n  \nMichael Flynn, a retired lieutenant general in the Army, has never been charged with an extremist crime and is not included in the data from START. But Flynn whipped up the crowd the night before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. When he went before the Jan. 6 committee, he pleaded the Fifth when he was asked if the violence that day was justified. (For more on Flynn, you can check out our Peabody Award-winning project with PBS Frontline,\u00a0[Michael Flynn\u2019s Holy War](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/michael-flynn-government-insider-holy-warrior/).)\n\nOne thing we know is that people with a military background have a high value to extremist groups and are often targeted for recruitment.  \n  \nThat was really apparent on Jan. 6, when people with military backgrounds led the charge up the Capitol steps. More than 230 people with military backgrounds were arrested in connection with the attack. And of the 14 people convicted of seditious conspiracy, the most serious charge resulting from Jan. 6, eight previously served in the military.  \n  \nOur analysis of the data found both cases where extremists worked in teams and alone, but a key aspect of the analysis was that when an military member or veteran was involved in an extremist plot, those plots were more likely to include firearms and training. So they were highly collaborative.  \n  \nAs for your last question, Aaron calls it \"an impossible choice.\" Jason and I agree the answer is pizza. It\u2019s the perfect food.\n\n\\-- Michelle R.

The stereotype of the \"dumb poor servicemember\" is largely false.  \n\nThe average military servicemember comes from the middle three economic quintiles of American society. \n Also the military is statistically better-educated than the civilian population.  You can't enlist without a GED or high school diploma.  You can't commission as an officer without a Bachelor's degree.  Senior enlisted often have their degrees as well, and both senior officers and enlisted often have postgraduate education.\n\nWhat's more, the reason Western militaries are as good as they are compared to more authoritarian nations is precisely because of the concept of \"mission command,\" whereby a leader formulates an overall intent and then leaves it up to his/her subordinates to be creative and flexible implementing the details.  This is why the US and its allies crushed the Iraqi military during the set-piece combat phases of both Gulf Wars, and why the Russians got smacked so badly in the opening phases of the Ukraine War.  One side rewarded creativity, flexibility, and individual initiative, while the other was a totalitarian society that required top brass to make basic decisions.  Ukraine is not as far along that path as the US Military, but after the 2014 invasion they made a concerted effort to catch up and seek Western training for their forces.",

No personal failing, I caught a *REALLY* nasty strain of norovirus that basically fucked my GI tract up for months, I was hospitalized for a whole week and everything, and I just wasn't improving. Wanted to be there really badly, but it didn't pan out, I wasn't in any sort of physical shape for it.\n  \nI can tell you, and my post history will back this that I'm basically a Democratic socialist in my political leanings, I think a highly, properly regulated hybrid system mixing capitalism and socialism like the Scandinavian states is the way to go. There's room for both, just want better controls on capitalism.\n  \nThe people I met and are still really close friends with from my time there are pretty similar leaning - I don't recall what my one friend's intended rate was, but the other served as a Navy Corpsman with the Fleet Marine Forces, and again, both of their political leanings are *VERY* similar to mine.

Among the groups with the largest number of such individuals tied to to them were organizations like the Sovereign Citizens movement, Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters.  \n  \nAs to whether these groups and individuals are cooperating, your question is very timely, in that in the past, a lot of these groups tended to be insular. Especially when it came to ones who didn't share the same ideological motivation, they weren't always looking to act jointly - so for example, even within the far-right universe, there are a range of different motivations underlying certain factions, and people are drawn to them for different reasons based on their worldview and what they want to see happen.  \n  \nBut in recent years, we've started to see a shift - groups that traditionally wouldn't have been cooperating and planning together have started doing so. They are finding common cause around what they perceive to be shared antagonists that are motivating them to work together. Whether this trend continues remains to be seen, but it's been one that extremist researchers have been increasingly following in recent years.\n\n\\- Aaron Kessler",

Maybe they see no way of getting what they want, and the only people left who will even work with them are others who are willing to play dirty. Could get messy if they're desperate, but it sounds too dysfunctional to be a large-scale threat.\n\nI am no kind of expert, just a confused person in Missouri guessing and shrugging.\n\nMy hope is that the truth is too apparent for the bad guys to win. In the information age, with so many people paying attention and communicating with each other, no global takeover is going to stick. However, there are always casualties. I hope we can learn from all of this.",

Some animal rights and environmental groups are included in this category.\n\nTo see more specifics, you can\u00a0[find the PIRUS definitions here](https://www.start.umd.edu/pirus-frequently-asked-questions#q7).\u00a0\n\n\\-- \u00a0Michelle R.
