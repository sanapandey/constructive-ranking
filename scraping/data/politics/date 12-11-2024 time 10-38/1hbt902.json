Investors generally had to be given an equal say in corporate governance, and corporations were required to comply with the purposes expressed in their charters. Therefore, some large-scale businesses used other forms of association; for example, Andrew Carnegie formed his steel operation as a limited partnership and John D. Rockefeller set up Standard Oil as a corporate trust.\n\nIn the late 19th century, state governments started to adopt more permissive corporate laws\n\nSo it seems the rich and powerful have created loop holes which needed to be opened more.  They got hit with anti-trust (which is where the term came from) and then just started to attack government. \n\nYou are here.",

Well, a bill like this directly aims at that target and should be something they support, if they truly want populist support from the working class.\n\nAnd I believe that many people who voted for Trump did so because they're frustrated with the current state of inequality and corporate dominance in the United States, and a bill like this strikes at the heart of that. \n\nI don't expect the Republicans to do this. I actually expect them to do whatever they can to screw over the working class.",

It helps to keep the temperature high and ensure people's short memories don't forget political events and their ramifications easily. \n\nSo much of living in the age of breaking news is too much information and too much forgetfulness and that's what corrupt leaders bank on- short memories for bleak world events and resultant scope for misinformation and propoganda.",
