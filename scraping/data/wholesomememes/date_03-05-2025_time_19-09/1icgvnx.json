Like \"raided donated clothing piles and sewed anything onto anything\" style.",

Typical business or school dresscodes for women involve covering tatoos and not showing midrift and cleavage. For men its covering tatoos and wearing a suit and tie. Neither gender wants to dress that way, but it's a workplace not a social gathering.\n\nIf its just a man judging a random woman in public then yeah, thats clearly wrong. But the fact he is in a suit makes it seem like its a workplace thing.",
