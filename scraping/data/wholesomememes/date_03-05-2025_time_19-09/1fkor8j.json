Hope in hope who never fails, in the culmination of hope, and hope in other things, like better work life, home life, school life etc, these things are refined and perfected by God because we are not meant to fail but we do have negative and positive effects on each other.\u00a0So God bless you all in your responses the circumstances that befall you, and on the better and greater way you will learn to navigate life, both in God and in your understanding of the true inner workings of the things and ways of life. Matthew 6:24-34.\n\n\nHope in One who provides will always be sure and delivered, Praise God. Is your hope in the same? \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffe Amen and keep safe, Hallelujah.",
