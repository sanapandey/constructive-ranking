Her mental state is now basically a child. She never had long left to live in the first place but you chose to not cherish what little time you had with her before she mentally deteriorated and slowly start forgetting. Now you'll never be able to experience her cooking or see her smile again becuase you prioritized study and games over her. I will strangle you if I ever get the chance to see you. FYI Grandma's still alive but shes no longer the grandma she used to be when I was younger. All of her well known friends that always visited her or go out together with her when I was younger already passed away while she is the only one left.",
