But other than making sure they know you're available no matter what, don't overstay your welcome. Sometimes wanting to be left alone is genuinely the answer and it's important to respect that. Just make sure they're safe they know you're available if they change their mind and then leave them to make their own decisions about what they want.",

It's been 3 years where I'll still reach out to say I miss her, and she just likes the message but doesn't reply. She said I wasn't putting in the effort she needs from friendships. I still love her and miss her so deeply. I'm heartbroken over losing my sister in crime",
