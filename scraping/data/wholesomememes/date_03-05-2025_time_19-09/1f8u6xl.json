This is probably not even the whole comic.\n\nThere is a free? 20 page story on the net where Rory makes his dad a cup of coffee while the dad is working at his computer and the dad then spills the coffee on it later by accident. Rather than owning up to his mistake, the dad then blames Rory for the computer breaking down and wants Rory to pay for it. The rest of the story then escalates into mind games between the dad and Rory about getting the other to admit that they were responsible for breaking the computer.\n\nSo probably not a wholesome comic.",
