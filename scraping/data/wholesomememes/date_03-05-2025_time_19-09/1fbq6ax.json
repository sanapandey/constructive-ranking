A lot of people with childhood trauma don't know what healthy behavior and interactions are, it's a confusing time transitioning away from that while gravitating towards change and positivity. Old patterns, self destructive tendencies and so on takes time to heal and recognize, on that road to a better and healthy life bridges will get burnt, opportunities lost and good people disappointed but it's all part of getting better and work on/recognize. It's all about getting the puzzle pieces together, but once shit is stabalized and you know how to deal with it and communicate properly life gets A LOT better. The most importabt part is cutting out negative influences and toxic people",
