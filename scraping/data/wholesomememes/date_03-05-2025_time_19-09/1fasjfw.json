Imposter syndrome is often because you measure yourself against what you hear about others. And generally, you only hear about them either fucking up badly, which seems to be an incident, or them being very competent, which seems the norm.\n\nBut you yourself see your own small mistakes that others don't see. And others make the same mistakes, which you don't see. So there is a big difference in information which leads to the feeling that you're not compitent enough for your current function and not deserving of what you have achieved.",

As you could imagine, absolutely demolished my self-esteem. My teachers at my special-ed school saw how much I loved academia, saw my potential for success in school. They helped me to develop the skills I\u2019d need to succeed in college, even if it meant letting go of my hand and having me practice those skills on my own. It was scary, and painful, and imposter syndrome absolutely pops up, but now I am three years into my college career and I could not be happier.\n\nLong comment, but I just wanted to say good meme, OP. People who believe in you, who let you know what they see in you when you struggle to see it yourself, make all the difference if you let them.",
