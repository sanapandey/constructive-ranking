Something small and unique, like a specific (but not difficult) order plus a 30% minimum tip has never failed me.

I would hook him up with drinks or other free things. That was about 10 or so years ago and we're still friends.\n\nI made friends with the whole staff of a ramen shop in my hometown because I'd ask to substitute the broth (easy enough, no allergies, just spicy miso instead of shoyu, everything else the same) and I'd tip very well; at one point they'd call me \"spicy miso\" when they saw me. I never paid for a drink there and the whole crew would come to our house parties. Good folks, I miss them.",

I remember more than a couple times when I was expediting, a server came back and was like \"so and so at table 7 is that person who was super cool about it when they found a produce sticker in their meal\" and I said \"let me send them dessert\" or whatever. Restaurants will remember you for not being a pain in the ass. Also, besides just \"free shit'\" I might tell my line \"this is for a regular who has been awesome to us, let's do it right,\" giving them the VIP treatment. \n\nJust in general, be good to service workers.

But when you're neurodivergent it becomes the most self destructive advice you can follow because the stuff you want is fundamentally different from what others want, and vice versa.\n\nIt's more important to treat others the way *they* want to be treated, the trick is figuring out what that is on an individual basis.",

Hell, I don't know anyone who doesn't want to be treated like that.\n\nI have a sibling who is neurodivergent, and they have had very little problem with this concept.  Just treat people with kindness, compassion and respect, and your more likely to receive the same in return.  There are times where it's not at the forefront of their mind, and they definitely don't live by it, but they understand it, and recognize they're not following it if called out.\n\nI'll acknowledge it's probably harder for neurodivergent people at first, but I don't think it's something they can't understand, especially with time.  Nobody likes being treated like shit, and if you treat people like shit, you'll probably get it back in return.",

She told the Plaid she should go sit down and wait with her family because she had been working hard and walking around all day and must be tired. Jamie reassured her it would be ok and she wouldn't get in trouble, but of course the Plaid refused. She thanked us both for our hard work and told her to just come get her if she changes her mind because she wouldn't mind standing and waiting instead. \n\nShe was so super sweet, I'll never forget it. It was the nicest thing and I was really impressed with her. She's got a lifelong fan!! \ud83d\ude01",
