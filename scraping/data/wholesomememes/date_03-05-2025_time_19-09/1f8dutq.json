Weirdly enough my dad does hug his sons and grandsons and will even feel hurt if you refuse a hug. In some places the macho culture is still strong specially in older generations, so some man have a hard time showing phisical love, specially to other men or boys.",

He said that because my parents were the one to get pregnant, my parents should be the ones taking care of us 24/7. We could never have a sleepover there because he didn't like kids. \n\nSo no, I wouldn't hug my grandfather, even the handshake feels but much tbh. Not all grandparents are all lovey-dovey",
