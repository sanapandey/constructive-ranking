To be completely honest, I've honestly (in a self hating sort of matter) become numb from hearing those kinds of stories because it sounds ever so constant from SO many people. I'm not doubting the severity or impact it has on you, but I'm just telling you it ain't going to help me none. You're probably thinking that my younger self wouldn't end himself because I would be different than I would be from then or that I'd be different than how I'd imagine/thought of myself of being. Yes and no. Yes, I'd surely be different in the most obvious sort of aspects, but the reason he'd be willing to end himself is because of ONE MAJOR CONSTANT. Literally because I'm different, and I *hate* being different. Not the \"different\" as in with natural change, but being different from everyone else. I hated it then and I hate it now; the only difference from now is that I have the knowledge that I really cannot NOT be different, so I have to either learn to live with it, or die, and the second option ain't a real good one. Add to that statement with next to everything from my childhood being flipped on its head, and you get one seriously messed up dude. One of the things that makes me different is involuntary low self esteem. Another is impeccable pattern recognition. Sure, there may be some perks to being different, but it doesn't outweigh the overbearing, persistent, and catastrophic deficits to being different. If, of all things, of being the worst aspect of what I deal with (besides stereotyping) it has to be a general lack of the feeling of accomplishment. I literally do not feel accomplishment in really anything I've done or do, so you saying \"you're breathing, so that's an accomplishment\" ain't going to do me any favors. Also, when I say something is \"useless,\" I do not state it as an opinion or belief. I state it as an absolute fact, so you saying that I'm \"making\" it useless because I'm saying it's useless is a very naive statement. I'm saying it's useless because it actually is useless. Just like any theory, you have to test it, and I did, rigorously, and results came out to: useless. It may work for you and some others, but believing it to be a cure-all is not going to end well. I do have to apologize for all this at the end, because it ain't a train I'm all that good at stopping when the thoughts roll through. I'm brutally honest when it comes to these things. All I really do ask from all this is please don't waste both yours and my time and leave it be.",
