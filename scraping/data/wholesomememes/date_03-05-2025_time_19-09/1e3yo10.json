Its the same scenario for both with their preference. Regardless I think its mostly for small men that it affects quite negatively, and well it affects the majority of men still negatively as the ideal height is often perceived to be around 190cm or 6'2-6'4, with individual variability of course.",

I've gotta believe we'd see some patterns develop across other orientation demographics, but I wonder as well if said patterns would be more sparse/erratic. Either way, it would be really fun and interesting to me to see how this idea of masculinity/femininity is both portrayed and perceived among other sexual orientations.\n\n>I have so many questions\n\nYou and me both; thank you for the talking points, and for giving me new angles to approach thinking about this topic.

Or do they think I\u2019m hot? A big thing I get is \u201creally? You look taller.\u201d From chicks, why? Because they think it\u2019s a compliment. \n\nDoes this mean the 5\u20192 guy stops trying? No. It means don\u2019t be ignorant as to what reality is.",

It's part of the process, and it's not even wrong per se -- sexual attraction is a major aspect of initiating a relationship for most folks. \n\nI think it can depend on how your support is worded. Stuff like the OP comes off as disingenuous because it's basically saying, \"Even though you're constantly rejected specifically because of this one, unchangeable aspect of your physical appearance, be happy with it and accept who you are!\" It's kind of talking past the actual impact of it. \n\nAs the poster who also responded to you said, I think commiseration is probably a better response. \"I know it's hard and it sucks, but don't give up, you have lots of other positive aspects and there are women out there who don't care about height. When you're actively dating, superficial stuff comes first, and people will reject you for unimportant things early on. It's hard, but you'll hopefully find someone you can connect with.\" I dunno, stuff like that. Acknowledging that it's a real road bump that they'll have to deal with, and it's about finding someone for whom that isn't a deal breaker and/or who is more interested in getting to know someone.

Dudes I see all this talk about it online but In reality I can honestly say that I never felt my height was a disadvantage ever with women and I don\u2019t know what all the fuss about it is. Even in street brawls I have personally taken down and seen other dudes take down giants and it\u2019s actually more common than you think.

Tall women can also struggle to find partners who will accept their height. Personally I've been rejected by a lot of men who felt emasculated by my height. The amount of times I've heard something to the effect of \"You're such a great person and attractive but you're just too tall for me\" is up there. Alternatively a fair number of men wanted to treat me like something that needed to be checked off their sexual bucket list. \n\nMy point is anymore I treat my height like a filter, if you think I'm \"too tall\" that's a you problem and thank you for letting me know I shouldn't waste anymore time here. I hope some short kings can look at it the same way.",

This makes a lot of men hate their height, but the problem is a direct result of people being mean about men's height.\n\nOne way good way you can support people is to validate their feelings. Instead of telling them what you think they should do, ie : you should accept yourself, you should xyz....you can say something like: I'm sorry you have to deal with so many people putting you/men down for being short. That sucks. It's rude and it shouldn't be happening.\n\nFor most people, telling them \"just accept yourself\" isn't super helpful. But it is helpful to make someone feel like people get your struggle, that people acknowledge that your problem is a real, valid problem and that they support you",

If I let men\u2019s doubt about my capabilities affect me, I would have to leave my job, but I don\u2019t, I just prove them wrong and make them feel bad in the process. With shortness, I feel like the same approach applies. I think creating space for open communication and reassurance (backed by action) amongst men (and women) makes rejecting poor treatment a lot easier, versus a situation where everyone is indifferent around you and any poor treatment you receive for something unimportant will feel like a 20:1 situation.

It's saying that what I'm feeling (upsetness) about what I'm being told is ok, without overreaching and saying that I have to feel that it's untrue. It'd be great if I felt that way, but unfortunately that only works if it comes from myself. Otherwise it's just another person pushing me to feel a way that I don't already feel. Just because it's in an ostensibly positive direction doesn't mean that I'll be ready to accept it in that moment.\n\n> I think in my mind when I personally reassure people, I\u2019m being dead serious and I make sure my actions match my words and that I create an atmosphere that matches those intentions as well.

That's definitely important for sincerity. But the reason that a complaint about something like height comes up is because of how it affects people's treatment of me in aggregate, not because of someone like you who may genuinely be kind.\n\n> Reassurance is meant to give you confidence in dealing with the actions of others, because there\u2019s too damn many people in the world and you can guarantee there\u2019s always going to be assholes. Does that make sense?\n\nI agree with your goal here (well, mostly - will get to that in a bit), but I don't think reassurance is a one-size-fits-all approach to getting there. The only way that I have been able to build confidence in my life is to actually begin to experience success. Being told that I will have success and that I just need to have faith until I start achieving it just makes me feel like I'm being gaslit every time.\n\nThe other issue is that your premise is good for long-term interactions with people (i.e. cut people out of your life if they're assholes), but not all desired interactions are long-term. Many men who struggle with dating would love to have the option to have one-night stands with hot assholes. So reassurances along the lines of \"your height doesn't matter, and anyone who treats you like it does is an asshole\" doesn't address the oft-unspoken desire to still be attractive to those assholes. And it takes a lot more than a friend's (and certainly an online stranger's) reassurances to stop caring about that.\n\nAdditionally, again in the realm of dating and sex, there's the dichotomy of your view (\"people who treat you worse for being short are assholes\") and the rightly-accepted view of \"people's attraction preferences are valid even when seemingly prejudicial\". You can't say that someone is an asshole for happening to have a preference that is acceptable. But running into enough people with that preference as someone who can't meet it is going to be understandably discouraging nonetheless.\n\nAnd the last bit that comes to mind is that there are some sorts of circumstances in life in which you can't avoid some level of mistreatment. Look at the statistics where taller people have better professional outcomes. You can't just cut that out of your life, especially since that's something that not even ever expressed explicitly. It would be virtually impossible to figure out if your boss holds some (likely subconscious) preference for taller people when it comes to assessing their competence. And that's not even mentioning how much trouble it would be to try to job hop until you somehow found one with a boss that wasn't like that.",

It doesn\u2019t fix that women want men that are taller than them. It doesn\u2019t fix preferences for tall people, but it does provide a certain amount of support, and well-intentioned, backed up support should be valued and accepted. It\u2019s not going to fix the dating world, tbh nothing will, but not giving up if you want to find someone as a short guy is the most important thing to do, and having reassurance (specifically factual reassurance, bordering on advice) can be a life line for people that are struggling with rejection. Again, doesn\u2019t fix anything, but with dating, the key is to not give up, and to put yourself out there (especially in person, meeting women in person in third spaces you both enjoy is probably men\u2019s best bet all around). Reassurance and just general emotional support is totally necessary for guys trying to date, especially for short guys. I get that it can be felt as gaslighting, because short guys still have poor luck so it seems like reassurance is trying to pull wool over your eyes, but almost everyone has seen shorter men with wives and girlfriends. It\u2019s not impossible. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m not trying to say that preferences are bad, I\u2019m saying that people who treat you badly because they prefer someone else are assholes because there\u2019s no need to be rude to people who aren\u2019t your cup of tea. I know there\u2019s a desire to be desirable still, but you gotta maintain some self-worth and not give your body to hot assholes who won\u2019t think twice about you. There are some people you should be happy don\u2019t like you, so don\u2019t let sex be the only validation. Everyone needs to validate themselves to some extent or they\u2019re going to struggle in a lot of ways in life.

Most of the time it\u2019s a \u201cwe just didn\u2019t click\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re not my type\u201d.  I\u2019ve turned down girls purely based off of physical attraction, but I\u2019ve never vocalized that. And I\u2019m sure plenty of girls turn down guys due to height and never vocalize it. No hate from me! I just feel like this is the realest observation I can make.",

Yeah I am sure he would have nothing to say about this.\n\nIt's so interesting how people keep bringing up the same handful of short celebrities who did make it, and who upon closer inspection have some damning things to say about height prejudice, and then just happily ignore that as well as the fact that they are the exceptions that prove the rule, in order to pretend nothing is wrong.\n\nI guess denial is one hell of a drug.",

What am I in denial about?\n\n*\"It\u2019s only as big of a deal as you make it.\"* \n\nTo quote Tyrion: \"Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not.\".\n\nUnfortunately, even if YOU don't make it a big deal, the prejudice against short guys is very real, as even you have already inferred. Juxtaposed to this, your statements come off as dismissive, as if being short is just minor personal challenge that is in your own hands (and head) to overcome and once done so, the world will stop seeing it in its entirety.\n\nBut height prejudice is an insidious form of discrimination that works identical to racism; people form a snap-judgement about you and your height factors heavily into that judgement. When you are a short man, most people instinctively assume you are less capable and unfortunately also less valuable and less desirable and it's up to you to prove them wrong. Of course, trying to do so brands you a \"napoleon\", so you're stuck in a double-bind where you're damned either way.\n\n*\"It\u2019s only as big of a deal as you make it.\"* is an optimistic form of denial I see a lot in short guys. The nice part about it is that you still have the illusion of control and agency. However, height prejudice is not something that can be outworked or outwitted. Yours is a belief that is pushed onto you by the rest of society so they don't have to acknowledge their own bias. \n\nDenying a harsh, unfair reality in favor of a positive illusion that gives you the idea of agency while focusing on what you can control is understandable [and in some cases beneficial. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_illusions)But it ultimately is better if short guys stop trying to appease those who oppress them in order to avoid the dreaded \"incel\" or \"napoleon\" labels and take an active, candid approach in making people see the kind of treatment they receive; even if they get laughed at, branded as weak, or diagnosed with \"little man syndrome\" and/or \"victim complex\" for it.",
