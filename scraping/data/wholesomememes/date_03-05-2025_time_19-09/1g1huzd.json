I didnt believe him even though i could see what he was trying to say. Idk even back then ik my dad was full of pseudo philosophical bs. Anyhow this post made me feel seen and reminded im not the only one w a dad that didnt think the best of me. \n\nTo anyone who reads this, you are original and powerful. just bc someone has already had a similar thought to you, doesnt mean your ideas isnt worth pursuing. Maybe your idea will turn out to work differently and help others in another way, or hell maybe even inspire them to make something new. Go for it and dont let anyone put you down.",

It's a beautiful thing that we share ideas and influence each other, but what's interesting is the infinite amount of ways that the same thing can be expressed and perceived. Only you can express something in your way, and maybe your way will lead to something special.",

                            "body": "AI art is an amalgamation of easily accessibly, but often not public domain, image and /or text sources.\n\nThe issue with AI art now (so far, and possibly forever) is that it doesn't offer a *perspective*.  The great artists who copy or derive inspiration from other works put their own spin on it or at the very least put the copy within another work that highlight a new way of looking at something.  \n\nThe way it is usually put is that great artworks reward you for looking at the piece longer.  While AI art punishes you for doing so.\n\nWhat's more is that this lack of perspective art is being used as \"good enough\" work to push out budding artists from what little paying work there is.  Often because the people paying for such works are simply trying to check a box.\n\nFinally there is the issue with *learning* how to do something new that is often a close companion with simply struggling through a manual part of the process.  Programmers are finding some of this out the hard way right now as they use Copilot or a similar program as a crutch to build out the boring parts of the code.  Then end up having a debugging / component integration nightmare as they run into issues that they are ill-equipped to handle since handed off the basic parts of the design to an AI.\n\nThis is less like using power tools instead of hand tools in woodworking, and more like ordering from Ikea and claiming you \"made\" it.  Sure, you did put it together, but you probably don't understand underlying design decisions and what tradeoffs result from that.\n\nThe pendulum will swing back one day, but IMO we are the poorer for it now.",
