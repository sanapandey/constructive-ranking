And furthermore feelings arent an evidence that you are right on the base of logic - if you feel triggerd because of \"this and that\" it doesnt mean automatically that its legit and valid to be triggerd in the first place. Emotional reactions are irrational and the reason for a specific kind of an emotional reaction lays down in the subjectiv individuality of an \"I-Identity\" correlating with natural animalistic characteristics. \nBut, you shouldnt judge your feelings and give them values; you should reflect the feelings from a rational perspective and become in control of them - in control of yourself at the end. \nAnd of course, emotions will close to always be before cognitions-by-will in the first place, because emotions are even the most latent motivations which lead to thinking about this or that at all. To think at the same time as to feel isnt something the most normal humans will ever achieve and is more like a buddha-thing for many people; its the classicaly \"to be in the Here&Now\" - it needs to be in a state of consistent critical reflection for which you need to sense everything you perceive and it needs deep understanding of the own \"Self\", which not many people are able to do. But you can come close to that state/flow of mind.",
