And the only happy people are the starving artists who are pursuing their passion for jazz trombone no matter what!\u201d\n\nThe truth is that life is much more complicated. And the benefits of financial stability cannot be understated. It\u2019s much easier to pursue your passions when you aren\u2019t worried about paying rent, affording good food, getting proper healthcare, etc. even if you have less time. Because 40 hours per week is a lot. But there is also a shit load of time leftover. Plenty of time to lead a fulfilling life, if you try. It\u2019s hard at first because you don\u2019t have the energy and mental capacity to do everything you want. But it\u2019s like running a marathon. You probably can only run a half mile on your first day and then you will be exhausted. But if you keep trying and keep practicing you will find yourself making progress. It\u2019s the same with doing stuff in your life. The more shit you do, the easier it is to do shit. The more you practice making time for your hobbies and friends and socializing, the easier it will be.\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s true that some people are genuinely way too busy to pursue anything besides survival. But there are a lot of people that are in survival mode but don\u2019t need to be, and they are suffering because of it",

Later in my comments I made a point about finding something you find joy in, and I did not specify any of the conditions that you have attached to it. I also specified twice that I understood that not everyone has the opportunity to choose what they do, and so my qualms were about advising people when they can and are making that choice. It was a mistake to try to have a dialogue with you about the shitty work experience that I began to realize was not universal, as you seem to have taken it as an opportunity to lecture me about how the world works as though you understand the nuances of my experience and position based on a few focused Reddit comments, that you have read in a very uncharitable way.

Then when you start pulling on Social Security that gap is probably closed. Your numbers will be different, of course. Making that 20k from your favorite artistic hobbies is probably very doable, but you are going to be spending a LOT of time on it.\n\nTo make that kind of money from music, for instance, you'll need to bring in $385 a week before taxes, which is teaching 8 half hour music lessons for $25 a week then playing out both Friday and Saturday nights where your cut is around $100 for a 4 hour show. For taxes, make that 10 lessons and $125 a show (an extra $100 a week). That's a ~20 hour work week, not including all the phone time getting shows booked and getting lessons arranged, and it's not accounting for weeks you fail to book, illness, or expenses like studio rent or broken equipment/strings.\n\nIf you want to make that kind of money running Dungeons and Dragons as a DM, you'd need to bring in that same $385. Assuming you charge $10 per person for a 2 hour session, you need about ~40 (technically 38.5) customers and you'd need to run 7 2 hour games - that's a game every single day. Now - you can supplement that by hitting the con circuit (Gencon, DragonCon, Origins... those are the big ones anyways). If you can pull in an extra grand from each con (4 days, 4 games a day, six players, $15 instead of $10) then you get an extra 1100 dollars from the con circuit. You may even be able to get more money if you are willing to charge more. You might get away with running 6 games a week. $10 for an online game is also a bit expensive, so you have to be good and if you can't get that $40 players, then you are sorta screwed. This also doesn't include taxes or buying art assets, books, or VTT accounts.",
