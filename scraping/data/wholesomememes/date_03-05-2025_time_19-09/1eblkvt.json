I was insecure about my abilities and knowledge and went through so much unnecessary stress in my education and subsequent first steps in the job market. Sometimes something happens that puts me back into that headspace and I remember that I've been looking at my 20's through rose-colored glasses and that I actually do have so much going for me in my 30's, regardless of all the flaws.",

Last time I was at the doctor I was told I have the joints of 60 year old man, CTE, improperly healed fractures in my hands, wrists, feet, and spine. When I was fighting and bouncing I didn't have insurance so i was my own doctor. That or I went to a family friend who was a med student turned vet. My best friend is 34 and he went into programming. He lived an active but gentle life. He's not afraid to dig in and work hard don't get me wrong. He has just lived a much easier life. Because of that he can still run, jog, swim, hike, bike, and work hard like he's 18.",

At the time I think I\u2019m doing the right thing. But I\u2019m in such a daze I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m at the stove and not the coffee pot. Or that I\u2019m turning knobs and not pushing buttons. This morning I got in the garden tub to take a shower. Then got angry and confused because there wasn\u2019t a shower head. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but it scares the shit out of me when it does. \n\nOn a side note, how the hell did you carry kegs at 8200ft?!

The funny thing was how he complained about being out of shape, having knee and back pain and no longer having 6 pack. He would look at his older photos from when he was a teen or in his 20s in such envy and sad nostalgia, saying he was attractive back then and now he's no longer because he's \"old\". He would talk about how in shape he was and now no longer like it's impossible to be in shape in your 30s. The funny thing was that he did absolutely everything he could possibly do in his 20s and in the present to feel \"old\". First of all, he worked in very hard physical jobs all his life and refused to ever put any sunscreen on himself because he saw it as a women and gay thing. While his legs were white as snow, his neck hands and face were brown and full of sun damage. I tried and tried but he refused to do anything about it, saying he's manly and that he doesn't care about sun cancer. Obviously he also never washed his face properly, never put on any lotions, moisturizer or soup because I guess for him taking care of yourself is too \"feminine\". And then he would proceed to cry and moan about having wrinkles. Lol. He would cry about his physical state and being in pain and moaning about not having his old teen body anymore while also stimultionasly never working out, not going to the doctors to fix problems he has from injuring himself, allowing himself to be lazy and lay down in bed with his ps and phone all day, refusing to even slightly stretch because it's too \"girly\" and real men only lift (which he didn't for the 2 years of dating him). He would drink beer like crazy and say it's the only thing that helps his mental state (refused to go to a psychologist which he needed very much). He would drink like 20 half litter bottles of beer every single day. He also smoked like a madman and he had a poor diet, barely any vegetables. He literally also never drank water and he didn't brush his teeth at night, only morning. Never cleaned his tongue or something like that. Only when he got a heartattack did he quit cigarettes and alcohol. He was always a skinny guy, but that didn't mean he was healthy.\nSo yeah obviously he felt old in his late 20s and early 30s lol.\nYet he would project those feelings on me, making me feel like it's obvious that with age I won't be as attractive as I'm now.\nMy advice, never date someone with this mentality, they are so bitter. I was trying to be positive, active and healthy and it was very very hard because I kept putting all my energy on trying to lift him up. Because I loved him and wanted to spend time with him I would give up on going to the gym and going for a run because he wanted to just lay in bed for days, so I did it with him.",

What I'm actually upset about is the notion of everyone else thinking of me as old and mocking me for it. In the grand scheme of things I know I'm still relatively young and have plenty of years left but I hate the idea that suddenly people think I shouldn't be able to go do certain things like let my hair down in a bar, play in my band or play video games and stream etc at home because I happen to have lived a little longer than they have.\n\nI guess this is a roundabout way of saying we shouldn't be bothered about how old we are and we should just try to stop caring so much about what others think about it, because we're all heading the same way and I know when the time comes for me to slip off the Earth I don't wanna spend any of those final moments thinking \"I wish I had done what I loved to do instead of what others think I should have done\"",
