When she came to each starfish, she would pick it up, and throw it back into the ocean. People watched her with amusement.      \n\nShe had been doing this for some time when a man approached her and said, \u201cLittle girl, why are you doing this? Look at this beach! You can\u2019t save all these starfish. You can\u2019t begin to make a difference!\u201d.   \n  \nThe girl seemed crushed, suddenly deflated. But after a few moments, she bent down, picked up another starfish, and hurled it as far as she could into the ocean. Then she looked up at the man and replied,\n\u201cWell, I made a difference for that one!\u201d",
