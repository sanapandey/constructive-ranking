She was self-conscious about her appearance so she rarely ever let me take pictures of her.\n\nNow I have maybe 3 pictures of her from the last 15 years and a few dozen of the 10 years before that.  And only one video where you can barely hear her voice in the background.\n\nTake the pictures. Shoot the video. The random dumb downtime moments spent screwing around are the most important.\n\n Trust me.",

I have pictures with friends and family where I'm the only one left alive. Gee, I really wish I had less of those. Such an annoyance to have a visual record of my life. Much better to just keep a vague concept of those times.  \n\nIt's absolute bullshit that you can't enjoy the moment and also take a pic. Also, \"the memories are better\" is another load of bollocks. You don't keep memories, you really don't. You keep a very small number of them. When I find and old family album, or an old memory card with pics, I really don't remember most of it until I see it again. \"Living the moment\" doesn't mean shit 30 years later when you can't remember it. Seeing those pics though, they really do bring back memories. \n\nThere's a reason we have museums and not just empty buildings with \"those items were lived through at the time, no need to keep a record of them for today\". Young people, record the shit out of everything. It gives you an accurate record, and you can even show new friends and family which weren't around at the time.",

If I died, I'd want there to be good pictures of me for people like my parents or siblings to look at. If one or both of my parents or siblings died, I'd want pictures to remember them by.

Kids think that all pictures of them are bad, and they're gonna end up on r/blunderyears or something. Which is possible, admittedly. But the photos you take are for those you love, and who love you.\n\nAs this person said above, take those photos and videos. Cute, funny, serious, \"bad\", whatever.
