He spoke and carried himself like the war movies of the time, had an authoritative voice, a good head on his shoulders and looked out for the neighborhood.  In his mid-70s, he beat the shit out of home intruders that tried to break in our house while we were on vacation.  He was such a neat guy.  When I was 10, he saw me on my way to Taekwondo class and showed me some stuff he learned.\n\nEvery afternoon while we were playing in our backyard, he'd come out, say hi to us, and light up his pipe.  Smelled like gumdrops. \n\nAlso, his last name was Nelson.  Colonel Nelson.  And no, his wife's name wasn't Jeannie.",

Weirdly, it was almost like a recollection of some sort of childhood synesthesia. Made me remember the times when I'd watch my mom play Fatal Frame 1 on the PS2. As she played I'd be able to smell something that wasn't actually there, if that makes sense. And it smelled pretty much EXACTLY like this strain. Sometimes when I play that game I still get that smell, though not like when I was little.\n\nEDIT: And there was no incense burning or anything that could have smelled that way. It literally only happened with Fatal Frame 1. Just FWIW.",
