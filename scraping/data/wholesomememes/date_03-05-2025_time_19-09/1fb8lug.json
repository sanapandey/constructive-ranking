            "body": "There are some beautiful fields of study dedicated to this in case anyone is interested. One of my favorites is Dean Keith Simonton's work on the Origins of Genius, which explores the psychological processes which underpins unique creative genius. Just beautifully insightful work. [https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/148690.Dean\\_Keith\\_Simonton](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/148690.Dean_Keith_Simonton)\n\nAnother social scientist who has expanded our understanding of what constitutes creative contribution to society is Howard Gardner, where he examines the minds of people like Gandhi and illustrates how we can be brilliant in unrecognized ways. [https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=21137&context=fac\\_pubs](https://aquila.usm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=21137&context=fac_pubs)\n\nFor those with a more mystical bent, there are scientists who have dedicated their lives to understand the mystics of our species and how their minds are transformed through contemplative practices, Andrew Newberg. [https://www.newsweek.com/religion-and-brain-152895](https://www.newsweek.com/religion-and-brain-152895)\n\nThese are just a few, but there are so many more who are exploring the heights of the mind versus glorifying the depths to which we can sink.",
