Because it took me a few seconds to figure out the implication of what that would do.

CO poisoning is something we spend a lot of time designing strategies to deal with (since you need a huge amount of air being pumped down to keep things safe and fresh).",

The mind is a problem solver, filled with stuff like calculations and worst case scenarios for when you're thinking.\n\nSome people are thinking about what did happen, some people are thinking about what could happen in the future. And both of them are same scared... The mind is basically repeating it for them because it doesn't want to see them hurt again..\n\nBut it's not a normal human state of being. Both of them are stuck in what we can call the \"problem solver mode\" and that is good to do for maybe 10 minutes..? But if it's constant, you gotta learn to let it go and stop repeating..\n\nWe are supposed to live inside our soul, and not in \"problem solving mode\" (head).\n\nI saw this video of a guy named Aaron Doughty on youtube.. Where he rephrased the quote \"i think therefore i am\" into the phrase \"i think therefore i suffer...\".  \nAnd after hearing this.. i caught myself at times slipping, like really really suffering and then Pop! Reminded myself that.. Oh! I am suffer again because i am sitting here thinking....\n\nOther words for thinking might be ruminating, pondering on/over, contemplating, giving consideration to, dwelling... None of which is really that important to be doing in this moment, especially on problems that hasn't occurred yet or hasn't been for at least a 100 000 years.\n\nMental health.... \"I think therefore i suffer...\".  Your soul is not the brain, start living in your own soul instead and stop trying to \"solve a problem\".\n\nThe head is just for calculating.",
