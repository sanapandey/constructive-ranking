It's not overly complicated but my goodness it is food for your soul. \n\nDo yourself a favour though and make it from fresh ingredients instead of a box kit. Those can be good, I know they're a part of my childhood nostalgia...but the homemade stuff is correct. \n\nI picked a [recipe at random](https://www.recipetineats.com/baked-mac-and-cheese/#wprm-recipe-container-20506) because variations are more about variations in type of cheese and possible add-ins like jalapeno! (Also that site lets you skip the life story and go right to the recipe itself.) I\n\n hope you give it a try and enjoy!",
