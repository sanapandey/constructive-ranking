It would drop to about 133m/s from the normal 343m/s.\n\nIt would also consume more energy to produce the calls, as sulfur hexafluoride is very dense compared to air.\n\nMy guess is that the combination of those factors would lead to the following: the bats would be heavily disoriented and miscalculate distances all the time (since they are used to the normal speed of sound) and would not catch a lot of insects. Pair that with the fact, that the energy expenditure has risen drastically, this could be a very short experiment that won't pass the ethics committee.",
