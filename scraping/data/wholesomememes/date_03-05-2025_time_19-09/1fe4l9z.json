Sometimes you don\u2019t even want to start a conversation and just want to make someone laugh and let them know you are thinking about them. \n\nI\u2019m usually the one to send memes to people, but I have a few good friends who actually share them with me too. Even after years of not talking as life passes by. \n\nAlso, I just saw a hummingbird!",
