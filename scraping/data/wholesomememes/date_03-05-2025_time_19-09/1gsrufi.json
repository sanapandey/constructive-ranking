As a rough volume that gives us of 732,000L of water. \n\nApparently we make 15 to 30 gallons of tears a year. If we take the upper bound as how much we can cry in a year (ignoring if it was possible we cried continuously) then it works out to about 6445 years to cry that river.\n\nCan anyone point out glaring faults in my working?\n\nI will note that apparently there's a river in Finland that's only 3.5m long. For simplicity I'm going to say it's 3.5x3x3m.\n\nThat gives us a smaller aim of 277 years. Get a couple of pals and you could do it in a lifetime!",

The people of the city knew that their lives relied on her sadness, so when they passed by they would spit on her, and call her names, and never show her kindness. \n\nOne day a sweet but naive little girl was celebrating her 7th birthday and skipping her way to the castle to see the king. She had heard that large crowds gathered to see the king, and so she would have all the more people to celebrate her birthday with her. On her way to the castle, the young girl came upon the crying woman and became upset that someone could be so sad on her special day. \u201cExcuse me crying woman, don\u2019t be so sad. It\u2019s my birthday and a beautiful day out!\u201d Hearing these words, spoken so sweetly by the little girl, the crying woman looked up. Through vision blurred by her tears the woman saw the bright blue of the sky with birds soaring high above in the warmth of the sun. She saw thick healthy trees covered in deep green leaves and heavy with ripe fruits. And she saw the river, strong and flowing through the gorgeous valley below. \n\nAs she took in the sight of the gorgeous bountiful land surrounding her, her attention came to the soft caring face of the young child, a face filled with kindness and concern. \u201cI don\u2019t want you crying on my birthday\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want ANYONE crying on my birthday. Today is a day to be happy!\u201d The woman cracked a subtle smile, and a few more tears fell from her eyes. Not tears of sadness, but tears of appreciation, for she had forgotten what it felt like to be seen and to be cared for. The little girl spoke again \u201cIf you\u2019d like, you can come to celebrate my birthday with the crowds of people gathered to see king Trump.\u201d The woman\u2019s face fell. \u201cWait, Donald Trump is our king? You have to be fucking kidding me!\u201d Then she begin to sob, and sob, and sob, forevermore.",
