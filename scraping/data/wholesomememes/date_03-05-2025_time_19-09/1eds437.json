And their answer is always \"never!\" \n\nAnd then I respond, \"Sure, makes total sense. But when would you forgive a man for hitting on you, even though your not interested? If you were at a gay bar for someone's birthday,  for example,  I'm sure you'd expect that you might get hit on and so in that circumstance it would be OK. But then how would you want the person hitting on you to react? I'm guessing you'd like to politely decline and then have them leave you completely alone for the rest of your life. You wouldn't want them trying to grind on you if you hit the dance floor and you wouldn't want them coming back later to hit on you again when you're more drunk... It's the same with everyone. The only acceptable places to hit on strangers are maybe in nightclubs and bars. And even then, no means no and you need to fucking respect that.\"\n\nAnd the penny usually drops for them.\n\nLike you've said, no gyms, no supermarkets, not at work, nowhere else! Keep it in nightclubs and bars, and leave it alone if the answer is no.\n\nFirst time I ever used that explanation was when I was at a weekend market waiting for friends to arrive and two guys were hitting on me. So I moved to wait elsewhere.  And when my friends arrived, i explained why I'd moved and one of my male friends said to me, \"Wow you really can't hit on anyone anymore...\" And it made me feel like I was overreacting or being too sensitive. Until I thought,  would he have been overreacting or too sensitive if (as a straight man) he'd turned down their advances? No!\n\nAnyway, he agreed with me in the end.",

I mean, you are in public, you are working with people all day and I guarantee there will be guests you desperately hope would hit on you or who you'd love to chat up more. I think the guests know that too. Plus, there is nothing immoral in a little bit of flirting or expressing interest as long as (as you say) you keep within the proper boundaries and accept a no although a lot of people can't do that. Funnily enough, because it is not an unexpected and unwanted interaction with the guests it's actually much easier to gauge whether they'd be open to talking or flirting. The issue comes from the fact that for the one behind the counter it's their workplace.\n\nThey are, in a way, an extension of the place and represent the company and their colleagues as well. If they hit on you, the guest, and it is unwelcome their action is a detriment to the reputation of the workplace as well, not just them. \n\nThe same is true in reverse. If you hit on someone behind the counter you have no way of knowing if it's welcome or not but because they are at their place of work they don't have the option of leaving the situation or responding properly because whatever they respond with reflects on the company.\n\nAnd you really have no way of knowing because I had colleagues who liked it and flirted back with guests but I also had colleagues who felt unsafe because of it or others who had murder in their eyes after the guest left but all of them had to put up a friendly face.",

But to have a stranger approach me in my everyday life, and then having to deal with that unexpectedly and politely,  it's just unpleasant.\n\nEven on planes, where I may have chatted to someone for hours.

Next time he comes in, I don't assume his order, \"What can I get started for you?\" He orders a venti iced americano with 5 honey and continued to do this every day the rest of the time I worked there, and I never dared to let him know that I knew he was going to order that. \n\nIt was so weird, I still remember it to this day.",
