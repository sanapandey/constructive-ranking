And like most grandmas say, stand up straight and look at people when they talk to you.\n\n  \nEdit: To be clear.  If you are a teenager just get any suit.  Nothing will fit right for more than 2 weeks at that point in life. Just show up dressed properly for the occasion and wearing deodorant and you will exceed expectations.
