I haven\u2019t included tangentially related films like minority report that might be worth watching, since I wanted to keep the list on topic. One thing I\u2019ve seen about the cyberpunk genre is it follows cops/special agents etc a ton even if it would be really cool to see different perspectives instead. Its called cyberpunk after all. In no particular order...\n\n\n\nLive Action:\n\nBlade Runner + 2049 (the first film is a bit slow, but it really kickstarted the genre. I have no idea which cut is the best but probably avoid the original theatrical cut. The sequel 2049 isn\u2019t as important of a film, but I liked it more),\n\nAltered Carbon (first season only, seriously don't watch the second one, highest drop in quality ive ever seen. Even for netflix it was shocking),\n\nDredd (not the Stallone one, absolutely great action),\n\nRobocop (not the remake, great satire while being a really good action movie, also watch starship troopers by the same director if general sci fi is something you want)\n\n\n\nAnimation:\n\nGhost In The Shell (\u201895, 2, The tv show standalone complex is not quite on the same level, but its still quite good, I honestly can\u2019t remember anything about arise, so it must have been mediocre. There was also a newer netflix show and it was total crap)\n\nMar Express (I was absolutely blown away by this one, my second favourite next to ghost in the shell),\n\nCyberpunk edge runners (really fun show, great story and characters)\n\nAkira (I liked the beginning more before it got too crazy, but a ton of people love this one, so I\u2019m including it)\n\nPsycho-Pass (cool concept, ok execution, bad second season just watch the first if you are interested)",
