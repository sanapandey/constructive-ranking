I've got four daughters, they have their entire lives to be fed lies by marketing, politicians, etc.  I'd rather keep them from having to deal with a foundation of lies at home as well, at any age.  I think one of the most powerful things you can experience in life is a good friend who says I know you and your flaws, you are a piece of crap, and I love you, and I'm not going anywhere.",
