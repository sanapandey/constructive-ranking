I dont think it will ever be a constant state because we're humans and life is a roller coaster. But it will get easier and easier to believe it. Length of the journey depends on the person.\n\nI know it's not really great news. Maybe because I'm also on the journey, and it is tumultuous. I just hope one day there will be more sun than there is rain. It wasnt for nothing so far though. I'm glad I came so far, even though I still have a lot left. Good luck my friend.",
