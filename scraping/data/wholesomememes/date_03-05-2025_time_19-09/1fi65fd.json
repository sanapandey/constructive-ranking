The very old ones were from locals and they seemed far more legit, from fishermen and stuff who seemed to have negative feelings about their sighting. Then there was some amount of overlap with local sightings and \"Nessie hunters,\" until eventually in the sixties all local reports stopped and there were only Nessie hunters. \n\nSadly I lost the site at some point and have never been able to relocate it.",
