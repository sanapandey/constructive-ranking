He was a street dog and he got a fright and jumped into my sisters car on her way to my house, so she dropped him off by me. He is a mutt with some staffy in him and has a scar on his back from being stabbed. He is the merriest most loving boy to people but is very apprehensive about meeting new dogs. His favourite thing is to cuddle and get kisses, on command he holds his snoot out for soft kissies. He is my no homo homie I kiss every day",
