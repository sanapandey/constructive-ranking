When I was young, I didn't even think about the disability; I was fine. Now, it's a daily fight. I don't know why, but the isolation has amplified my insecurity and OCD. I fear people's judgment. I accept my disability and am working on becoming more comfortable and confident in my body. I've realized that I\u2019ll never be this young again. I need to face my fears. When I'm on my deathbed, I don\u2019t want to have any regrets. I\u2019m on a quest to realize my full potential. I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but becoming a little better every day\u2014waking up early, meditating, working, and ticking off to-dos\u2014feels great. I\u2019m becoming obsessed with discipline and confronting my fears. Writing my thoughts in my diary helps me understand myself a little better. To understand yourself, improve a little every day, and become the best version of yourself\u2014this, I believe, is the meaning of life.\n\nLET\u2019S GO AND ACHIEVE GREATNESS.",
