For the first couple years you make stuff, it\u2019s just not that good. It\u2019s trying to be good, it has potential, but it\u2019s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn\u2019t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. It\u2019s gonna take awhile. It\u2019s normal to take awhile. You\u2019ve just gotta fight your way through.\u201d\n\u2015 Ira Glass",

The notion that everything can be art, and therefore subjective is one of the damning problems if the pursuit is mastery.\n\nYou can look at any work of art and come to a reasonable conclusion. You cannot, or should not, do that with mathematics for instance. Because of that, artists assume they should know things that took masters **decades** to learn.\n\nIn mathematics you can easily acknowledge you don't know. That makes it emotionally and rationally relateable. In art you're left feeling incompetent, talentless, etcetera because you assume you understand. That type of ignorance is especially problematic.\n\nThe arts suffer from poor access to a good education due to its perception that it is not a hard field to succeed in.",
