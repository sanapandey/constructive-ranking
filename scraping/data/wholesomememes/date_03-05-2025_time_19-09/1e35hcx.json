They were potty trained and I could keep them out of their cage when I was gone. They were extremely intelligent. \n\nI would continuously keep rats if it weren't for their short life cycle. It just breaks my heart. Plus now I have cats and I don't think that would mix lol",

I've been keeping rats most of my life now, but I did take a 2-year hiatus between my current pair and their predecessors. Partially due to covid hitting weeks after losing my last boy and not knowing how the virus affected rats for a while. But eventually I just couldn't keep away. I knew I had to get some new bundles of fluff when I started having recurring dreams of finding abandoned baby rats and bringing them home to hand-raise.\n\nThe cat-rat situation is definitely tricky. I have two cats, and thankfully they're just politely curious about the rats. But I definitely do not let them near each other when the rats are outside the cage without *very close* supervision.",
