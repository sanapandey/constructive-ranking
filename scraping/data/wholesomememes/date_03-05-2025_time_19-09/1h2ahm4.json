And my manager comes over and starts giving me attitude, telling me to pay attention. The kid's mom, who was standing right there, overhears and starts speaking Spanish with my manager. I couldn't understand a word they were saying, except for maybe one or two words. After the mom left with her kid, my manager walked away and looking all grumpy. So I call over this associate who witnessed it and who speaks Spanish, I ask her what the heck they were talking about. Turns out, the mom was asking my manager if she had kids, and my manager said no, and the lady told her it's such a treat to have someone distract her rowdy 7-year-old and that I'm great at my job and that my manager shouldn't be rude to me. \n\nI love seeing managers with a stick up their backside get put in their place.",
