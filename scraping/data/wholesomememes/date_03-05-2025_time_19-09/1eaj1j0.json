I'll never forget the time I lived in Spain, and taught these little Spanish kiddos about the president pardoning a turkey for Thanksgiving. I told them 'the president saves one special turkey from being turned into food!\" Well, one kid was totally confused, and asked how we basically make more turkeys every year if only one is saved. lol! Young ones think about things in ways that just don't cross our minds anymore as adults. I'd be happy to secretly be a dinosaur. Much better than just being depressed.",
