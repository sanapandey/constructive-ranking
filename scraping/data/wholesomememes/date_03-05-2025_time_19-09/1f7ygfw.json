            "body": "Hey there friends! It\u2019s only been a few days since we started cracking down on the spam bots and excessive reposts that have been plaguing r/WholesomeMemes - and now there is nothing left!\n\nSurely some enterprising content creators would see this vacuum as an opportunity to showcase their creativity, make people laugh, and been seen by *checks notes* 17 million people.\n\nBefore last week, I woke up each morning with disdain in my eyes seeing low quality reposts from spam accounts on the front page of Reddit. Honestly, most of the popular subreddits are cooked. It seems we might not be able to put the egg back in the chicken here. \n\nWhen I saw r/WholesomeMemes was open to help and new ideas, I pounced on the opportunity to help meowderate. We did the right thing, but now there are no posts coming through that are not spam. If you aren\u2019t a spam bot and submitted an OC wholesome meme but it didn\u2019t get approved, please send us a modmail. \n\nI am working with the other mods to come up with guides and contests to encourage people to post (hopefully in the next week or so), but until then we need your help! \n\nHere are some easy and basic tools to help you make memes:\n\nhttps://imgflip.com\n\nhttps://www.mematic.com\n\nHeck, as long as it is original content you can even hand draw it as long as it is wholesome (not just cute) and a meme.\n\nFeedback is GREATLY APPRECIATED!\n\nEdit: Please note that we may take up to 24 hours to approve your meme. We are humans with lives and stuff.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you everyone who made memes! Please no more \u201cMods vs The Bots\u201d memes or other meta Reddit content. They will be removed moving forward.",

Bots are better now than they ever were and they use generative networks to compose very convincing texts. And they will get much more intelligent in the coming years, to the point when talking to a bot will be more interesting than talking to the actual human.\n\nHere's the example of what AI can do right now, it took 5 seconds:\n\n**GENERATED POST AND COMMENTS**\n\n**Which space exploration mission are you most excited about?**\n\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of human exploration, I'm curious to hear which upcoming space missions have captured your imagination. Whether it's returning to the Moon, setting foot on Mars, or venturing further into the outer solar system, what do you think will be the next big leap for mankind?\n\n---\n\n**[deleted]** \u2022 2.1k points \u2022 6 hours ago\n\nThe Artemis program to return to the Moon. It's about time we went back, and this time to stay!\n\n> **space_enthusiast42** \u2022 872 points \u2022 5 hours ago\n> \n> Agreed! I'm especially excited about the potential for a permanent lunar base. Imagine the scientific discoveries we could make with a constant human presence on the Moon.\n\n**red_planet_lover** \u2022 1.5k points \u2022 5 hours ago\n\nMars, hands down. SpaceX's Starship development has me hopeful we'll see boots on the red planet within the next decade or two.\n\n> **sciencematters** \u2022 623 points \u2022 4 hours ago\n> \n> While I'm excited about Mars too, I think we're underestimating the challenges. Radiation exposure, psychological effects of isolation, and the physical toll of reduced gravity are all major hurdles we need to overcome.\n> \n> > **optimist_prime** \u2022 310 points \u2022 3 hours ago\n> > \n> > Valid concerns, but I believe in human ingenuity. We've overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges before. Mars is the next logical step for our species.\n\n**deep_space_dreamer** \u2022 986 points \u2022 4 hours ago\n\nHonestly, I'm most hyped about the missions to the outer solar system. The potential for life on Europa or Enceladus is mind-blowing. Dragonfly's mission to Titan is going to be incredible!\n\n> **reality_check_101** \u2022 452 points \u2022 3 hours ago\n> \n> Those are exciting, but let's not forget about the James Webb Space Telescope. The images and data it's sending back are revolutionizing our understanding of the early universe.\n\n**budget_watchdog** \u2022 -78 points \u2022 2 hours ago\n\nWhy are we wasting money on space when we have so many problems here on Earth? Fix poverty and climate change first!\n\n> **forward_thinker** \u2022 205 points \u2022 1 hour ago\n> \n> Space exploration drives technological innovation that often has applications here on Earth. Plus, studying other planets helps us better understand our own. It's not an either/or situation.",

There's a reason places like /r/AITAH or /r/relationships are known as creative writing subs.  They may have one real person post per day but it'll get buried under the hundreds of \"my aunt shit in my coffee and I freaked out, AITAH?\" nonsense.\n\nThat being said, the smaller communities are usually pretty okay.

I dream of a Reddit where every post, every image, every story is fresh, bursting with the creativity of minds unshackled by the chains of repetition.\n\nI have a dream today!\n\nI have a dream that one day, in the endless expanse of this platform, there will be a beacon, a function\u2014a function that will guide us through the flood of new content. It will shine brightly, showing us the best and brightest of what Reddit has to offer, while gently reminding us of the gems of the past, not as a burden of repetition, but as a respectful nod to the brilliance that has come before.\n\nI have a dream today!\n\nI have a dream that one day, every repost, every regurgitation of what has been, will be gently but firmly turned away at the gates. No longer will the past haunt the present, for the future demands space to breathe, to grow, to flourish in ways unimagined by those who came before.\n\nThis is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to Reddit.\n\nWith this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discord of stale content into a beautiful symphony of new and diverse voices.\n\nWith this faith, we will be able to work together, to browse together, to laugh together, to uplift this platform together, knowing that every time we refresh that feed, we are met not with the ghosts of old posts, but with the spark of something new, something inspiring, something worth our time.\n\nThis will be the day when all Redditors, old and new, will be able to rejoice and say, \u201cFree at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free from reposts at last!\u201d\n\nAnd if Reddit is to be a great platform, this must become true.\n\nSo let the fresh content ring from the mighty mountains of r/funny.\n\nLet the fresh content ring from the heightened peaks of r/AskReddit.\n\nLet the fresh content ring from the diverse lands of r/pics and r/gifs.\n\nLet the fresh content ring from every hill and molehill of Reddit\u2019s sprawling communities.\n\nFrom every subreddit, let fresh content ring.\n\nAnd when this happens, when we allow fresh content to ring, when we let it ring from every community and every thread, we will be able to speed up that day when all Redditors, young and old, casual and devoted, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old internet hymn:\n\n\u201cFree at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free from reposts at last!\u201d",
