            "body": "I disagree. Forgiveness is where you are either able to understand why someone performed an action and no longer hold it against them, or you see that they have sufficiently made up for their past mistakes and you see they have grown as a person and no longer are the same person.\n\nYou can move on from someone's actions without forgiving them. One of my best friends cheated on his girlfriend, another very good friend of mine. For a long time I was angry at my friend, because first of all cheating is terrible, and I see as a moral failing, and secondly he caused an entire split in our friend group. However after some time I was able to move on and meet up with him again, however I didn't forgive him. It wasn't until way later that I saw that he grew as a person when I forgave him.",

When you forgive, you are able to let go of that rage. It's a simultaneous action. \n\nI'd rather disagree on the stance that forgiveness is \"the only way\" to peace. Yeah, rage can be pretty detrimental. Entire Count of Monte Christo is about that. But enforcing forgiveness is equal shit. Sometimes, it can be very understandable why someone could never forgive someone. F.ex. I have an abusive mother, who basically wrecked my entire life with her instability. Even though I understand why, and even see how much of the stuff she technically isn't mentally liable for...I can't forgive her. I'll never forgive her.\n\nThe rage is not as strong anymore - but it still fuels me. Mainly in the sense of not wanting to become anyone like her. Forgiveness would feel like an insult to myself",

However, I see that inner peace as something on its own. I call it moving on; it is when you let go, you realize that what happened happened, and there is nothing you can change about it. However, this does not mean I have to forgive the person who caused it.\n\nI do agree that one does not need to forgive for peace to happen. This is what I see as not forgiving but accepting and moving on.",

Forgiveness is not merely accepting what happened or ceasing to be angry. Rather, it involves a voluntary transformation of your feelings, attitudes, and behavior, so that you are no longer dominated by resentment and can express compassion, generosity, or the like toward the person who wronged you.\n\n[Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/forgive) has a couple different definitions. None of which really agree with you. \n\nHere's an excerpt: \"excuse, condone, pardon, forgive mean to exact neither punishment nor redress\"\n\nGemini *Summary*: Forgiveness is the act of letting go of resentment and other painful feelings towards someone who has wronged you. It can also involve accepting the flaws of others and giving them a second chance.\n\nEdit: I realized I forgot to link the APA. Also thanks for the award!! \ud83d\ude0a",

I am saying that forgiveness isn't just something you do to yourself, it isn't just letting go of your anger and resentment. It is when you come to a point where a transgressor has made up for or has justification for their actions. I can let something go without forgiving someone; I will give myself that peace of mind: it happened, and I can't do anything about it now, The best I can do now is move on; that is not forgiving; that is moving on. Forgiving is when I see that someone has made up for their mistake or has justification, then I forgive them, I absolve them of their guilt.\n\nWhat the person before is saying is that this is resentment... But forgiveness is the opposite thing, in my mind. Resentment is when one doesn't forgive; a person has not made up for their past transgression, and therefore, resentment still lingers connected to that person. This will turn into an obsession if one doesn't move on. I resent my father. I have not forgiven him, yet I have moved on. I can be in the same space and be civil; what happened happened, and nothing is going to change that. I don't have to forgive him. I am at peace.",

But we would make ourselves hypocrites if we acknowledge our own sins and expect God to forgive us while we are not willing to forgive others. In this case, we are not willing to extend the same grace we received.\n\nThe call to be willing to forgive is repeatedly stated in the Bible. Already in Our Father: \u201eAnd forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u201c Or Colossians 3,13: \u201eBear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.\u201c Or Luke 6,37: \u201eDo not judge and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.\u201c\n\nThis is all based on the Christian (biblical) appeal to love: to love God, to love ourselves, and to love our neighbours (Mark 12, 30-31). Colossians 3, 14: \u201eAnd above all these, put on love which binds everything together in perfect harmony.\u201c Love is the most important tenet according to the Bible. To love God, others, and yourselves. And loving others includes the willingness to forgive them.\n\nIt\u2019s indeed often pretty hard to forgive or love others. In theory, it\u2019s always easier than in practice, and with some cases moreso than others. But, one, you don\u2019t have to do it on your own. God can give you the strength to do so.\n\nAnd, two, our decision to let go and forgive already contributes to a better world, to a healthier world, and to a healthier mindset. Not constantly harboring (consciously or subconsciously) a grudge is healthy for yourself, too.\n\nThose tenets sound strict and hard to achieve - but they are meant to help you and to help make the world a better place. And it also doesn\u2019t mean that your pain is invisible to God or that God approves of the wrong that has been done to you. But, like He is willing to forgive us even after we hurt Him and His other children, He wants us to forgive us others, too.  But, again, we\u2019re not necessarily expected to do it out of our own strength",

The bully apologizes and the kid learns the bully was acting out from a violent, poor background. The Kid himself had some unstable parents, and understands: Despite having made horrid experiences, he can now see it as \"we were just lost kids\" and forgive his ex-bully on it.\n\nThat said...this doesn't mean he \"corrected a wrong\". It's still a wrong. If it got corrected, it'd be a right. It also puts the pressure on the kid: That it's HIS responsiblity as well, to correct the situation. Except it's not. The wrong can only be salvaged by those who caused it. Mainly the bully, and the shitty system that failed them both. \n\nYour entire stance is a bit too \"bystander effect\". Like. No offense, but the line reminds me of something my teachers would have said. No talk of what happened, just \"zero tolerance\" and \" we all have to solve it together\". And then forcing me to forgive the guy that just rammed my entire head into the ground, simply cause I \"made him angry\". It's this wishy-washy stance",

An expectancy of one to find healing within themselves from a \"terrible background,\" you're better off believing that Santa Clause is real. Bullies will stay bullies unless you ask them why. It's not no Disney movie like Zootopia where the bully says that they were raised badly. That NEVER happens, and if it does, buy a lottery ticket. What I said already defeats your argument, because you misinterpreted what the statement is supposed to be about. True forgiveness is an *active* action where it's not just saying \"I forgive you.\" It's fully willing to be there and aid from the things they're hurt from, either through chatting or offering assistance. I learned that the hard way when I learned that my bully committed suicide a couple years after I forgave him. Forgiveness is not a \"one and done\" deal, it's a painful journey, but worth it.

As cliche as it sounds, I realized that it was eating me up. I had to try to forgive for my own sake, so one day, while alone,  I said, out loud, \"Dad, I forgive you\". I didn't tell him, just said it between me and God. Everyday for a year, I had to say it. Little by little I came to realize Dad was broken too, and hurt me (and others) because he was damaged as well. I'm still No Contact with him; forgiveness does not equal letting him back into my life to cause chaos and stress, but I've (mostly) let go of my hatred.
