I was in a vacation just having fun with my boyfriend and this amazing lady just stopped me, asked me how long we are staying here, and we talked with her a bit. At the end she just told me how pretty my smile his and how it lights me up, she told me to never stop smiling and she wished me the best in life. Whoever she was I love her, i think about that often, she was a beautiful women with a pure soul and I just wish i could tell her how many times I think about this simple interaction. Now I try to do the same with other people.",

So I pull over, and ask if he needs a ride somewhere. Unfortunately where he needed to go was about an hour away, and I had work in about that amount of time, unfortunately. So I drove him as far out as the daycare, took off my shoes and gave them to him and I gave him my unopened bottle of water. I figured I couldn't take him all the way to where he needed to go, but at the very least I could make the trip more comfortable.\n\nIn hindsight, I kind of wished I'd said \"Fuck it.\" and took him, considering that job was seriously fucking me over, but hindsight is 20/20. I think about that guy every now and then, he was obviously going through some shit, and was having a rough go of it. I hope he's doing well.",
