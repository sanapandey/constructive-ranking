Several animals can be accused to have some form of civilization already, depending on how broad your definition is.\n\nI wonder how much crows would need to evolve to create advanced technology. I doubt a corvid would have the physical strength to act as a blacksmith without significant adaptation. Their manual dexterity is pretty impressive, but I don't think they could tie a knot. Making fire requires some brute strength or complex tools. A crow might be able to cheat by grabbing a burning twig from a natural fire and kindling it elsewhere. Mining can also require some serious muscle, though there are some surface sources. \n\nI suppose corvids could get a jumpstart by using processed materials from human artifacts. Granted, this presupposes a cataclysm that wipes out humanity while leaving corvids in a good situation. \n\nEvolving the muscles and dexterity for metalworking, or even precise stone and woodworking, might require the loss of flight. This is far from unprecedented, but it normally happens when there aren't any significant predators and an open niche, which simultaneously lowers the need for high intelligence. It's all possible, but it's a weird path. They would also need the endurance for advanced toolmaking.\n\nI wonder what traits are required to create advanced technology and civilization. Intelligence and cooperation are obvious, but you need to be able to gather and wirk certain resources to unlock certain technology. Maybe there are some alternative paths to creating spacecraft that don't involve hitting hot metal with a large hammer at some point, but it seems tricky. \n\nYou also need to have the right mindset to invent certain things. Perhaps persistence hunting gives humans an advantage here. We evolved to focus on a singular goal for days, investing significant energy on a hypothetical prize that we can't even perceive directly. A lot of new inventions are pieces of crap in the prototype stage and require intense development to be practical.",

The third book mostly deals with a lost human colony and the *incronguities* going on there but the corvids from Rook are a fairly important plot point.\n\nThe planet Rook was still early in terraforming when the doom came and the terraformers stranded there were desperately trying to create a biosphere that might persist. Most of it failed but the main win out if it was a strange evolution of more intelligent corvidae who ended up with some severe neurodivergences. Some of them gained incredible memory and others gained a lot of inquisitiveness and logical deductive skills. Doomed on their own, in pairs this formed a sort of savant which was able to survive. The corvids eventually managed to eke out a civilisation on Rook, though it's a bit unclear if they're actually sapient or just very very very good black boxes. \n\nI suppose you technically don't need to read the first two books though they do help provide the context of where the Octopi, Portiids, Humans (with a capital H) and the Interlocutor all come from and what their deal is.",

After that I let him roam freely into the wild. \nSomeday around a year later. I heard some strange sounds from outside the windows and one was sitting there with some Food. (I believe it was some small insect?) \n\nEver since then I get \"Presents\" on my opened windows. Dead Insects, nuts, twigs all kinds of stuff. \n\nBlue is now trying to feed me I guess!^^ \n\nEurasian Jays are part of the Corvid Family and are also VERY smart. They even communicate with other members of the Corvid Family, sometimes bond with humans and even try to talk to them :)",

A row of crows formed behind him, and a bunch of fat greedy gulls behind the crows. I thought uh-oh this little starling doesn't stand a chance of grabbing a chip with this lot!\n\nAnyway, a bit of chip was thrown down, Mr Starling grabbed it and flew off, one of the crows flew off behind it. I thought it was going to steal the food, but it didn't, and a minute or two later the pair came back. This repeated over and over and eventually it clicked. \n\nThe crows were protecting the starling from the gulls. The bodyguard accompanied it to where I presume its nest was, the back row forwards remained to hold back the gulls.\n\nSuch smart and truly compassionate creatures.",

I noticed a limp and decided I'd call the vet in the morning. When my mom woke up I explained the situation to her, she said we should wait and see if it gets better first, but I know my cat, he wasn't acting like he usually is, so I took an appointment anyway and asked my brother to pitch in for the vet and took him there myself. \nTurns out he got bitten by another cat and the wound was already infected.\n\nI'm never listening to my mom on how to take care of my cat. And she always wonders why he likes me better than her.",

These bones are surrounded by the nerves and blood vessels that support the beak\u2019s functionality and growth. Protecting these layers is the outer lightweight layer of keratin called the rhamphotheca.  Like our fingernails, this layer is always growing and being replaced.  \nDepending on where the fracture occurs, the rhamphotheca can grow back enough to abolish the injury.  Unfortunately though, there\u2019s not much room to work with before you hit bone, and the bone cannot be regrown.  In these cases the rhampotheca may heal over the exposed bone, but it may not grow back to full size since the template for its shape (the bone) has been stunted.  Even if it does grow back, it may not do so correctly, leading to twisty shapes.\"",

The two birds were a couple with the one without a broken beak (Mabel) protecting the one with a broken beak (George), but the genders are the other way around, they only ever had two kids (one of which made it to adulthood), and the reason for his beak breaking was never known.\n\n[This post](https://urbannature.blog/2016/01/03/georges-tough-year/) explains is about how they were first seen Summer 2015, had their chick that didn't make it before George's beak was broken, and the beak breakage occurred shortly after the chick died. With how the update to the post the photos were taken from says that George died summer 2016, his beak was only broken for half a year before his death",

Maybe I didn't word it nicely, but I was trying to ask which parts you didn't know (or believe) and what you would actually accept. Because I don't think I've seen anyone be presented with the studies and actually accept them. It's deny, dodge, change subject, run away, etc. Anything to not have to accept it.",
