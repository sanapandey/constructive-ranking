Not even saying this for humor purposes, they will RIOT over a banana with a narwhal on it. \n\nWhen they do this, it is almost impossible to get them to listen to you and it is a huge inconvenience. \n\nA lot of this artwork may also be problematic for other students. 6-year-olds get scared over stupid things. If they see what they deem scary painted onto a banana, they will tell their parents and their parents will bitch at the teacher because their child couldn't sleep the night after. Yes. They will do that. \n\nI see a lot of people calling the teacher a \u201cbitch\u201d, \u201ctoo strict\u201d etc. But she is probably outnumbered with 10+ kids in her class going crazy over a banana and is already stressed out as is because teachers are worked to the bone and get paid \ud83d\udca9. \n\nLike I said, it may look like she is a bitch but she isn\u2019t and I don\u2019t expect many people who don\u2019t work in a childcare environment to understand. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f",

So is the solution here to only hand out bread and water to every child at meal time so no one feels left out with no other meal options allowed?\n\nHow about focusing your energy on the other 20 children in class who's parents think of you as daycare but with a lesson plan, they need more of your energy than the kid who's parents are loving too much apparently.\n\nThis teacher isn't a \"bitch\" or \"too strict\" they are just being lazy and not wanting to deal with the children who got excited over a colorful bannana of all things... she's probably dissapointed that she can't give the kids a benadryl with their chocolate milk in the morning so that the afternoon nap is easier too.",
