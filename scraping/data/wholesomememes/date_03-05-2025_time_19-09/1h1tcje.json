Compare your present self to your yesterday self  \n\\- Learn from them, their techniques and strats can be used as a study guide  \n\\- Seek advice from your coach or your teammate  \n\\- And most importantly: stay determined. Level up in sport takes time and effort, also consistency too. Don\u2019t let temporary setbacks discourage you\n\nYou got this! I believe you can improve",
