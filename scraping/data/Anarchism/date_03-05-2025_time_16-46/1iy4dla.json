Was it Emma Goldman who said that \"So many young men ready to die for the revolution, but so few ready to mop floors for it\"? \n\nI cannot see what he changed by his suicide. What did it do? I mean except leaving a lot of grieving family and friends. Why didn't he choose to actually DO something instead of just committing suicide dramatically?  \nIs it a US thing that I don't get or...? \n\nCurrently the Kurdistan defense forces are looking for people with military backgrounds, or medical, or mechanical/electrician skills to help defend against imperialist fascists. Its dangerous, and it actually helps people. AND you don't have to die a 25 year old boy with your whole life ahead of you. \n\nNow I get it, some of you might get angry at me - but seriously - call this a social media self-immolation or something, but if it stops some kid killing themselves for nothing at all, feels worth while to write.\n\nJust think it through, and don't. Actually try to change the world for the better instead of just slipping out of the gene pool.",

Ofc it would basically mean that all other work, all other protests, all attempts to sway the Biden administration from without and within was easily replaced by a 25 year old committing suicide. I mean years of grass roots work, years of thankless boring bullshit to force the hand of the US in to looking at the genocide in Gaza for what it is was meaningless.\n\nCall me cynical I guess, but I'd rather have a 25 year old kid fighting for the rights of all, than a corpse with a dramatic backstory.   \nAnd while yes, the way our storytelling works, the way Hollywood tells us the fight against cruelty should be - the lone hero doing a grand act of sacrifice or punching Dr Evil in the face to vanquish his entire machinations - is designed for acts like what this young man did, it does nothing except create pretty little statues of socially acceptable heroes to fawn over.",
