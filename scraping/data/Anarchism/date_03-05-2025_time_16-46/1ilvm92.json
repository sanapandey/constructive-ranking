The existential threat of death supercedes all.\n\nThat allows for the mind to accept the consolidation of power that is used by the oppressive forces to dominate the environment.\n\nPositive disintegration follows the motivation of action down to the psyche to determine where it's coming from.  If it is malicious in origin it should be uprooted.\n\nWhite supremacy coalesced from the horribly war-torn landscape of Europe.  We started exporting people all over the world after hundreds of years of warfare on the continent.  \n\nThey felt entitled to the peace they felt they earned from slaughtering their kinfolk en masse.  When they went out to export their hate and violence, they realized that most of the world wasn't as good as hate and violence as they were.\n\nNow the offspring of that exportation of hate and violence has colonized a large part of the world.",
