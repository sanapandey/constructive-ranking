    "selftext": "Being in this intersection is fuckin lonely, parts of the exmuslim community is quite islamophobic for highly understandable reasons, many of us including me are actively avoiding being persecuted, 29/1/2025 just a week ago a prominent exmuslim Salwan Momika is assassinated, he is known for quran burning and that does not change anything to relieve exmuslims of their concern of the very safety of their life. On youtube, all rhetoric by both sides appeal to statist arguments and there is basically no one on either side seeking peace except for apostate aladdin, chillest exmuslim i know. As an anarchist, i also feel abandoned seeing barely any talk of anarchist against religious persecution, let alone persecution of exmuslims by Islam. This is an area i really wanna organise around, but I am just a closeted exmuslim with no ally, still living under my muslim parents, surrounded by muslims with hierarchical mindset. What can I do? Talking about anarchism with my friends is the best i could do and i am not even doing that yet out of fear for being considered mislead.",

First,\u00a0the Workers' Solidarity Federation in Pakistan, iirc one of their members got arrested for allegedly breaking some religious law? idk the details\n\n\nSecondly the Federation of Anarchism Era, iirc based out of Iran. They wrote a really good explanation of the anarchist opposition to religion, as an institution. Here's one of their more recent articles: https://asranarshism.com/1403/11/15/freedom-speech-english/",

            "body": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm an agnostic on default settings (cis-male, hetero). I\u00a0*want*\u00a0to believe, and my wife wants it for me, but I find it difficult when my Ummah (community) embodies exactly what I reject: classism, tribalism, fascism, plutocracy, etc. Islam itself rejects these things. The Islamic consensus has already agreed on \"non-degradation\" when referring to God's creation, citing medical research. The latest medical studies also support this statement.\n\nBut now, conservatives are clinging to the \"immutability of divine creation\" in opposition to transition, particularly gender transition. This isn't a reconciliatory or satisfactory outcome. And this is where I think I might have an approach.\n\nI'm tattooed, and I personally don't see anything inherently wrong with it. If I remember correctly, two of the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence didn't just\u00a0*not*\u00a0consider tattoos as \"haram\" (forbidden), but even recognized them as \"halal\" (permissible) because they can benefit mental health.\n\nI'm not a wellversed Muslim, but I believe this approach is viable and appropriate,\u00a0*but*\u00a0it needs to go through the process of Islamic dialogue. And I'm offering myself as an advocate. Islam is great because it stands up for the little groups. Islam is now at its greatest crossroads. Will it succumb to the temptation of fascism (tribalism)? Most of the Muslims I know are proletarians. And we shouldn't underestimate the modern progressive movement coming out of Asia.\n\nI'm trying to force an Islamic respectful dialogue and trying to force them to acknowledge the progressiveness of Islam. It's not the book that needs to change, it's the old bearded men who read it that need to change. Funny, wasn't there a \"catchy\" term for examining one's own prejudices?\n\nStay brave. As an ally, I'm not particularly easy to spot, which is why I'm looking for an identity-defining sign. Something like \"Nomad.\" The nomadic lifestyle in the Maghreb has a lot in common with anarchy, except it's theistic. Sounds totally cringe, I know.\n\nWe need this alliance because this issue is dragging many conservative Muslims, who simply want to be humble, into the whirlpool of fascism.",
