Anarchism in Asia is generally not talked about enough in most anarchist circles, which is a shame.\n\nAs for the Manchurian anarchists, I've heard that the free territory they established actually managed to last a couple of years. I wonder if there are any accounts made by people who lived in it, just to know how it was organised.",

Since we were occupied in 1910-1945 by Japan, their primary focus was anti-imperialism. Their unique mixture of anarcho-communism, left-wing nationalism, and traditional Korean thoughts (Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, etc.) has been an instrumental manual on \"How to implement anarchism in anti-colonialist struggle\".",
