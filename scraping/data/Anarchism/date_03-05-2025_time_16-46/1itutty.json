    "selftext": "The media often paints anarchism as chaos, violent protests, destruction, and a lack of structure. They say it\u2019s an ideology of disorder, embraced by the uneducated and reckless. But is that really what anarchism stands for?\n\nFigures like Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, and Mikhail Bakunin argued that anarchism is about cooperation, mutual aid, and the rejection of oppression in all forms. Instead of rulers and enforcers, anarchism envisions a society built on voluntary association and shared responsibility.\n\nSo why is anarchism always framed as a threat rather than a solution? Is it because true freedom and self-governance challenge the very foundations of power? Or is there something about anarchism itself that makes it easy to distort and dismiss?",

It's a game of propaganda that has been going on for longer than any person has been alive. After the Nazi party fell, the U.S. needed a new \"enemy\" to fight against in foreign affairs, a \"reason\" to invade foreign lands in favor of their own capitalist motives. So the U.S. turned on the communists, that primarily won WWII, because they weren't capitalists. They used this opposition to capitalism as an excuse to meddle in foreign affairs and send either the CIA, or the actual military, to secure U.S. interests around the world. It's one of the biggest propaganda theaters(psy-ops) in modern history, the myth that communism, or any groups not capitalist, are inherently \"evil\".",

To oppose illegitimate hierarchies looks to them like opposing nature, therefore violent. Some people cannot imagine order outside of rigid hierarchy, they interpret this unknown as chaos.\n\nSome people conceptualize all human relations through the lens of coercion. (For example a recent ex of a friend framed their mutual aid network as \"I don't know what kind of leverage so-and-so has over you\"). I think people have been groomed to accept coercion from the state (and capital) as orderly and acceptable. If someone cannot understand organizing on the interpersonal level without coercion, they may see anarchic types of organizing as somehow infringing upon the state monopoly-on-force, and therefore violent.\n\nChristianity, as popularly practiced, is often big on obey this and submit to that. Anarchism feels spiritually offensive to even a lot of secular people raised under Christian-influenced norms.\n\nFear of Mob Rule runs deep through the history of Liberalism as applied by elites who shaped governments.\n\nTriangulation of political ideologies to paint neoliberalism as the Goldilocks zone. Planned economies are too authoritarian. Decentralization requires too much fragmented decision-making. The pyramid of meritocracy? Just right.\n\nAgents of manufactured consent tend to portray all resistance to establishment violence as inherently illegitimate.\n\nAt risk of getting too Freudian: a lot of people just *feel* a need for a Big Daddy (sometimes Mommy) in a Big Chair giving orders and reassurance from on high. On an emotional level, they see anarchism simply as something that threatens the structure on which they depend on for a feeling of psychological security.\n\nPoor humanities education combined with low quality social relationships can stunt the ability to understand some seemingly basic concepts surrounding interpersonal organizing.\n\nSome people fundamentally do not believe in human liberty and voluntary association. They just, don't believe in it. And everything that comes after that is just backwards justification.",

I am writing this from a north American perspective. I dropped out, i completed part of grade 10. I never got to see the curriculum for my own eyes beyond that. However i think the curriculum is mainly to blame. From what I've heard, (please feel free to tell me what you learned about anarchism in history class), it seems the curriculum has provided students with the most extreme cases of anarchism. By this, they tell mainly the stories of the insurrectionists. \n\nOf course violence has existed in anarchism. But violence has existed in every political/religious movement. Even broad groups that have toted themselves on being pacifists have had violent sub groups. Take Christianity for an example. Its safe to say not all Christians are violent. Some are just normal people that walk over to their toaster every morning, and head off to work, living the most simple lives like everyone else. But there are also Christian extremists who have committed heinous acts of violence in the name of Christianity. The problem isn't any particular group, the problem is that, violence has been a go to answer for a long time. We have relied on violence being a solution to problems that either do or don't exist. By we i mean all of humanity. At some point we push the envelope of morality.\n\nI think the education system doesnt have a pluralistic system of political education. I believe all tolerant political movements should have a fair shot in terms of how they are portrayed. By that, i mean intolerant political movements such as fascism have no place in any society to be viewed as legitimate. Outside of that i think we need more pluralistic attitudes. \n\nInstead of being bias towards classical liberalism and conservatism, i think we should take an approach in which we try to convince learners of every single political movements validity (minus nazism and hateful obviously toxic ones). Make solid objective persuasive detailed arguments for every movements validity, as to give it all a fair shot. And let people decide from there what they want to accept. \n\nHow it is now, it seems maybe its lopsided. And from that, we have the societal collective false understanding that \"anarchy is just chaos\". \n\nI might be wrong about lots of this, its just my own thoughts.

It's not the case that anarchy developed as a concept in the 19th century and thereafter gained the meaning of \"chaos\" by those who opposed it. Rather, the first anarchists took the existing word and developed a new meaning out of it. So even without the perceptions of anarchism as an ideology, you have to contextualize that you are talking about something different. There are other factors of course, such as the first red scare; even if anarchism didn't have a name problem, the development of socialism proves that it would still have an image problem. But the etymological association with chaos and violence makes it very easy to highlight certain incidents",

The common interpretation of the word recognises its true and etymological meaning; but it is a derivative of that meaning due to the prejudiced view that government was a necessary organ of social life, and that consequently a society without government would be at the mercy of disorder, and fluctuate between the unbridled arrogance of some, and the blind vengeance of others.",

There were many well-known 'anarchists' such as Ravachol and Emile Henry, who were seen (somewhat correctly imo) as deranged psychopaths willing to kill indiscriminately.\n\nPropaganda of the deed started well enough with admirable efforts like the Benevento uprising, but at the end of 19th century individuals who often only had tenuous links to the larger anarchist movement were commiting violence for violences sake and calling it propaganda of the deed in an effort to rationalise it.  \n\nUnfortunately, this period of anarchist history was when the movement was the most publicised in the mainstream press and had the greatest impact on the public imagination, at least in Anglophone countries, and the image of the crazed bomb thrower has been difficult to shake in the 130 years since.",

The government is afraid of losing their control over the people and the freedoms that they've restricted from having, which makes big money and big satisfaction for the greedy politicians. this isn't always the case or what some people believe, but this is just my personal take on it and why I've become an anarchist.  \nanarchy isn't some \"ideology of disorder\" it's an ideology based off of seeing through the lies of the government and what they really intend.
