But the sustained and targeted ones like BDS or the DEI related ones have seem to actually made dents or outright caused change. They just take a while.",

It's partially to help the population of the resistance see each other, but mostly to remind Target, WalMart, Amazon, and the rest of the big-money tech-bros that _they_ need _us_ **FAR** more than we need them.",

We've been propagandized for literal decades and are so hungry for excess crap in this country it's revolting. It is *so much easier* to get the public to sign on to a one day blackout to begin with than a multi day blackout let alone a weeklong blackout. Our society is a very screwed up society that thrives on people buying excessive amounts of garbage day in and day out so starting small for many of these people is helpful. I apologize if I sound preachy or anything. I agree with your sentiments regarding the more the sustained boycotts being what brings about more change, I am just adding my thoughts and hopes for them just being a starting point for many additional Americans as well.",

And never forget that withholding your labor is more powerful than withholding your purchasing power. Your spending money is, after all, only a fraction of the value of your labor.",

Otherwise it's just an easy day at work with no customers, followed by an influx of customers either before or after the \"strike\" day.\n\nNow combine boycott AND strikes on a sustained effort? Now we're talking.\n\nCoffee shops are abundant. We could completely dismantle Starbucks within a week and send a massive message to the corporate world. If we did it, new coffee shops popping up and existing ones together would fill the coffee void and take in the displaced employees.\n\nThey may be the easiest, lowest hanging target to take down given their competition is everywhere and easy to do at home.",
