    "selftext": "I just wanted to let y'all know I was just in a store and heard a heartwarming thing. My partner did not have enough EBT for snacks so I covered the cost and mentioned inflation and people getting their EBT messed with lately. He isn't but it's not like there hasn't been a stream of reports coming from a bunch of states. I mentioned how most people I know seem to feel this way. I said the march thing from a few days ago had good stuff happening there. She was interested haha\n\nI saw the beginning of this a long time ago but I still love to see it and I love that even more people are gearing up to show up for one another. Even despite their draining fucking DG schedule. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f",
