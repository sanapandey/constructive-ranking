Some of it is outdated, declassified and old, or otherwise not fully relevant. Much of it is still definitely useful though.\n\n[https://mega.nz/folder/YOwgzAyL#MawIOFe95YEiKJCVgSU6Jw](https://mega.nz/folder/YOwgzAyL#MawIOFe95YEiKJCVgSU6Jw)\n\nAgain, if anyone can suggest a better place to host this stuff I'm all ears.",
