Basically these Incel fucks have watched every SCI-fi that depicted a corporatist dystopian hellscape and they thought: \u201chow can we replicate this?\u201d\n\nI just watched Alien Romulus. At the beginning of the movie the main character has her indentured servitude hours doubled from 12k to 24k, due to \u201clabor shortage\u201d and she\u2019s unable to leave her planet because of it. All I could think was \u201cI bet Elmo fucking loves this plot line.\u201d",
