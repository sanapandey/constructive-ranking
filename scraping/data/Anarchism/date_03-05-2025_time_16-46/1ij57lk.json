The point of anarchism is that opposition to hierarchy benefits *everybody*. What is there to hide? The more extreme anarchist positions like anti-statism or insurrectionism aren't a core part of the philosophy, they aren't what bind us as a community.\n\nHasan is a charlatan. He's disingenuous. He doesn't foster lively discourse. He carefully manicures his platform so that he gets to share his thoughts unchallenged. And even when he has a good point, he packages it in lowest-common denominator superficiality based on making essentialist claims about different political identities(e.g. conservatives are all like X, leftists are like Y), imbued with a superiority complex that betrays his own authoritarian tendencies\u2014the total effect being that his viewers are trained into an 'us versus them' mentality that positions them above everybody else because they have the \"right\" positions. People give him the benefit of the doubt because those political positions are underrepresented, but what good are they when the terms in which they are discussed lack any kind of critical individual reflective thought or a genuine consideration of healthy human relations.

Social justice strives for the liberation of colonized, poor, and queer identities. Conservative ideology aims to subjugate these people to benefit colonizers, aristocrats, and patriarchs. The morality of this scenario depends entirely on one's position within it, and I am making the case that reductionism limits the discussion in ways that hides these complex dynamics and therefore informed praxis. In my opinion, Hasan pushes this kind of thinking because of a paternalistic mistrust in people's capacity for reflection and an intrinsically driven desire to secure a moral high ground from which to argue from authority.\n\nSpeaking of which, if 'us vs them' is the model we are operating on, then authoritarian leftists like Hasan fall in the \"them\" camp. According to history, these groups support \"big tent\" alliances with anarchists and socialists so long as they have no centralized power themselves. But given the opportunity, they will meet any criticism or disagreement from other groups, ally or not, with violent political repression. Conservatives commit genocide today, while authoritarian leftists are projected to commit genocide in the future.",

It\u2019s important to recognise the current battle, and I think this idea that Hasan is going to suddenly blindsight everyone and become a future genocidal dictator is incredibly disconnected from reality.",

The former two need to be stopped at all costs, by any means necessary, and if we're talking about just those two, I agree with you that they are the threat we should all be focused on right now (I also think Hasan is too soft to do genocide himself, he would more likely just peddle the propaganda and benefit from its violence).\n\nAs for the \"everyday supporters\", I think this is too heterogenous a group to make any kind of blanket statement about. There are some in this category who are dangerous actors who we need to combat, and others who might not be as threatening but could never be trusted to help, regardless. However, there are still others who are amenable to changing their stance and becoming true comrades, but even more importantly, because this would be the vast majority, there are people who we will never agree with but will cooperate to a degree that is acceptable for all parties. In both these latter two cases, they are allies in revolutionary struggle.\n\nWhich I hope makes more clear why I'm so critical of Hasan. He positions himself as a leader of rhetoric and ideas for revolutionary struggle while maintaining an *expressly* partisan approach, perfectly content to label anybody he disagrees with as someone not to be trifled with, or perhaps to be manipulated (though that unwittingly extends to his supporters as well). I find that unserious at best, dangerous at worst. If we were to organize for a general strike with the attitude Hasan has, it would be rendered ineffective from purity testing, bullying, and coercion. I'm interested in more genuine attempts to weave a network of solidarity and cooperation.",

Mainly I don't like him because I've seen way too many clips of him apologizing for China and Russia, showing explicit or implied praise for authoritarian figures like Lenin or Tito, objectifying women, and admitting to just saying whatever is politically expedient without a regard for the truth, which are all things I don't agree with. I also dislike him as a political content creator since he is unwilling to accept criticism or engage with ideas he doesn't agree with. I would overlook all this for pragmatic reasons, but I haven't seen enough evidence that he can mobilize that support base to do anything useful, so I  have no reason not to continue dismissing him. And I would just straight up ignore him, if I didn't think that he was cultivating attitudes in his audience that are damaging to organizing.",

He's disingenuous. He doesn't foster lively discourse. He carefully manicures his platform so that he gets to share his thoughts unchallenged.

When the right rolls out their talking heads and pundits to get their messaging across they aren't making distinctions about which denomination of facsism they are or picking them up on nuance.

It eschews complexity for simple imagery, and therefore renders people feeble in their capacity to adapt to the changing political landscape, or at least starves them of opportunities to grow. Opportunities involving the hard work of developing the mind, body, and soul through collective action and individual reflection. Propaganda is a tool of the oppressors, and to wield it is to take on the identity of the oppressors, and so in spite of its apparent short-term gains it is utterly self-defeating in the long run as it cultivates the language and habits of mind of one who dehumanizes and exploits people for self-serving ends.\n\nI don't want comrades that blindly follow popular leaders.

The appeal to community organising is one that resonates with people generally. Tankies have a significant leg up in some cases that they can point to places like China and sorta graft themsleves onto China's weird state capitalism which appeals to people who want more governance to assure them of structure and regulation. My understanding of MLs is that their support of Russia specifically stems from their authoritarian strongman belief of Russia's dominance over the region, I don't think MLs are happy that post-soviet Russia is economically inclined the way it is and likewise their support of places like Cuba and Venezuela comes from a reductionist view of resistance against US influences, sanctions and coup attempt, which is an legitimate concern but they sort of have this sphere of acceptable positions and tactics and I can see why you might think I'm trying to emulate the MLs brand of silence in the face of legitimate criticism.\n\n So to that I end I apologise for not making myself more clear, it is absolutely fine to hate, criticise and disavow Hasan if that's how you feel and the wider Anarchist movement won't be rendered more or less viable for not having him. \n\nHowever in my opinion it is not that essential to worry about Hasan's messaging because he does have an attentive and wide audience who are getting a crash course in socialsim and politics. I think having a left wing voice on a mass media platform is important and good. It's preferable to leaving the streamer ecosphere to only reactionary podcasters and influencers who would otherwise totally dominate streaming.",

I'm not saying you can't have individual thoughts and feelings about figures, but you have to voluntarily set aside differences to be a part of any group.  We are already a deeply isolated and fractured society.  People feel alone, there is no social cohesion let alone something more politically useful.  The oligarchy wants us divided and ineffective, and we're there.  If we are to establish a coalition we must temporarily put our collective needs for security, both economic and practical, at the forefront of our efforts.  Individual identity and perfectionist ideals must come later or we will be crushed by authoritarianism before we ever have a chance.  They will not care about our autonomy, that is fucking assured.  We must combat them with volunteerism.",

Super off putting to me. I opened a random other video and saw the same format where he just reads questions from a predetermined list whenever his guest paused, without listening or acknowledging what the guest said. As someone else pointed out, it was only two videos, but it was still enough for me to not click a third.\n\nRegarding the profit motivation comment, that was based on how he\u2019s gone about some of his merch stuff, it just seems like disingenuous posturing without follow through. I don\u2019t hate him, I\u2019m sure there are situations where he takes things more seriously, but he\u2019s just come across to me as a douche in every context I\u2019ve ever seen him, so that was my answer to op\u2019s question",

Supporting russia or china or really any other capitalist state, is like investing your support in asian supremacy to curtail white supremacy, or investing yourself in a different feudal lord simply because they dont own as much as the current feudal lord, even if the alternative is being worse per capita with the power they have. Build and support actually positive alrernatives to the system itself, rather than being against one particularly large instance of it not out of principle but other factors. If you believe Russia is less harmful per capita with the power the russian state has, EVEN with how insanely bad the united states already is, you need to wake up, and stop calling yourself a leftist or socialist until you have done more research. It's not about western hegemony, it's about state and capitalist hegemony, and if you don't understand that, you cannot be a serious socialist or leftist while these are the dominant, core right wing systems on the entire planet to address.\n\nI dont watch hasan but I've heard enough from him to see him repeatedly die on hills supporting chinese and russian imperialism, in ways that absolutely cannot be justified by claiming nuance.",

I really don\u2019t envy him. He gets constant shit from every side because he\u2019s outspoken and stands by his core beliefs. He takes a lot of public flak, and is in genuine danger of getting hurt by a rabid stalker or a swatting. \n\nNot to mention the danger to people like his friends and family, who don\u2019t necessarily have his level of OPSEC. If I had to choose between his job, and the kind of low-profile mutual aid I currently do, I would stick with my current stuff 100%. I suppose getting bucketloads of money would help with the stress though.\n\nI definitely disagree with him on a lot of things, but I have to acknowledge that he has in a roughly decade done more to spread leftist ideas in the public eye than most of us will do in our lifetimes. For all his faults, Hasan is the kind of ally we need, and he seems happy to play the role.\n\nI think it\u2019s about time we start seeing more left-wing unity anyways, given that fascists are getting cozier and more organised.",

It would be nice if we all just worked together and let everybody live their life how they want as long as they don't harm somebody. I love the idea of unions, and people from the ground up being able to group up and stand against oppression and for a greater good. But despite all that, we don't live in an ideal world with unlimited resources and people are not naturally egalitarian. They can be, but don't have to. It's not black and white. So because of all that, I consider myself a socdem in practice. And you can call me traitor or whatever, I don't care. It is the closes thing to what I believe that actually works. For some reason, many people call me a dirty capitalist when I say I am socdem, which I don't really understand because I am not. I definitely don't have that much of a hate for it as many other anarchists, but that's because I mostly blame the people who mis-use it for exploitation than the ideology itself. I think we should be more hateful towards fascism, Marxism-Leninism, monarchism and those kinds of authoritarian bullshit.\n\nAnd another thing I don't understand is, why are many people in the anarchists movements so hateful. You are sort of an example for that. You immediately start attacking me and claiming I am disrespecting people that came before me because I have an \"anarcho-syndicalist\" tag? And that's all just because you don't agree on something I said. I would have understood if you were replying to a fascist, because those fucks don't deserve people being nice to them, but it bothers me why are so many leftists, specially groups that should generally respect each other, so hateful towards each other. And don't get me wrong, I think left unity is a pretty idea, but again, does not work. I would say that most of the time in history the left tried to unite, it ended up with anarchist movements being pushed to the side and eventually just being misused by the Marxist-Leninists. Or another example is how anarchist movements were treated in countries of eastern bloc. But just because leftist unity doesn't work, it doesn't mean we shouldn't be nice to each other. To a degree ofc, I won't be nice to a Stalinist.\n\nI just to live my life in peace and be happy. And I think everybody should do that.",

The left is indeed an umbrella term, but the umbrella for anti domination, anti authoritarian, pro mutualism, and pro equality. The right is pro domination, authoritarian, anti equality, and parasitic. I can go into how the entire history if the usage of these terms even from the inception backs up this usage and how material reality backs up this being the fundamental political divide if you would like. The cold war was the primary reason for many political terms having their meanings be poisoned by propaganda illegitimately. \n\nThis would place tankies generally on the centre to right wing, as the systems they consistently support tend to be statist, capitalist, and often even particularly authoritarian anti socialist states that even resort to genocide and slavery. What people identify is secondary to what political outcomes they actually support in the real world. If hitler believed he was following the vision of socialism and karl marx and was open about that and really believed it, but then did nothing differently, he would be equally fascist and right wing and it would cancel out that rhetoric. The same applies to these vanguardists, or \"tankies\" as people say online. Look at what they actually support. The core of vanguardism is appearing as a leftist and taking advantage of grassroots leftist movements by coopting them and justifying their dictatorial power by claiming to represent the people and socialism to feign legitimacy. While they crush worker power and gun down striking workers and suppress any actual socialist projects they touch. Every fucking time. Tankies are not leftists, and they are not socialists.",

I based this notion not just the discourse but my own observations of authoritarianism in leftist groups, not just tankies, but in Marxists and communists generally. Socialists along the lines of Rosa Luxemburg (i.e. Marxists who rebelled against vanguardism) are the only *explicitly* non-authoritarian strains of leftist thought I can think of. Also just to clarify, I'm using a loose definition of authoritarianism here to mean a willingness to concentrate and wield power in small groups of political leaders without any skepticism or opposition towards the hierarchies it creates.",

I'll go into wht the left and right actually mean somewhat briefly, and if you'd like I can show you a video that goes further in depth on the history of the terms and why their meaning has been poisoned particularly during and after the cold war.\n\nThe inception of the terms left and right wing originate in I believe 1789, during the french revolution in which people in parliament organized themselves along these lines. The literal right wing of the parliament included those who wanted to preserve or strengthen the monarchic system in place, and the left wing included those that wanted to diminish or abolish it. There was also further distinction between those who located on the far right wing or far left wing, which appropriately indicated their extreme support for monarchy and maintaining and bolstering of present hierarchies, and the far left being those that wanted to go further than abolishing monarchy, and wanted even more egalitarian relations than others in the left wing. Here you find the fundamental political divide in all of politics in general, physically manifest in this room, which created a useful and intuitive analogical term for describing many other political landscapes and how they related with each other, which was used for hundreds of years afterwards to consistently mean this same thing with little deviance other than fleshing it out. \n\nThen, you have a particularly unique circumstance with the cold war. Here, you had political groups and individuals who identified explicitly with the left and terms explicitly associated with it, while in reality, consistently supporting and building right wing systems; being hierarchical, dominance based systems. These people and movements ended up winning, and successfully coopting the perception of being left wing and redirecting it towards a right wing opportunistic power consolidation justified through the (manipulative) rhetoric of Vanguardism, Leninism, and various state capitalist entities riding the percieved moral value of leftist movements to the top of the hierarchy, without systemically dismantling them. The cold war happens, and now the two largest propaganda outlets in human history actually *agree* on a particular thing; being to call the USSR socialist, but for different reasons. The United states and the western countries found it useful to do so, so they could point to the USSR in how authorotarian and undemocratic they were, and point to them as socialism in order to discredit it. The USSR and other similar entities had an interest in calling themselves socialist in order to feign legitimacy of their anti-socialist authoritarian systems using the percieved moral value of socialism, as a positive thing. What happened with ML countries was not a genuine evolutionary splinter from traditional socialism, it was an opportunistic, cynical attempt to gain hierarchical power by veiling themselves as socialist. They actively\u2013 the moment they took power\u2013 violently suppressed worker and general self management wherever possible, as it directly contradicted their goals and the power dynamic they were trying to maintain over them. The USSR was a right wing, anti-socialist, state capitalist dictatorship. This isn't even as crazy of a thing to say if you look at the history and at other socialist and leftist intellectuals at the time. Even Rosa Luxembourg, an ally to Lenin, regarded lenin's vanguardism as a right wing version of communism because of it's nature. \n\nThis left right spectrum, even diregarding it's history, is still also a materially useful and real thing to point out as well. Fundamentally, all political divides intersect along the core division of class conflict, and branch off from that centre point as well. If we didnt have the left/right spectrum already there, we would need to create a term to describe this real and important systemic phenomenon in how power functions and organizes. I hope this helps, some people like to watchor listen to a video on this subject as well if you'd like that, I know some which flesh out a lot of the history and counter arguments more than I do here.",

I don't think the far-left movement has ever been weaker in the West than now, we are a fragmented minority in comparison to the liberals out there and the far-right. A lot of people here see him as a force of good because he's at least one far-left streamer in a lake of shit. The fascist cyberwarfare is winning and we have to get our heads out of our asses.",

Arguably, if the US were to follow the reform or revolution tradition, both the European \"social partnership\" reformism and the Soviet-style revolutionary approach would signal a shift towards some kind of socialism, and both would have an equally valid (or equally invalid) claim to the \"socialist\" label.",

His heart's in the right place and I appreciate him for that. I agree with him in that having a \"Joe Rogan of the left\" isn't going to help face the sheer force of the fascist wave in the US right now, but I think guys like Hasan are still pretty necessary in deradicalising young men and boys/pushing them left instead of down the alt-right pipeline.\n\nEdit: typo",

I'm saying that a lot of Hasan's appeal has to do with his political messaging (in addition to news and entertainment). He's been a political streamer on Twitch from the start and his socialist messaging is a part of what his fans buy so he's incentivized to continue monetizing that political messaging (whether he wants to monetize it is up for debate). Is it necessarily bad? No, but it creates a dynamic that fans should be aware of.",
