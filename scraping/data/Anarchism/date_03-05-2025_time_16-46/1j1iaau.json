    "selftext": "When I search this subreddit, a lot of answers are to use credit unions. When I try and research more about credit unions, the very few that exist in my state seem to be focussed around real estate or investing. I live in Western Australia, I'm on centrelink payments, and I have less than 200 AUD in savings (emergency fund), so it's not like I'm earning a lot having this kept in a savings account. I need my bank account to receive payments, but should I just take all of my money out as cash whenever I get paid and use it this way? I feel uneasy having all my money in a bank when I'm this financially insecure.",

So if the bank goes bust, the government provides you your money. The money is much safer in the bank than in cash, where it can be lost, stolen, destroyed by fire, etc.\n\nPeople here understandably dislike and distrust the global banking system. It still operates reliably for the majority of people the majority of the time, and any circumstances where it ceased to do so would almost certainly render cash money equally valueless.",

Also, I'm the most familiar with American history in this regard, so I'm going to discuss that, but Australia does insure bank deposits for specific approved banking institutions.\n\nOk, so, in order to set up the how and why of insuring bank deposits, it's first important to understand how a bank functions. Banks take deposits, but much like everything else in capitalism, if they are a private institution, they must make a profit. What this means for a bank specifically is that the deposited money is not sitting there in a vault at all times. In fact, banks historically have had some percentage of deposited money they were required to keep on hand in order to meet the demands of withdrawals, etc., although currently in the U.S., as of 2020, they now have no minimum percentage that they need to keep in reserve.\n\nSo what are they doing with that money? They are taking it and investing it or loaning it. They make money either by giving loans to people/businesses, for houses, investments, etc. and receiving more money in the form of interest. They also take that money and invest it in various things like stocks, bonds, real estate. The specifics of what they are allowed to invest in vary country by country, and in different historical periods, but they are generally loaning the deposits out and also investing it in something that *should* hopefully grow in value.\n\nOk, so now that their general business model is set up, I can bring it back to the historical precedent for insuring deposits. I'm most familiar with why the FDIC was set up in the U.S., so I'll be using that, but I'm fairly certain (don't quote me on this) that a lot of countries also set up this type of program in the wake of the depression.\n\nSo, what ended up happening in the U.S. during The Great Depression is what are called bank runs. Basically, in order for a capitalist economy to function properly, businesses *in general*, meaning across the whole economy/GDP must continue to grow and increase in monetary value. Well, that is simply mathematically impossible to happen forever, and sometimes you have large dips in the economy. When this happens, the banks, who have been investing in assets they were expecting to appreciate, and loaning out money to people who they expected to keep being able to pay, might suddenly find that the total value of their assets is less than the total of the money that has been deposited. This is understandably pretty scary, but is *actually not impossible to recover from*. If everyone remains calm and doesn't pull all of the money they deposited out of the bank, then the bank should be able to recover on a long enough timeframe and bring the total value of their assets back up above the amount of money that has been deposited.\n\nThat leads me to explaining a bank run. This is what happens when everyone doesn't remain calm. Ok so, for a good amount of banks in this situation back then, it *was* possible, likely even, to recover from this situation. But it's simply impossible that *every* bank would recover, and most people don't want to chance that their money simply evaporates. So, everyone went out to their bank to try and withdraw every single cent they had deposited in hopes that the bank still had enough money in order to pay them so that they weren't left holding the empty bag, so to speak. So, once enough people have pulled their money out and emptied the reserve, the bank must start selling assets. Once those are emptied out, all the bank is left with is debt and they fold. If this happens across an entire economy, the recession/depression deepens dramatically, because banks are *required* under our current system in order to keep up that eternal growth. They loan the money out to businesses in order to expand. If there's no money to go around, everyone is dead in the water and monetary exchange absolutely freezes, more layoffs happen. Basically, a death spiral.\n\nThen, in order to combat this, the FDIC was eventually introduced in the United States. I'm sure it worked this way for many nations, too. What the FDIC does is insure deposits up to some specific dollar amount. For simplifying, for the average bank user, they've got one account. That one account is insured up to 250,000 dollars. You can have more accounts and be insured for more, that's not the absolute limit per person, but it works well enough here. Anyways, this strongly discourages bank runs. Now, most people don't have to worry about their bank folding. Worst that happens is now you have to go and ask the government to give you the amount of money you deposited and you move on with your life. And if enough banks fold at the same time that even the FDIC can't insure everyone, well, then we're all good and truly fucked and I don't think you have to worry about your money being gone anyways, because it's essentially valueless in this apocalyptic scenario.\n\nSorry that's so long, banks are convoluted.",

Many don't have balance minimums, so you could just have an account that's basically empty that you can get paid in, and then keep your 200 in cash. I believe there are online credit unions as well. But either way, putting your money in a bank doesn't lock it up and prevent you from using it unless it's a savings account. Just open a checking account and get a debit card to use your money with. Typically better than cash because you can't lose it. Also it's not like you'd be making any interest off 200 bucks in a savings account anyways. \n\nHonestly dig around the personalfinance sub to find some good online banks. They will be more helpful than here, and if you're in an unstable position you need to prioritize your own security over the morality of which bank to use.",

If it is somehow taken from you by the bank, you can at least call someone and hopefully come to some resolution, maybe it was an error or something, I don't know, depends on the scenario.\n\nAnd if there is going to be a depression and your bank fails? Then the Australian government has a system for insuring deposits, so you should be able to get your money back as long as that bank met the requirements to be insured by Australia. I know they have this system, it just didn't seem worth it to see if they are insured because I highly, highly doubt that is some super small bank that doesn't fall under this system.\n\nAnd the absolute worst scenario of all, enough banks fail that even the government of Australia doesn't have enough money to insure your deposits?
