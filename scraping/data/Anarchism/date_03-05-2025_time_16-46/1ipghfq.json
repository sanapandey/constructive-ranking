I'm white, for reference.\n\nI saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTlglMBmT-0) the other day and it makes a good point about how Black people have done such a disproportionate amount of the work of resistance in the US, and other races including white people tend to swoop in and take credit and derail their movements, and don't reciprocate when they need something (like reparations). It kind of makes me worried that we've burned our bridges and we're just not up to the task of working-class solidarity - and we're basically fucked if that's the case.\n\nWhat can we do about this? What do you do to keep it from happening in your own groups?\n\n*(Edit: To be clear these questions are specifically to other white people)*\n\nThanks for any answers you have",

Don't have a single person or organisation as the focus of your movement, cause that can be co-opted, perverted, whatever by anyone. Yes, it makes the work excruciatingly slow, but if you truly create community for community's sake and have that roll into liberation work, it is much more resilient. Make sure that the voice of your community is stronger than the voice of the populist fascist right, or even the \"white saviour\" left. I see enough things that can be wrong with this approach, most of all that it is indeed very slow, but on the other hand, the faster attempts have not been successful.",

Sounds more like a white-supremacist talking point than a radically anti-racist one.\n\nWhat do you think a race-traitor is? \n\nI want to be abundantly clear that the terminology *is* a white supremacist talking point. They created the term as a way to differentiate themselves from white people who have interrogated and dismantled their own internal white supremacy. \n\n**A race-traitor is**\u2014by a white supremacist's definition\u2014**a white person who operates antithetically to white supremacy**. Why would you not appreciate being antithetical to white supremacy, unless you yourself are a white supremacist? Anti-white supremacy is anti-racism in the most categoric sense. \n\nAdditionally, one thing I think white people need to understand is that European =/= white. It never has meant that. Whiteness is a network of power that is malleable, and has amalgamated and assimilated various cultures that were strategically necessary to maintain it's power. Irish folk weren't white at one point.  Same for Italians. In fact, all white people\u2014if you go back far enough\u2014were at one point not considered white. Whiteness was created as a weapon of colonization to be inflicted upon indigenous Europeans, the first victims of white supremacy. Just as white people colonized the Americas\u2014stealing, raping, and murdering indigenous folks\u2014the original white people did the same to indigenous tribes of Europe that are now almost all extinct through violent assimilation.\n\nIf you want to understand this more, i'd definitely recommend the books /u/AnarchaMorrigan has suggested, as well as [Kathrin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxUTQx3mcQI) YouTube channel.",

You have white skin, you're Caucasian, that's what you're saying. You're white. That's not inherently evil; the whole social structure that privileges that is what's evil. Identifying with American culture (or wherever you live) more than \"white culture\", trying to tear down systemically racist institutions and modes of organizing society, agitating for racial and social justice, all of that is well and good, but I can't help but feel the fact of the matter is that some random white person in the US or Australia or whatever country *can't* identify ethnically with anything other than whiteness, in the same way you didn't say \"I'm Irish\" or \"I'm Swedish\" or whatever, because presumably you are *not* those things, you've never lived and existed in that culture, even if your ancestors did. Even if you do a bunch of research on your family tree, it doesn't really change anything. You're just white, and you'll tend to default to that label (as you did in this comment) because that's just how the word is commonly used.\n\n>I don't feel any type of way about being expected to become a race traitor. whiteness doesn't hold any pride, history, or achievements for me. it's different from identities with cultures behind them.\n\nLike, I'm glad you don't feel a knee-jerk negative reaction to being called a traitor, but still, it has a very strong negative connotation for the average person. I don't know why I would go about calling something that is good a word that is typically used an an insult and accusation. I doubt I could get many people to be less racist towards arabs, say, if I urged them to be \"race traitors\". In fact, I imagine I'd probably further solidify whatever racist \"us-against-them\" views they already have. Very counter-intuitive approach.\n\n>id encourage you to read Noel Ignatiev, either *Race Traitor,* *Treason to Whiteness is Loyalty to Humanity* or *How the Irish Became White* for more on this.\n\nI haven't read those books, I'll check them out. Genuinely appreciate the recommendations, thank you. I've read books that dealt with this concept of whiteness before, though, and I'm still just not very convinced that it's particularly useful or practical to identify morally wrong behaviors and structures in society with a word that many people identify as being *whether they like it or not*, as you have yourself. Italian people, or whoever, fresh off the boat in Ellis Island have and have had the option of not identifying themselves as \"white\", and the pressures for them to identify as \"white\" were certainly oppressive ones, but the average person of European descent in the US just doesn't have that option today.",

I'm American and Irish (second gen so kind of between cultures but that's a story for a different day) but those are nationalities. Ethnicity is a bit more nebulous as you may or may not belong to a specific ethnic group, but that is distinct from race which may or may not be related. Seriously. this shit is so much more complicated than we're taught and I hope you'll delve deeper into this when you have the time. Race: the Power of an Illusion is a great documentary on stuff like this. it's old, so probably most easily accessible from a library or something, but rentable here https://vimeo.com/ondemand/race . \n\n\nAnyway, if you look at wikipedia's running list of ethnic groups in the world, you'll find \"white\" isn't there https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contemporary_ethnic_groups but there are plenty of ethnic groups composed of white people. mayosapiens are not devoid of culture for being white, it is Whiteness that robs them of culture\n\n>but still, it has a very strong negative connotation for the average person.\n\nso don't use it for the average person. it's more a term for people who have internalized what Whiteness truly is and have begun the work of rejecting it. if who you're talking to isn't there yet, don't use it. we use it here because we're anarchists and part of the premise of the sub is that we're talking to other anarchists who have a basic knowledge of anarchism and how it relates to anti oppression activism\n\n>but the average person of European descent in the US just doesn't have that option today.\n\nthey do though by what they choose to celebrate. celebrating your culture's food, music, language, art, history, is not specific to a race or skin color. what does Irish dancing for example have to do with being White? nothing. Celebrating Whiteness is literally just celebrating hatred",

Irish people were originally not considered white, and many people are considered white very inconsistently (\"Schrodinger's white people\" as I once saw a Jewish person on Reddit say).\n\nSo being a white race traitor or calling to abolish whiteness is more about abolishing the point of grouping ourselves that way, which is white supremacy.\n\nAt least that's how I understand it",

It certainly is of course associated with whiteness and the requirement for being allowed into it, but it is a historical throughline rather than a socially reinforced set of behaviors and values.",

It's a word with a negative connotation.\n\n\nI'm questioning the wisdom of such verbiage, outside of relatively academic texts, when there are so many better phrases (in my mind) to associate with anti-racist action. The average white person hasn't read Baldwin, they don't know what you're talking about, they just know you're asking them to be a traitor, and that you're applying a negative value judgement to something that (in their mind) they have no control over.

I **cannot** destroy white supremacy, and neither can any person of color. If we could, **don't you think we would have destroyed it by now?** For hundreds, if not thousands of years, no matter how hard we've tried, we have failed. And that is because\u2014as i've already stated\u2014it must be an inside job. The abolition of whiteness requires white people to **willfully** relinquish (and betray) their whiteness at every level. \n\nWhite supremacy **is** the mechanism of global power right now. Every aspect of every human life on this planet revolves around white supremacy, and/or the violent, historical (and current) actions of white supremacists that have affected our planet's ecosystem, and the very trajectory of humanity itself. What we need is a revolution of our reality to change our current global oppressive power structure and end the humanicide of our species. \n\nBut there are two roles in this revolution. One to dismantle and nullify the current oppressive forces (which y'all must do), and the other to create and facilitate a new reality outside of this oppression (which we have been doing). \n\n**People of color do not need white people to save them from white supremacy, we've saved ourselves by creating a world irrespective of it.** And that is evidenced by our continuous survival under it's oppression. Now, what people of color *do* need from white people is for them to hurry the fuck up and get over their white supremacy. We need y'all to save yourselves from the dehumanizing mind-virus of supremacy, hierarchy, and colonization. Because once y'all do, you can join us in the horizontal world we've created where race is not a factor, nor a part of our collective reality.\n\nWhiteness is the willful dehumanization of the self that permeates one's ego into violence for humans. It has taken hold of the vast majority of European-descended people and hijacked their bodies into tools of colonization, imperialism, and genocide. How could people of color\u2014who are being colonized, imperialized, and genocided\u2014stop them from doing that besides pleading for our own humanity? We've tried that and it doesn't work [and I want to be clear that we should NOT have to do that]. And that is because whiteness blurs one's ability to see others\u2014or themselves\u2014as human.",

Being a traitor to colonization, imperialism, and genocide **is a good thing**. John Brown did it. Matter fact, he betrayed his own country when he raided Harper's Ferry in the most overt and radical way. These white leftists start crying when they are confronted with the idea that they must relinquish their participation in white supremacy. And it's fucking disgusting, annoying, and dismaying. Race-apathy is not the same as race abolition. White people need to be **active adversaries** to white supremacy if we're gonna get anywhere. Embrace the traitor role.

The more actionable question would be \u201ccan white people dismantle white supremacy already?\u201d  Asking about solidarity between racial or ethnic groups makes it sound like it\u2019s a co-equal task when the work to be done is 100% on white people to dismantle white supremacy.  The rest of the world\u2019s been waiting for us to get to it.",

            "body": "This may not directly answer your question (which, admittedly, I'm perhaps naively biased to answer with a knee-jerk \"of course!\" despite not having any on-the-ground activist experience nor any practical advice; although, I can see where you're coming from), but I think it's worth noting the way in which solidarity has naturally occurred between different racial groups throughout history. If I recall correctly, Zinn discusses this at length somewhere near the beginning of *A People's History of the United States* when it came to white indentured servants and black slaves in the American colonies: they fought side-by-side in uprisings, only later becoming fractured when different economic incentives were introduced that provided reason for the white indentured servants to betray their black comrades and, in turn, reason for black revolters to be pre-emptively suspicious of any whites.\n\n(It's perhaps not directly related to the crux of the discussion, but such incentives included allowing for revolting white indentured servants to forfeit the fight without being put to death, an offer which was quite naturally not on the table for their revolting black compatriots, as well as guaranteed plots of land and guns for when their terms of indentured servitude were over.)\n\nThere are other examples of such social dynamics, where relatively strong shared goals and tactics break down upon a \"divide and conquer\" approach being adopted by the ruling class, both in US history and global history in general. The details are muddy, but I seem to recall a similar situation occurring early on in the history of apartheid South Africa, where poor whites and blacks had largely shared goals until whites began to enjoy better prison conditions and so on. Although no other specific examples immediately come to my mind, it's my personal belief that the attitudes of mutual suspicion and paranoia play into the hands of the ruling classes, who have everything to gain from fractured and clashing movements mired in mutual suspicion, both in the US and elsewhere. When it comes to on-the-ground organizing, especially for causes that are very clearly racial in nature, it's only fair to demand white people take more of a supportive role, to listen and learn from others, so that the voices and actions of those who are most directly affected are amplified, and further, I think it's reasonable to be wary of those white individuals who are unwilling to do so, who do not display some level of humility in wanting to learn from others, but I think it's a mistake to think that's genuine cooperation and solidarity is fucked from the get-go.\n\nAll that being said, there have been many who have spoken quite eloquently against my viewpoint who would know far more than I. I think it was Steve Biko who said: \"The biggest mistake the black world ever made was to assume that whoever opposed apartheid was an ally. Not only have they kicked the black man; they have also told him how to react to that kick.\" I can empathize with that viewpoint, that anyone not directly affected by some discriminatory systemic structure will inevitably be more inclined to talk of mealy-mouthed compromise such; I'm white-passing myself, so it's easy for me to minimize the difficulties inherent in the attitude I'm advocating for here. But I'm also reminded of Malcolm X, who later on in his life, especially after going on Hajj, softened his attitude towards white people and believed in the genuine possibility of productive cooperation across racial lines. If people can't cooperate across these sorts of lines, aren't we well and fucked from the get-go?\n\nI doubt any of this was worth writing, it's nothing particularly novel or practical, but I figured since it was tangentially related and I've already written it up I might as well post it. I hope you'll forgive me my little essay if you find it unhelpful or well off the mark.",

We as white people need to understand our role in the struggle for racial equality.

You can shoulder that burden and be someone who approaches counter-protesters. I've convinced people to leave anti-civil-rights stuff; both anti-blm and anti-lgbt. If you're not visibly part of the oppressed class, you can get past a lot of guardrails and reach the ignorant person behind the bigotry.

It's a very unfortunate reality, and I feel obligated to pay that forward, and use my energy on behalf of oppressed people. \n\nThe very image of you on the protest line will have a subconcious effect on old white people who see you on TV.
