            "body": "This is an excellent article that puts things into context. I want to share my own thoughts a bit on this issue as well.\n\nI grew up in the 90's and became an adult in the early 00's, which I remember as the craze of globalisation, privatization and brutal imperialism by the US, Russia and others.\n\nWe (what we now call the global justice movement) went to protest against G8 (now G7), WEF, Iraq war etc. because we saw the exploitation, lies and that wars were waged in order to expand empires.\n\nPersonally I was never against _actual_ free trade and I'm sure as hell prefer to live in a country were I can at least vote (we have direct democracy where I live). I think it's rather awesome that I can buy coffee from Chiapas and olive oil from Lesbos and Palestine. I love the fact that I can communicatea and work with people from all around the world. The earth is so small, we're essentially all neighbors.\n\nBut we saw through the hypocricy of neoliberal capitalism that adorns itself with \"democracy\" and \"free trade\". (Democracy and free trade _for who_ ?) It's easy to see through the BS with an Anarchist lens: It's about power relations, worker exploitation and domination.\n\nEntire regions being destabilized, through coups, sabotage and military brutality doesn't sound like freedom and democracy to me. The US empire added fuel to the fire of Islamofascism in the middle east, which has lead to an increase oppression and death. Creating problems that they are then pretending to solve...\n\nTaking over natural resources and financial oppression via the IMF doesn't sound like \"free trade\" to me either. Read [here](https://chomsky.info/19960413/) for an excellent analysis on that matter.\n\nAnd again, we are seeing a hypocricy now from the right wing, just with a slightly different tune. Just now they are done pretending to side with \"free trade\" and \"democracy\". The US is siding with Putin, a fascist dictator who wants to expand his empire westwards, but demands vast amounts of natural resources from the country that is being attacked. And they try to tank the economy with a sensless trade war so his friends and benefactors can gobble up the pieces.\n\nBut it's all essentially the same game: weaken the working class, global exploitation and centralization of power. Don't get fooled into believing that this helps any of our causes.",
