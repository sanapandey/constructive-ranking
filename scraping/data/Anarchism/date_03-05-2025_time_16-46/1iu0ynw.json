It is time to organize, and bash the fascists. Henry Rollins said it best, this is not the time for dismay, this is punk rock time. This is what Joe Strummer trained us for. Hero time starts right now.",

This is an  international project, but, it is started from a North American perspective. And in reaction to the 2025 US elections. \n\nIt's an almost completed piece of graphic literature. \"Book 1\" is just about done, the author is anonymous, i am in possession of it, but the author is looking to pass book 1 down to another anonymous author for it to be expanded on further. Then the next author once they have exhausted themselves can hand it down to someone else. \n\nThe part that isn't done is essentially the confines in which the proceeding books can be written. Just the set of rules for how the next portion is permitted to be written. Which should be no trouble for most of the anarchist community. \n\nBut i am in possession of said book and I am supposed to pass it down to someone else. They would need to be or team up with an artist to continue the next part. And be highly dedicated as the original author worked on this intensively. They have said they have exhausted themselves and want to pass it down. \n\nSomeone who will protect the original intentions of the book and wont corrupt it basically. This person is an isolationist they don't leave their home, they are as solitary as they possibly can be in this society. They barely know anyone and so they have no choice but to use the Internet to hand it down. \n\nIf you want you can message me and I can keep you updated.",
