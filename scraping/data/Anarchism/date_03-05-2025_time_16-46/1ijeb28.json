    "selftext": "Hi folks! I have an Etsy shop and I would like to offer an item for free. I will make a special coupon/discount code for this item so when people go to the checkout they can have it for free.\n\nI created an illustration of Medusa holding the decapitated head of the tangerine man. The image is ready to download and I thought I wouldn't show the entire image in the product description (just in case). \n\nIs it safe? will my shop be closed if I offer this type of product? ",
