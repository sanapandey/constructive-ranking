I\u2019m so freaking tired of old men in suits in their comfy chairs in their air conditioned buildings who won\u2019t have to be stuck on this planet much longer writing their words that control the one life I have.\n\nThey prevent me from achieving my dreams. From being with the people I love. And the crowds rush in and support them because they are so used to the cage they are afraid to leave it, but the cage master won\u2019t let them stay in their cage unless they help lock me in one too.\n\nI despise them\n\nFuck politicians and fuck the bootlickers that make their abstract power real!\n\nSorry to vent guys",

They can't come to terms with America not being a free country. I have sympathy for that. But I also have some hope. People are becoming more class conscious and that is a very good start.",

Their top-down decisions bring nothing but harm and oppression, and they claim they are \"saving us from ourselves\".  But let this anger turn into love for your fellow man, and your fellow Anarchists. Let that be what motivates you, because mutual aid among comrades shows them how unnecessary they've always been.",
