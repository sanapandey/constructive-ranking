What systems of accountability can we make that produce results? Anarchists tend to define themselves around their autonomy and freedom to act, the idea of centralized power is a red flag for abuse. \n\nMy question to all of you here is: how would you feel about the concept of another Internationale, but for anarchists? I personally have considered the amount of abuse and unaccountability I've heard from all of you and I think we must agree: what measures in place we have are NOT working; something must be done and the excuses of autonomy fail to understand the responsibilities we have as autonomous beings. Especially for those of you who are communists as well, this movement has been broken over and over again but survives. What can make anarchism thrive and make headway? How can we maintain our independence but become accountable to one another? How can we foster international solidarity, protect each other, and feel unified in more than just the idea of freedom from the state? \n",
