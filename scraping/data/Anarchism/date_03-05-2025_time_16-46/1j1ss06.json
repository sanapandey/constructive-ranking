    "selftext": "Hi comrades,\n\nBack in November, 3 students from Queen's University Belfast were assualted by police arrested during a peaceful protest against their university's complicity in the Zionist genocide and the presense of Hilary Clinton on campus.\n\nThey have been wrongly charged with resisting arrest and assaulting officers and are currently going through a lengthy legal battle. At worst, they could face a six month prison sentence for peaceful protest on their own university campus.\n\nThere is currently a letter writing campaign to the Public Prosecutions Service to try to get the charges dropped. We are concerned not only for the welfare of these activists, but also for the chilling effect on protests that these prosecutions will have if successful. If you are able to write a letter to the PPS protesting the criminalisation of these demonstrations full information can be found at the link below.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsjdlrM6MJ/?igsh=ZXV1emRiMmhncjAy](https://www.instagram.com/p/DGsjdlrM6MJ/?igsh=ZXV1emRiMmhncjAy)",
