            "body": "During my time as a Marxist-Leninist I and various others would rely on a series of arguments to uphold and defend the ideology and the states which they created. In hindsight it's clear that these arguments were highly defeatist in nature, as instead of desiring to aim for higher standards, they instead resort to flattening the debate to defend what occured historically.\n\nI haven't seen a lot of specific debunkings of many of these arguments, so I decided to reflect on my time and get to the meat of them.\n\nI also end by reflecting on my time as an ML and what drew me back to Anarchism.",

Really, if you define the act of \"Imposing one's will upon another\" as authority, then you're essentially saying that \"might makes right\", which is a blatantly reactionary thought process.",

After all, the actual Communist revolution would be made by workers and Lenin himself didn't believe the Revolution would start in Soviet Union but in a high developed capitalist country like Germany.\n\nAccording to Lenin in the same discourse, calling his government Communist was only a propaganda (his words) to suggest that his government was working to one day archive communism.\n\nWhat Lenin discussed at party meeting and congress and wrote in private letters are not the same as what he discussed and wrote to the public. Most ML only read one or two books, and some pamphlets, that Lenin wrote to the public and nothing else.",

He really wasn't trying to be secretive about this, works like *The Tax in Kind*, *The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It*, and plenty of other writings make it unbelievably clear to the public, these are not just internal communications. In fact, Lenin was one of the few trying to dispel the illusion that state capitalism is socialism, which was a rather prominent misconception within the second international. Lenin understood international revolution would be the only savior to the Russian revolution. Until then, of course Russia would be stuck at state capitalism and would never achieve socialism in any sense, while it would also still be accurate to describe the USSR as socialist in aim. I'd also like to note here that Lenin makes this specific fact clear in his pamphlet *The Tax in Kind*, where he says\n\n\"No one, I think, in studying the question of the economic system of Russia, has denied its transitional character. Nor, I think, has any Communist denied that the term Soviet Socialist Republic implies the determination of the Soviet power to achieve the transition to socialism, and not that the existing economic system is recognised as a socialist order.\"\n\nRemember that this was a public document made into a pamphlet for wide distribution. Lenin isn't deviously lying to the workers about the nature of the USSR like you claimed. Stalinists fuck this up and claim the USSR to be literally socialist, but Lenin himself made no mistake here and made no attempt to deceive anybody.",

But I understand you assuming that I was thinking of it as conspiracy by Lenin, because most leninists claim that Soviet Union was socialist, and so many people who actually care to read and understand Lenin end up believing that most people think Soviet Union was socialist because Lenin was doing conspiracy. When it was just a kind of Slogan that people people took for granted without carring to actually reading beyond some Lenins books.\n\nDifferent from what people did with unpublished and even unfinished Marx works and letters, Leninists didn't published and promoted the unpublished letters, discusses, etc from Lenin, and the few translated to English or other languages are protected by copyright and massively remove from Marxist.org and others site.",

From my understanding\u00a0 without at least one industrial nation providing embodied technology including military defences agrarian country will face same fate as Ukraine from Russia today - invasion. Too bad focus on self defence created this militaristic image of USSR some love and some (like me) want to avoid. As far as I understand \"standart Anarchist answer\" is Spain in 1930s,\u00a0 but you can't build full technology pyramid in just 15 years from literal ores and coal. Too much machinery in steps ... so, imports. But who will export that much machinery \"for free\" even for friendly (supposedly) country? Even steam locomotive and 1920x style truck is hi tech for its era. Ofc avoiding whole eurofaschism isdesirable, but capitalism tend to expand even unprovoked, so it will conflict with peaceful/ecological existence of some alluance of countries\u00a0 sooner or later .....",

By 1804, they abolished slavery, expelled the French colonizers, and established the independent republic of Haiti. Haiti was the name given to the Caribbean island by the Tainos before colonizers arrived, slaughtered the entire indigenous population, and imported African slaves.\n\nWhile the 1776 and 1789 revolutions of the USA and France were grounded in exclusionary \"citizens' rights,\" the Haitian Revolution stood out for a commitment to universal human rights. Thanks to the revolution, Haitians enjoyed freedom from enslavement for some forty-six years from 1802 to 1848. According to Nick Nesbitt, the Haitian Revolution was 'the culmination of a radical strand of Enlightenment political philosophy that acted upon Spinoza's revolutionary proposition: to avoid insofar as possible the alienation of constituent power to representative bodies and to \"always preserve the natural right in its entirety.\" '[1](https://libcom.org/article/anarchy-haitian-revolution#footnote1_um75oq2)\n\nAs Russell Maroon Shoatz, a former Black Panther, summarizes, the Haitian Revolution saw two competing tendencies: a centralized \"dragon\" and a decentralized \"hydra\":\n\n*\"There, between 1791 and 1804, we witness one of the most titanic struggles ever engaged in between (enslaved) workers and their overlords. It is through an examination of the events surrounding that struggle that we can clearly measure the strengths and weaknesses of our dragon and hydra: centralized and decentralized forces of change.\"* [2](https://libcom.org/article/anarchy-haitian-revolution#footnote2_8lt7lm9)\n\n[https://libcom.org/article/anarchy-haitian-revolution](https://libcom.org/article/anarchy-haitian-revolution)",

                            "body": "Communism existed long before Marx ever was born. It was Engels who introduced communism to Marx, and most of what Marx wrote about socialism/communism is a mix of many socialists/Communist theories and concepts he took from other socialists and communists of his time and before them. Even some of the most famous Communist phrases associated to Marx are not from Marx. Marx only took them from other communists.\n\nThe real Marx insites are theories about capitalism. Before Marx became Communist supported capitalism, and after became Communist his main focus was to learn and understand how capitalism works. Even his Proletarian Dictatorship theory is based on his theories about capitalist developments.\n\nAt the end, Marx barely wrote and studied communism itself. He wrote and studied mostly about Capitalism and his theories and findings are mostly about capitalism, not communism.",

His huge contribution to political economy pholosophy was about capitalism, which helped him come up with theories about workers revolution.\n\nAs I said, Marx barely wrote about communism itself.",
