Works wonderfully well and quick, is reaaaaally cheap, came in a lot of different forms here in France (self-dissolving tablets, concentrated liquid, diluted liquid etc...). In tablet, you dissolve at... It was 1 pill/tablet per half litre ? IIRC ? In concentrated/paste form, a tiny tube (0.5cl) for 10cl is good, and you can spread some concentrate under your eyes in prevention.\nIf needed, put it in a spray bottle to spray it on your face and eyes, very efficient (had some street medics going around during protests with pre-filled spray just asking people in cloud of tear gaz if they needed some, really it's a life changer)\nYou can drink some to rince your mouth too.\n\nIf no Maalox is available, diluted citrus juice on a cloth around the mouth and nose is said to help\n\nIn all cases, using pool glasses (hermetic sealing) is reaaaaally good !",

Don\u2019t use milk, it\u2019s only temporary relief and there are more risks \n it\u2019s not sterile. It may not feel great but the fastest way is clean drinking water in the eyes and time. Definitely look up more guidelines on how to protest safely. It\u2019s a good idea to have eye protection to try to prevent tear gas/chemical agent contact. I recognize milk was normalized amongst resistance groups but it\u2019s just safer to stick with clean water to avoid potential long term damage.\n\nEdit: I wouldn\u2019t recommend antacid either even if people have used it before. The feeling of the burn will dissipate but it\u2019s better that it goes without a battle within one of the most vulnerable parts of your body (your eyes).",
