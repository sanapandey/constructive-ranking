Truly revolutionary.\n\nAnarchism, brought to you by the same consumer culture it claims to reject. Can\u2019t wait for the limited-edition, corporate-sponsored revolution!",

At the same time, I have to say that this whole notion of pacifism among the left nowadays cannot answer the problems that we have right now. It's a weak point to stand on, as wars that we have right now cannot be solved in \"immediate negotiations\" way, because aggressors of these wars aren't willing to accept any other terms except for total annihilation of their enemy. Neither Ukrainian or Palestinian people have an option for pacifism. \n\nFor Ukrainians and Palestinians, the choice isn\u2019t between peace and war \u2014 it\u2019s between resisting or disappearing. Both Russia and Israel are trying to commit genocide.\nInstead of advocating for immediate negotiations with \"peace at any cost\" point, we should aim all our rhetoric towards supporting the oppressed. And only them have the right to decide whether they want negotiations or not.",
