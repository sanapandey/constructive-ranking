    "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t the right subreddit for this but thought you all might have some decent input. \n\nI do work with a local, city wide mutual aid group that works directly with the community to provide essential resources through supply distributions at the local shelter and other avenues. \n\nI love being involved with them and giving money/purchasing where I am able to! But the work I do is a bandaid. It\u2019s not a solution. It\u2019s just tiny drops in a massive sea. \n\nThat being said, I\u2019m exploring ways to expand within this group but also as an individual. \n\nBasically what I\u2019m saying is I want more money/resources to do more things and offer long term solutions for my neighbors. I can\u2019t apply for traditional grants as we are grassroots (ie not a 501c3). But I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s lefty philanthropists or micro grants or really anything else I could tap into. I want to house folks, get them decent healthcare, grow shit and build a thriving community that isn\u2019t in survival mode. But I\u2019m just a girl that works at an animal shelter. \n\nThanks in advance x ",
