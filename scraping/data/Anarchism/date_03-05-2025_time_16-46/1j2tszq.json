    "selftext": "Hey, so I've been doing social media activism for years, but I haven't gone to any protests physically because of my nuerodivergency/other mental health issues. I wanna find a group of people to go with, but unfortunately being social irl is kinda my downfall. I have one irl friend as we speak. I wanna find a group or even just one person to go with me that understands where I'm coming from with my needs in terms of autism, that can help show me the ropes for all this and know how to help if I'm having a meltdown. I just don't feel safe going alone for my first time when I have no prior experience in this. Please give me some advice!!",

Then you get to know people a bit and what's going on, and then maybe when you go to a protest you might see some people you've met before, or you might even be going to a protest that is partly organized by the group you got involved in, or going with some of the people you met in the group.",
