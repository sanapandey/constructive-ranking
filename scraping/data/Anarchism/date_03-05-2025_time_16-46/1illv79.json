    "selftext": "i've been having this contention for a while, as comrades and i have predicted a potential civil war in the following years to come.. i come from an indigenous background, and have committed myself to staying off the grid/reading theory/committing to direct action. however, i come to a point of strife, as i find that this country has failed most latin american countries through imperialist tactics, apartheid, slavery.. blah, blah. anyways, i saw a post regarding \"fleeing\" in these tumultuous times, and some where criticizing and saying it would be cowardly. however, if a potential war were to flourish, would it be cowardly? i mean, my ancestors are not from here - in fact, they fell for some american dream gimmick, and were continually exploited, harassed, and disregarded in the bureaucratic system. why should i then, turn around and fight for land that's built on the most evil of principles? some romantic idea of revolution and/or autonomous state? that's what got Che killed in the end. these are different times - surely, but not sure. just conflicted and wanted to give my thoughts and meanderings. i would only fight for my loves ones and comrades if the organizing was right and established, which does not seem the case. and it seems it's only bound to get worse here. what do you think? what would you tell your POC comrades regarding this?",

I think you don't really ever completely know either--you react moment to moment....\nI guess I try to remember that we only get one life, and shouldn't I do everything I can for others, for the world? It requires a selflessness I don't always possess, but I know it is the guiding principle if we are ever to get anywhere....\n\nAll actions do not need to be big, or violent. Perhaps the most effective ones are just being sand in the gears...or giving you skills or resources freely. \nThese tiny things are what make the larger things possible. \nSending love and strength.",

I would not fight fight back in hopes of saving \u201cAmerica\u201d\nBut all social progress has and will always be won via civil unrest and fighting. Not everyone will be able to leave the country; in fact a vast majority will not. I won\u2019t be able to. So in the interest of myself and people like me, staying and fighting back is our best bet. We might be fighting for social progress we won\u2019t be around to enjoy, but we got the 8 hour work day because someone threw dynamite into a crowd in chicago 140 years ago. I am the beneficiary of a long line and history of political action, I will take actions that will benefit people who aren\u2019t me to in a sense, pay it forward. \n\nNot to mention there\u2019s no guarantee that fascist trend or conflicts won\u2019t spill out globally. They already are. So I\u2019m doubtful leaving the United States would help. \n\nLiving \u201coff the grid\u201d and other survivalist ideas are lame and impractical. It\u2019s just rehashed liberal homesteading slop.\nThe capital it would require to build a \u201cself sustaining\u201d living situation is immense and would involve you recreating infrastructure that already exists elsewhere.",
