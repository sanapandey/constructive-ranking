The United States is not the only imperial power in the world. As US power wanes, it will be especially important to understand this and to listen to people from other parts of the world in order to understand what is going on there. In this case, that means listening to Ukrainians, Russians, and Belarusians. You could start by reading the texts in the list of citations published here.",

And also where is the line between colonialism and simple territorial expansion which pre-dates even the nation-state? The justification for the invasion seems more ethnonationalist\n\nDon't get me wrong it *is* imperialism but I think you have to zoom out to see that? Ie it's not only about seizing this one territory, but about punishing and about intimidating all the other people/states in Russia's sphere of influence - which isn't all that different from how the USA and UK use millitary force (or for that matter maybe Israel?)",

We should not act like history began in 2022, or 2014, or 2001 for that matter.\n\nNonetheless, it's possible to make the argument that that colonial militarism is assuming a different \\*form\\* today than it did before. In 2003, we were in the midst of neoliberalism triumphant, in which a pointless and horrific attack like the invasion of Iraq served chiefly to put Iraqi resources at the mercy of the global economy, as well as to dehumanize Arabs and Muslims. Today, we are in a somewhat different era, when it is not a question of the US government and its allies extending the reach of neoliberalism, but instead, we are watching the neoliberal world order collapse into rival blocs. War is spreading across the Mideast and into Europe, and threatening to break out on a much bigger scale in Asia. Three of the major world power blocs have involved in old-fashioned land-grab colonial invasions over the past year and a half\u2014Russia in Ukraine, Israel (as a proxy for the US) in Gaza and the West Bank and Lebanon and Syria, and Turkey in Syria (and, via its proxy Azerbaijan, in Armenia). \n\nAnd this is just the beginning. The talk about seizing Greenland, Panama, or even Canada suggests that the sort of treatment that racist, Islamophobic Republicans once reserved for places like Afghanistan and Iraq could soon be on the table everywhere, and other power blocs (China, India, etc.) will not wish to be outdone.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why we should not make excuses for Putin (echoing his own mendacious claims that he was \"forced\" to invade Ukraine), but rather recognize that, if there are not serious consequences for the invasion of Ukraine, it will serve as a model for other countries.\n\nTLDR: It's hard to summarize complex geopolitical shifts in social media posts.",
