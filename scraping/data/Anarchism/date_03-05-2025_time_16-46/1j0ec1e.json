            "body": "Another pacifist nonsense promoting the false dichotomy of violence vs non-violence.\n\nSelf-defense is by definition violence. Pretending that all violences are an act of domination is basically saying that self-defense is an act of domination against our oppressors and agressors.\n\nIf someone try to kill you. Killing them in the process of self-defense can happen. And even if you don't kill them in the process you surely harmed them or performed an act of violence while defending yourself. That's what revolutionnary violence is, self-defense. Do you prefer victims to let themselves being killed?\n\nIf someone try to dominate you, to violate your consent, to steal your freedom and when you try to free yourself, to defend yourself or to take your liberty back, they try to kill you. It's totally justified and necessary to engage in self defense to survive. This is what revolutionnary violence is. That's why people like bakunin and other not out of touch with reality anarchists say that revolutionnary violence is necessary. Because it's inevitable that those who oppress and dominate us will not let us free ourselves without trying to kill us.\n\nPeople who oppose revolutionnary violence are either brainwashed by the bourgeoisie propaganda that present it as an act of agression. Or they straight up avocate against people's right to self-defense and basically tell them that if someone try to kill you, to dominate you or to violate your consent: let it be.",

The pain of that betrayal stings every day, every Native suicide is because of imperialist violence. There is no comparing self defense to the violence of the state. One can only exist in the presence of constant force and coercion, the other is a last resort to protect yourself from harm.

You change the world through building organisations capable of direct action; be it providing food, rendering aid, building dwellings for people, etc. Anything that helps people\n\nYou defend people and the organisations they rely on, through proportional means up to and including violence. You must include the capability for violence, because if you do not, somebody who wishes force you back into a brutal hierarchy for their own ends will simply escalate beyond your capability to resist, and everything you have built is entertained completely at the whim of the conquering power; you are dominated by it.\n\nWar is simply the continuation of politics by other means.",
