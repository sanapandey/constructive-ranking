Although I cannot find an entirely credible source on this I\u2019ve heard from multiple sources that colored printers (even home printers) can leave coded metadata (yellow dots left on printed paper that are nearly impossible to see with the naked eye) to help trace printed items back to their source. Again, not positive if this is true but I recommend printing anything in color out at a local library as opposed to doing it directly at home or somewhere that can be traced back to you",

They have exhausted themselves writing the first book. a second book will be written where this one ends. It's not a piece of fiction or something, it's practical and very easy and quick to read. It is a graphic piece of literature. \n\nEssentially they need to pass book 1 down to another anonymous author for it to be continued. This anonymous author would highlight themselves as someone else with a differing moniker picking up the torch so to speak. When the next anonymous author exhausts themselves on book 2 they can pass it down to someone else. \n\nThis person lives in solitude, is a hermit. They barely leave their home. Hence why I'm here to pass the book down. \n\nThe next author/illustrator would need to be quite dedicated to protecting the original intentions of the book, it cant be corrupted, but this shouldn't be hard for the anarchist community. \n\nThe part that is being completed right now is essentially the confines for how the proceeding books can be written, essentially some safety's put in place. But the format, everything else is up to the next author.",
