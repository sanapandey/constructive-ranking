    "selftext": "Hey. So, I don\u2019t know if this is the right sub for this, but it seems like a place I could get some answers. Now, I\u2019m not completely sure whether I will pull this off, but I am going to school in a relatively blue state, and have trouble getting to most protests as they aren\u2019t in my area and I have very little transportation options. On March 7th, I\u2019ve heard there are gonna be big protests for the March for Science movement, but I looked and the closest one to me is two states away. So I would like to attempt to stage a walkout at my campus, and would appreciate any suggestions or help. I\u2019m not sure if it would be better to discuss with my administration, or to plan it underground but I am leaning for the latter, however I would love some insight on the pros and cons of attempting to plan above board.\nI have never done anything like this before, so this is sort of my gateway into activism and standing up for my values. Again, I can\u2019t promise I will actually be able to go through with this, it is a big leap for me. Any help is appreciated.",

            "body": "You should certainly plan it underground, as school administrations have been known to work against protest efforts. Even if they do accept, they could register names, alert law enforcement, etc. I would keep it secretive for now. If you go to high school, maybe let your parents know if they are trustworthy as they can help to protect the students from teachers who disapprove.",

I\u2019m not quite sure how to spread the word adequately underground, or if it would be safe to tell trusted staff about my plans (are they required by law to report me?). Would you suggest I make flyers to pass to people who I trust to pass to more people, or would that be a bad choice considering the circumstances? Sorry for all the questions, this truly would be my first time taking direct action",

You can pass flyers, makes sure they are small and easy to hide, you can also use telecommunications. Like, put a link to a Signal group chat on the flyer where you can distribute information instead of putting the date and time on the flyer itself. You can also just use word of mouth to get the message out, and that has no paper trail. Probably the safest option.",

If you have allies from teachers in the science department, instead of a walk out you could do a sort of walk in or walk to science where instead of leaving campus you march to the science department where a feature is a science teacher talks about some science-based topic and perhaps a social studies teacher saying something about evidence-based policy making. If you do not have faculty allies, you could ask for such inputs from externals and march off campus to hear them.\n\nIt is important to emphasize what you are for, not just what you are against.",

You can be the first speaker - take 30 seconds to thank the group for walking out in support of science because 'science is for everyone' or whatever catchphrase, and then say we'll hear a few words from whatever speaker before returning to class. Speaker could be another student, a local organizer/activist, scientist, a teacher who supports what you're doing - five minutes tops. You can also open it up to anyone who wants to comment, if the group is small.\n\nDon't try to organize it yourself. Get other kids involved NOW - tell people you want to do something Friday and YOU NEED THEIR HELP to plan and pull it off. If they help create this, they will show up.\n\nAsk a friend (or a yearbook kid?) to take photos/video. Email a press release (even a couple sentences) to your local media that morning (like \"students at your-school-name to stage walkout at whatever-time in support of...\"). Have art-ins during study halls this week to make signs & t-shirts, ask your art teacher for supplies/ideas. \n\nDo you know someone with a megaphone? If not, recruit cheer and/or theater kids to do human microphone for your speaker(s). Get band kids - even our extremely tiny school has a marching band, so I think you must have band.\n\nA few kids with signs/banners and something to say will have more impact than 30 kids walking out and being like, now what.

Meeting with management, especially early on, could get you recognised as a troublemaker for the rest of your time in school. If there must be meetings, make sure they're in a group where each person has something to say, not with just one spokesperson\n\n\nThe basic pattern for any action is to talk to a few good people and with them make an organsing committee. Talk about how to promote it, make posters, each talk to people one to one in your classes to get them on board and agree to recruit more people in turn. Talk about how to bring on people in other yeargroups etc you don't have contact with yet. If you can, host a people's assembly on the actual action where anyone can speak (within a timelimit) to the rest - that way there's not a clear leadership and it feels democratic, plus you can take a vote at the end on what action to do next",
