    "selftext": "Movement anarchy stems from an anarchist alternative to traditional fitness methods and sports - which embraces the natural movement for itself that we engaged with as kids that society trained out of us.\n\nEmbarrassing movements that go against the norms.\n\nWe have been domesticated on nearly all levels including in our physical movements themselves.\n\nMovement Anarchy is rejecting norms of movement - moving irresponsibly - running, jumping, climbing, balancing, frolicking, climbing trees, throwing things, and occasionally breaking things.\n\nMove for the fun of it - act as our heart desires - practice skills that we invent in the very moment we do them.\n\nMovement anarchy means that when you walk down the street, your balancing on the curve, jumping over stuff, climbing stuff, doing whatever you want. Getting in trouble and breaking things.\n\nUnlike organized sports like skateboarding, movement anarchy is almost impossible to regulate. There are no \"spots\" that we stay at for hours. The entire world is a gym. There is no distinguishment between movement anarchy and every day existence. It happens everywhere all the time. It is uncontrollable.\n\nIt is also illegalist, especially indoors where I only fuck around in places I hate. If I break something in walmart then fuck them. Cops will never catch me.\n\nThat is all. You can find me in the trees, and climbing into drainage pipes.\n\n\\------------\n\nThis sounds silly, until you realize that this is the most natural military training that is ever provided.\n\nThe brain learns fastest when ***PLAYING.*** Trying to sneak around random people in the park with a heavy backpack on while climbing through trees pretending I'm a soldier ***GENUINELY prepares me for combat situations***.\n\nPlay is seriously one of the deepest and most powerful aspects of our psychology which is almost entirely abandoned in our alienated domestication.",
