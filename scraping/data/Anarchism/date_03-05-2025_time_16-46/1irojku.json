    "selftext": "Looking for videos/podcasts/writing where folks with anarchist philosophies debate neoliberals and other folks in the political spectrum. Ideally I\u2019d look for debates/panels that seem well matched, paint different sides in the best light possible through strong speakers/debaters. Not looking for clickbait YouTube debate content if possible.\n\nThanks! ",
