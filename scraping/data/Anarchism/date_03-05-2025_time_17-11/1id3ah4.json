    "selftext": "\u201cIf man is infinitely malleable\u2014without innate mental structures or needs\u2014he becomes the perfect subject for control by the state, the entrepreneur, the technocrat.\u201d\n\nWe stand at a crossroads in history. The fascist candle burns brighter than ever, offering a false hope to a desperate working class.\n\nBlinded by despair, the proletariat clings to its dim glow, believing it leads to prosperity. But this candle does not guide\u2014it consumes. It feeds on the very people it claims to illuminate.\n\nThe promises of social mobility, wealth, and fairness crumble under the reality of an ascendant technocratic bourgeoisie, whose privilege is no longer even hidden.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cfake\u201d left\u2014the corporate-backed liberals, the hollowed-out European social democrats\u2014have abandoned the working class, leaving them vulnerable to the so-called \u201cpatriots\u201d who wave their wallets as flags.\n\nIt\u2019s time to reignite a real flame\u2014not of empty promises, but of unity, strength, and class solidarity.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Let\u2019s be the candle of hope\u2014not the candle of despair. \ud83d\udd25",
