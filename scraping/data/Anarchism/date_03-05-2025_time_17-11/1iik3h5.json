If you're concerned, there is probably a lib nonprofit where people know a lot about their unhoused neighbors on a day-to-day or at least month-to-month basis. You might consider volunteering to gain a better understanding of how ICE raids are impacting them. My experience has been that there's a certain amount of chronically homeless community, although obviously there are people on their own or couch surfing etc. with other community.",

A lot of the orgs in the Twin Cities that service the camps have ties to the Native orgs down here, since a lot of the homeless are Native. So, I can connect you with people doing work around that in the Cities, or assistance to the homeless in Duluth, but I probably don't have contacts near you, because the networks of activists get a little thin out in the north. Though, I might know folks who know folks, through the pipeline fight or through the community down here.",

At least not for a while.\n\nThe point of the sweeps is to be loud and public, it's meat for Trump's base who want to see all the \"Mexicans\" who are \"taking American jobs\" be thrown out. That means they largely target workplaces because that's where it's easiest to find undocumented people.\n\nWhen Trump's concentration camp in Cuba opens up, who knows?",
