Don't get me wrong, I think the Hitler comparisons are fine, but it's completely ignorant of colonialism and its history in creating concentration camps. I'm from Australia and am genuinely surprised that people don't know we run concentration camps called \"detention centres\" in places like Christmas Island or Nauru - I'd recommend looking them up if you're interested.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is people saying that if you do nothing while Trump builds concentration camps then you're basically a Nazi. Yet if you judge them by their own measure, almost all of America and Australia are Nazis for putting up with the concentration camps that are already established.",

I'm pointing out that there already are concentration camps separate to the one that he's starting / reopening. For example the two I mentioned, and also I think there's one at the US-Mexico border too that was in the news for separating kids from their parents.\n\nSo people pointing out that it's starting to look like Hitler for this reason are ignorant to what's already happening. So the point is that they are already functioning before Trump which wouldn't is not the same as reopening one.",

Obama may have locked up and ruined the lives of many immigrants too, but he didn't openly encourage it and talk about how evil they were and how we needed to purge them from our country like a disease. Obama didn't call mexicans rapists. The dems didn't openly court nazis, have widespread nazi support, or have the richest man on earth on stage at the inauguration, actually throwing up Nazi Salutes with zero push back. I think that makes the Hitler comparisons pretty spot on. Not to mention the cozying up to dictators around the world, the fact that his dad was afgiliated with the klan and that he allegedly kept a collection of Hitler Speeches by his bedside according to his ex wife.",

There are videos of the police removing barricades and practically escorting people into the building and giving them a tour. Only suburbanites who have never been to a 3rd world country think that was a coup attempt. The only person that died that day was an unarmed woman. Charlottesville was tragic, and a woman lost her life that day, but you have no sympathy for Muslim women? Do you have any idea how many Muslim women died at the hands of Obama's drones where he \"crashed\" weddings with hellfire missiles? You don't care about them. You only care about what the tv tells you to care about.\n\nYou can vote, but participating in partisan politics outside the booth is not wise.",

When trump does something horrible, he says he is doing it in front of everyone, and the media eats it up. The left keeps that shit quiet. That does make them dangerous, but I would argue no more dangerous than the right. \n\nWhat the right does is...on TOP of doing all the same shit the dems do, just out in the open, they also target additional people and programs that dems would often not touch or in some cases programs dems have kept afloat.\n\nEducation funding, HUD Housing, EPA, Medicaid, SSI, Welfare Programs, etc, just to name a few. Those things are historically, not under nearly as much threat when dems are in control and Nazis are not emboldened to harass people in the streets.\n\nDems also have a much more solid history of employing and elevating POC, disabled and LGBTQ people. Call it tokenism if you want, but they still do it and those people end up in more positions of power than they ever would under a republican party.\n\nEven at their absolute fucking worst, democrats are still easily better than even the best Republicans. I imagine you would be hard pressed to find anything Republicans have done to help anyone other than the rich. You just can't say that about dems. Actual poor people are suffering slightly less because of very real programs that dems have actually kept alive and those very same programs have been historically and almost exclusively attacked by only Republicans. \n\nIf you ask nearly any marginalized group, they will more than likely tell you that they feel less safe with Trump in the white house and they are, as we speak very much less safe with Trump in the white house.

That being said, I too have found myself frustrated with the lack of acknowledgement around an already existing concept.

The debates that have swept the nation over the years are things that have been debated and voted on far longer than most seem to understand. I believe it to be imperative we continue to focus on protecting our immigrants but give them justice across the board by understanding the history of their oppression. Mass deportation is to be the main focus as it is almost impossible to fathom just how horrific the reality of it is. However, you could better understand by looking up \u201cMigrant Camps\u201d. Something that has been around far longer than Trump. The conditions of these camps are and have always been inhabitable and inhumane - Making an example of how our government does not have the capability of enforcing such drastic measures without blood on their hands. A \u201csmall scaled\u201d example of what is to come.
