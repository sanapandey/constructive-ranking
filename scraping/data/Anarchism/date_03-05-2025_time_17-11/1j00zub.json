            "body": "Saw a video on instagram about hypothetical alliances between Marxists and Anarchists. In the comments there are Marxists calling for \"unlimited genocide on anarKKKists.\" Why do Marxists want to genocide people that slightly disagree with them? Why do other anarchists think this is still a good idea when history has proven otherwise?",

I became an anarchist mostly on my own but also because the amount of sectarianism among socialists is disturbing. At a DSA conference some years back they handed out a sheet of other leftist orgs and why they're bad lmao. My one former Marxist friend told me anarchists are good as soldiers but can't be trusted to lead because our ideals are petit bourgeoisie and the revolutionary state would collapse. I wish I could say I trust a socialist in a time of serious upheaval but frankly, I don't.\n\n\nEdit to also mention they don't think we \"slightly\" disagree, they find the idea of moving to statelessness during the revolution to be so harmful that it enables capitalist resurgence and weakens the left. Our ideals of \"freedom\" are too abstract and meaningless, they're emotion based and we have no scientific evidence for our beliefs or basis in the scientific method. Truly they think Marx was some infallible genius (I still don't understand how they justify Engels) but Kropotkin was just full of shit I guess, definitely not one of the preeminent scientists of his time but being born an aristocrat is somehow worse than Engels?? Truly confusing.\u00a0",

They keep telling me to not to judge the whole movement because of fringe comments, but when you see comments like that get so much support and little to no opposition it\u2019s pretty dissuading.\n\nIt\u2019s great when you can have a good discussion about Marx or Lenin with them. There are plenty like that, but I have encountered fanatics like you describe. Those ones are scary. Well Engles was paying for Marx to live basically while he worked, guess they have to love him lol. \u00a0",
