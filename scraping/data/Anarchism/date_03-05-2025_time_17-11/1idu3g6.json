Condemning this guy shouldn\u2019t be hard, and it\u2019s disturbing that it took so much of the movement so long to condemn him and his group. Ethnonationalism dressed up in lefty language is bad, folks.",

My guess is he probably spilled a lot of info on the authcomm groups he used to run with in exchange for all charges being dropped. Of course it helps that his victims were most often houseless teens with histories of addiction and mental illness, and that he comes from a wealthy, politically connected family. He will probably rebrand as some kind of born-again right winger on the Jesse Lee Peterson tip, and the American fascists, who never met a child-molesting cult leader that couldn't fool them, will forgive all his past sins. Trump's America is the environment he always not-so-secretly wished for. Augustus is a dirty chomo narcissist, though, and a drug addict, so it's just a matter of time before he gets caught up with the law again.",
