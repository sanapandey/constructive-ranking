A friend told me I was using the term wrong and that anarcho-socialists believe in no welfare, that the disabled (I myself am disabled) who cannot contribute to society should be shunned or ignored. That sounded wrong to me, one part of anarchism that always resonated with me was the compassion so I googled it and haven\u2019t been able to find anything saying either way. Naturally it\u2019s hard to find unbiased sources online so I figured I\u2019d ask here",

There's so much reproductive labour, care giving and affective/emotional labour and intellectual labour that everyone does. It's not like if you aren't able to contribute in food manifacturing of health care and other things that are exclusively considered as work in a capitalist society, then you aren't contributing in any way.\n\nAs said, from each according to their ability, to each according to their need. The whole idea is that the goal is that we are able to satisfy everyone's needs, and everyone will contribute in the ways that are possible for them. In the ideal society, according to Marx for exaple, there isn't \"work\" as we know it in the capitalist system. People want to contribute to the community, and things we consider as work are done not for compensation but to cultivate oneself and to help each other. Definitely tell your friend to familiarize themself with mutual aid as suggested.\n\nAnd about welfare, there's already \"welfare states\" (even though these structures have been taken apart very heavily for decades now) where there's social welfare systems and benefits for disabled people. So I find it very confusing why your friend would think that in a better society disabled people would be shunned. Makes no sense.\n\nETA: Also I don't think you can consider yourself an anarchist if you are such an ableist.",

Mutual aid is the foundation of anarchism. From each according to their ability, unto each according to their need and all.\n\n\nI wouldn't strictly classify anarchistic society as having welfare per se, but it would cover the same need with mutual aid. The distinction is that mutual aid is mutual, it's as much about building community and seeing others as your equal as it is about meeting needs. Welfare is impersonal and often treats people as lesser. Having welfare is better than living under capitalism without it, but I'd prefer a world where we don't pity people who can't do certain things, but rather accept that they make society better just by being themselves and thriving in it, and if they need a little extra help in some ways to do so, we're happy to lend a hand.\u00a0\n\n\nEveryone will need help at some point in their lives, it's foolish and selfish to think some people don't deserve it.",

Generally, theorists believe that welfare is a lesser evil in the context of capitalism, but that anarchist praxis should seek to make government social safety nets irrelevant. Historically, this has meant developing social safety nets independent of the state-machine/capitalist system. In the long term, stateless economics fuse social safety nets with social activity in general. People will fulfill their needs/wants in cooperation with others in their community. \n\nAgain, the specifics vary with some anarchists still favoring things like currency and others seeking their complete abolition.",

Anarcho-socialism is not a real term. The anarchist philosophical lineage was born from the socialist philosophical lineage. Anarchism is always socialist. Socialism is defined by workers owning and managing the means of production. Anarchism applies that egalitarian logic outside of the workplace and says that people should have a direct and equal choice in all the affairs of their own life and free from political and social domination as well as economic; autonomy and equal decision making in all aspects of life \n\nIt's true that there's no welfare systems in anarchism because it takes the state to have a welfare system. But I think for you, the goal isn't the welfare system so much as everyone being taken care of, especially the most vulnerable people. Assuming that to be true, then I think you should investigate anarcho-communism, which expands on anarchism by saying all resources and production should be owned and managed by all the people, not just workers. \n\nThis is also a system that arguably has been the most successful system in all of human existence as it is what every foraging society practices today,  and from seems to have been the dominant economic organization throughout the paleolithic, even before modern humans.  \n\nIt can also be said to be the only leftist ideology to ever achieve any type of socialism in more modern societies, unless you count dictatorships promising to hold power in the name of workers the same thing as socialism. Instead, I think The Paris Commune, Revolutionary Catalonia, and Revolutionary Ukraine, are examples of workers actually controlling the means of production, via the anarcho-communist movements.",
