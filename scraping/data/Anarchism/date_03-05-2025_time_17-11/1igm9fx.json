            "body": "Why did the space in Glasgow close? If it didn't survive in Glasgow, I personally worry about it surviving in NYC where things are endlessly more expensive and projects like this are more bound to fail. People have been struggling to even keep open a general anarchist or trans space in NYC, it seems like it'd be even harder for an even more niche project like this, especially when the Jewish community (even in NYC) is so internally divided over anti-Zionism.\n\nEven as a trans, queer anarchist with Jewish heritage, I'm sort of left asking \"who is this project for?\" Not trying to be a naysayer at all -- space is critically needed right now, I just think this isn't really addressing that need. And if its going to be a bilingual anti-Zionist space in a place like Brooklyn it seems like Yiddish and English aren't the only languages that should be centered -- it seems like Arabic and Spanish at the very least are pretty critical languages if this space is going to be a space that hopes to be any sort of staging ground for anti-Zionist or anti-fascist resistance.",

I went a few times and it was nice enough, but didn\u2019t feel particularly successful as a cafe. Never seemed to be open. \n\nSubsequently there was an awful lot of drama, I think they alienated quite a few people. I don\u2019t know the specifics but if you\u2019re interested the threads on r/Glasgow are worth reading.",

But I imagine the project can be for those who get active and involved, and for those who respect that work \u2014 being clear about the intentions and expectations can help reduce time- and energy-consuming conflicts later down the line.\n \nPossibly too niche though, I hope they find the right balance.\n \nIn their [closing statement](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/pink-peacock-closing-statement) from 2023 they say\n \n>the short answer is burnout. we\u2019ve all been volunteers this whole time, and like everyone we\u2019re struggling under capitalism and kyriarchy. most of us are disabled, and the ongoing pandemic is still hurting our collective physical and mental health. the constant battle to keep ourselves financially afloat didn\u2019t help.",
