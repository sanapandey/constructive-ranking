    "selftext": "Despair is just the long way to apathy.\n\nThat's one of the biggest tricks that centers of power use to silence dissent and stop any action against them: Deny that a problem exists until it's so obvious and so bad that nobody can ignore it, and then say there's nothing we can do at this point, so why bother? We've seen this happen with capitalism and the record-breaking difference between the rich and poor, we've seen it with climate change, and we've seen it with the loss of our privacy. Right now - especially in the US - it seems like there's more interest in internet privacy than there's been in a long time, but when people look into it and find out how far we are from being truly private, they get discouraged. We're being pulled in 2 different directions: \"We can't really do anything\" and \"We can't just do nothing.\"\n\nIf that's how you feel, you're not alone. But your privacy is definitely still worth taking back.\n\n#1. Surveillance isn't free.\n\nCorporations and governments have a lot of money, energy, and computing power to track people, but it's not infinite. The most intensive types of surveillance (the ones that involve dedicated experts, complex deanonymization techniques, and things like that) are mostly saved for high-level targets like terrorists and military agents. The basic level of surveillance they do on everyone is all passive: automatically logging information about you as you live your life.\n\nAnything you do to separate yourself from their trackers stops a little of that. Doing something as simple as switching your browser to a more private one, or disabling location or Google apps on your phone, or deleting apps you don't need and logging out of social media, means 1 less source of information about your life that can be tracked.\n\nAre more serious measures worth learning and doing? Absolutely, because privacy is freedom. The more dissenting, threatening to power, or targeted you are, the more private you need to be. But it's not all-or-nothing, and you can get better at it over time.\n\nEspecially because of the second reason:\n\n#2. Information goes out of date.\n\nIt's a common belief that once your information is out there, there's no use protecting it. But almost everything about you changes over time, so if someone stops being able to track you, eventually what they know about you will be less useful. Maybe you don't go to the same places or talk to the same people as you used to. Maybe your beliefs and opinions changed. Maybe you have a different job, a different computer or phone, a different bank account or card than you did before. For all they know, maybe you changed your name and moved out of the country. Each piece of information you keep someone from getting is information that might not be true anymore.\n\nOne big exception is your DNA, which is why everyone should stay away from things like 23andMe and Ancestry.\n\n#3. Privacy is a community effort.\n\nStaying private would be impossible if you were the only one doing it. If everyone is leaving their data out in the open and you're the only one keeping it secret, you'll stand out more than anyone else - but if everyone is securing their privacy, it's there for people who need it most. And secure messages, group chats, and file sharing are only secure if *everyone* keeps that information safe.\n\nPlus, privacy is only accessible because of open-source projects and the people who develop them, almost always for free, as well as those who learn privacy and security so they can help each other with it. Without that, only the best security experts could keep their data private.\n\nAnd in a worst-case scenario, if *everything* goes wrong and they catch you doing something that really pisses them off, there's nothing like people you can trust around you, who will have your back and not snitch on you, and will remember you and visit you in jail if it comes to that.\n\nThe ultimate point of surveillance is fear, because without fear it's hard to control someone.\n\nSo let's take our control back, little by little.",

If you're poor, you are so screwed if you fail at any of the above mentioned security culture precautions.\n\nI have soul crushing apathy and a death wish so it's hard for me to even care, but I am forcing myself to start caring for the sake of others.",

And yeah, security culture does need to be a lot more accessible to poor people, especially bc so much of it requires specific hardware or doesn't run well on old/low-end hardware, or has too much of a learning curve for people without spare time and energy.\n\nThank you for caring. I know it's hard these days",

People definitely chase that dragon though, especially if they're privileged with grandiose ideas vs poor and already living reality under the state's boot.\n\nI had the \"opportunity\" to learn opsec etc. during Occupy, but I decided the workshop was sus and looked too much like a trap since hackers were getting busted left and right with much scandal.",
