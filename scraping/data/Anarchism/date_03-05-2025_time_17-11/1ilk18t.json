If one\u2019s goal is to secure the rights of these groups, then ones best policy is to stick with modern civilization.\n\n>In the fourth place, the GA Movements adoption of many of the soft values of modern civilization, as well as its myth of a soft primitive utopia, attracts too many soft, dreamy, lazy, impractical people who are more inclined to retreat into utopian fantasies than to take effective, realistic action to get rid of the technoindustrial system.\n\n[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-letter-to-a-turkish-anarchist#toc16](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-letter-to-a-turkish-anarchist#toc16)",
