    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019d like to start a discussion about the use of the term *fascism* and whether it remains a useful category for analyzing contemporary political phenomena from an anarchist perspective.\n\nIn many political debates today, especially within antifascist circles, the term *fascism* is frequently used to describe authoritarian right-wing projects and figures such as Trump, Bolsonaro, or Elon Musk. However, I wonder if this usage is still analytically helpful or if, on the contrary, it oversimplifies the issue and prevents a deeper understanding.\n\n**Personally, I believe that antifascism as an ethical horizon will always be relevant.** However, labeling figures like Musk or Trump as \"fascist\" seems problematic to me. Even if they share authoritarian and reactionary elements, applying this label often turns them into mere *Hollywood villains*, making it easier for them to reject the accusation and weaken the critique. Additionally, this broad use of *fascism* may prevent us from identifying the specific characteristics of today\u2019s political and economic landscape, such as **corporate capitalism** or **techno-feudalism**.\n\nAuthors like **Murray Bookchin, Peter Gelderloos, and Noam Chomsky** have criticized the indiscriminate use of the term *fascism*, arguing that applying it to any contemporary form of authoritarianism can be misleading. Instead, they suggest analyzing power structures within capitalism, colonialism, and broader hierarchical systems. (**Edit: I originally made a mistake regarding Chomsky. In fact, he does use the term** ***fascism*** **quite broadly. Thanks to a response from DvD\\_Anarchist on this post, I can now clarify this.**)\n\nSome questions I\u2019d like to explore:\n\n* To what extent does *fascism*, in its historical sense (Mussolini, Hitler, etc.), remain a valid category for understanding today\u2019s authoritarianism?\n* Does the overuse of *fascism* reduce complex political phenomena to historical comparisons instead of analyzing them in their own context?\n* From an anarchist perspective, is it more useful to focus on power structures and hierarchy in general rather than labeling certain movements as \"fascist\"?\n* What do you think of the critiques from Bookchin, Gelderloos, and Chomsky on this topic? Are there other anarchist thinkers who address this issue?\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and any relevant bibliography on the subject. Thanks!",

It seems that there are competing factions within the Trump administration, on one hand there are the Christo-Fascists who seem hell bent on winding back civil rights and reimposing segregation, and the Techno Fascists / Feudalists of big tech.

Funny how you mention Noam Chomsky criticizing the indiscriminate use of the term, when I've seen he himself saying that corporations are basically fascist, to mean top-down authoritarian.\n\nAfter studying the different perspectives on what fascism is, I came up with the following definition: Fascism is a reactionary, right-wing ideology that is anti-democratic (in the broadest sense of the word, including representative/liberal democracy), anti-communist (against both state and libertarian socialism), nationalist with a victimizing and revitalizing discourse (MAGA in a nutshell), and views violent speech and actions as legitimate means in politics. \n\nConsider these four elements as a checklist for defining a movement or a person as fascist, because it is important to keep in mind is that it\u2019s not enough to take individual ideas or methods to define an organization or a person as fascist, since many ideas and actions are not exclusive to fascism. What matters is the big picture; examining the sum of ideas and actions is what will allow us to determine whether the fascist label fits or not.\n\n  \nMusk and Trump are undeniably fascist. You may have had reasonable doubts to call Trump a fascist in 2016, but not after January 6 and him controlling the Supreme Court and ruling the country as a dictator through executive orders, many illegal ones too, with total disregard to Congress.",

At least for Musk). These kind of people are not necessarily the same who might end up being fascist dictators themselves; they are the people who set up the groundwork that allows easy fascist takeover.\n\nThese are the von Papens and Hindenburgs, the Emmanuel IIIs, \u00d3scar Carmonas.\n\nBut yes, there's also of course pretty obvious differences from the sort of fascism Europe saw around WW2. Which can mean that fascism is a bit inaccurate term. The backgrounds tend to be different - historical fascist dictators were by large military officers, who utilized the dying traditions of monarchism for support. They weren't necessarily supportive of the wealthy (though often were allied with many oligarchs and the general bourgeoisie) or come from a wealthy background themselves.\n\nThe similarities are pretty striking tho. Nationalist ethos, militarism, conservatism, autocracy, naturalized social hierarchy, .. so yeah - that's fascism.\n\nWhen communicating these things, I think it can be a fair approach to not focus too much on the individual leaders, and rather focus on hierarchical systems like capitalism, or even centralized state apparatuses overall, having the tendency of spawning fascism. Trump or Putin or whatnot, those are the individual leaders, but it indeed is the underlying system that has allowed their raise to power.",

I don't know if he did the salute to be an edgy asshole; he could also have done it by accident. I cannot imagine any situation that - as bad as everythting has become - that an Nazi salute would be openly supported. Even people who we would call racist and right wing are hardly actually Nazis or even anti-Semetic.\n\nI do believe the actions of Elon and Trump are \"fascist-like\" just because they do support the fascist core of the Trump administration: anti-immigration policies, the extinction of the Palestinian people, regid social structures, denunciation of civil rights, and devotion to the state leader and (nominally) the state.\n\nRegardless, Trump, Elon, etc. are not fascist: they believe private power over state power, and they're not idologically fascists. I don't doubt elon and Trump are racist in various ways as Trump is damn near an 80 year old white man from the U.S., and Elon is a filthy rich, middle-aged white man from South Africa; of course they are racist in some way.\n\nThis is pedantic on my part as I know that when people reference fascism, they usually are not concerned about the role of ideology in its construction; they usually are concerned about the results of fascism, which current America is trending towards.\n\nI think we should acknowledge the reality that Trump is a dangerous human being; I'd argue he's the most dangerous individual due to his views on climate change. I don't know if he's racist because he really seems to be about himself, and I doubt he cares even about \"white Americans\" or any kind of ideology. It give him too much credit.\n\n  \nHowever, the term fascism comes with a lot of baggage, and I think its use as a catch all perjorative term for authoritarian goverment and racist does three things: it sometimes keeps us from working with people that we label \"Nazis\" because we have this conception of the barbaric nature of the Nazis and their supporters; it promotes the idea that the Republican party is actually fascist and isn't merely absurdly pro-business and anti-human opportunists; and it ignores how closely the Democrats - who I don't think any of us would call fascist - mimicked a lot of the fascist policies, as well, including shelling Gaza and promoting immigrants as taking our jobs.\n\n  \nMaybe I'm covering for fascists by saying all of this, and again, I believe it is pedantic in many ways. But I think we draw a hard line, call people \"fascists\" or \"fascist supporters\" and ignore that individuals have developed these thoughts outside of a strong ideological movements. I know a lot of common, working-class and middle -class Americans who believe immigrants are taking money out of our system, that America should come for, or are not as supportive of certain civil liberties for a host of reasons, usually due to issues in education.",

However, the continuation of the same trends as seen in the far right of Europe and South America is similiar enough that we can call it the same thing, in the same way that the UK, France, and Switzerland are all democracies but they express it very differently. \n\nIt is useful to know what is fascism in a pragmatic way. United fronts work, and - as seen in the recent French elections - sometimes it is more important to prevent Fascists from getting into power than it is to be principled and refuse to work with anyone else. It's important to know who we can work with or against. \n\nEco's essays on fascism are probably an excellent start. Understanding what people are on about is helpful too, so either the moustache man's angry screeching known as \"Mein Kampf\" or Evola's \"Revolt against the Modern World\" are probably good to read as well - in that they help us see the emotional and spiritual reasons why someone would become fascist.

Fascism begins with fostering nationalism and patriotism to a degree of fanaticism, where your loyalty to the state is the same as your loyalty to the land you live on. The USA has been fostering this brand of white supremacist ideology from its foundations. Those in power tie patriotism to God, they deify the flag and make it a moral imperative that if you don't like the government, you can't be in the USA or you're an enemy of the people. We are in the slow creep to it, fascism is a more open ideology than one would think.\n\n\nAlso, Bookchin is not an anarchist he is a libertarian municipalist and has documented his disagreements with anarchism and Marxism.

If you want to define it using its actual political theoretic definitions laid out by Mussolini, then people like FDR, Bernie, or Stalin are more fascist than Hitler was. Classical fascism was basically a program that declares humanity needs to shrug off class struggle and instead have classes come together under the banner of the state, and that an incredibly strong omnipotent state with all its citizens united under the banner of extreme nationalism will deliver the ultimate form of society. It's class collaboration committed via a state that takes on an almost spiritual characteristic. \n\nBut as you said, most people aren't using that definition of fascism. They're mostly just talking about conservative authoritarianism. I agree that it's reductive to call any right wing movement fascist. However in reality, it doesn't matter much how you label authoritarian right wing movements. Call out why exactly they are our enemies by highlighting their beliefs and actions. Using a thought terminating label by just declaring them fascist is insufficient.",
