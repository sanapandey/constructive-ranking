The flyer should contain a drop box email address.\n\nIf you get enough interest (this will depend heavily on the nature of your propaganda so if at first you fail... try try again) arrange the meeting in any available space. A pub is good. In the meeting put forward the idea of squatting a local premises( squatting is still legal in commercial property)  for the purpose of meetings and events. Cinema can be a good crowd puller (Manufacturing Consent is my fave film for this)\n\nAs your community grows you will pull in more people from further afield. Network with other anti capitalist spaces everywhere.\n\nAll power to you :)\n\n[https://network23.org/ass/](https://network23.org/ass/)",
