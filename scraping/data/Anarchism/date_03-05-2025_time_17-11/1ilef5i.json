I\u2019m looking to organize and see what I can do to help the people in my city who are struggling. I also want to have actual meaningful events and rally\u2019s-not just some weak protest that consists of chanting and playing drums outside of a building for a protest that they organized with the police to make sure it was \u201cok to protest\u201d. I don\u2019t fuck with the police and don\u2019t want to work alongside them in any sort of capacity.",
