            "body": "Kodachi Linux is better than Tails as it comes with a VPN and all the tools Tails does. The Tor Browser is always based on an older version of Firefox. Many times its for a version of Firefox that has security holes that were fixed by newer versions. For this reason its been exploited by feds and other attackers. Personally I choose to harden Firefox, and configure tor manually and ensure the EXIT nodes are set to a country that won't send logs. There are many things to take your security even further, but you aren't going to learn how to be invisible online from one short tik tok video or 5 slides like this. This doesn't even address what to do in a surveillance state that blocks tor where you have to configure bridges to even get it to work. This will help you to access things like pornhub or tik tok from the US, but I would not follow these steps and expect to evade three letter agencies online. At the bare minimum I'd suggest Kodachi Linux to get an extra level of protection. Stay safe comrades.",

For many reasons. Talking about stuff with your own face and name can be more credible. Especially when it's about more local affairs. It can also be a good thing that mildly sus stuff goes back and forth the more public internet; it creates more data to go through to find the things that actually are of high interest. And if anything that could be suspicious to some intelligence agency is cleaned out from the public net, that can also reinforce the status of those things as indeed suspicious. And your searches you do and the sites you visit can increase their visibility. If the search or discussion isn't outright connected to very criminal activity - like searching how to DIY bombs or discussing the details of industrial sabotage action - it's IMO quite fine, in the average country, to do it in the more open Internet.",

Everything else - especially research and private messages - should be as private and anonymous as possible, even if it's not illegal or suspicious.

People were still saying things like \"I'm not a criminal, I have nothing to hide.\" It's different now, after there have been multiple high-profile data leaks and companies caught selling data, trust in the cops is lower than it's been in a long time, the US lagging farther and farther behind the EU in privacy rights, etc. People care a lot more now, that's why subs like r/privacy are so active.

There's also an argument to be made that governments also benefit from having Tor be anonymous and secure, so they're not going after small fries. People usually get caught on Tor because they make a mistake and post some personal information or use shared usernames across the clear web and dark web or leave Javascript enabled and visit an onion website that is malicious and deanonymizes them through their own computer, or download a file that can deanonymize them.\n\nIt's still much more secure to use Tor, if you're cautious and taking steps to protect yourself, than using the clear web.",

The exact method people use depends on context and it\u2019s a pain in the ass no matter what.\n\nTOR is definitely better but it\u2019s certainly not fail proof. Part of that is the metadata, there was a good post recently about this. Many hackers have been caught because the metadata between clear net and TOR activity was put in a graph and used as evidence of the end user\u2019s identity. A university student trying to send a bomb threat was found because he was the only user on the university network accessing TOR at the time of the threat being sent.",

So no, no back doors, even if it was designed with one, which it wasn\u2019t.\n\nTOR probably isn\u2019t bulletproof, but in combination with TailsOS (a portable (on a usb stick) OS that wipes itself after each use, also managed by TOR project) it\u2019ll be magnitudes more bulletproof than the vast majority of other setups, bar a few people using really niche software no one has heard of (which also hasn\u2019t been put to the test unlike TOR)\n\nTOR probably has unknown (to the public) vulnerabilities being stashed by governments, as does every other popular software worth making vulnerabilities for. These won\u2019t be used on nobodies or for general surveillance, because once it\u2019s used it\u2019ll get patched, and it\u2019s hard to find more.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason criminals, journalists, activists, and civilians of all varieties have been using TOR for, what, decades, with very very few being caught thanks to TOR. It works. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you should be using tor for everything, you probably don\u2019t need it. If you think you need it, use it, it\u2019s free!!! But it\u2019s still not good to scare people who may actually need it away from using it, there\u2019s only like one serious alternative I know about and the theoretical benefits don\u2019t make up for lack of adoption and support.\n\nWall of text",

The ISP sees you made a call to a Tor node, but the ISP can not decrypt the metadata of your call, and wouldn't know what the end destination was.

                                    "body": "Firstly, receiving packets from TOR nodes isn\u2019t a breach of anonymity or security, since the data is encrypted and anonymized, and thus unusable by the ISP. The ISP seeing you receive encrypted packets from a VPN is just as useless as seeing you receive them from a TOR node. \n\nIf simply connecting to a TOR node was a problem (or if they were blocked by your ISP), tor project provides various bridges so you don\u2019t have to connect to nodes directly. The Snowflake bridges, for example, send encrypted information through a volunteers computer which is then passed onto TOR. Hosting a snowflake node is easy, tor project provides an add on you can simply install in your browser. \n\nSecondly, if you use a VPN, you\u2019re simply shifting that potential problem from the ISP to your VPN. Instead of your ISP seeing packets, the VPN provider sees packets. Many VPNs are less trustworthy than your ISP. Many, if not most VPNs keep logs.\n\nBasically using a VPN introduces another third party, another attack vector, another middleman. And most VPNs aren\u2019t respectful of privacy or anonymity. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not recommended by the tor project.\n\nTheoretically, a privacy and anonymity respecting no logs VPN could marginally improve security. The only case I can imagine where it would make a difference is if 1: TOR was somehow deanonymized and decrypted, which is unlikely and would defeat TORs entire reason for existing and 2: you had a VPN which kept no logs and couldn\u2019t be attached to you, of which there are very few.\n\nThe statement could be modified to \u201cNo, using tor with a vpn is not recommended, unless you really know what you\u2019re doing, in which case there could hypothetically be marginal improvements\u201d. But that\u2019s a long statement and could confuse a user, perhaps intimidating them from using TOR in the first place, even though a VPN is totally unnecessary if not detrimental.\n\nThe simpler answer which is realistically just as good is \u201cno, using tor with a vpn is not recommended\u201d.",

My isp is starlink which i dont trust but can't be helped because I'm in a rural area. The alternatives are overpriced and garbage. Ur absolutely correct that you can't use just any vpn, which is why I got Nord",
