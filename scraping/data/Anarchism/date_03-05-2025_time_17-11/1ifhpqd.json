Obviously these should only be used for private, personal, and completely legal purposes. It would devastate me to find out people started using these for graffiti or other illegal activities. And definitely don't print a lot of these and leave them in bookstores, record shops, etc, where anyone could grab them for free and use them for nefarious purposes.   \n\n\nFirst one is here (\"Keep ICE Out of Chicago\") - but keep an eye out for more!
