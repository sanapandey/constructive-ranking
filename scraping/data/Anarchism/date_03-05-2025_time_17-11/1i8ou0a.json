            "body": "Saw a post this morning on here that was talking about free and open source software, and it made me recall discussions and thoughts I have had about the other side: affordable, accessible, and open source hardware.\n\nOn one hand I really respect the primitivist argument, most of the technology we have today serves to make the already easy slightly more convenient at huge environmental and social cost. Toward this end I believe we should be rolling back much of our technology (HVAC and gas powered personal vehicles come to mind) in favor of low power, more efficient alternatives (good building design and public transit would be the substitutes for the above, and there are many more). However, primitivism also does away with uses of high-tech that could be used to connect self-organized communities across long distances, organize libraries, and conduct scientific research.\n\nWhen I talk about high-tech I mean microchips/processors, anything that involves nanometer scale manufacturing, as well as any kind of material that requires a supply chain that is not generally available in a single geographic area. For example I consider latex rubber, steel, some plastics, glass, basic electric/natural gas motors, some batteries, and some concretes to be low tech while I consider computer hardware, advanced polymers like tire rubber, most 3d printer filaments, rare earth containing metal alloys, and synthetic textiles to be high tech. \n\nIn a decentralized world where communities are self sufficient for those living in them and can produce or acquire low-tech relatively easily, is it reasonable to still produce some of these high tech materials? How can this be achieved in absence of exploitative supply chains? Obviously everything that can be designed to be repaired should, but how should those standards be maintained? How can infrastructure (eg fiber optic networks, power sharing) be maintained? Specifically, (how) should computer hardware be manufactured and distributed, specifically relating to the difficulty of production (photolithography, doping etc), realizing that the access to necessary materials requires access to the global commons?\n\nAlso, as a biochemist, I see biology and synthetic biology as a decentralizing force that can allow all kinds of materials and products to be easily and sustainably produced locally, but the technology and basic understanding of biochemical processes necessary for lots of these applications are far off enough to where decades of science still needs to be performed, much of it relying on computational resources. I think that transitioning to biochemical systems for the production and maintenance of materials and systems represents a transition to a more sustainable mode of high-tech that will greatly reduce our reliance on other things like rare-earth metals, but depends on our ability to actually make it to that point scientifically, which given the effects of climate change will be difficult, and the burden of that research falls both on researchers that survive and people that take it upon themselves to archive and distribute that knowledge. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated, all power to all the people!",
