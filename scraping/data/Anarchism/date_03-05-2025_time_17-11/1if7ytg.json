Or if there's a boycott, is it better to keep things on the shelves so their products rot and business is stagnant?\n\nFor example, if I steal a Unilever product from Carrefour, wouldn't that mean that Carrefour has to pay Unilever anyway?\n\nOr does it not matter because either way, it's causing these monopolies economic damage and that's how we make change in the first place?",

You won't damage the corporations in question by nicking some TP, cosmetics, sodas or other random shit, but it will hurt those who don't give a fuck about supplying products manufactured by slaves which they gladly sell for grossly inflated prices.

They just raise prices to cover the loss.\n\nB) You are then forcing other victims of corporate greed to pay for the stuff you stole. \n\nC) It helps them perpetrate the myth that the left just wants something for nothing. \n\nD) It gives them the opportunity to attempt to marginalize your life even more. Sometimes, I think that that is more valuable to them than the profit they would have made off of those things you stole. Big corporations and the billionaires seem to make most of their money off of being able to exploit people. The more exploitable people there are then the better off the corporations and billionaires are. If they can get as many people as possible who can't get a decent job, because of criminal records, I think that makes them very very happy. Because then they can force everyone to work for minimum wage. \n\nE) Then, there is the fact that it could fuck up your life. \n\n\nI think that a far better way to hurt these corporations is to simply never do business with them. Never even walk into their stores at all. And convince everyone that you can to never go into the stores either. Buy everything second hand. Get everything from thrift stores.",
