Smoking a cigarette isn\u2019t just about smoking a cigarette, it\u2019s about having a reason to go have a look outside. Pie your corners.\r\n Speaking of corners, there\u2019s a lot that can be accomplished with the blind corner, especially if you have the correct tools, and a little patience. Fire deletes almost everything. It isn\u2019t about winning, it\u2019s about exhausting. Sabotage and evade. \r\nRunning away is not running away. It\u2019s going to ground. \r\nBuild your own gadgets. Learn. Use libraries and Libby app.\r\nDon\u2019t wrap your ego up in it. That\u2019s their job. It\u2019s why they lose.\r\nTake pride in nothing.\r\nDon\u2019t promote yourself, frame them. If they are what they are, mark them as what they are, but don\u2019t be obvious about it. Become comfortable with bureaucracy. Become comfortable with making friends.\r\nYou are charming. You are unassuming.\r\nYou have excellent cardiac fitness.\r\n Be a vibe.\r\n Be sincere.\r\nBe on time unless that\u2019s where they expect you to be.\r\nTrust that you\u2019re not alone, even if you can\u2019t see your allies.\r\nTake low-hanging fruit and leave.\r\nDon\u2019t look back.\r\nYour life will be easier if the people you don\u2019t like prefer you to the other guy.\r\nThey have deep pockets, but they\u2019re not infinite.\r\nForce them to spend money while spending as little money as possible.\r\nBeatings only hurt if you\u2019re afraid.\r\nIf it costs you very little but means the world to someone else, you should do it.\r\nDo not linger over the scene of your success.\r\nYou will succeed.\r\nAnd you will never be known. And you will never be thanked.\r\n",
