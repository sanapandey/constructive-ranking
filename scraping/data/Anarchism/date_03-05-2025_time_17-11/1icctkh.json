    "selftext": "TLDR:\n\n1. Never turn off your phone \u2013 A sudden absence of metadata (like turning off your phone) can be more suspicious than maintaining normal activity.\n\n\n2. Stick to your usual patterns \u2013 If you're doing something sensitive, make sure your metadata (like app usage, location, and routines) looks the same as any other day.\n\n\n3. Be aware of your networks \u2013 Your connections (social media, WiFi, shared files, etc.) can be used to map your affiliations, so limit unnecessary digital ties.\n\n\n4. Keep adapting \u2013 As surveillance technology evolves (e.g., facial recognition, license plate tracking), security strategies need to change too\u2014stay informed and flexible.\n\n\n\n",

But that's rarely worth doing in practice, bc 1. there's a lot more people than just anarchists/activists who take privacy seriously these days, and 2. it means you have a lot more things to keep track of (don't say certain things around your microphone etc.) and more chances to make a mistake.\n\nPlus some malware can be stopped by turning your phone off",

Then go out and do whatever it is you're going to do. No phone on you. Now all you have to worry about is showing up on the thousands of cameras that are out there. You'll have to wear clothes you ordinarily don't wear. A scarf to cover your face. Or a COVID mask. It's become more acceptable to wear those now.\n\nWhen you finish doing what you've done, cut up the clothes you wore during the commission of the crime using scissors (don't do this at home). Throw the clothes and the scissors out in different garbage cans across a wide area.\n\nIf you leave for work and get home from work at the same time every day and you go on your phone at night and there's no activity on your phone during the night because you're asleep, but on the day the crime was committed, you didn't go to work, your cell phone pinged off different towers than usual and your phone was turned off for 3 or 4 hours at night, that right there will throw you under suspicion.",

I doubt surveillance agencies even have this metadata and people mapped this precisely (mapping on everyone, who their friends/coworkers are, their routines etc) to be able to search \"anarchists in location x who turned their phone off at y o clock\", and if they do it wouldn't be wasted (revealed) on busting some dudes that burned down some nazis home.\u00a0",
