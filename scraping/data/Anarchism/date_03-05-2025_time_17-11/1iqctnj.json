If you do not fight now, you will have to fight later, when he has accumulated more power and you are in a weaker position.",

You can't evade, fight, or endure hardship without physical fitness. It is easier to cultivate mental fitness while cultivating physical fitness.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you're a really good at chemistry or work as a nurse, maybe you need to be manufacturing miso cards for distribution in states where abortion is outlawed. Maybe you can make cheap epi pens for people.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you're a prep cook, learn how how to cook on a campfire. Learn any skill you have and how to do it with shitty or improvised resources. Learn how to preserve food, plant a food garden. Make friends with someone who owns chickens and help them with their farm projects. Learn how to trap rats.\n\n\nMake friends with people who have other skills and resources.\u00a0\n\n\nTake advantage of free trainings, or cheap trainings from the government even. The CERT program focuses on community disaster relief and can connect you with skilled people in your community. They may not be anarchists, they may very well be authoritarians. Learn to blend and it won't matter. You'll still learn shit, you might even win some hearts and minds.\n\n\n\u00a0Hunters ed programs can teach you about guns and wildlife for cheap. Stop the bleed course can teach you how to control massive bleeding. Take a swimming lesson if you can't swim, take some mma classes. Take a short welding or mechanics course at community college if you have the time and money.\u00a0\n\n\nGet your toes wet with a lot of stuff, and really dig into a couple things that you click with. The more people you meet, the easier it is to find the right people.\n\n\nRead widely on the subject of guerilla warfare and authoritarian psychology.\n\n\nIf you can handle doing soldier shit, I recommend digging a lot of big holes. Soldiering is mostly about digging, and it's good exercise.\u00a0",

But to paraphrase Fred Hampton, we don't think it's best to fight fire with fire.   We think it's best to fight fire with water.   And we're not going to fight reactionary pigs with reactionary politicians.  We're going to fight them with a proletariat revolution.",

However all evidence is pointing to the fact that Trump rigged 2024. America did vote, but the orange turd refused -  yet again - to be flushed.",
