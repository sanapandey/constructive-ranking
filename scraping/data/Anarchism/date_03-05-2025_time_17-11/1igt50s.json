    "selftext": "This is something I've been mulling over since the 2024 US Election. For years, the far-right has been backed by massive think-tanks like Prager University and the Daily Wire, spewing propaganda and fear that has shaped the narratives of the political right, often putting trans people square in the crosshairs alongside \"Illegals\" as an easy outgroup to represent the \"degeneration\" of society.\n\n  \nThe Right has formed a cult of personality around Trump, swallowing wholesale the red scare propaganda over the \"Communist\" Democrats, all while the Democrats gleefully skip behind them, trying to imitate them and pleasing absolutely no one. I only advocate for participating in Capitalist Democracy to keep the worst reactionaries out of power, as it's foolish to think the Democrats will stand up for anyone but the Capitalist class.\n\n\n\nBut as we've seen, when the Democrats fail to commit to standing up for human rights, giving wishy-washy none-answers like \"I'll follow the law\", people stay home. And when people stay home, the MAGA cult flocks out in droves to make their [idolatrine](https://genius.com/Ghost-idolatrine-lyrics) the law of the land, further erasing human rights and enforcing Christian Nationalist brand Fascism.\n\n  \nThis brings me to my point about Anarchism. The simple truth of the matter is that we need more propaganda, more art, more literature, to drag this world kicking and screaming toward a better future. Already, mega entertainment corps like Disney are erasing overt trans representation in media to please their bigoted shareholders, walking back on the bare minimum token representation they already had.\n\n  \nWe cannot let the far-right [control the conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaPgDQkmqqM) any more than they already have. We've seen what happens when our so-called leaders refuse to offer any sufficient counter to these narratives, stuck in an endless loop of [we go low, you go high.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAbab8aP4_A) We are watching in real time as the right uses culture war narratives to justify human rights atrocities, and since the Democrats are too preocupied with \"Playing by the rules\" (no matter how much the other side stacks the deck), we need to cut through the bullshit with our own propaganda, in conjunction with direct community-based action, to protect the lives of LGBTQ+ people and other targeted minorities.\n\n  \nEvery piece of art we make helps to further cement our place in culture, even when the state tries to censor us. Society is nothing without the individual actions of people collectively working to protect the persecuted. So even if all you can do is pick up a pencil or type in a word document, we need you to do it, and we need to bolster those who do just as much as those directly acting to protect the most vulnerable amongst us.\n\n  \nTicking a box once every four years won't save us. It's not useless, but it's just one small part of a much grander effort to fight back against the far-right's culture war. Make your voice loud and clear to rise above the loud bigots: If you are threatened by Fasicsts, you are safe with us!",

There's no ecocidal billionaires that'll ever give us money or airtime. Our art will always have limited appeal to those defending the status quo. \n\nI'm not interested in anyone's opinion on voting but it's not our job to make sure democrats (or anyone else) gets elected. The dems didn't lose because a relatively low number of left-wing folks stayed home. They lost all on their own. A campaign without a message filled with unforced errors.\n\nIf we want to convince people of our ideals we need to do so on the power of those ideals. The strength of anarchism lies in that we practice what we preach. One of best tools of propaganda is that we organize by the principles we believe in *and this works.* \n\nIf you want to reach people you need to be visibly doing tangible things. This *can* absolutely be art and propaganda. It *can* include joining protests that are too liberal for your tastes. It can be direct action, distributing food, teaching people about op-sec.\n\nThe anarchist group I'm most involved with has (if we're optimistic) 7 people. Our reach and organizational capability is larger than that number would imply because *we get shit done*. We grow. It's slower than we'd want but we grow because people trust us to get shit done. And when you're seen getting shit done people remember.\n\n(This in no way devalues actions that are for whatver reason less visible)",

We need to convince people, especially Democrat leaning liberals imo, that a better future is possible and the government isn't going to save us from this mess. I see a lot of Democrats wanting to protest and organize but not knowing how. I think a lot of people would be willing to take even more direct action but they don't know how and don't have a push to do so. We need to counteract the doomerism that liberals and leftists are wallowing in right now and let them know what we can all do instead.",

Aron Ra, renown youtube anti-creationist, has repeatedly expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the Democrats, rightly acknowledging that they are centre-right at best.

Because humans learn the most through powerful stories that both entertain and make you think deeply. \n\nThe last four years we've been putting expressly leftist work out into the public consciousness. But it's hard to compete against billionaires when you have a $0 marketing budget. But we keep doing it because it's important, like you said.",
