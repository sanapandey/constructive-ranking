So maybe it's pedantic, but I'll insist that insurrectionalist anarchism emerged as a critique of syndicalist methods in favor of the anti-organizational spirit that characterized the early anarchist communists, that the green anarchists' insights are most needed in the city, that individualistic self-assertion is least necessary when you catch us alone, etc. \u2014 in short, I'm afraid that relegating our anarchisms to where they're least antagonistic may just render them powerless.",

The implication is that, if we understand anarchism itself as an array of different proposals arising in different conditions, we will be able to grasp it as an entire ecosystem of thinking and action, rather than an abstract ideology to be imposed on a complex and uncooperative world.",

If you\u2019ve got an actual point, by all means be contrarian, but otherwise that\u2019s the sort of thing that destroys even the healthiest solidarity and community. Hopefully we can intellectually mature from the \u201cquestion everything\u201d motto of the past to more of a \u201cresearch, examine and reflect on everything\u201d approach now that we have done decades of questioning everything and now have a lot more knowledge to draw upon.",

Meet with neighbors and talk about energy reduction and saving money on energy bills, then about gardening to save money vs factory farmed shit. Discuss wage stagnation and inflation. Talk about illness and pollution. Let them come to it on their own terms.",

So much of what politics *is* at its core is about learning, doing teaching, collaborating, nurturing, and building rather than the Hollywood image which affirms a more authoritarian idea of what it means to change one's/others' circumstances. Political activity must not lose its moral and practical foundations.",
