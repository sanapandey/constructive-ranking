Pilfering long forgotten magick systems from various religions they formed their own magick system from the ground up. This group consisted of many highly intelligent people such as William Buttler Yeats (one of my favorite poets, who\u2019s poem \u201c[The Second Coming](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming)\u201d should be studied by all anarchists.)\n\nOne of their members, Israel Regardi,  published [a book containing all their rituals](https://www.abebooks.com/9780875426631/Golden-Dawn-Original-Account-Teachings-0875426638/plp), and [you can find hundreds of sources explaining how to do them online](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oyao3JZ-Iv0). Ritual Magick can\u2019t grant you the power to shoot lighting from your fingers, or counter-act any physically or socially deterministic forces for that matter, but it can invoke profound psychological & spiritual transformation, and nudge your reality in your favor. (\u201cMaking the improbable possible\u201d as one magician described it) I have experienced empirical evidence of the existence of spirits in my personal life, and so it seems perfectly rational to me to summon and interact with benevolent entities through ritual practice. What I\u2019m saying is, if you go into magick with realistic expectations, you will see results. It\u2019s about being aware if the spiritual energy/forces around you, and using your imagination to direct, and interact with them. Like what a priest does during Catholic Mass, but you\u2019re doing it for yourself: eliminating that *hierarchical* intermediary between yourself and Divinity.\n\nI was introduced to both magick and anarchism by genius comic book writer Alan Moore, and considering both seek the complete liberation of humanity, it makes sense to pair them together.\n\nFeel free to visit r/GoldenDawnMagicians if you want to learn more.",
