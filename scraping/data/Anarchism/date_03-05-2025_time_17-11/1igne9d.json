The feds want you innactive in general, which allows them to sweep any underground activity because theyve removed the first layer.\n\n  \nThe first cop is the protest marshal.",

It's cute that they have so much confidence that there will be more elections. The last thing they want is people power posing a serious challenge to the Trump regime because collective power is hard for them to control and channel and could easily target capitalists and billionaires. \n\nThat's why at this moment the GOP actually has more people power in the sense of being able to mobilize large numbers of their supporters and stand behind groups like the Proud Boys to exert effective political pressure, but there's no equivalent to that on the liberal side. Liberals hate and snitch on antifa at every opportunity.",

Here it is again with slight changes.\u00a0\n\n\nNobody actually thinks like this except like the upper leadership of the Democratic party. Most liberal people don't feel like they have the time to put in resistance, which I know sounds absurd, and it is, but that is how they feel. Most people who support the Democratic party and the liberalism in general are not doing so out of a deliberate ideological commitment to liberalism, they just don't know how political resistance works and don't want to disrupt their own lives too much. It's infuriating, but most people involved here are not acting out of malice.",

Thanks for responding in good faith, and I apologize if I seemed confrontational award pedantic. I just run into a tendency in leftist spaces to dismiss the average person as incapable of being leftist, and people often signal that by calling all Americans\u00a0liberals. I hope both of us can find ways to resist and help the people we love.",

Where I live, when major demonstrations are arranged, it's usually pretty organized - get speakers, notify the local organizations in different areas, ask them to participate, gather a participant list of organizations that are OK with being publicly associated with it, etc.\n\nThis is done not necessarily because it was somehow legit or because it otherwise can't be done without such organization, but simply because it indeed makes people take it as more credible; that's important, when you want a bunch of people who are strangers to each other to gather to the same place at the same time.\n\nOn a quick googling - something anyone criticizing this should also do - it seems to me that there are local organizers involved, who have been reached and talked to by news medias, and there's some other longer-established movements that have taken this up positively. That's good enough for me and what I generally think is a good way for initiatives coming from the grassroots to build up.\n\nWhat I initially thought your post suggested was that that there were people speaking against participating in protests etc altogether, like that activists should only be underground or something.",

Maybe they mass arrest us by the hundreds of thousands. Maybe they use it as a way to find us so they can keep a closer eye on us. Technically any of that is possible. So does that mean we don't do anything? We lay down, roll over, and show our bellies? Fuck that. If we don't fight this shit half of us are gonna die anyway.
