    "selftext": "Hi comrades!\n\nI dont know if it is been written before, but I was not able to find it up. So I will start doing (little by little) a list of free media around the world. Keep posting on it comrades! Maybe someone of us can think that a media is \u201cfree\u201d but other comrade can have info against this assert. So lets keep calm, lets discuss with serenity and construct this list toghether. But first of all lets discuss what is a \u201cFree Media\u201d. Here my suggestions:\n\nWith free media I mean:\n\nA must:\n\n1.- Are not accepting money directly from a bank, think tanks, political parties or capitalist groups (insurances, weapon industry,\u2026). A big income must be by suscription or ethical advertisements.\n\n2.- Can be public or private but not accepting interference of politicians. Can accept goverment advertising but without being the main income.\n\n3.- Journalists inside can be working full-time, part-time or freelancing. They must receive a decent salary far from the Interprofessional Minimum Wage and that allows them to live where they live in a dignified and self-sufficient manner.\n\n4.- They correct mistakes they have made publicly.\n\n5.- THEY SUPPORT FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND INFORMATION AND THEY WILL HELP EVEN TO THEIR COMPETENCE IN SUCH PROBLEMS.\n\n6.- Support and accepting material from local journalist or freelances on the ground. Paying them well for that (Video, Photo and Writers).\n\n7.- Once per year (minimun) they show their incomes and also salaries of the workers (but not the names for privacy). They dont especulate with their money.\n\n8.- Not using  \u201cclickbait\u201d titles and subtitles. \n\nA desirable:\n\n1.- Using free software or at least MIT license for their webpage or blog. \n2.- Not using fascists social networks like Meta, X, Google.\n3.- Not selling information of the suscribers to any third party business.\n4.- Using Creative Commons licenses.\n\nI know that is difficult right now to have all the criterias ticked but let\u00b4s mark the most \u201cfree media\u201d collaborating in this subreddit. Fo example: XXXXX media has 6,3 (means that they have 6 big ticks and 3 little ticks).\n\nPLEASE HELP PEOPLE KNOWING FROM WHERE THEY ARE INFORMING.\n\nOsasuna eta anarkia. \n",

            "body": "For investigative journalism, [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/). They're an independent, nonprofit newsroom.\n\nMission\n\n>*To expose abuses of power and betrayals of the public trust by government, business, and other institutions, using the moral force of investigative journalism to spur reform through the sustained spotlighting of wrongdoing.*\n\n**1. Income sources.**\n\nPass.\n\nTheir primary income is through donations and their site does have ads not managed by them, however, each are specifically independent of their journalistic content.\n\n**2. No political influences**.\n\nPass.\n\n**3. Journalist wages**.\n\nPass.\n\nI only did a quick evaluation of glass door info, however, it's not always easy to determine employees' wages and if they're sufficient enough for their various regions' costs of living. That's not to mention that \"dignified self-sufficiency\" is subjective. I think this criteria needs to be rethought or removed.\n\n**4. They correct mistakes they have made publicly.**\n\nUnconfirmed but I assume they do.\n\n**5. Freedom of speech**.\n\nPass I think.\n\nI'm not sure what you meant here Like, they're not *anti* free speech and they definitely support their rights to free speech and press with their journalism directed at those in power.\n\n**6. Support for local journalism or freelancers.**\n\nPass mostly.\n\nThey have their Local Reporting Network which says, \"ProPublica is supporting local and regional newsrooms as they work on important investigative projects affecting their communities.\"\n\n**7.- Income transparency.**\n\nPass mostly.\n\nThey release various financial reports publicly that are especially useful for donors and other to see how their money is spent. They do not publish journalists' individual wages.\n\n**8. No clickbait**.\n\nPass.\n\nEdit - sorry, posted too early, Finishing here.\n\n**B1. Uses free software or MIT license on website.**\n\nUnconfirmed.\n\nI don't think this matters. The most open, honest, and well-intentioned of news media organization might still pay somebody to build a proprietary website that won't necessarily have any license like what you're thinking, and even if they use FOSS along the way, it's hard for people to know where they did aside from some surface-level stuff.\n\n**B2. Not using fascist social networks.**\n\nUnsure.\n\nI'm sure they have social media accounts like many news media orgs. They might post stories there, not sure.\n\n**B3. Not selling user's info.**\n\nUnsure.\n\n**B4. Creative commons license usage.**\n\nPass.\n\nEDIT AGAIN - Sorry this got long but some of my answers seemed like they deserved more than pass/no-pass.",

I haven't had any access issues as a free subscriber, but there is a paid tier that removes ads and allows \"unlimited access\" which feels vague. But overall I find their reporting is solid and not clickbait-y.",

It's basically fine if you're already comfortable with consuming media critically and they do still do actual investigative journalism that attacks the status quo, e.g. their involvement in the Panama Papers.",
