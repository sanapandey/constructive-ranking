    "selftext": "I saw \"just be tougher\" over and over again in the comments. I got one question for the people who say stuff like that though, why can't you just be better instead? Isn't that the entire point of anarchism?\n\nand if language doesn't matter, why do you not constantly call people racial and transphobic slurs? I am trans and the same people who don't call me \"tranny\" do call me dumb. They say language doesn't matter for the second, but they have gotten good at not calling me the first. Does language only not matter when you personally think it doesn't matter?\n\nOr are yall actually just defending calling fascists any slur in the book? There are quite a lot of you so I think I need a post to collect opinions\n\nto bring one of my replies up here:\n\ninsane asylums are prisons built to punish people for the crime of being neurodivergent\n\nisn't using the language and logic of prisons to describe things, including fascists, itself policing? If you don't think we should be policing people, then shouldn't we be making sure we don't police people?\n\nedit 2:\n\n\"I will side with the people using slurs not the people they are used against\" isn't very anarchist\n\nAlso reminder, \"imminent threats\" attack us in many ways, and language fundementally impacts how we organize. If you are saying the fascists are harmful because they are like us, and then attack us both, you are the *imminent threat* to me, just as much as the fascist is, you are just fascists infighting. \n\nIn fact it is probably worse because you are closer. I would rather have a fascist at a distance than one in my face. \n\n\nedit 3:\n\nYall seem to have missed the fact that calling fascists \"stupid\" is victim blaming. If you are blaming us for fascism, the same thing fascists do, it is not a trivial \"imperfection\", it is us not having an anarchist community at all.\n\n\nedit 4:\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m going to use the R word to bully people who I think deserve it until the end of time. Is what it is! And truthfully, to communicate with the most ignorant among us, we do need to use their language. The more we impose these language rules on people the less they will want anything to do with dismantling hierarchies.\"\n\na comment here, which really means: \"I have no interest in removing hierarchy, I simply believe the wrong people have it and either you can help me gain it myself or leave my space. This is the type of \"anarchist\" you see all over these spaces\n\nHere is a link to spaces I run where the goal is removing hierarchy: https://linkstack.lgbt/@RosethornRanger\n\n",

There are people who have intellectual impairment caused by brain malformation or malfunction. There are people who lack the spark of curiosity that leads us to learn whatever we can about whatever is put in front of us. And that third group of people, we don't have a great word for them in English except STUPID. They're not \"dull,\" and they're not \"retarded.\" They are not \"uneducated.\" We all know uneducated or intellectually disabled people who yet possess curiosity\n. \nWe need a word to describe those people because they're fucking dangerous.

You *are* saying their lack of intellect is the reason they are saying/doing/whatever the thing you are criticising them for. The whole point of my questions is, let's assume that accusation is correct, what is the knock-on consequence for your argument? I have seen the consequence be a conclusion that making bad choices due to low intelligence means people deserve suffering, even if it isn't phrased that way, and I'm not happy with that position. \n\nIf you're using these words to describe an action or viewpoint, I think we're then in the territory you're describing. I'm not sure where I sit on that, I can see both sides of the argument. I'm certainly not immune from doing it out of learned habit. I also think it's good that some spaces take a position against it regardless of whether the terms are directed at people or ideas, because it reminds us of the history of those terms as slurs and forces us to remain critically engaged with the question of how we use them.",

Now you're here adding edits where you write really simplified and bad-faith versions of people's points. Do you really think that's how you get people to reflect on their language?\n\nI'd get it if you were just tired of having to constantly educate people, but the purpose of your first post seemed to BE to educate. So when people have questions or share their own views, why are you being so hostile?\n\nI'm also disabled. I agree that we need to pay attention to the way we use language. I also agree with other commenters who are saying that language changes over time, and some words just don't mean the same things they did before. However, English is also not my first language so I won't claim to be an authority on the words you discussed in specific.\n\nThere's also the issue of reclamation. I know plenty of disabled people who use the word cr*pple about themselves for example (only sensoring to avoid automod fuckery). Should they be told to cut it out too? \n\nI refer to myself using queer slurs. I find power in taking them for myself. I wouldn't ever call another queer person those things unless I knew they were fine with it, but some people also think I'm wrong for reclaiming slurs for my own usage. \n\nYou're speaking about an important issue, but your edits and responses lack nuance.",

            "body": "I think there are a few aspects to this. \n\nFirst, the vast majority of peoples philosophical opinions, in the end, are really just justifications and rationalizations for their pre-existing behavior. This isn't to say that some could actually be applying something like Rawls' Veil of Ignorance, obviously he took it in very liberal directions politically, and coming to conclusions entirely based on the axioms they hold true, but the majority of people simply don't do this, and even then the axioms may be different than yours. This goes to say that many of these people are juvenilely holding on to language they grew up using, both because giving it up implies they were wrong in the past and because it is difficult to change the language you use and many simply don't care enough about their political beliefs to put in that effort, regardless of how hard they post. \n\nSecond, I think a lot of people conflate general intelligence, assuming that even exists, with morality, knowledge, and even competency. This leads to a desire to call politically uneducated but passionate people dumb, especially when they lie on the other side of whatever power struggle they are most invested in. Really, we should be calling Fascists unserious, incompetent, uneducated, and evil, but I also think that most of those insults don't hold nearly as much water for the public as simply saying someone isn't intelligent. While it is cathartic, I also don't think insulting your political enemies is particularly productive in the long term, so I don't see much need to change language here, rather I think we should probably be dissuading people from blithe insults as \"praxis\" in general.\n\nLastly, on the subject of neurodivergence in general, I think the answer, to a degree, is indeed to toughen up. The only people who are seemingly remotely interested in cleaning up ableist language are anarchists and rad libs, the second of which I doubt anyone wants to interact with anyways. This means that to be involved with any political sphere in real life, at least that is capable of including enough people to do anything legitimate, will involve people being casually ableist in front of you. I have bipolar disorder myself, and it used to bug me immensely when people refer to others as crazy, and it still does, but I realized that it really is counterproductive to get in direct confrontation with everyone who uses ableist language casually. If someone is being intentionally ableist, yes call them out, but if its obviously an artifact of their pre-existing language patterns, probably produced entirely before they were meaningfully introduced to anarchist thought, I simply don\u2019t think its worth to bad blood it will probably create to call them out on it, or even the time it would take to hash the issue out. As long as there are people starving and freezing to death on the street, I think our time is better spent on things other than policing the casual language of our allies.\n\nAs an aside, and I am going to get shit on for this here, I do think there is a significant difference between an involuntary, mental health related hold and a prison sentence. For one, I am not aware of forced labor in any mental hospitals, though correct me if that isn't the case. Additionally, during the worst of my manic episodes, had I been a sincere danger to others or myself which was really a close thing, I would have far preferred to have been held for a period than to have hurt someone or took my own life. Autonomy is not sacrosanct unless you are truly a radical egoist, and I think that attitude is rather counterproductive to the project of materially freeing our fellow individuals. Truly, it is possible to enter a state of mind, outside of your own accord, that removes you from your normally held beliefs and reasoning abilities. In a state like this, I do believe it is justifiable to infringe on autonomy to prevent harm, both to the sufferer and those around them. This obviously needs to be thoroughly monitored for abuse, and I don't trust any state to do this correctly, but that doesn't mean the concept of an involuntary hold doesn't need to at least be engaged with sincerely.",

            "body": "Let me ask, is the issue the specific words, as in a slur, or is it the act of describing some people as less intelligent? \n\nI think this could be the key difference in word choice between potentially ableist words and other slurs. It's obvious I can't use the n word, but some people *are* black, so I can describe them as black. There are transgendered people, and I'll call them that when needed. The slurs are obvious.\n\nMost people would agree that some people just are more or less intelligent than other people. We could get into the nitty gritty of what exactly that means in different contexts, but generally it's accepted that some people, or ideas, just ain't smart. And people want to be able to describe that. But it seems that some who talk about ableism would prefer no word be used that way. So it's more akin to if a black person was saying to just completely ignore that facet, and there is no word thats okay to describe blackness.\n\n\nNow, obviously this isn't a one to one relationship, in fact my point is that these things are different. So if it's confusing why people won't say tr*nny but they will say d*mb, I think that's at least part of it. No alternative is offered to the word d*mb, you're just supposed to cut that whole concept out of your speech, not just a word from your vocabulary.\n\n\nNow all that said, me I tend to avoid calling people d*mb directly, but I'll describe ideas as that or st*pid (idk what I need to censor or not, I just see some comments getting deleted). I use the word cr*zy similarly. Is that wrong? Idk, maybe\n\n\nI guess I wonder what's really accomplished by eliminating the concept. Ill give another contrast with another slur. If I see a movie and say \"that was a [n-word] movie\" my bias is obvious, I'm really saying something culturally about the movie, and about the kind of person who would enjoy it. If I say \"that was a d*mb movie\" I'm not saying that like, there's a cultural class of person who that movie is for. Again that's just to illustrate the difference, not necessarily a good argument for the continued use of the word d*mb. \n\n\nThis was long winded, my point was just that comparison between ableist slurs and other kinds of slurs isn't perfect, because they function very differently, and those who insist they not be used are ultimately asking for different things",

If it is meant in a bad way, hitting down, then it's offensive, yes.\n\nGenerally, it would be nice if people tried to respect each other.\n\nThe world is a rough place, and most people who have lived a tough working class life do like to rip the shit out of each other. This is mildly offensive, but part of the culture of most of the planet, a symptom of people feeling bad in a shit world, and in a way, expressing this. The idea of let's all hold hands and love each other is enough to make most puke.",

Just a friendly reminder that phrases like \"terminally online\" and \"touch grass\" are ableist and help to perpetuate the harmful idea that one's value and contribution to anarchism and anarchist praxis is centered solely on \"meatspace\" interactions. We recognize that in-person organizing is important, and we encourage it, but our disabled comrades are valuable, as are their contributions regardless of their ability to go outside.\n\nWe highly recommend [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iGFSJ3gv1kY) ([watch on Invidious](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=iGFSJ3gv1kY)) for further explanation. \n\nThis may also be a great time for you to take a moment to review our [Anti-Oppression Policy](https://reddit.com/r/anarchism/wiki/aop) to see how and why we try create and maintain a safe space for marginalized people to hang out without seeing mirrors of their oppression and language used to degrade them based on their marginalized identities.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
