Makhno himself denied the flag was from the anarchists of Ukraine. The anarchists of Ukraine primarily used plain black flags.\n\nI personally have no issue with people still using it (I still have one up on my wall), but seems important people at least know the history of this flag, in spite of it popular pseudohistory.\n\nAlso in general, I feel like many anarchists need to [unlearn a lot of myths and assumptions they have about the \"Free Territory\".](https://www.thecommoner.org.uk/we-carry-a-free-territory-in-our-hearts/)",

A government and thus by definition pretty bad and 2. A liberal government which does not serve the worker even a little. But! It is far better than the brutal oligarchic regime that was there before the Orange Revolution and I only wish we anarchists had been even more involved than we were.\n\nI am not an evangelical Christian, I believe there are degrees in hell.

If other countries help Ukraine, Ukraine would be able to keep most of it's land, rebuild it's infrastructure, cross their fingers and hope that Russia won't attack again.\n\nBut without foreign aid Ukraine would collapse, Europe would get millions of refugees and Russia would get millions of potential soldiers who they could then send to fight on Russian behalf in their next imperialistic expansionist wars (like they did to indigenous people of Siberia/northern Russia/Caucasus or to Ukrainians from Donbass/Crimea).\n\nFirst scenario is still bad, but obviously much better for literally everyone except Russian elites.",

Given that these companies largely control the states of countries like the US, it's not hard to see why things have gone in the direction they have. \n\nI'm just simply saying that in a war between capitalist states maybe the best option for anarchists isn't aligning with one of the states in the war. This doesn't mean giving up or not fighting back against Russia, but it does mean we should be skeptical of joining forces with and bolstering states. \n\nIt's bizarre to think of the state as one of the primary oppressors and obstacles towards a less exploitative and more free world, but then turn around and risk one's life for the protection of that same state in a way that ultimately lines the pockets of the capitalists. We should be getting organized and building power outside the state.",

Oliver's Stone \"Ukraine on Fire\" shows the trajectory. The movie ends just post maidan, but it is very eye opening from the perspective of today. I know a bit of history of Ukraine and Eastern Europe pretty good last 30 years by just live experience and now it is clear to me that the US used their old stooges of Ukrainian nationalists to take control of the Ukrainian state and pull it out from the Russian influence. This wouldn't happen without consequences. If not for their plan of taking over Ukraine this war wouldn't happen. \nI often hear argument about independent right to self-determination of Ukraine... but please... what kind of self-determination is puch by neo-nazi sponsored by imperialist capitalist state? \nOrdinary Ukrainian people has been caught in that game and in ordinary way have been used to be grinded by the machine of war and that's apply to both sides. \nRead history of OUN, how they were harboured by US, UK, Canada... What were they ideology? Do you know that they still operate and have influence on government of UA. Do you know what connections they have internationally? This is serious scary. The surface of the media reported international politics doesn't show any of that. As the subject of Russian propaganda has removed the subject from discussions with accusations of being under influence of Russian propaganda. They didn't disappear they got stronger and embedded in the structures of the state politics and institutions. This is really dangerous and once the dust of war sets this people will be at lead of strongly militarised and garrisoned state. That's not going to have no influence of EU. Particularly neighbor countries. On the other side is antagonized state with also structures and ideology strongly based in fascism in its own flavor. Dugin etc.... Visions of this guys are beyond any nonsense western nazis are coming up with on pair with only the US now... Mixture of  religious fanaticism and extreme capitalism.\nHave to see beyond whatever dramatic narrative of fight for freedom and democracy we have been sold. This is more debt, more enslavement and despair. Not prosperity. One thing Zelenskyy said which must have frozen Trumpolini I agree with... \"You will feel it\" ... No one is immune to it and it will affect everyone. I see people in the west being so remote from it like... It is going to solve itself, it will not. The long tension is now in full confrontation and the spiral is unwinding after long time of pressurising. \nThinking in category of free westen world authoritarian east is over. There is no more good and bad guys. Looking at the right wing leaning of countries in EU it is evident that this is irreversible now. It has to end in catastrophe this is the only way for people to sober up. No amount of talk and explanation will do. And finally for Russia being aggressor..It doesn't really matter. And what? What force in the world will do anything about it? They can stop them somewhere in Ukraine for now. But what would convince them to stop there? What Russia has to loose right now? Reputation? Money? Do they really care? EU and the west will be under constant threat and on verge of dramatic confrontation. This is not good prospects for the EU unless someone will get sacrificed for temporary appeasement of Russia. And power in Russia will consolidate even more. People naively think that without Putin RU will collapse. They have a long tradition of collective management under dictatorial leadership. They will get another character in his place. Someone the west doesn't even know is there. This is a right mess in the moment of the history of make it or break it and anarchists have foretold this situation long time ago. This is what capitalism is leading to. War and more war.",

But the conclusion of this article is pure bullshit.\n\n>Too many working people no longer see any fundamental difference in who will rob them.\n\nNo one I know wants to live under Russian occupation. Most people do not want to be conscripted mainly because of fear of dying and/or because they see the imperfections in the system and are not sure that they will get necessary equipment and training. Not because they don't care who will win in this war. Absolute majority of Ukrainians would rather choose to live under flawed liberal democracy than under imperialistic expansionist dictatorship. They would rather get robbed than robbed AND genocided. People saw how Russia gave Ukrainians from occupied Donbass WWII helmets, WWI rifles and sent them to die in a meat waves in bulk. They saw how Donetsk turned from a flourishing city that held Euro 2012 into a shithole. We understand that if we get occupied we will face the same fate in the next Russian expansionist war in Moldova, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Baltic States or some other country Russia views as part of it's empire.\n\nAs to Ukrainian anarchist and their perspective on this war, you should rather read about such organisations as [Solidarity Collectives](https://www.solidaritycollectives.org/en/), [Resistance Committee](http://linktr.ee/Theblackheadquarter) and leftist magazine [Commons](https://commons.com.ua/en/).",

Basically the same tactic israel uses to alienate support for Palestine in the west. \n\nIn reality, Ukraine isn't far right by any stretch of the imagination: in the 2019 election, the far right got 2% of the vote, and achieved zero seats in the Rada. It's a multicultural society, in which the far right is significantly smaller than in most western countries.\n\nBut by constantly hammering on miniscule factions in Ukrainian society (like Azov and Right Sector), the Kremlin can get westerners to equivocate between the sides. Meanwhile, russia is literally run by a far right dictator, who is in the process of carrying out an imperialist invasion for \"blood and soil\".\n\nI think it's particularly telling that some western leftists endlessly talk about Azov (a marginal group of around 800 shitheads), but has nothing to say about Rusich or Wagner, which are mainstream in the russian military (over 20X larger, founded by explicit neo Nazis, and are currently engaging in a massive campaign of rape and torture in the occupied territories.)",

There's been human rights atrocities on both sides of the civil war before the Russian invasion. I reported on it. Zelensky ran as a peace candidate and did not deliver.  Instead he listened to the wrong people in Brussels, in DC, in Langley. I wanna get off the right/left and onto more practical matters of this war. The US and NATO squashed a peace process in April 2022 and maybe it made a bit of sense because Russia struggled at the beginning of the war. Since Russia regrouped using Wagner (then spectacularly shot Pregozhin out of the sky after his weak kneed mutiny attempt) and getting a feel for a longer drawn out war, Ukraine has had no chance of winning this war. They cannot win. It's very simple. Look at a map and say which country will win a long drawn out war and anyone would pick the largest country on earth by landmass. Putin doesn't care how many of his citizens he sacrifices for the cause. I believe Putin believes this war is existential for Russian survival due to NATO encroachment.  There's no point in me putting a value judgment on that because it is the way he thinks. This is not an existential threat to  NATO or Ukraine as Putin wants 4 conquered terroritories in the east.\n\n--------\n\n\nI want peace in Ukraine for the same reason I was happy about the Gaza ceasefire so fewer people die, so that tne killing stops. People need to stop watching movies and playing COD. The good guys don't always win the wars. That's WW2 propaganda. The bad guys often win wars. Ask any native anywhere.  Ask the Armenians. Sometimes you have to cut your losses because you lost and not because your side is less freedom loving or less noble. I am not worried about Putin touching a NATO country because they are a NATO country.",

Since 1991, the far right has absolutely not been mainstream in Ukrainian politics and is actually much more marginal than other European countries. This has been borne out in many elections, not just the most recent one\n\n> 1. Studies consistently show that rates of participation in hate groups, as well as hate crimes, are lower in Ukraine than other Eastern European countries, and FAR lower than in russia.\n> 1. Additionally, Ukrainians are significantly less likely to hold antisemitic attitudes than Poles, russians, or Greeks.\n\nYou then browsed the abstract (and obviously didn't read) the second source. If you'd actually read the source, you would have seen this information:\n>  2007 was the most violent year in terms of racially motivated crimes with 88 registered assaults with 6 fatalities[In Ukraine]. By comparison, in Russia during the same year there were a reported 625 casualties with 94 deaths attributed to far-right violence.\n\nwhich absolutely supports my point, because based on this data, russia has a much larger (per capita) number of casualties and deaths from the far right. This is completely consistent with the abstract. You see, it's totally possible for the far right to have an outsized impact (relative to its tiny numbers), and also be objectively very small. Do you recognize that the abstract isn't saying that Ukraine is a far right hell hole? and it's certainly not saying that \"Far right paramilitaries committing regular pogroms with impunity.\" I feel like the only way you could come to that conclusion is if you didn't read the study, and already had a preconceived notion that you were looking to confirm. \n\n______\nSo far I've provided well supported claims backed by academic work and studies. And your argument has been to misread a single study, use that misreading to dismiss all of the points, and then bluster (without any evidence) about how how \"Far right paramilitaries committing regular pogroms with impunity\". If this is true, then surely you'll have no trouble finding studies quantifying this and showing that is more common than in other European countries? \n_______\n\nI'll say again: if the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians aren't voting for far right parties, aren't participating in hate groups, aren't committing hate crimes, and aren't holding antisemitic attitudes: what makes you so sure of your feeling that Ukraine is some far right country.",

I reported on these. A million dead Iraqis led to the most barbaric terrorist groups ISIS that ran Iraq and Syria for a bit until The US and Russia took them out. ISIS has open slave markets in Libya..Everywhere in the middle east we flip turns to ISIS and everything we flip in Latin America flips back to socialist. Just this century we've failed 2 coups in Venezuela. We did Bolivia like I mentioned but before that we did Haiti in 2004. We did Honduras in 2009. We pushed for a political coup Operation Carwash to flip Brazil in 2015. We're involved in another Haitian disaster right now too.\n\nRussia doesn't like lgbt people very much but it's tolerated behind closed doors. Russia invaded one other country and commuted the P*ssy Riot sentence. They've got Wagner doing anti terror ops in Africa because the US wants Africans to submit to Africom and The Sahel has has enough with the traditional Colonialists and neocolonialists like France and the US.\n\nSo which country looks more evil?\n\nAlso Russia is not the Soviet Union.

The US has had numerous torture scandals with POWa and at Gitmo. I was speaking about the US domestic police force.\n\nHowever, I don't feel completely swayed by this argument for 2 reasons:\n\n1. Much of the rape and torture in the occupied territories is actually being done by russian security services, GRU, FSB, etc, in addition to russian soldiers, so it really is being done by people we would fairly call \"cops\". \n2. Even counting Gitmo (which I agree should be counted): russia is basically setting up multiple Gitmos on steroids in every single occupied area. The degree and scale is just completely on another level. It would be like if the US set up 20 Gitmos in every single city in Iraq, and supplemented the Gitmo torture with mass executions. \n\nLike, we can acknowledge that the US has done terrible atrocities without whitewashing russian atrocities.",

Wagner is like Azov, x10, on steroids. Azov is a shitty marginal group of around 800 people who spend most of their time fighting against russian invaders and flying edgy flags.

And it's also nothing approach the scale of what's happening in Ukraine. Again, Just in 1 occupied city, they found more than 20 torture sites. \n\n> Final point is that if you look at the Maidan revolution as a western backed coup utilizing the Right Sektor and Sveboda VS looking at it as a popular revolution that included the far-right, it will deeply change the way you view the entire war.

And it's basically a direct copy paste of russia's position: They can't fathom that Ukrainians genuinely don't want to be a colony of russia. So instead, it must be the case that Maidan was a CIA orchestrated plot to empower extremists in Ukraine (similar to the very real US coups in South America). \n\nBut ultimately, if you apply this lens to everything you wind up with an incredibly distorted picture. You miss the fact that, russia is genuinely imperialist. And that Ukraine, despite its flaws, isn't some Nazi dominated hell hole. It's an imperfect, multicultural country, in which the far right is less mainstream than virtually any western European country.",

They earned that territory through bloodshed. It's wholly unfair but that's war.\n\nAlso, just wanted to clarify: russia's demands are not just for the territory they captured. They are currently demanding massive portions of territory that they don't control, as well as measures that would make it even easier for them to invade next time.  Also, the 3.5 million Ukrainians who live under occupation will be subject to cultural genocide, so signing off on that genocide isn't really \"throwing russia a bone\"\n\n---------\nBut if this war could be ended by giving up some land and stomaching rape/torture/ cultural genocide of 3.5 million people, I think many Ukrainians might be able to stomach it. But unfortunately, we all know that just giving up some land will basically guarantee that russia will invade again. \n\nIn early 2014, russia invaded Crimea and the world told Ukraine not to fight back. \"Just give up Crimea for peace\". \n\nSo then russia invaded Donetsk and Luhansk. And Ukraine negotiated. \"Just give a bit of the Donbas for peace\". \n\nThen in 2022, russia invaded again. \"Give up more land for peace\" said the comfortable people in America from their couches. \n\nYou really think that this time, russia will stop? Unfortunately this fight is existential for Ukrainians. There is no option in which russia stops trying to invade/colonize the country. A \"land for peace\" appeasement deal didn't work in 2008 (Georgia), it didn't work in 2014 (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk), it didn't work in 2022. And you'd be a fool to think it would work now.",

This guarantees cultural genocide + widespread rape/torture of the 3.5 million Ukrainians currently living in the occupied territories. \n\n2. russia does not return any of the 700,000 children that it [claims](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/moscow-says-700000-children-ukraine-conflict-zones-now-russia-2023-07-03/) to have deported. \n\n3. No NATO for Ukraine, and no foreign troops to deter russia. This basically guarantees that russia will invade again as soon as it can. After all, russian pundits talk almost weekly about how Kharkiv, Odesa, and Kyiv are all russian cities as well and must be brought back into russia. \n\n4. Weapons restrictions for Ukraine. To make it easier for the next time russia invades. \n\n\nDoes this sound like \"peace\" to you? Right now, the options for Ukraine are to continue fighting and hold out hope, or submit to this \"peace\" and ensure their own destruction.",

Basically the status they have now\n\nThe status quo obviously wasn't effective in deterring russia, because they have already invaded multiple times.\nBasically what you're saying is that, when russia invades again, nothing will happen and russia will be free to takeover the rest of the country as well.\n\nAnd that is precisely why Ukrainians have to fight: because no peace deal with russia will protect them. The only shot they have at survival is inflicting sufficient pain on russia so that russia think twice when they are planning their next invasion.",
