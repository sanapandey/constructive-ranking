    "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I think I've always had an affinity for Anarchism (being an edgy teenager and seeing all the corny depictions of it on TV), but as I've grown older, especially with all the events happening in the United States currently, I've begun to analyze Anarchism as a potential practical and legitimate ideology.\n\nHowever, I haven't considered labeling myself as a full Anarchist yet due to only having a surface level understanding of it. Any suggestions on where to start my Anarchist journey, and more importantly, how I can get involved more with the community? Any advice would be highly appreciated!\n\nTL;DR: New to Anarchism. Where should I start?",

It's not a particularly tough read, and is available for free on the Anarchist Library.\n\n\nRemember that Anarchism is easily as much (if not far more) an ethic by which one lives as a political system, and applying it to your own relationships (with work, with friends and family, with your community, with money and resources and property, and with your voice in the world) is where one needs to start. If you wait for the revolution/collapse to start working on it, you're wasting your time.\n\n\nThis is a system that exists as a critique of power structures. Even if we succeed at becoming the most adopted ethic by which our community or region functions, that critique is never actually finished. It's work, and it always will be work because one of the big selling points of structures of imbalanced power is that they're significantly less work to live under and provide a means for many to ignore them entirely at the cost of freedoms and there will always be some who, even with good intentions, look to re-implement those imbalances.",

Max Stirner is kinda \u201canarchy adjacent\u201d but also worth reading. There are others but Proudhon, Bakunin and Kropotkin are the \u201cbig three\u201d. After reading that stuff you\u2019ll find yourself constantly annoyed by teenagers in skinny jeans who toss around terms like \u201canarcho-communist\u201d but have no idea what it actually means. For a really fun dive into the actual mechanics of how anarchism functions in the real world you should do some reading about the Spanish Civil War and how Catalonia was able to implement syndicalism with relative success. That\u2019s why people often misrepresent anarchism as being connected with socialism, communism and antifascism, because those groups were all fighting together alongside the Spanish republicans against Franco\u2019s fascist army and the monarchists. But I digress. Also it\u2019s probably important to learn about the Russian revolution so you can fully grasp the difference between Marxism and anarchism. It\u2019s worth noting that all the big anarchist thinkers of the 19th century disagreed with Marxism and it\u2019s rather unfortunate that they all used the term \u201ccommunism\u201d to describe their theoretical utopian society, since the Bolsheviks and (later Stalin) would also use that label for their own authoritarian regimes. If you really want to go back and understand the philosophical underpinnings of anarchism, Marxism and the entire mid-19th century ideological revolution you\u2019d need to start with Hegel. His ideas really started everything. Good luck.",

RATM  is a band I'm very familiar with, and I also listened to a bit of Minor Threat, which I don't know for sure if they preach leftist beliefs, but still fit the general vibe. Are there any other bands you would recommend?",

Failing to do this will not create anachism, just another system of oppression. If there isn't a philosophical framework reinstated and developed within every single anarchist centered around individual power and self governing morality it would just be another bs system.

I see this as the most realistic path to real freedom from oppression. creating stable communities of individuals, figuring out how to balance me against you against us. i see it as an inevitable conclusion of radical empiricism, and find great hope in many movements that are seeking to take charge of themselves.",
