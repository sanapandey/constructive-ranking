    "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot about right wing grifters like Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro and how people like that managed to drag online discourse so far to the right even though they might not necessarily TRULY believe the things they're yapping about (thought many of them definitely do). the way they'd constantly be the first to try dominate the narrative whenever something even vaguely progressive or leftist happens, even if it's just performative stuff like representation in movies or whatever \n\ni feel more and more that we might need to take greater control of the narrative and shape our messages to resonate with and radicalise the normies in a decentralized populist movement kinda way \n\nwhere other people slightly to the right of us (either a bit more authoritarian or capitalist or whatever it may be) are in an environment online that we actively attempted to make hostile to anything vaguely right wing ideas, the same way they did it to us, when they were portraying us and our ideas as irrational or going too far or unreasonable. \n\nbasically flipping it on them with our own \"grifters\" or public figures and yappers and comments section takeovers where we make sure everything is centered on what WE wanna talk about \n\nI feel like we have a better leg to stand on because leftist ideas have almost always directly improved people's quality of life when implemented even slightly. fairness, kindness, empowerment, cooperation, self expression, connection, saving nature and having a thriving ecosystem. all these things are pretty easy to sell I think. so if we tried as hard as they did to market ourselves it'd be a clean sweep.  \n\nidk what do you think? do you think it's worth it to put effort into making noise and dominate the cultural conversation by pulling in the normies, or are there more important things we do first before that?",

The Koch demons funded a lot of it, it wasn't even profitable necessarily. \n\nWe can't grift because our message is a threat.",

No large-scale media will even give us a fair platform or the benefit of the doubt\n\nThere already are people providing reasonable and entry-level information. Podcasts and youtube channels that do this already exist. Most anarchist media is freely accessible online or can be found on random distro tables. It's not as if these are poorly made (although some of them might be) or that the people making them are doing a bad job. It's simply hard to have the reach you'd get if you have ecocidal billionaires giving you money.\n\nWhat *does* seem to work is being visible while you're doing cool shit. Whether that's mutual aid or the sort of direct action you can do out in the open. Do this without hiding that you're an anarchist. The people in charge are telling us that (for example) damaging fossil industry makes it harder to sell climate action to the general public. Actual research says the opposite. \n\nSimilarly do organizing with other people and groups without being apologetic about your own politics. Anarchist groups all across the world get shit done but people often don't know it's anarchists doing it.\n\nThe things anarchists should be doing if they want to increase their reach are:\n\n* Do mutual aid\n* Do direct action\n* Go to protests\n* Organize fun events\n\nDo these while being openly anarchist. Tell people why you organize the way you do. Teach people how anarchy works by showing it works.\n\nDon't take this as me saying other things aren't cool or necessary.",
