    "selftext": "Why do so many modern anarchists conflate anarchism with socialism, marxism, and communism? Historically, anarchist thinkers like Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin were opposed to marxism, not aligned with it. Bakunin, for example, saw Marx\u2019s \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d as just another form of authoritarianism that would inevitably lead to oppression\u2014something history proved correct.\n\nThe term anarcho-communism comes largely from Kropotkin, but when he (and other 19th-century thinkers) used the word \u201ccommunism,\u201d they were describing a hypothetical stateless society\u2014one that had never existed. After the Russian Revolution, communism became a concrete, real-world system associated with centralized authoritarian states like the Soviet Union. So why are people still using the term anarcho-communism today, when communism now represents state control and authoritarianism? It\u2019s completely contradictory to attach anarchism\u2014a philosophy of anti-authoritarianism\u2014to a term that has become synonymous with government control.\n\nThe reality is that modern leftist and activist groups have co-opted anarchism, blending it into a vague, trendy brand of \u201canti-capitalism\u201d that serves their own agenda. They take the aesthetics of rebellion while injecting anarchism with socialist and marxist ideas\u2014ideologies that are inherently dependent on centralized power and state control. But true anarchism is diametrically opposed to socialism and marxism because those ideologies require a governing force, whether it\u2019s a state or a so-called \u201cpeople\u2019s collective.\u201d Anyone claiming to be an anarchist while advocating for socialism or marxism is either deeply misinformed or deliberately misleading.\n\nIs this historical ignorance, or is it a deliberate ideological hijacking?",

            "body": "Well, many anarcho-communists just refer to what we believe as \"anarchism\", because it is. Anarchism has always been anti-capitalist, and when you say that anarchism is anti-socialist, you're defining socialism too narrowly as state socialism. Anarchism is the anti-state side of socialism.\n\nWhen we use the term \"anarcho-communist\", it's because we are deliberately rebuking the Leninist claim to communism. It's a useful term within anarchist discourse, because anarcho-communism is a huge part of the historic, global, and ongoing anarchist tradition, and within anarchist circles, most people know that when you're referring to anarcho-communism, you're referring to that tradition. But, at the same time, the term \"communism\" in popular discourse has, in huge parts of the world, been conflated with 20th century state socialism. As such, many of us in conversations with folks will describe ourselves as social anarchists, or class struggle anarchists, or as anarcho-syndicalists if we are in fact anarcho-syndicalists, or simply as anarchists.\n\nBut yeah, anarchism has always been the anti-state wing of socialism. It's not just an extreme form of liberal individualism.\n\nEdit: Hold up, you've clearly read theory, looking at your comment history, but where was there a miscommunication here, in the material? Did you read all about anarcho-syndicalism and not know that the goal of anarcho-syndicalism is anarchist communism? Communism doesn't mean Leninism. The syndicalists you cite as a good example elsewhere, were fighting for anarcho-communism (or sometimes anarcho-collectivism; the difference is not that big and is often situational) through syndicalism.",

A bureaucratic system with which to redistribute the means of production is by definition not anarchy. Anarchist-communism (subtly different spelling from anarcho-communism) was Kropotkin\u2019s term, but the truth is nearly everyone in the 19th century used the term \u201ccommunism\u201d to describe their utopian vision. Because at the time there was no historical precedent for communism. It was all theory. That changed with the Bolsheviks. Now that word means something entirely different. People may argue that they\u2019re sticking with the original 19th century definition of communism, in which case I think it\u2019s important to look at another term which has taken a dramatic shift in meaning. Prior to the 20th century the term libertarian was synonymous with anarchist. Then it was hijacked by the free market capitalists and now it means something entirely different. Any anarchist who is hanging onto the communist label as a throwback to the 1800\u2019s should then have no problem proudly identifying themselves as a libertarian. But the fact is words take on different meanings. Communism doesn\u2019t mean the same thing now as it did 150 years ago. However anarchist-syndicalism still means the exact same thing it\u2019s always meant. And while the labor movement came to represent something entirely different from its anarcho-syndicalist origins, the term itself remains untainted. Why is this important? Because we live in a society where words like communist, fascist and anarchist have very clear definitions but people love to toss them around without understanding the historical context. For example people always refer to Franco as a \u201cfascist\u201d, but he was actually a nationalist dictator. It\u2019s important to be able to clearly distinguish between those two. And while we\u2019re at it, the antifascist army that opposed him were the republican-libertarian-socialist-communists. Clearly the meanings of words change.\nAnd in a broader sense, communists have continually proven to be as big a threat to anarchism as fascism. Look at the slaughter of Makhno and the black army or the May Days of the Spanish Civil War. If history has taught us anything it\u2019s that an anarchist is just as likely to die from a communist bullet in their back as a fascist bullet in the chest. At this point in time it\u2019s offensive to the movement to use the title communist as anything but a pejorative.",

                            "body": "Okay, so the argument here really boils down to whether or not the definition of communism has been so thoroughly changed by Leninism that it's no longer useful to use. I think that's a contextual question. Internal to the anarchist movement, where most of us understand that there is an historic current of anarchism called anarcho-communism, the term remains a useful category for discussing that current. It can also be useful in distinguishing between contemporary anarchists. For example, in the metro I organize in, those of us who are anarcho-communists tend to have a very different analysis and set of projects, than one of the other anarchist circles locally- the anti-civ anarchists.\n\nWould I suggest organizing under the banner of \"anarcho-communism\", and branding all public communications with hammers and sickles? No, not really, especially given our metro's huge population of people who came from former Marxist-Leninist states, such as the Hmong. We just describe ourselves as anarchists, because that's what we are. \n\nBut in answer to your original question, it's neither historic ignorance nor deliberate ideological hacking. It's a disagreement on whether the word \"communism\" has been completely redefined by Leninism to the point that it must be banished from the anarchist lexicon.",

I\u2019m sure you know what I\u2019m talking about. I think this hijacking is more than just young people wanting to spice up their TikTok with some anarchist flair, it\u2019s the power structure doing the same thing they did in response to rap music in the 90\u2019s. They\u2019ve learned from the counterculture movements of the 1960s and now rather than opposing these movements they adapt them into something they can manipulate. Anarchism itself doesn\u2019t leave much room for interpretation, which is a good thing, but when it\u2019s part of some ambiguously defined compound-word then it opens up room for a whole bunch of non-anarchists to slip through the door. And I\u2019m not talking about something innocuous like angsty teenagers, I\u2019m taking about things like asset management groups pushing specific cultural narratives in order to destabilize society and control world governments.",

I think it's more the inevitable result of living liberal hegemony. Even with liberalism in crisis in the west, most adults who are politically active today grew up in a culture where liberalism was the entire framework of discussion, the default. I think that's where liberalism enters the movement- through its new recruits, and through jaded and tired older anarchists making compromises with the system but trying to convince themselves that these compromises are still anarchist.m \n\nThere is also a process of recuperation. I can see it happening with the term \"community defense\" for example. In the mid-2010s, anarchists started using the term \"community self defense\" when talking about autonomous, organized anti-policing and anti-fascist organizing by multiracial coalitions of working class people. By 2020, the term \"self\" was increasingly being dropped and online-radicalized Marxists were calling the stuff they did \"community defense\". More recently, I've seen it entering into the language of more academic and nonprofit linked activists- the same type of folks who boldly called themselves abolitionists in 2020 but have since walked that back by redefining abolition. Those sort of activists love radical phrasemongering but always have to sand off the rough edges and the serial numbers of their phrases to maintain their place at the table in the liberal academic and nonprofit world. So, there's a process of recuperation that happens, but I don't think it's a wide ranging, intentional plot so much as the familiar dynamics of the academics mining radical movements for exciting new phrases they can plant their flag into. \n\nI don't think that, for groups trying to control world governments, the anarchist movement is a particularly useful place for them to try to influence things. I'd say a lot more effort gets put into building pipelines for people into the far right.",

I think it\u2019s part of a greater effort by the power structure to undermine and defang anarchist principles.\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed how the  left has increasingly co-opted anarchist movements, particularly by attaching the term \u201canarcho-communism\u201d to ideologies that dilute anarchism\u2019s core values. What began as a radical critique of the state and hierarchical power structures is now often infused with liberal ideas calling for more government control, regulations, and restrictions on individual freedoms, principles fundamentally at odds with anarchism\u2019s goals of autonomy and anti-statism. This shift has allowed powerful political and financial actors to redirect protest and resistance narratives to serve their own interests.\nCorporations like BlackRock and Vanguard are leveraging their immense influence over global financial markets, media, and culture to manipulate political and cultural landscapes. Through mechanisms like ESG scores, these asset management giants push narratives that align with their own economic and political agendas, all while appearing to support progressive values. Their control over streaming services and major media outlets allows them to shape public discourse, pushing a cultural agenda that reinforces their interests. By promoting particular ideologies, whether through content creation or media partnerships, they subtly guide public sentiment and influence political outcomes, presenting their preferred policies as the \u201cright\u201d or \u201cmoral\u201d choice.\nThis manipulation of the cultural narrative serves to consolidate their power by creating a climate of division and confusion, which in turn weakens genuine grassroots movements. By rebranding dissent as something that fits within an acceptable, marketable narrative, they neutralize real opposition. Ultimately, this enables these corporate giants to maintain the status quo, keeping their influence over global affairs intact while giving the illusion of progressive or revolutionary change. The implications of this are profound: it\u2019s not just about pushing a political agenda but reshaping the entire cultural framework, ensuring that resistance is funneled in ways that don\u2019t threaten the existing power structures, but instead reinforce them.",

While they adopt tactics and imagery associated with anarchism, their true focus isn\u2019t the abolition of state power but rather about advancing progressive policies and fighting perceived oppression. While Antifa may not explicitly advocate for more government control, they often align with movements that support stronger government regulation in areas like diversity and equality.\n\nBy adopting the anarchist aesthetic, Antifa reshapes public perception, shifting the narrative toward a form of activism that, while opposing fascism, still relies on creating structures to enforce these values. In practice, enforcing equality through laws or policies inevitably means reinforcing systems of control, which directly contradicts anarchism\u2019s core principle of dismantling all forms of authority.\n\nThe use of hyphenated terms like \u201canarcho-communism\u201d creates a space for movements that don\u2019t truly align with anarchist principles to adopt its aesthetic and language. By attaching these qualifiers, we open the door for social justice movements to appropriate the anarchist identity without truly embracing its core values. Anarchism, in its pure form, is a rejection of all authority and coercion. But by allowing flexibility in how the term is used, it becomes easier for movements that rely on government intervention or state power to present themselves as part of the anarchist tradition.\n\nThis creates a situation where these groups can co-opt the symbolism of resistance without sharing the foundational goals. They adopt the look, the tactics, and the rhetoric, but ultimately, their focus is often on using the state to enforce equality. By introducing ambiguity into the term \u201canarchism,\u201d we allow movements like Antifa to redefine what anarchism \u201cmeans\u201d in the public eye.

Antifa has long been a specific branch of work, like Food Not Bombs or Anarchist Black Cross, that anarchists have long been the primary if not almost exclusive organizers of. Antifascism has developed specific analyses and theoretical contributions, in much the same way that anarcha-feminism has, that compliment and shore up anarchist thought: https://threewayfight.blogspot.com/ Specifically this includes the core plank of opposing the state and not impeding continued struggle against the state. Antifa has consistently opposed hate crime laws, etc. This is why the SPLC denounced antifa in the 90s. Also antifascism's hard line on genocide and authoritarianism (and its 90%+ anarchist involvement) was what led pretty much every communist group to denounce it from the 80s on.\n\nSure, in recent times there's been some very online folks identifying themselves as \"antifa\" as tho it's like a loose identity, and there's a couple voices (Shane Burley and Mark Bray) that have tried to endorse an antifascist strategy of mass movement politics (\"hey kids I hear you like antifa, did you know that [generic leftist thing] is the real antifa?\"), but that remains not at all what antifascism or antifa are, which continue to exist doing the same unsung janitorial work to keep the rest of us safe that they always have.\n\nI don't disagree with some of your broader points on \"anarcho-communism\" recently functioning as a whitewashing of state communism, etc, and certainly there are some silly folks slapping \"antifa\" on themselves without any connection to the actual thing, and treating it like a loose leftist protest movement, but come on, we're anarchists, we know better. We've known the actual antifascist crews and groups for decades. Your characterization of antifa reads right out of how Fox News talks about it: \"is trans parenting antifa parenting?!\"",

If the public misperceives what anarchism is, even if large numbers of randos self-identify without any real knowledge of it, does that transform what anarchism is?\n\n> coordinating with progressive NGOs, defending democratic political narratives, and even lobbying for deplatforming through corporate and state partnerships\n\nWell I could see some good and necessary things characterized this way, as well as many bad things, but the bad things are increasingly mobilized specifically by the CVE (Countering Violent Extremism) folks who explicitly set themselves as adversaries of antifa.\n\n> Plenty of Antifa-aligned groups have actively cheered state censorship or suppression when it suits their politics.\n\nThere's complex ethical/strategic evaluations here. For example, if a nazi who murdered anarchists flagrantly doesn't get convicted and go to prison the state's action there becomes a loud announcement of open season, even while we don't support prisons and obviously a nazi in prison is just collaborating with other nazis. So the evaluations of antifa's Three Way Fight perspective can get a little complicated in terms of analysis. But when you look at those who briefly identified as \"antifa\" before turning into defending the state or collaborating with it, like ARR did, the antifa movement has widely denounced them and they now identify more with CVE.",

            "body": "Are anarchists communists? Are anarchists socialists? Let's get into the history a little deeper.\n\nMarx was not the first one to use the word \"communist\"\u2014before Marx gentrified the communist movement, the term was associated with actual workers like Wilhelm Weitling, whom Bakunin got to know and derived some influence from as he was becoming politicized. Later, Weitling was forced out of his own organization in a brutal power grab by Marx. That was the 1840s, and the same authoritarian tactics that created such disasters in the 20th century were already at play in Marx's personal relationships. If you read about his life in detail and make note of the actions he took in regards to the Paris Commune and other events of his time, it really isn't possible to come away with a positive impression.\n\nBakunin never identified as a communist, though. Here's what he had to say later:\n\n**\"I hate**\u00a0[**Communism**](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Communism)\u00a0**because it is the negation of liberty and because humanity is for me unthinkable without liberty.**\u00a0I am not a Communist, because Communism concentrates and swallows up in itself for the benefit of the State all the forces of society,\u00a0**because it inevitably leads to the concentration of property in the hands of the State, whereas I want the abolition of the State,**\u00a0the final eradication of the principle of authority and the patronage proper to the State, which under the pretext of moralizing and civilizing men has hitherto only enslaved, persecuted, exploited and corrupted them. I want to see society and collective or social property organized from below upwards, by way of free association, not from above downwards, by means of any kind of authority whatsoever.\"\n\nContrast this with what Bakunin says about socialism:\n\n**\"Liberty without socialism is privilege and injustice, and socialism without liberty is slavery and brutality.\"**\n\nBakunin, like practically all of the anarchists of his time, saw himself as a socialist. Indeed, for many years after Marx broke up the International Workingmen's \\[sic\\] Association in the early 1870s (most of which reformed without him as \"the black international\"), the majority of socialists took for granted that anarchism was the best way to realize socialism. With the benefit of 150 years of experience, they were surely right.\n\nAfter Bakunin's death, Kropotkin and Malatesta took to describing themselves as anarchist communists, because they wanted to emphasize the importance of abolishing property. Fair enough.\n\nAs you point out, \"communism\" has a new set of associations now, after the 21st century, the vast majority of which connect it with authoritarianism. When people say \"anarcho-communist,\" they are concretely distinguishing themselves from this, but when they simply say \"communist,\" there is no way to tell whether they mean Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao, or Engels, all of whom are bad in a variety of ways. It is reasonable to be concerned that any attempts to rehabilitate \"communism\" without prefixes will ultimately benefit authoritarians.\n\nI don't think it behooves us to provoke sectarian conflict over this subject\u2014semantics is important, but conflict is not always the best way to change people's minds. Rather, we should model good behavior by identifying ourselves as anarchists and by discussing in detail why we prefer that descriptor to others, like \"communist\" or \"socialist.\"",

But Bookchin's process is a matter of majority rule. I believe people yelling this at him was part of the reason he distanced himself from the label. And regardless of that the process he describes is majoritarian.\n\n> How, then, would society make dynamic collective decisions about public affairs, aside from mere individual contracts? The only collective alternative to majority voting as a means of decision-making that is commonly presented is the practice of consensus. \n\nThere is too the matter that Anarchism of course does not have a very comfortable position for consensus \"decision-making\" either, but in any case Bookchin's view seems to have been was that it was majorities or nothing which is not a conclusion one would derive from most anarchist theory\n\n> You have to work stuff out as a group if you want to live as a group of free people that share resources and space.\n\nSure, but part of the general critique of anarchism is that you don't need prescriptive mechanisms like majoritarianism to do this and that such mechanisms do not work anything out at all but, since they are matters of authority, prevent equilibrium by legislating order. Since our interests are mutually pertinent and interdependent on one another we can expect cooperation to persist regardless of a \"decision-making process\", and in the anarchist view flourish because of its basis in negotiating external constraints rather than waiting for orders",

Referring to the quote pulled above or simply reading to the quote you linked would clarify this. Referring to anarchist literature, eg malatesta, would offer some reasons for why votes create rather than solve conflicts of interest between winners and losers.  \n\n> This doesn't mean consensus, nor did I say that.\n\nNo, it means majority rules, which certainly does not entail everybody getting together to \"make the decision\" but rather a process by which the decision of any number of minorities or individuals is ruled out. Bookchins talking in this respect is rather noticeably unstable, as he seems to think that gathering information about what people think makes a pronouncement not itself. A king if he likes can debate and accept criticism from his subordinates, so if he does that hes not really a ruler i guess.\n\n\n We seem to move a step closer to everybodys participation via consensus,  in which no decision is made without collective approval, but both your and bookchins not only lack of interest but opposition to it certainly throw this commitment into question \n\n> You can't always get what you want. That's ideology at the service of narcissism.

If we simply dispense with bookchins unfounded assertions about exactly what is necessary for cooperation, theres nothing stopping us from pursuing one in which our conflicts are resolved and not repressed by an authority\n\n> There is an obvious difference between \"direct democracy\" as an imposed institution and direct democracy as unmitigated group decision making.\n\nThere doesn't appear to be a meaningful difference in the way you want or Bookchin want to construct it, which, presaging bookchins own relationship with anarchism, another archism making the same sort of assumptions about society as its confederates. Afterall, within bookchins own scheme of things, its not possible to do better than direct democracy anyway, so its either going to be the people imposing the system on us or necessity, whether we like it or not",

One is that \"consensus decisionmaking\" vis a vis vetoes and such is also incompatible with anarchy, and the second is that anarchists already have a \"third thing\" which is free association. The absence of a \"decisionmaking process.\" Decisions are made and organized around by individuals. Interest is asserted by people themselves, not by some preexisting assembly\n\nIn the second place, what a majority votes has *nothing to do* with the best possible solution to a situation, if there even is such a thing. There is nothing special about an opinion being in the majority that confers a useful understanding of reality. That's discovered through research and experimentation. In such a case where a really \"weighty concern\" from our perspective is not something possessed by the dissenting parties, there isn't much difference between a majority vote and a coin flip, besides the fact that we're choosing to compromise on our principles for what is literally no reason in the former case.

Whether or not The People's decisions are enforced by the Armed Forces, \"The People's militia\", or just by a bunch of guys with guns is really irrelevant to anarchism, as the number of heads ruling has never been a very great matter of interest.

The Bolsheviks were very opposed initially at the idea of being associated with the anarchists, but Lenin, seeing the failures of social democracy and the  relative consistency of anarchism argued:\n\n>  \n*\"Subjectively, Social-Democratic workers are most loyal leaders of the proletarians.*\n\n>*Objectively, however, the world situation is such that the old name of our Party makes it easier to fool the people and impedes the onward march; for at every step, in every paper, in every parliamentary group, the masses see leaders, i.e., people whose voices carry farthest and whose actions are most conspicuous; yet they are all \u201cwould-be Social-Democrats\u201d, they are all \u201cfor unity\u201d with the betrayers of socialism, with the social-chauvinists; and they are all presenting for payment the old bills issued by \u201cSocial-Democracy\u201d. . . .*\n\n>*And what are the arguments against? . . .* \n\n>*We\u2019ll be confused with the Anarchist-Communists, they say. . . .Why are we not afraid of being confused with the Social-Nationalists, the Social-Liberals, or the Radical-Socialists, the foremost bourgeois party in the French Republic and the most adroit in the bourgeois deception of the people? . . . We are told: The people are used to it, the workers have come to \u201clove\u201d their Social-Democratic Party.*\n\n>*That is the only argument. But it is an argument that dismisses the science of Marxism, the tasks of the morrow in the revolution, the objective position of world socialism, the shameful collapse of the Second International, and the harm done to the practical cause by the packs of \u201cwould-be Social-Democrats\u201d who surround the proletarians.*\n\n>*It is an argument of routinism, an argument of inertia, an argument of stagnation.*\n\n>*But we are out to rebuild the world. We are out to put an end to the imperialist world war into which hundreds of millions of people have been drawn and in which the interests of billions and billions of capital are involved, a war which cannot end in a truly democratic peace without the greatest proletarian revolution in the history of mankind.Yet we are afraid of our own selves.* \n\n>*We are loth to cast off the \u201cdear old\u201d soiled shirt. . . .*\n\n>*But it is time to cast off the soiled shirt and to put on clean linen.\"*\n\n  \nIt would of course, turn out to be a rebranding in name only. The new Communist Party would continue to consolidate their power and personality cultism, much as they had as the Social Democratic Party-- eventually suppressing a number of bottom up movements in their midst, including several of an actual communist (ie: bottom-up, horizonal) character.  \n  \nAnd of course, as a result, the word communist has been widely perverted to mean dictatorship, state ownership, and state subjugation, rather than direct collective power.",

Socialism, in theory, creates the material conditions which render the state obsolete.\u00a0\n\nAs to why that never happened in China or the USSR or anywhere else, there\u2019s a very defensible argument that those efforts were made impossible by the extremely hostile responses of the entire rest of the world. From the moments of their inceptions, both the USSR and PRC were under economic attack, were being infiltrated and undermined by malign covert agents acting on behalf of hostile capitalist powers, and were often under military threat as well. Living like a socialist\u2014with trust and love for your fellow human beings\u2014is all but impossible under those conditions. Those experiments were doomed to become warped and corrupted and paranoid.\n\nIn addition, I think there\u2019s a very strong case that small-S soviet council direct democracy of the kind the USSR initially tried to implement literally wasn\u2019t practicable or feasible in 1919, but it is today. High speed communications allow for radically decentralized and democratized decisionmaking even while maintaining a state. If you implemented, in practice, what the Russian communists only theorized about, you would create so many tiers of accountability that the degree of actual state power held by any individual would be minimal. The state would truly become the tool of the people, which would allow it to be discarded when it became obsolete.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with this\u2014sometimes I don\u2019t know if I agree with it either\u2014but you\u2019re being disingenuous if you claim not to grasp the basic theory at work here.

In the same way that libertarian used to mean anarchist but I\u2019m also not going to go around telling people I\u2019m a libertarian because that would just make people think I\u2019m some sort of free market capitalist. I can sit down with academics and discuss the historical origins of political terminology but when it comes to normal people in the real world, you say the word communism and they don\u2019t think of Kropotkin. They think of Stalin. And I think the only reason people haven\u2019t put these antiquated terms to rest a long time ago is because leftists have realized they can hijack anarchism the same way free market capitalists hijacked libertarianism as a way to justify deregulation. And now leftist are doing the same thing with anarchism. They want to infiltrate the youth protest movement and subvert genuine anarchist ideology with their authoritarian liberalism and if people cognitively associate anarchism with communism, then in another fifty years anarchism will be gone entirely and instead we\u2019ll have a far-left political party called the \u201canarcho-communist party\u201d running for state legislature. And nobody will even remember that it used to stand for something different. Because that\u2019s how the authoritarians dismantle resistance. They infiltrate it and dilute it until nobody remembers what it used to stand for.
