I\u2019m partial to the American version by Charles Hope Kerr using they/them in place of he/him. If anyone happens to know where I can find a good version please let me know! ",

            "body": "Well, I haven't recorded my version yet, but I tried to translate as accurately from the original French, which is actually very anarchic, politically, and incorporate some of the best lines of multiple other English translations. If you'd like, I can find time to make a recording of this. I like to play it either as a bit of a Celtic style, influenced by Pol Mac Adaim, or a very Mississippi John Hurt influenced American fingerstyle, bluesy version.\n\n***Internationale***  \nArise, ye prisoners of starvation! Arise, ye wretched of the earth!  \nFor justice thunders condemnation: A better world's in birth!  \nNo more hunger\u2019s chains shall bind us; Arise, ye slaves, no more in thrall!  \nWe\u2019ll leave the gloomy past behind us- We have been nought, we shall be all!\n\n(alternative: Arise you prisoners of hunger... for reason in revolt now thunders)\n\nChorus:  \nSo come comrades, come rally, for the struggle carries on  \nThe Internationale unites the world in song  \nSo comrades, come rally, And the last fight let us face.  \nThe Internationale Unites the human race. (x2)\n\nWe want no condescending saviors, To rule us from their judgment hall;  \nWe workers ask not for their favors, Let us consult for all.  \nTo end the reign of exploitation And win for all a happy lot, (alt: \"an insurrection must be fought\")  \nWe will ignite revolt in every nation, And strike while the iron\u2019s hot\n\nLike monsters, bathing in their Godhood- They steal all that\u2019s made or grown  \nHave they ever done anything other Than to exploit because they own?  \nTheir estates are but golden cages For the wealth our work gave birth  \nIn asking for our rightful wages,\u00a0 We demand only the Earth\n\nLet no one build walls to divide us, No war but class war shall we fight  \nCome greet the dawn and stand beside us- Workers of the world, unite!  \nLet no army march upon another, Throw down your medals, throw down your swords  \nEmbrace as sisters and as brothers- We\u2019ll turn our guns upon our lords\n\nAnd now begins the final drama In the streets and in the fields  \nWe stand unbowed before their armor, We defy their guns and steel  \nAs we fight, and weather their repression, Let us be inspired by life and love  \nAlthough they offer us concessions, Change will not come from above",
