    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been thinking about the idea of anarchists working within government systems. Some argue that this is a way to \u201cpractice what they preach,\u201d but I see a contradiction that\u2019s worth addressing.\n\nAnarchy, at its core, is about rejecting hierarchical control, state authority, and the structures that uphold oppression. Governments exist to maintain power over people, and their systems are designed to sustain themselves, not to be dismantled from within. So when someone claims to be an anarchist while actively working in government, it raises an important question: **Are they truly practicing anarchist ideals, or are they just participating in the very system they claim to oppose?**\n\nNow, I understand that survival under capitalism requires compromise. Many of us take jobs within systems we don\u2019t fully align with because we need to pay bills, get healthcare, or navigate the reality we were born into. There\u2019s no shame in that. But let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s a difference between working a job to survive and working for the government while claiming to resist it.\n\nIf your paycheck comes from an institution built on oppression, you\u2019re **reinforcing** that institution\u2019s existence, whether intentionally or not. You can believe you\u2019re making a difference, but real systemic change doesn\u2019t come from within systems designed to preserve themselves. Governments don\u2019t allow people to hold real power unless it serves their function. That\u2019s why historically, even well-intended reformists end up constrained by the structures they work within.\n\nWith the growing threats we\u2019re facing, environmental collapse, increased surveillance, rising authoritarianism, we don\u2019t need more people trying to \u201cfix\u201d a system that was never meant to serve us. We need more people turning their backs on it entirely. Saying no more to oppressive laws, exploitative labor, and a system that actively works against us. We spend so much of our time, energy, and resources feeding a machine that is trying to kill us. Imagine what could happen if that energy was redirected into something better.\n\nI\u2019m not telling people what to do, everyone has to make their own choices. But personally, I believe the future isn\u2019t in reforming or working within the system. It\u2019s in walking away from it. In creating something new, something prosperous, something that actually serves us. A world where we invest in each other, not in a dying system that was built to control us.\n\nWe all exist within oppressive systems, but how we engage with them matters. The question isn\u2019t just **what we do**, but ***why***, and whether our choices are truly moving us toward liberation, or just making it easier to exist within the system as it is.",

Out of interest, what do you think of corporate and unaccountable sources of power?\n\nAlso you advocate the redirection of people away from the government. I would be interested to know how you would say.... feed and provide medical care on mass to the people, not in the future, but now.\n\nCurrently, the government is regulating corporate behemoths that would otherwise destroy the fabric of society and destroy all life on the planet simply due to the framework of profit motive. How would you suggest we regulate them seeing as anarchists are a tiny percentage of the population ?",

                    "body": "I\u2019m not particularly focused on the government itself, I\u2019m focused on people, the harm done to them, and how we can actually change things. The system is just the machinery; the real issue is how people uphold and comply with it.\n\nThe past year has taught me that change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and it can\u2019t be forced, it happens when the collective decides to shift. Until then, those of us who see the truth have to be a thorn in the side of cognitive dissonance, speaking truths that make people uncomfortable, protesting, and rejecting the false \u201csolutions\u201d the system hands us.\n\nAs for how to care for people now, **the answer is simple**: *we take care of each other*. If millions of nurses, teachers, and other skilled workers stopped working for profit-driven systems and instead focused on their communities, we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on corrupt institutions in the first place. Imagine a world where people used their skills to directly support those around them, rather than feeding into an economy that exploits them.\n\nAnd the argument that the government is \"regulating\" corporations to prevent total destruction? That\u2019s a myth. The government and corporations are one and the same. Corporations only exist because governments protect them, fund them, and give them legal cover to exploit people and destroy the planet. If the state truly regulated corporate behemoths, we wouldn\u2019t have child labor in supply chains, planned obsolescence, mass environmental destruction, or billionaires hoarding resources while people starve.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? We stop playing the game. The fact that a small group of people are resisting doesn\u2019t make it futile, it makes it urgent. The system only functions because people comply with it. Every time someone chooses to truly live by their values, it weakens the machine. Change doesn\u2019t come from waiting until we have the numbers. It comes from people breaking free of fear and acting in alignment with what they already know is right.\n\nAt the end of the day, people already have the power to shift reality. They just have to stop waiting for permission.",

We simply have to reach out to them.",

Funny how I\u2019ve been doing exactly what you claim is \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d for over a year, and yet, still here.\n\nYou\u2019ve boxed yourself into colonized definitions of society and resistance. You assume that removing yourself from a corrupt system is the same as removing yourself from society itself. That\u2019s an incredibly narrow way of thinking. Society does not cease to exist just because we stop feeding corporations and institutions. Society is the people, not the system.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real, your own words contradict your point. You claim to have lived underground, outside the system, on the run, yet you also claim it\u2019s impossible? Sounds like proof that it is possible, and that the issue isn\u2019t whether it can be done, it\u2019s whether you actually believe in it.\n\nYou\u2019re also stuck in the all-or-nothing fallacy. Change doesn\u2019t require everyone to opt out. Movements historically only need about 3.5% of the population actively resisting to create massive shifts. The issue isn\u2019t numbers, it\u2019s that people like you, who claim to be against the system, are still defending participation in it rather than figuring out how to actually undermine it.\n\nThis constant cycle of debating instead of doing is exactly why we stay stuck. The biggest barrier to change isn\u2019t the right-wing, isn\u2019t the corporations, isn\u2019t even the government, it\u2019s people, who are too afraid to let go of their illusions of control.\n\nAt the end of the day, we should be focusing on solutions, not justifying compliance. Instead of reinforcing the system you claim to oppose, why not start looking into ways to get your community off-grid? Because resistance isn\u2019t just about individual survival, it\u2019s about creating alternative structures so people can actually thrive outside of the system. That\u2019s what real change looks like.",
