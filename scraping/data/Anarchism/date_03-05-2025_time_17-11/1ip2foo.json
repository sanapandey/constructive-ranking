That obviously backfired. I'm also convinced that the Democrats nominated Kamala Harris knowing she would lose. Most Democrats are capitalists still, regardless of how their policies are labeled. As capitalists, it's in their best interest for the orange money man to be in power. The majority of elected officials don't give a shit about their constituents, and that goes for most countries not just the US",

                    "body": "People didn't stay home, both sides had huge turnouts. I think (European so open to correction) that the real reason Democrats can't win over Trump voters is that they fail to address the psychological grip that right-wing propaganda has on them- many of whom are poor, poorly educated, and sometimes functionally illiterate. These people have been fed a constant diet of fear, rage, and conspiracy theories for years. They don\u2019t even realise they\u2019re being manipulated because they think everyone else is, they think they're victims trying to save America because right-wing media plays on their insecurities to emotionally rile them up. They're manipulated into thinking they're MAGA when, they\u2019re just being used to keep the rich and powerful in control.\n\nI don't think it has much to do with policy, I don't think Trump voters actually understand the policies they oppose. They just repeat whatever buzzwords right-wing media feeds them. That\u2019s why they're always crying about communism without knowing what it means and mistake basic government programs for a socialist takeover.\n\nThe GOP knows exactly how to exploit their ignorance, using simple, emotionally charged messaging that reinforces tribal loyalty and discourages critical thinking. Meanwhile, Democrats assume facts and policies alone will get through to Trump voters, but their messaging is completely inaccessible to this demographic. It\u2019s buried in elite language, long-winded policy talk, and media sources that this group doesn\u2019t engage with or understand. Trump refusing to debate Kamala was so effective because his voters don\u2019t consume mainstream media. They exist in an entirely separate echo chamber where they only see what confirms their worldview.\n\nI honestly think that Trump voters are in a cult and the only way this will end at this point is if Trump disappears and Republicans can't find someone else with the abilities to succeed him as the leader. Hopefully, they can't, and this all dies with him.",

But this is a symptom of decades of systemic destruction of our instutions. Public education could have saved us. \n\nThere was also about a 3 point decline in voter turnout.\n\nAgain, when there is no opposition party, when there are few left policies and both parties are marginally different uninformed voters get pulled into culture wars and informed voters drop out of particpating.\n\nI think you underestimate the average republican voter. They aren't what you see at rallies.",

I think you're right after revising this. If she had taken uniquely strong stances which directly counter Trump, things might've been different.\n\nThe way I've conceptualised the average Trump voter is through looking at demographics and everything I see points to a group that is poor, poorly educated, and easily manipulated. What I don't understand is that every debate I've seen from a Republican reinforces that, even the politicians/Republican influencers (?) seem so narrow minded and unintelligent. I just can\u2019t grasp why anyone with critical thinking skills would align with Republican ideology. Why would this happen to the average person if they weren't being psychologically manipulated into it? Surely they'd be able to see for themselves that they're objectively following a narcissist who does not want the best for them.",

I think those voters tend to be victims of politics. But then there is also just a type of person who is unleashed by Trump's rhetoric. They're excited to be able to be hateful in public. Although, that mindset also stems from ignorance.",

However, I'm completely lost on how I can get in touch with other people who are interested in organizing and planning direct action operations. These organizations are decentralized by design, which makes them very hard to find. I obviously know I won't find them here, but can anyone offer breadcrumbs?\n\nYears and years of terrorist threats from the right, armed temper tantrums in the aisles of Target, the desecration of our Capitol, the assault of police officers, the erection of gallows to hang a sitting vice-president, the lies about immigrants \"eating cats and dogs\" (magically stopped after November 5th apparently). It all comes at a cost. These chickens come home to roost. I want to be part of it and I'm willing to risk a lot to do it. Just don't know where to start. \n\nI'm posting this request in a few places here on Reddit in the hopes of getting some guidance.",
