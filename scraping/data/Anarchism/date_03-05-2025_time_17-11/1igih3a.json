            "body": "I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to use my property as a commune. I had intended it to be used as a sanctuary for rescue animals and abuse survivors. I had intended on aiming for sponsorships to cover the cost of renovations so I would not be relying on government funding. Typically DV programs rely on government funding. My goal was to ensure that I could provide support without being told that people I supported didn\u2019t meet the requirements. I also ensured never to do anything that put me in a position of becoming a mandated reporter as mothers who are DV victims are far to often held responsible for the acts of offenders providing justification for social services to remove children from non offending parents.\n\nAt this time though, a community relying and supporting each other is probably the only assistance I can provide. I serve a vulnerable population, but I am also vulnerable myself as a single mother with a trans child and a neurodivergent child. I have a very large farmhouse, but it definitely needs work, a lot of which I can\u2019t do on my own. I have an outdoor wood stove, and I had hoped to do a manmade pond at some point. I have a lot of experience in gardening. I can do cosmetic work, but I have no idea what I am doing when it comes to electricity, plumbing, and cutting wood. I figured if each person contributed roughly 7 hours a week, that would be enough. I\u2019m zoned agricultural. I am honestly exhausted though. I have made no progress in the area of building community locally. I keep quiet to keep me and my children off the radar. And I have a very slowly growing brain tumor that no one really knows about. It\u2019s a damn thorn in my side, but lately I am realizing I am not in a good position out here just me and my children. I need to figure this out. I\u2019m open to ideas. Please be kind though. I really am utterly exhausted",
