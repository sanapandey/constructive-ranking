I\u2019ve done small things like speaking at school boards but I don\u2019t think protests are possible for me.\n\nI\u2019m a service dog handler, and to be honest, I\u2019m not as worried about putting myself at risk for a good cause, but obviously a protest would be extremely unsafe for my SD. I\u2019ve considered going to protests without him, but I\u2019m hesitant, given that if I get arrested and I don\u2019t have access to him at all, that could be potentially dangerous for me \n\nWhat should I do to organize with other anarchists/antifa without physically attending protests? I still want to do whatever I can ",

Growing your own food and/or sharing is one of the staples of anarchist action.\u00a0\n\n\nEither start yourself and get people involved when you get better, or join a communal vegetable garden project if you can find it.\n\n\nUnconditional love in any direction is the biggest anti fascist/capitalist etc. Move you can make at any point.\n\n\nAlso any kind of skills that make you and your potential community more independent from industries. Food/technology (repairing/building)/entertainment come to mind.",
