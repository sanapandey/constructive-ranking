The ways in which we desire have changed, every waking minute we must optimize our time for money. Have you ever thought about what you\u2019d be like without your mind being overwritten by these (what I\u2019m calling) manufactured desires? The need to always consume when you aren\u2019t working? The constant worry that you\u2019ll lose everything you have because you got laid off?\n\nTo me this question is nearly unbearable to think about. ",

I'd like to build and run a little heathen (a more historically minded form of Norse Paganism, I'm active in the Inclusive manifestation of it, and it forms a big corner stone of my Pagan Anarchist leanings) chapel, nothing grand, somewhere small and warm and welcoming, somewhere folks can have a little peace and contemplation and the community can come together for festival and feast, and maybe a flock of sheep and goats to look after when I wasn't busy tending to the chapel itself...   \n  \nI like working with livestock, and woolies are a pleasure in particular to me. there's a deep pride to seeing the wool you help bring about clothing your neighbors, and good food stuffs on people's tables, I suspect.",

                            "body": "happily!\n\nso... to start, it involves a little bit of a history lesson, Heathenry (the generally used name for the more Reconstructionist/Revivalist form of Norse/Germanic paganism, contrasted to things like Norse influenced Wicca) has a long story of 2 factions. Prior to the mid 2010s or so, this was the divide between Universalists (a more liberal/progressive approach that treated Heathenry as a open tradition, welcoming to varied degrees to all... some folks were better about it than others. the big org for this is The Troth, a troubled but well meaning national level org), and the Folkists (a catch all for far right folks, ranging from conservatives to outright Fascists who tended to use Heathenry as a manifestation of their politics more than anything, the Asatru Folk Assembly is the big dog on that wing... they were a little quieter about it historically, but they're an open White Supremacist group these days)\n\naround 2016, the Universalist paradigm kind of reached a head, and went through a cultural change, changing from it's 90s and 00s stances of non-racism and non-homophobia, to a more actively anti-bigot footing... right around the time attitudes about Loki being included in ritual came around, now that I think about it... this change in footing is still getting completely settled, particularly in The Troth, but there are alot of informal Inclusive Heathen groups that are active, including the take over of r/heathenry from some less savory types some time ago, and the Discord server associated with it, Skithblathnir (shout out to the folks in both.)\n\nI actively cultivate my practice as an Inclusive one, it's actually what lead to my religious life and political life starting to mesh into Pagan Anarchism concepts. I could talk one's ear off about my ideas of Thor's friendship to working class folks, the Gifting Cycle's and Mutual Aid's similarities and how they compliment each other, and the reclamation of polytheistic worldviews as vital to the abolition of Whitness and authoritarianism, but I'll spare ya'll unless folks want me to start a post for a serious discussion of stuff like that.\n\nbut yeah, Inclusive Heathenry's tendencies is a focus on community togetherness and building, the cycle of reciprocal proportional gifting as a way of strengthening that togetherness both with each other and the greater world (the Gods, the Landspirits, the Ancestors, etc), and a stronger Animistic tendency than Folkist seem to reach for, while there are plenty of IHs that have strong relationships with one or more of the gods, it's far less prevalent amongst Folkists to have anything to do with anything but the Gods.\n\nif you'd like a good primer on heathenry, from someone far the better writer than me, I'd suggest checking out the Longship: [https://thelongship.net/](https://thelongship.net/) it's a very good write up, though not an explicitly Leftist one.\n\n\\~\\~tbh, I think I might fire off a Pagan Anarchism discussion post tomorrow when I get up, I think it could be great fun\\~\\~",

I also get depressed when I try, because it feels so much like an unobtainable fantasy.\n\nI hope to in some small way contribute to the liberation of future generations. That is what gives my life meaning.\n\nAnd since I won\u2019t be there when it\u2019s hopefully eventually achieved, I tend to think of anarchism as more of a direction than a destination in my life. I try to structure my relationships horizontally, try to eliminate hierarchy in my life, try to create conditions in my part of the world that are amenable to an anarchist society. And of course build parallel social structures outside of the bounds of capitalism and the state that reflect all of those values.\n\nI hope that one day my niece and nephews (or more likely their descendants) will cast off the chains, and when they do build a better world than I can imagine.",

I am tired of money worshippers, the mindless consumerism, the atrocious quality of everything and that greed is considered success - I am fortunate enough to have found groups to help, we work towards creating resilient networks - our motivation isn't to collapse capitalism, we're acting on the assumption that it is collapsing by itself (we, the people keep it afloat by eagerly offering it new innovations, but it will only make the collapse worse imo) - our opportunity lies in creating networks of mutual aid that will hopefully flourish when the economy collapses, we hope that it will prevent the descent into a mad max style dystopia.\n\nSome ideas that get me flak is that we don't all need to have jobs all of the time. The point of society is to provide for those struggling, not to multiply the wealth of the affluent. That we have a duty to our planet, it doesn't exist for us to extract from it until it's a dead rock. That an economy based on artificial scarcity is a completely mindless pursuit. That war, oppression and exploitation arise out of the juvenile egos of our elites, who have so little substance that they try to compensate with money.\n\nI wish people dared to dream of a world where everyone can eat - but the general motivation seems to be a kind of pained wail \"but what about me?!\" - which would be fine, if they directed their attention toward the people oppressing them instead of gay folk and immigrants. I'm also dismayed that people who DO have comfortable lives, do so little to progress their consciousness and instead live their life seeking to satisfy the next base desire",

Theres no real point in asking what if, if its impossible to go back. All we can really do, is find ways to break down our thoughts into their fundamental parts and assess our situation from there. One good example: Theft. Stealing doesn\u2019t exist in communist style band societies(tribal could be another term but I think its inaccurate). So if we can recognize that stealing is a social construct of ownership, we can also recognize that stealing is just another way of surviving in a world that inequitably distributes resources. Im not sure where to go from there, because at the end of the day, most capitalists even everyday people will not like the idea of justifying theft in a society that discriminates against it. We see how that plays out today actually. Its pretty standard to just left thieves leave because they have human rights, so assaulting them to get merch back is illegal, which causes animosity in people who work for a living. And around and around we go. I think a better question to work with is this: How much exploitation is necessary for large scale societies to exist? How would a non exploitative large scale society even look?\n\nSorry if I got off track btw I tend to do that.",
