In the right configuration, it is a way for a community to decide on the rules that will apply to everyone.\n\nQuestion 1: Is an HOA anarchic, and why/why not\n\nQuestion 2: If so, does the near-universal loathing of HOAs cast any doubt on Anarchism?\n\nnote- I identify as an Anarchist\n\nUpdate: I HATE HOAs, and I am not trying to shitpost. I am trying to understand how Anarchism avoids the fate of HOAs where the worst people make the rules.\n\nI am really trying to get educated, and I am confused. LOL and downvoting kind of sucks.",

BUT, I recently came across a video showing an eco village that operated as an HOA.  I don\u2019t have all the details of their structure but it sounded like everyone was involved and they truly were in existence to help.  In fact the entire reason they used the HOA setting was to undermine so many of the rules that prohibit collective housing agreements especially when working with off grid and less typical building practices.  Honestly blew my mind that an HOA might actually be able to do some good.  Just a thought.  I\u2019m definitely no expert.\n\nEdit: [FOUND IT](https://youtu.be/-YfcVFExDJE?si=Hbv1GrnOznfNZ8zR)",
