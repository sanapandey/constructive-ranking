    "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nI just wanted to share information about the recent release of the first English edition of the book \"Paraguayan Sorrow\" by Spanish anarchist Rafael Barrett (1876-1910) (originally published posthumously under the title of \"El dolor paraguayo\" in 1911). I was translator and editor of this edition, which is published by Monthly Review Press. It would be fantastic for Barrett's work to get some more traction among English speakers. I think he has a lot to offer!\n\n\"Paraguayan Sorrow\" is a compilation of articles and speeches that Barrett wrote about Paraguay during his 6-year stay in the country (1904-1910), a period cut short by his early death from tuberculosis. The Spaniard became one of the strongest and most cutting voices to speak out against the fierce injustices affecting Paraguayans in the long aftermath of the bloody Triple Alliance War (1864-1870), which had seen more than half of the country's population perish.\n\nHe highlighted the ills suffered by an impoverished population that had been stripped of access to the land by national and international elites. He placed special emphasis on attacking transnational companies that extracted the prized leaf of the yerba mate tree from the depths of Paraguay's forests, subjecting workers to conditions of slavery.\n\nBarrett's anarchist viewpoint has long been celebrated by the Paraguayan left as a source of inspiration for the ongoing struggle against the conditions of imperialist domination that still weigh on the country. His work is currently having something of a resurgence, of which I hope this English edition forms part.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://monthlyreview.org/product/paraguayan-sorrow/\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/11/rafael-barrett-paraguay-writer\n\nhttps://www.counterpunch.org/2024/12/13/on-rafael-barretts-a-radical-voice-in-a-dispossessed-land/\n",
