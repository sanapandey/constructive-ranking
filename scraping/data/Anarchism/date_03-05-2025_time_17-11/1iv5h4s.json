    "selftext": "As this year progresses, I, and many others I assume, am seeing a lack of a comprehensive response to the current fascist take over of the United States government. \n\nWhat I am seeing is many small organizations planning specific actions or protests in support of specific things; like Palestinian Liberation, Queer and Trans Liberation, and POC Liberation. \n\nWhich is good! These are important issues. I am definitely not trying to say these things are bad. All of the efforts are necessary. \n\nBut the issue I am seeing most often is that the turn outs are small. Either because of low support for this specific action, it was planned at an inconvenient time for most people (seeing a lot of stuff scheduled during the work day which keeps me from getting out, as I imagine it keeps others from getting out), or other issues. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to be a doomer, don\u2019t get me wrong. Organizing seems super difficult, large scale organizing seems far worse. \n\nBut so many groups have different plans for different days. PSL is doing one thing, DSA is doing another, CPUSA is doing another. Not to mention smaller local groups. \n\nFrom what I know historically, popular fronts have been formed from socialists to anarchists and liberals to combat fascism and nationalism in say, Spain.\n\nIs there any merit to a coalition of leftist organizations to plan actions together with considerations for how to get the most turn out possible? Actions to resist the fascist take over as a whole, and not in support or against specific issues?\n\nSorry if these are silly questions or discussion, I\u2019m pretty ignorant about leftist organizing and want to know more about it as I\u2019m starting to join groups around me. \n\n(I also posted this in another sub if that\u2019s okay)",

            "body": "Unity should be around shared goals. When the PSL or most other socialist groups have a march the point is to build their membership and get their name out there. When anarchists organize a demo there should always be a focused point. (even if it's to see what capacity is)\u00a0\n\n\nSo when antifash demos were a common occurrence there was strategic and tactical unity with crews/groups that did not share our politics but were gonna be in the streets at the same time trying to do the same thing. It was safer for everyone if there was some amount of communication.\n\n\nThere is a common desire to jump past the slow process of organizing or building affinity and trying to make common cause with other groups that APPEAR to share our values. This always ends badly for anarchists.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso, turnout is generally not the main goal. Protests can be used to gauge sympathy, help people find each other, keep a campaign going or build a smokescreen for other things but otherwise are useless and burnout organizers. Do not organize stationary protests unless it fits into your wider goals.",
