I have a friend who got super into this sort of thing and then when he finally got his chance, he was in a scrum of dozens of cops, anti fascists and fascists, and all he managed to do was bonk one of the Nazis on the head with a traffic cone.\n\nBy all means learn martial arts \u2013 it's a good thing to do irrespective of political reasons \u2013 but ultimately what makes this sort of anti fascism successful is numbers and preparation, not individual fighting skills. Things like the Battle of Cable Street were successful because the anti fascists out mobilized the fascists, not because anti fascists were exceptionally talented fighters.",

Would sign up to a gym that offers either MMA, BJJ, Muay Thai/Kickboxing or boxing.\n- I think an able bodied person with 3 months- 1 year of BJJ experience is able to beat the vast majority of other people (Of the same gender & similar strength level) in a fight. Simply because most people don\u2019t know anything about grappling\n- Muay Thai or Boxing will definitely help you feel more confident in a fight. Most people\u2019s biggest fear is getting punched, so exposure to that goes a long way\n- I recommend going to an mma gym & getting exposed to both some striking & grappling; within a year of training a couple times a week you should feel much more confident in defending yourself \n\nSource: Pro fighter & coach",

If you're lucky enough to live in a place where people generally don't have guns then don't start running around with a BB gun.  The cops will think it's real and shoot you.  The minimal self defence benefit is not worth it.  If you live in a place where tasers and pepper spray are illegal then don't get them.  The legal consequences of being caught with them is not worth the minimal self defence benefit.  The first sentence is good advice.",
