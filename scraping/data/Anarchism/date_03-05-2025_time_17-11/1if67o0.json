I have them automatically sorted into a specific folder so as to not clutter and overwhelm my main inbox.\n\nAlso - I surprisingly find a lot of good articles on the default news aggregator that appears on an empty tab on the Firefox browser. More general knowledge - but occasionally also good articles regarding more serious content.",
