I appreciate that you don't believe in representative electoralism, I don't particularly believe in it either, but apparently no one's Luigi-ing a way out of this either. Quite frankly, wasting our time and energy putting Democrats down feels like it mostly serves to distract ourselves and export any responsibility for the failures of our own methods, and looking around, the most it seems to accomplish in real terms is greasing the wheels of the fascist machine so it can go full speed ahead. Palestine isn't freed. There's no Medicare for All or CEO heads being put on spikes en masse. I've yet to really see how it's more than a bunch of talk to put ourselves over, and in the meantime all it really does is make it that much easier for the real shitheads to get real power and evade direct blame while they run roughshod over millions of people.\n \nTake an honest look in the mirror and ask yourself what you've done to stop this, and more importantly, why it hasn't worked.",

Chomsky was my gateway into radical thought during the Occupy days.\n\nFunny enough, having been involved in Occupy and I know he was an advocate for OWS, I haven't read any Graeber books, but he is on the list. Just finished up some Voltairine De Cleyre. Would recommend. Maybe I'll move Graeber up the queue. Any book stand out for you in particular?\n\nI can hear what you're saying more clearly, but I don't think criticizing politicians and calling for them to do their damn job while continuing to be willing to organize with other folks (including liberals/dems where we can agree) is abdicating anything. I think criticism of hypocritical and opportunistic capitalist politicians is a key part of propaganda for The Beautiful Idea. I think that critique isn't the whole thing; we have to organize and try to build the new world and remind people that they should take their autonomy back. \n\nI guess what I'm getting at is I'm not going to show up to a large-tent event and start shitting on rank-and-file libs. But I think pointing out that Dem Reps and Sens keep voting in line with the current admin's agenda and that we can't count on representatives to uphold their own rhetoric and work in our best interest shouldn't be off limits. Especially when, ya know, even someone who loves to claim she's \"progressive\" like Klobuchar keeps enabling this stuff. Being a dick to regular folks doesn't win any anarchy points and it doesn't help get shit better. But thoughtful critiques of the structures and people in power can radicalize a person. I know that watching people critiquing Obama during 2011-2012 radicalized me.\n\nAlso, I don't fucking have the answers. And anyone pretending to is probably trying to sell you something. People, myself included, like to talk shit on the internet. Critique is easy. Community building and harm reduction and care work is hard.\n\nSorry for the ramble.",

Like, there are a lot of complaints about the two party system that don't really reckon with how it disciplines dissent on the wings. If you stray too far from the center, the half of the duopoly you agree with even less reap the rewards far more often than the radicals do, and I think that's something we need to maintain an awareness of. That's why so many people keep crawling back to the major parties, not because they love or trust establishment politicians but because they're even more afraid of what the other side of the establishment might do, and they're not necessarily wrong to feel that way.\n\n>Also, I don't fucking have the answers.

I just think we'd all be better off with a little humility in the face of these deep and abiding problems.
