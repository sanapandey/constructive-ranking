My own country is actively committing atrocities, rampad capitalism and neo-colonialism are destroying our earth , women's right, trans rights, and queer rights are being thrown to the wood chipper and it's just the beginning. \n\nI want to protest and be an active person against all these wrongs ,but I'm deeply afraid and conflicted about violence, though I know from history that all revolutions need both non violent and violent activism to succeed, and I do believe that protests should be an active disorder of the status quo and not supported or \"protected\" by police forces I am terrible afraid. \n\nI have cptsd partly from being physically abused most of my life,  and still haunted by the sensation of violence and the way my body reacted, I decided a long time ago that I will never physically harm another living being (and will try my best to not harm in any other forms anyone at all) and this promise has been a piller of my identity for as long as I can remember, I don't know if I could even break that promise and still be me, just thinking about it makes me scream and cry internally and at times even physically convulse. \n\nAlso, one of my most crucial steps in healing was the relationship I developed with my self /younger self, and the promise I will always support and protect myself physically and emotionally, which means going to a violent protest where I will also witness violence, experience it myself and might even need to self defend against police violence makes my skin crawl, it makes me feel alone, unsafe, abonded, and to feel in my body the sensation I am so horribly haunted and ashamed of, what if I freeze again, what if I feel like a corpse again being moved around by others punches and gropes, I want to throw up just thinking about it. \n\nWhat do I do?

It's debatable how effective protests are to begin with.\n\nYou could instead make posters, stickers, or graffiti to spread information, or make it a habit to check in on immigrants or queer people in your life that might be in danger and support them however you can. Just going around town and covering up removing fascist propaganda or dog whistles would be doing a lot. A lot of fascists feel emboldened right now so we need to make sure to be louder than ever.\n\nI don't think going somewhere that might trigger your CPTSD or put yourself or others in danger would be the best use of your time and energy. You have to take care of yourself too!",

Op, learn first aid, learn to cook bulk meals for cheap and food safety, if you have spare warm clothes or spare cash to buy some, unhoused folk would probably greatly appreciate that. Giving resources (like dv resources and locations of food banks/shelters). If you don't have many resources yourself getting in touch with mutual aid or trying to start one with trusted allies. All of these will have so much more of a tangible impact. Not everyone has to protest, and I understand not everyone is equipped to. Rest assured that you have important skills that can be utilized in alternative ways :)",

            "body": "There's no reason to harm yourself (mentally or physically). You're not a bad activist for not wanting to face or engage in violence.\n\nAs you probably already know all protests and other forms of activism need people 'on the frontline' so to speak, but also need people doing a lot of other stuff:\n\nThe saying goes that for every fighter we need 10 support. This is true but I don't like that framing because it glamorizes one role while all of them are worth doing and necessary. If you want to be part of a protest but avoid direct confrontation it can be worth looking into other roles.\n\nIf you do want to go to a protest and potentially face violence try to do so in the safest circumstances possible. \n\nPlan extensively. Look up the location beforehand. Scout the day before it if possible. Go with friends who are aware of your fears and trauma and who have been explicitly told how to react when things get hard for you. Walk them through what might happen and how they can help you. \n\nYou can absolutely practice mindfulness at a protest. Mindfulness isn't as amazing at the people trying to sell it make it out to be but it *can* help you stay more grounded. Practicing in advance will make it easier to do under stress.\n\nIf that's something that feels ok for you maybe look up some video or written reports. Most of what you see online is *probably* going to be worse than what you face if you're careful but it'll help you get a feel of what *could* happen:\n\nDon't attend in black bloc and stay away from the front. At least at first. Know that situations can suddenly change but also that most protests have different segments with different risk tolerance. If you stay near people who aren't looking for a confrontation with the police there's a high chance you can just walk away from the protest whenever that feels necessary.\n\nBring the right supplies and make sure your friends do too. If you'd feel better with a skate helmet and goggles: bring those. Pack enough water and some snacks. Some first aid stuff. Something to cover your face can be a good precaution even if you don't plan on masking up. \n\nWhat can sometimes also help (but maybe after you get a bit used to being at protests) is to have a clear role to focus on. Carrying a flag, making sure your affinity group sticks together, handing out water, taking pictures (avoid taking photos of people's faces), handing out flyers or stickers, keeping an eye on the cops, &c.",

It may take some time to find it but I hope you will get there safely. <3",

            "body": "Here's how I conceptualise it.\n\nYou aren't responsible or accountable for the harm that other people chose to inflict on you. You also aren't responsible for the continuing effect that experience has on you, only for how you're managing it. You are aware of, and take reasonable steps to reduce exposure to, your triggers. That sounds like healthy coping and is totally excused by your cptsd.\n\nThat means you shouldn't feel shame or guilt if you can't face a protest environment in a way that is healthy for you. When things get violent like that it does inflict (more) trauma on protestors. Your cup is already full - you don't need to try and hold onto more.\n\nThere is lots of other good activism work that isn't protest-related - but if you really want to contribute to protests there's also organisational work that goes into protests both before and after. If you drive, people need transport to protests and you might be able to help get several people there who wouldn't otherwise go and then go be safe until they need a ride home.",

Not recommended, in fact, I just looked up cptsd and i think I've got similar. \n\nThere are plenty of other, possibly more important, ways to contribute.\n\nFind your strengths, get involved with people you trust, and let them know your triggers. \n\nDon't feel bad about not getting involved in the gritty stuff... it's really not that important.",

By that I mean permanent change, not something that does individual case work but no policy advocacy, for instance.\n\nSee what tasks they need done. Almost all organizers could use administrative support, meeting notes, follow up emails, things like that. Arrestable actions need jail support. Organizers need people willing to create social media content to get their message out. There\u2019s plenty you can do that\u2019s important and useful and doesn\u2019t involve going head to head with police.",

Indeed we have stood trial and passed many a long month in prison for precisely these things. Meanwhile, as a rule, our gatherings and lectures are usually attended only by comrades who are already believers, our manifestoes are scarcely read and soon torn down, and our banners are poorly understood if at all. So I wonder , given the results produced by these things, whether they are worth the trouble of exposing the bravest of us to the danger of being taken out of circulation for a long time at intervals.\n\"Something occurs to me. Would it not be a good idea for groups of comrades, on such anniversaries and of course choosing the place, time, and manner likely to have the greatest impact, to burst into the wealthiest grocery, clothing, footwear stores, etc., and hand out their contents to poor folk passing by or loitering there? And, out in the countryside, could small teams of daring folk not unexpectedly swamp the landowners' warehouses, invite the peasants to follow suit and grab and carry home some wheat, oil, wine, tools, and everything to be found there?\n\"And if, in the doing of these things, our principles will be spoken of and manifestoes distributed to explain the action, tell of past struggles, and hint at the battles and victories in the near future, then the event of which we are celebrating the anniversary will indeed be etched into people's minds and will serve as propaganda and exam-ple.\u201d",
