I know there are lots of books written from the perspective of one ideology but I want something more comparative. And I don't just mean \"Marxism vs. Anarchism\", I mean all the sub-groups, too.\n\nBonus if it goes into the actual praxis of how each one achieves their goal - I'm especially interested in how we all view mass mobilization differently. Thanks!",
