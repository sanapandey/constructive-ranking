    "selftext": "I hope it's okay to ask this here -- this seems to be one of the only subs with discussions about broad community involvement, unless I overlooked something. \n\nThe election cycle has whipped up a lot of fear and anxiety, as usual, and in response there are a lot of calls to get organized and become involved within your community, as usual. I don't mean to sound dismissive or jaded, it's just that at nearly 30 this isn't my first rodeo, but I am feeling very small and very ineffective this time around. \n\nI live in the deep south, one of those \"blue dots in a sea of red\" type cities. It likes to project itself as progressively-minded, but it's just very status-quo liberal. Still I was able to connect with some more radical folks out here (there aren't many!) and it felt like there was hope for forging community and strong connections and doing good work. \n\nBut I ended up having really terrible experiences with local community organizing efforts. The most upsetting was with an anarchist group that I worked with for about a year, which ultimately kicked me out of the organizing space for being lgbtq and neurodivergent -- in their words, it made things 'awkward' and made other people 'uncomfortable'. Then proceeded to steal from me and threaten violence against me. \n\nI moved on to other projects and groups but they all fell apart. One project that really felt like it was going to make a difference ended up selling out for corporate funding and threw its principles under the bus. Other groups and organizations lost steam and membership as folks moved away or lost interest, and eventually folded their chapters. And others, that ableist/transphobic anarchist group ended up taking over. \n\nFor awhile some of us tried to start our own community group & independent projects. But the oft-given advice, \"Just organize the community/set up mutual aid networks/do the projects yourself!\" is so much harder than it sounds in practice. We realized we didn't have a lot of experience under our belts but \"organizing veterans\" we appealed to for guidance were burnt out and wanted nothing to do with any more of it. So we just gave it our best try, and I know the idea is that if you set an example folks will see and become involved, but that isn't what happened. Definitionally, this isn't work that can be done by yourself or with just 2 or 3 people. The logistics aren't possible. We didn't do a damn bit of good, but we sure exhausted ourselves spinning our tires in the mud. \n\nGet involved. Get organized. Make a difference. Don't look away. Don't choose inaction. I've tried and I've failed. I'm not in a position where I can support anything financially. I don't have the experience, the knowledge, or skills to found something new from the ground up. I'm trying not to be just another burnt-out, jaded old timer. I'm trying not to be defeatist or apathetic. I still try to do what little I can, but it's not enough. Where do you go from here? ",

You do have to be realistic about your resources and capabilities. A monthly community kitchen *is* sorta doable with just two or three people. It's easier with more (and you can make more interesting food) but it's something you could do and it's something that might bring you into contact with others. \n\nThat's just one option. What you could also do is ask two questions: What does my community need right now? and: What can I do? Be honest. Don't overestimate yourself (that's the easy way to burn out) but also don't sell yourself short in advance. People tend to severely overestimate the skills and knowledge they need to organize effectively. One of the most important 'skills' is being willing to start doing something. \n\nFinally I'd also like to say that an anarchist group kicking someone out for being queer and neurodivergent isn't acceptible. Did you meet people in that group that seemed somewhat chill or even hesitant about the behavior of others? Sometimes people make do with the organizing that exists somewhere, and these are people who might be willing to spend time and energy on other projects.",

I am in a position where I'm working two jobs, potentially picking up a third because ends aren't quite meeting. I can't really donate to anything financially right now, and my spare time is limited. Projects I've become involved in with just two or three other people have ended up demanding more time and energy than I can give. There became an expectation that I must pour every waking moment I had into the project, and if I didn't then I didn't truly care. I had to step back from those projects because I wasn't able to meet my own needs at the end of the day, and that isn't healthy. \n\nIn the 8 years I've been at this, I've tried all sorts of things -- things that are more traditional community organizing spaces, including community kitchens in various forms, and things that are less so, like setting up a sewing circle because that's like the one skill I have and thought folks might be interested in? I'll spare you the play-by-play or else this comment would be a novel (unless you really want to know) but every attempt just collapsed. The projects got co-opted, or the initial interest dried up, and so on. I don't know what to do with that, because clearly the approach I've been taking isn't successful. \n\nAnd yeah -- it's super messed up that they did that. I guess I learned the hard way that just because a group calls themselves anarchist (or leftist or radical or...) doesn't mean they actually have inclusive values. When that happened I did confront other people in the group and asked if they agreed, if they felt the same way. And... most of them did. A couple said they were \"staying out of it\" because it \"wasn't their business.\" Only one individual stood up for me (but working with that person is not an option now or in the future, unfortunately). It really sucks.",

If things don't work out because you're the only one doing that, try not to take that too personally. I've seen this happen as well and it's why I believe nothing should ever be just one person's responsibility.\n\nFrom what you write it seems like your life is already pretty exhausting. Organizing *is* important and valuable but it shouldn't come at the expense of your health. Anyone expecting you to go beyond what you're able to do shouldn't be trusted. They don't have your best interests in mind. \n\nIt's okay to take care of yourself. We all do what we can and sometimes that means we take a step back from organizing",

When I was new in town I heard about an environmental protest and just showed up with a bit anarchist sign. I had no idea what I was doing. I appeared to be the only person of that persuasion there, but it turned out to be a great conversation starter. One of the folks I talked to was associated with our local Food Not Bombs chapter, and that's how I got tapped into my local community organizing scene. The bigoted anarchist group I described in my post I found though a flier posted to a lamp pole, and so I just reached out and joined up. It was great until it wasn't. So it's really a crapshoot... while I did meet some incredible people this way, and a lot of really awful people and orgs as well, so just be careful out there.",

If you're the one who is starting stuff, some people might join in and love what you're doing and thanking you a lot, but often that's where the involvement ends. My initiative ended up in me becoming a bit of an unpaid, spare time entertainer for other people, and when I had to step away due to burning out, everyone was \"so sad\" but nobody stepped up to keep it going. \n\nSo if I ever had the energy to start something again (and I doubt I ever will, the thought alone makes me tired), I would try to be very aware from the start that everyone involved needs to seriously involve themselves and carry some serious load - tedious organising labour, emotional labour, the whole damn thing. Not just the fun parts. \n\nLone wolf living is becoming more attractive to me after all of this tbh. I tend to my garden and quietly and randomly give my support to people or projects, but very sparingly and in alignment with my energy levels. Sometimes that's all one can do.",

Once I'd been burned by the toxic organizing spaces and all the good groups in my area collapsed, I really did try to take the initiative myself and start new projects. I did it probably more times than I should have tbh (something something the definition of insanity), and every time it ended up exactly as you describe it: people are enthusiastic but no one wants to truly take on any labor, and one or two people end up taking it all on, and that's unsustainable and burns you out quickly but everyone has an excuse for why they can't step in and take some of the load off your shoulders, so either the project collapses or you do (and so the project collapses anyway). I was trying to do all this on top of working two jobs, keeping house, and caring for aging parents. \n\nIdeally there would be some kind of community project that is highly organized, directed by folks who know what they are doing and have the experience and resources to actually execute it (especially for even distribution of workloads!) but alas, nothing like that exists in my region. \n\nI hear you on how attractive lone wolf'ing it seems. A part of me is always wanting to just fuck off into the woods. But, a larger part of me feels obligated to keep trying to be involved in community, to keep trying to find or build the village. This spring I'm planting a garden with a few friends. It's not a community garden and I don't think the small scale of it will help anyone on a larger scale. But it does feel like all I can do for now.",

For a moment, let go of this need to \u201cget organized\u201d and just imagine what it means to live a life according to your radical values. Make friends that support you and support them back. Work on your trauma. Cook at home. Wherever you can fight for those pieces and gain mental and emotional space and power for yourself, you open the doors to your own creativity and alignment. \n\nNot all folks appreciate this analysis, but I believe we live in a world that lacks any unifying narrative. Rather than stress about this, lean into what particularly gives you strength and inspiration. Eventually affinity will follow authenticity.",

On one hand, it really does make logical and intuitive sense -- \"you can't pour from an empty cup\" and all that. We do our best work when we are in good health mind body and spirit and in order to most effectively show up for others we must also show up for ourselves. \n\nOn the other hand, and especially recently, I've been bombarded with messaging about how selfish it is to prioritize things like that when everything is so dire, there are n+1 atrocities happening every day and if you aren't getting organized right this second then you're an enabler of violence and a traitor to your and/or the global community. And as much as I know that the news and social media have a way of distorting these things and a vested interest in keeping us all panicked and afraid, I guess I'm just not immune to it. \n\nThe funny thing is I've given this same advice to a dear comrade of my own, one who also seems to internalize more of the panic and need-to-be-involved-right-now mindset. They've recently started a sports club that has really flourished; not only are they happier and more inspired than I've ever seen them, it's enabled them to make so many more connections and cultivate more of a sense of community than any of our mutual aid projects ever accomplished. But because it's not community rooted in political activism, they think it doesn't \"count.\" I will reflect more upon what you've said. Thank you.",

I\u2019ll add another thought if that\u2019s okay.\n\nI believe the only way non-hierarchical ways of relating will exist is if we build relationships of trust. In capitalism and neoliberalism, we allow money and status/merit to take the place of trustworthiness. Sustainable organizing requires us to invest heavily in our relationships, and I embrace the notion that no one is disposable because the status quo finds us all easily replaceable. Any organizing that neglects this fact is doomed to recreate the exact systems and methods that oppress us. \n\nIn other words, there\u2019s no shortcuts to this. Relationship and trust building simply takes time. In contrast, the language of mobilizing on social media is urgent, immediate, and based in shame. It doesn\u2019t have an interest in building relationships. While the crises are indeed urgent, we owe it to each other to do things right so that we stop wasting time building absolutely no power and repeating history again and again. There is no mass power without relationships, and we have to commit to our belief in such a power if we want liberation to be realized. \n\nAlso we don\u2019t get to decide the next insurrection. It\u2019ll just happen when it does typically kicked off as a combination of weather, political climate, and significant event. Better to find 3 good comrades you trust to have your back in the streets than 100 politically aligned acquaintances. Best of luck, comrade!",
