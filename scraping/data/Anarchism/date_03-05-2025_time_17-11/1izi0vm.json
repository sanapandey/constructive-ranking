I think I had seen a similar image, but without Zen's Enso symbol, the circular brush stroke, around the yin yang.\n\nI had read some of the Tao in my teens, but my main focus became Zen, and I officially began identifying as a Zen Buddhist in '06. Tanahasi also has deep root in Zen Buddhism, I think that's why his translation of the Tao speaks to me a bit more than the others I have looked at so far.",

Great tool, probably the content of the rest of my evening! Thanks for the inspiration to find it!\n\n\nI don't really like this take too much though.\n\n\nI'd say the idea of the verse ( if we compare it with most others) would be that justice arises out of injustice and injustice likewise out of justice.\n\n\nThat without oppression there is no relevant notion of freedom\n\n\nThere is no life without death.\n\n\nBy naming and forming a concept a duality arises. By not naming, it disappears into the emptiness that might be called tao.\n\n\nTherefore they are both present at the same time.\u00a0\n\n\nThis version on the other hand, gives the impression that justice and injustice etc. Cannot share the same space. Which is understandable as it's an activist take.\u00a0\n\n\nThe end brings it back to my understanding of the verse again.\u00a0",

            "body": "Yeah, sure and this topic makes me want to bring up something I've been talking about quite a bit lately in the context of the history of socialism and how early socialists picked up some nasty tendencies way back in the early days of the 19th century in the Napoleonic era that set the stage for Marx. \n\nSo why is it that so-called \"socialist\" countries seem to have this seemingly odd prejudice against substances like cannabis or LSD which are not addictive and encourage empathetic behavior? You would think these would be embraced by socialists but they're not in most cases. Even more curiously is this prohbition against non-binary gender identities. Why should socialists criminalize homsexuality? That doesn't seem to make sense at first glance. \n\nBut it does make sense if you look at the context in which socialist thought developed in the aftermath of the so-called \"Englightenment\" in the age of European imperialism. The key term here is \"progress\" and a belief in a heirarchical progression from darkness into the light. In the context of this Hegelian process, the mystery of these socialist taboos comes into focus. \n\nIt is this emphasis on heirarchical thinking that underlies these flaws in socialist ideology that oppresses the individuals in the name of \"progress\" for the state that then become synonymous with industrial production or even GDP. That is all about hierachy. This is where the Tao is so important to anarchist thought: it is contra-hierarchical. The true way is not a straight path, it is crooked. Hierarchy is the illusion of forward movement. The Tao is curving and meandering.\n\nJesus' teachings borrowed from this  as well. What did Jesus say that his followers should do when they are struck in the face? He said that his followers should turn the other cheek. This is irrational but it is what Jesus taught. This sort of thing is where the socialist lose the game. They obsess over belief in a hierarchical model of \"progress\" that ultimately leaves very little difference between themselves and their supposed enemies, the feudalists/capitalists.",
