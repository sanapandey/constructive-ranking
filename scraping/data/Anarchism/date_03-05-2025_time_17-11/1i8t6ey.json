But the big picture I thought of is that this action could reduce inflation. Inflation is caused by over production of money, so maybe if this spreads nation wide the government may choose to throw away these bills \ud83e\udd14 just a thought. But it\u2019s definitely a slow process if it gains traction. ",

Joining an org - or even just meeting up with other leftists - is a lot more fruitful than some sharpie on Honest Abe's face. [IWW](https://www.iww.org/), [SRA](https://socialistra.org/), [Food Not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net/new_site/) - meet up with some local like-minded folks, make some friends, and make a difference for people in your community. Or, if one doesn't exist where you live, start one!\n\nWhatever you decide to do, OP - best of luck, friend!",

There's a lot here though because we don't live purely physical lives anymore so affecting our digital environment is still an avenue for dissent apart from social media. I am also reminded of McKenna's \"Culture is not your friend buddy\" that we should strive to create culture rather than consume it. Particularly when there are ways for our corps to turn the information they gather against us.\n\nThere are lots of ways to organise online though and community organisations always need help - you might be making visual content, you might help with documentation, recording audiobooks, whatever skills you might have can be applied to the digital sphere - with the increased reliance on digital surveillance, any steps we take to sabotage that is revolutionary (for example people have started to create networks to track ICE, or maybe signing up an immigrant tip line or your republican politician for spam emails, I don't really want to say too much here honestly, but tug at this thread a bit further) - if you know how to code there's a world of opportunity - the groups I work with, I've recently been really surprised by the power of maps (seems mundane on the surface but networks reach so much further than we can as individuals) - even if you don't code, there are various tools that people have created - for example being a node on the TOR network you're helping to make people harder to track (double edged sword though). Or maybe you share files or data that are hard for people to access otherwise - I don't know what your skills or experiences are, but being disabled or stuck inside does not mean that you can't participate",
