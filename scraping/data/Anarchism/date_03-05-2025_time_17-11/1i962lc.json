Not everyone can afford to be everywhere, but I\u2019m glad that someone who can, does. \n\nAlso the USA has been a laughing stock for decades I feel. But now more people have access it seems. Now they can see our shame and we can see their mockery.",

No one is standing up in a meaningful way yet, and we haven't for years. Sad that we'll need to follow the lead of people in other countries, but nonetheless this will encourage more of us to be braver and openly angry, to assemble and protest as is our right, and hopefully to make our voices heard like there's no tomorrow.",
