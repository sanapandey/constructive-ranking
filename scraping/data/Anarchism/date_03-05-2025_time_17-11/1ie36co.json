Do you feel you will get back into it?\n\nEdit: I take heart to all your struggles, so many shared experiences do give me a sense of real solidarity that we are frustrated, and the way of things must change.

            "body": "I... truly don't know if I can answer this in a reddit comment. It's either a giant essay, which I don't have the time/energy to write right now, or a quick comment that's going to be super reductionist and won't capture a lot of the nuances of my perspective(s) on organizing.\n\nSo... as a compromise, here's a random assortment of relevant thoughts, in no particular order:\n\n* So much Whiteness in DSA, especially in the powerful cliques/factions that run the big chapters. By Whiteness, I mean fragility, defensiveness, inability to hold multiple truths, weaponizing identity... Basically all the toxic dynamics of Power that make us (anarchists) go \"see? this is why we're against power and hierarchies\"\n\n* A lot of Do-Somethingism. As in, people tend to think that just because they're Doing Something, it's good and positive and contributing to The Fight. Y'know, sometimes the answer is Not to do something. Sometimes it's to rest. Or hide. Or plan and prepare for the right moment. Or to Do Something Else.\n\n* Which leads me to... I think a lot of activism/organizing is about chasing a feeling that you're a Good Person (because you're Doing Something). Which... isn't a bad thing, but it's a little bit cart before the horse.\n\n* I have big misgivings about ungrounded, unrooted struggle. Places like DSA (and many other orgs) are not rooted in a shared site of struggle. A workplace, an apartment building, a school, a neighborhood... These things ground us, they pose clear problems to address, they give us a clear community of people to struggle alongside, and they shape our goals and strategies. I almost don't see the point of organizing outside of a site of struggle except to find community with like-minded folks.\n\n* BUT, if we can only organize with people who already think exactly like us, we're fucked. A lot of Left tendencies are complete dogshit at talking to and connecting with non-ideological / non-radicalized people. This is NOT a class-reductionist or TERF dogwhistle. I'm not some asshole going \"uwu the bwue cowwar wowking cwass isnt weady fow twans people.\" No, I'm just talking about meeting people where they're at, not being scared/threatened by people's shitty opinions, and being able to explain your beliefs without constant buzzwords and jargon.",

Yet they still push themselves to find time to participate in multiple radical orgs. They're carrying so much.\n\nThat's the next nut I'm trying to crack in terms of organizing. Like.. how do we make World Change into something that eases our burdens rather than adds to them.

I feel like 2 years ago when I started reading more theory and anarchist history, despite identifying as an anarchist for most of my adult life, is when I began to look around and question what I was doing. That maybe just being a yes man to community organizing wasn't helpful to my own life, as well as maybe some of the projects weren't worth the effort. Working a lot with libs and marxist leninists...it began to seem not the right thing to be doing with my time. I still organize, but much less, and I'm figuring out where I want to put the bulk of my time. Until then I'll continue my bookclubs, learning about preserving foods, spending time with my community",

With my ex friend because he was initiating social dynamics and activity, also because they had a better affinity with him of course. Despite the fact that he was a manipulative violent misogynist and it was known by everybody. I discovered shortly after quitting that i am autistic. I guess that explain why it happened to me.\n\nHonestly while i deeply want to do something and can't even imagine living without fighting. I'm just hopeless now.

            "body": "I never stopped, per se, but I have stepped back and refocused on labor, music, and community self defense work to the exclusion of basically everything else, whereas I used to be heavily involved in many different types of organizing at a time. I should be clear that I am a highly involved organizer in the areas I am doing work in. But, some people who used to organize with me consider me almost retired from organizing because I don't work in the lines of work they do, anymore.\n\nA few factors for me refocusing included:\n\n1. Burnout. I was, at one point, the chair of five separate committees and working groups, organizing in my workplace, and running an exhausting and even traumatizing gauntlet of community self defense work. Our organization had rapid growth and expansion, but too much of the membership wanted to mobilize for actions but not do the day to day labor of organizing. Our core membership, including myself, failed to adequately do political education, training, onboarding, and delegation of tasks, because the period of struggle (first Trump presidency) was so intense. These contradictions contributed to our group's collapse, but also contributed greatly to my burnout. It didn't help that, the more work you take on the for the movement, the more you take the blame for anything that goes wrong, AND, the more people identify you as someone in leadership, even when you're actively pushing power away. So, they start resenting you. I organized in a completely burned out state for several years. It was only in this last year that I allowed myself to \"take a break\" (while still being active in a workplace campaign, for which I was recently fired in a retaliatory move) by just dropping most of my political work and spending about nine months just playing Grand Strategy and CRPG games, after having not touched video games since I started organizing around 15 years ago. It was a needed break, and helped me recharge something in me that I had forgotten to feel- a certain elasticity of the spirit, a sense of hope and vigor.\n2. Frustration with the movement having problems learning lessons. This was especially hard for in 2020 and the years immediately after it. I was in the epicenter of the GF Uprising, in Minneapolis- I was there when the first gas canisters were shot, was watching when the precinct burned, all that. This isn't breaking info security to say- the police info already know; I was an uprising arrestee. There were a lot of growing pains, especially with the newly radicalized folks who had a LOT of confidence and a lot of Dunning-Kruger effect going on. The young militant activists often prided themselves on not listening to anyone over 30, which meant not listening to most of the veterans of summit hopping, Occupy, or even the first waves of BLM protests during the Obama years. So many mistakes were being repeated, over and over- a focus on congregating in an autonomous zone rather than organizing across the whole city, a hyper security culture that actually made it easier for infiltrators and abusers to move in the movement, a TON of movement grifters and opportunists, very poorly planned and executed actions, failures to organize legal support for people, a lot of adventurism and action fetishism, a disregard for workplace or tenant organizing among self-described anticapitalists, terrible practices around how to deal with abusers, etc etc etc. Those of us who had been doing work for some time, by that point, were often ignored when we offered perspective or advice- especially if we didn't tick the identity boxes that some of the very identity-focused young activists wanted. I remember, for example, offering an organizing training to a rapidly growing tenant organizing campaign, which the experienced organizers in the campaign really wanted me to do. But, as I started promoting the training, a group of white women started demanding that I step back and make space for women of color to do the training. *No woman of color WANTED to do the training, and several women of color- including my whole committee at my apartment building- wanted me to train people,* but this group of white women took it upon themselves to make it a PROBLEM in the group that the training was being given by a white man. So, I had to step back and not give the training, because this discourse was just taking over the group and nothing could get done. No one learned the nuts and bolts of organizing, and the tenant campaign (*which would have primarily benefitted women of color)* fell apart.\n3. Changes in my arrestability. After my uprising arrest, it became apparent to me that even when I was arrested on minor charges, LE would be willing to harass family members of mine. I have family members who are very vulnerable, for reasons I won't talk about in this comment, so I simply can't take the sort of risks I used to.\n\n(cont below)",

My first org I was in, our local grouping fell apart over a conflict with the broader national grouping, and also over local conflicts (and endless accountability processes for a few people) that drained absolutely all of our time and energy dealing with, leading to a death spiral of involvement. That conflict was over real political issues (the broader org didn't want us doing antifascist work), but got incredibly toxic as people began digging up SA cases that had been covered up years before most of us were involved in the group, and weaponizing them (in ways frankly disrespectful to, and often without the consent of, the survivors) against the opposing faction. What was terrifying, was realizing just how many SA cases so many left groups have in their closet!  \n   \nThe second org I was in, two identity-focused factions formed and began a bitter feud with one another. The leaders of them were two fairly newly politicized but very active (and overconfident) people who-- unknown to the people they were leading into this feud-- had just had an affair and a messy breakup. They were basically weaponizing the membership of the organization to get even with their ex, and pushing more and more strident identity reductionism. It got to the point where these activists, who had joined an explicitly labor focused org, were refusing to walk on picket lines in solidarity with workers if they thought they workplace was too white or male, even if the workplace, such as the local refinery that was on strike, was actually full of POC and women workers. They'd have known that if they'd gone to the picket line with us!  \n  \nBoth of the factions accused the broader org of siding with the other faction, and they both quit en masse. The POC faction- whose main demand was that men of color wouldn't be held accountable for misogyny or even for SA, because that's carceral white feminism- called us racist white feminist queerphobes for siding with the women's caucus (we didn't). The women's caucus- which was becoming increasingly TERF in an organization founded by an almost entirely queer original crew, which was going to lead their expulsion before they quit- denounced us as misogynists for siding with the POC caucus (we didn't). All of us left in the group were the ones who hadn't sided with anyone, and *included almost all of the women of color.*   \n  \nSpeaking of which, the movement has had a real problem with not being willing to hold people accountable for harmful actions on very identitarian grounds. There are several deeply toxic, violent, repeat abusers in our city who have successfully avoided accountability for years by claiming any attempt to hold them accountable is anti-queer, even when the people they are hurting (manipulating, assaulting, sexually abusing, stealing from, endangering with terrible conduct at actions, recruiting into dead-end campaigns by lying about how the campaigns are going, etc etc) are *mostly young queer adults.*\n\n5. Boredom with performative actions. Marching from A to B is a huge part of local protest culture, and once you stop doing marches that have no purpose, you gain a LOT of time to do actual organizing.  \n(continued below)",

I saw a copwatch group I formed, for example, adopt such a hyper-focus on secrecy that they didn't even inform other people in the neighborhood that a copwatch project existed, and instead just recruited their friends. They then became very distraught that the membership of the group was less diverse than the neighborhood. I tried to bring neighbors into it, like the women of color on our tenant committee, but the hyper secrecy of it all turned them off. The copwatch group spent weeks in very emotional internal talks about changing the white culture of their organizing, while refusing to just *talk to neighbors of color or anyone else who wasn't young and radical-looking*.  \n  \nA lot of people treat organizing as a hobby for young adults, and it becomes way more noticeable as you get older, that for example meetings rarely have food or childcare or other things that make them accessible to people with families. This means people drop out of organizing when they start families, and their generational knowledge is lost, which along with just straight-up ageism, especially against older women, feeds back into the problem of the movement not learning lessons from past struggles.\n\n7. Frustration with people not being willing to do the reproductive labor of organizing. So many people want to just mobilize for actions, but are unwilling to do things like take notes at meetings, flyer for events, cook or do child care, or take or give trainings. One thing that really sticks in my craw is how so many people will just drop the ball on jail and prisoner support- even the defendants themselves, often, forgetting to do ANYTHING to prepare for their court dates! Even worse is when I raise money for legal defense, and then later, when it's needed, they come asking for more legal defense money... and it turns out the original sum was just used as a general treasury and spent on this or that. I once raised around 10k for an eco-defense camp, years before a certain pipeline was set to be built, with the explicit understanding that this was for legal defense and only for legal defense, because I had seen this movement leave defendants high and dry in the past. Well, the camp decided to stay camped out all winter, even though the pipeline wasn't even given the green light from the state yet, and over the course of the winter, they started bickering and squabbling and eventually the whole thing collapsed and the activists went their separate ways. So I asked where the legal defense money had gone, so I could safeguard it for when the struggle really kicked into gear. Some of it got spent on camping gear, and the rest just sort of disappeared. Then, years later, when the pipeline was getting built, I got these panicked calls asking if I could help raise legal defense money, because a bunch of defendants who had been led up these direct actions and told to go get arrested (at very unstrategic times, mind you- often, disruption to the construction was very minimal) were being left high and dry with no legal support. Everyone wants to be the hero locking down to shit, but no one wants to flyer for the benefit show to pay the lawyer.\n\nThose are the main ones off the top of my head. I'm still a highly involved person, but our social movements have some serious problems that need to be addressed.",

The main issue was one of them wanted to continue expanding without asking or thinking through the ethics and another one of them launched basically a hostile takeover. It was a mess, it disbanded a few months into Covid. I will get back into it probably but still bitter about that one since we all invested time and money and nobody knows where it all went in the end.",

It should not come down to each individual activist, whether they be a teacher, or a student, or whoever, to be superhumanly capable/responsible/brilliant/whatever. It is bullshit to expect so much and feel totally alone in your works. \n\nNow I focus on not becoming cynical, even though we all know it is totally warranted.

It did no good and just pissed them off. People prefer to bury their heads in the sand. They don\u2019t want to see things for what they are. They value a false sense of stability over justice. Now we are here, in the place I saw us ending up and *now* they care. Apparently. I have to admit I\u2019m a little salty about all of this but mostly I feel exhausted.\n\nIt feels to me like we\u2019re in a cycle that can\u2019t really be interrupted with knowledge or activism. Every few generations authoritarians rise, non authoritarians actively refuse to see it until it\u2019s too late (\u201cbe tolerant! they just have different values!\u201d) and we have a big armed conflict to beat them back. I\u2019m not convinced it can be avoided anymore.\n\nTo be totally honest the other thing bothering me is that the great majority apparently don\u2019t care what happens in their society until something personally impacts them. Detention has been used in horribly unethical ways forever and they\u2019re only now caring because it could affect them, meanwhile they\u2019ve been making jokes about SA and other abuse of prisoners the whole time. Women in more marginalized groups have been dealing with medical abuse and denial of care forever and most of the more privileged population didn\u2019t care until now when it\u2019s impacting them. Police brutality\u2026 I could go on. \n\nI got shouted down for pointing these things out and have lost friends over it and now they pretend to care. On the other hand I\u2019ve been dismayed by some of the infighting on the left. It feels like people are falling for astroturfing. The increase in antisemitism on the left is distressing as well. Idk, I\u2019ll pick it back up when I can gather some energy, because it\u2019s not like we have much choice. Just feeling salty and fed up with us as a species",
