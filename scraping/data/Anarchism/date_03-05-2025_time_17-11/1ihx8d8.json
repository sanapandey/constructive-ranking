And having standards of communication is extremely useful, from things like the protocols that run the internet to lingua francas and so on.\n\nThe problem comes when certain types of prescriptive grammar and standards of communication serve to marginalize and erase. Like stigmatized dialects, language death, and cultural assimilation more broadly.",
