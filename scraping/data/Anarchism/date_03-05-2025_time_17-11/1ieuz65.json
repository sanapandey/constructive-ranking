This is a really scary time and you have every right to feel the way the way you do.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t have a specific book handy, but I didn\u2019t want to leave this abandoned. You are reaching out here which is the first step of any mutual aid. Make a connection. I have been profoundly surprised by the people who have turned up for me, that I just kinda got to know before I needed them.\u00a0\n\nWho do you trust? Start there and see who they trust. Also get rest where you can. This news cycle is meant to shock and awe. Whatever it\u2019s even a little safe to ignore, ignore. Your brain needs time to process. I\u2019ll look around for books when I get a second but in the meantime:\n\nHang in there. You are not alone, even though it feels like it right now. Many of us are organizing alongside you to see how we can protect and care for each other \ud83d\udc95",

Could you maybe gently turn your attention to what nourishes you and those around you? Can you deepen connections with your neighbours, help community to grow through shared food and fun and practical work? \n\nOr maybe the focus right now needs to be on radical self care? Yoga, meditation, nature time, uplifting reading (as you suggest), making time for those things you really love but never seem to get to.... This could revitalise you too be able to help more in your community of the energy isn't there just now. \n\nAs far as reading goes, maybe folk like bell hooks (All About Love), Rebecca Solnit (Hope in the Dark) and Ursula Le Guin (Annals of the Western Shore), might be helpful. Grounded in struggle, they all stay focused on what is possible - real change, real equality, real Life. I'm sure there are many others, too! \n\nSigning off with love & anarchy (same thing, really)\n\ud83d\udc97\ud83c\udf39",
