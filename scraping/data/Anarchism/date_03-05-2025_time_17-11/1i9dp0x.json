De-colonial thought. Total pessimism. Every criticism of much of the western anarchist movement itself.\n\nYet when laid out into such a cohesive picture, a path emerges in front of you.\n\nBuilt on the back of systems analysis, meta-science, and indiginous critique of the machine.\n\nA new future presents itself.\n\nNot only anarchist. But practical. Supremely practical. Arguably more practical than our current system.\n\nYou can find it here:\n\n* [As a video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvwoHdNGq9wVweGZ5bj5ZxFYulL_Xll_z)\n* [As a paper](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anark-a-modern-anarchism)\n\nI'm floored.\n\nFor the first time, I see a future.  \nBeyond death.  \nBeyond apocalypse.  \nBeyond retreat.\n\nNot some abstract theory.  \nBut a meta-structure that could truely be the next eon of humanity.\n\nMaybe I'm playing it a bit up. But I'm really emotional right now. I haven't had hope for so long. But spotting that light in the distance makes me see a potential future. Where we escape the machine.",

            "body": "This is a 3 part series which unites the fractured fronts of contemporary anarchism, into a unified whole, which, when viewed in full, shows a possible future where we escape the machine.\n\n>*The anarchist conception must be synthetic: it must seek to become the great living synthesis of the different elements of life, established by scientific analysis and rendered fruitful by the synthesis of our ideas, our aspirations and the bits of truth that we have succeeded in discovering; it must do it if it wishes to be that precursor of truth, that true and undistorted factor, not bankrupting of human liberation and progress, which the dozens of sullen, narrow and fossilized \u2018isms\u2019 obviously cannot become.*\n\n\\- Voline\n\nI have shifted from a true pessimist in a world of decay, to a hopeful optimist for a liberated future.\n\nI am no longer a insurrectionist fighting into the night as I succumb to the machine, but someone with hope. With motivation to help my community.\n\nFight, grow, love, resist, and perpetuate to the whole world.\n\nAs the Zapatistas say in their letter \"[A Zapatista Response to \u201cThe EZLN Is NOT Anarchist](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ejercito-zapatista-de-liberacion-nacional-a-zapatista-response-to-the-ezln-is-not-anarchist)\":\n\n>Colonialism is one of the many enemies we are fighting in this world and so long as North Americans reinforce colonial thought patterns in their \u201crevolutionary\u201d struggles, they will never be on the side of any anti-colonial struggle anywhere. We in the Zapatista struggle have never asked anyone for unflinching, uncritical support. What we have asked the world to do is respect the historical context we are in and think about the actions we do to pull ourselves from under the boots of oppression. **At the same time, you should be looking at your own struggles in your own country and seeing the commonalties we have between us. This is the only way we have to make a global Revolution.**\n\n>...\n\n>Of course, the social struggles of exploited and oppressed people cannot be expected to conform to some abstract anarchist ideal. These struggles arise in particular situations, sparked by specific events.\n\n>**The question of revolutionary solidarity in these struggles is, therefore, the question of how to intervene in a way that is fitting with one\u2019s aims, in a way that moves one\u2019s revolutionary anarchist project forward.** But in order to do this, one must have clear aims and a clear concept of one\u2019s project.\n\n>In other words, one must be pursuing one\u2019s own daily struggle against the present reality with lucidity and determination. **Uncritical support of any of the struggles described above is indicative of a lack of clarity about what an anarchist revolutionary project might be, and such support is most certainly not revolutionary solidarity.**\n\n>Each of our struggles springs from our own lives and our own experiences of domination and exploitation. **When we go into these battles with full awareness of the nature of the state and capital, of the institutions by which this civilization controls our existence, it becomes obvious that only certain methods and practices can lead toward the end we desire**.\n\n>With this knowledge, **we can clarify our own projects and make our awareness of the struggles around the world into a tool for honing our own struggle against the present social order. Revolutionary solidarity is precisely fighting against the totality of an existence based on exploitation, domination and alienation wherever one finds oneself.**\n\n>**In this light, revolutionary solidarity needs to take up the weapon of unflinching, merciless critique of all reformist, nationalist, hierarchical, authoritarian, democratic or class collaborationist tendencies that could undermine the autonomy and self-activity of those in struggle and channel the struggle into negotiation and compromise with the present order.**\n\n>This critique must be based in a lucid conception of the world we must destroy and the means necessary to accomplish this destruction.\n\nThe Zapatistas present an alternate paradigm of revolution, and a deconstruction of anarchism. Rendering it into its purest, most universal form. Where the decolonial process is indistinguishable from the anarchic project - as the liberation of all people and peoples from the machine. Into a liberated future on all fronts.\n\nThis is what anarchism must become.",

A system is that of a \"complex system\", not a regulatory system.
