    "selftext": "Hey comrades,\n\nI'm excited to share Running Against the Wind (\u98a8\u306b\u6297\u3046!), a documentary that dives into Ishigaki Island's fight against state exploitation and control.\n\n\\-- What's the Story? --\n\nIshigaki might look like a tourist paradise, but it's been through a lot\u2014from Japan's annexation in 1879 to new military bases popping up today. The locals have been pushing back against these intrusions for years. The film follows Setsuko Yamazato, who's been at the forefront, defending her community's culture and environment.\n\nFor context, here is a video showing her protest and fight against the imposed opening of a military base in Ishigaki.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqx-OU51bj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqx-OU51bj8)\n\nOur work will focus on archiving her knowledge, both empirical and spiritual, and her deep link with the island, dating from her time running around the jungle in the refugee camp where she was displaced as a child.\n\nHere is the work-in-progress trailer. (for the crowdfunding)\n\n[https://youtu.be/SZpcKNBQr44](https://youtu.be/SZpcKNBQr44)\n\nIf you ever considered supporting the project, or spreading the word, here is the crowdfunding link. All help means so much to us -- empowering her message to be spread.\n\n[https://motion-gallery.net/projects/runagainstthewind](https://motion-gallery.net/projects/runagainstthewind)\n\n(It's both in Japanese and English).  \nCheers !",
