However, I didn't mention the crucial point of this unrest: the election fraud conspiracy theory, the result of right-wing populism and authoritarianism in our society. And that's why I'm explaining about South Korean right-wing populism and its \"election fraud\" to my comrades in Japan, Taiwan, HK, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua, etc.\n\n1. Background\n\n[HK comrades teaching the cops a lesson with molotov cocktails](https://preview.redd.it/q5pxzbcma5fe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=be1c982312691dbab55fe93bb357d8e3ccc17844)\n\nYes, we were all depressed when HK comrades, despite fighting valiantly, eventually knelt down to Chinese imperialism and authoritarianism. \n\nHowever, in South Korea, the situation was perceived a little differently.\n\n[Right over S. Korea is North Korea, and beyond it are China and Russia, two anti-West fascist \\(Dengist\\/Putinist\\) regimes](https://preview.redd.it/1yh4b97bb5fe1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e6486d246e255a81cf08d6c4758cd55e3542ae9)\n\nAs you know, South Korea has been always pro-West, while North Korea, along with China and USSR->Russia, have been mostly anti-West. Due to such reasons, the term \ubd81\uc911\ub7ec(NK-CN-RU) has been often used, and Korean right-wing, often seeing them as \"communist or ex-communist dictatorship regimes\", became extremely pro-West and Japanophile.\n\nTherefore, when HK protesters, who were British (pro-West) 23 years ago, lost to China, a \"communist\" (I mean state capitalist) anti-West country, South Koreans were extremely shocked, since it might be Korea's next future.\n\n[\\\\\"Jews are genetically inferior, but they are controlling all banks and corporations\\\\\" - Nazis](https://preview.redd.it/vx6dilokc5fe1.png?width=1532&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3d696da8d8ef415b3354306b03728513c44e6fe)\n\nThese anti-communist and anti-anti-West sentiments, combined with anti-Chinese racism (including anti-Korean-Chinese racism, since Korean Chinese are often seen as \"brainwashed Chinese who are no longer Korean\"), turned into the significant conspiracy theory.\n\n2. \"China Gate\"\n\n[The first of all](https://preview.redd.it/9hidhigwe5fe1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=adee6f7170193560e17447f2454d1cb1785ec54f)\n\nIn 2020, when [the legislative election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Korean_legislative_election) was coming soon, a right-wing user, who insisted that he is a Korean Chinese, said that liberals are Chinese proxies and pro-liberal, pro-Chinese/pro-NK, anti-Japanese/anti-USA, and anti-conservative replies and tweets are written by Chinese agents. \n\nAccording to this writing, many internet users discovered the \"suspicious activities\", and believed that pro-liberal opinions on Internet are dominated by Chinese agents, and that the election will prove it.\n\nHowever, the result was: liberals taking more than 180 seats out of 300, while conservatives barely covering about 105 seats.\n\n3. Result denial\n\n[\\\\\"2020 legislative election was a hoax\\\\\" \\\\\"Scanned the voting papers, and printed them again\\\\\" \\\\\"Not punishing the election fraud leads our country to destruction\\\\\" -\uc625\uc740\ud638 \\(Ok Un-Ho\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4o6kmw3pg5fe1.png?width=185&format=png&auto=webp&s=9904829837290c3b586c8c7673a1e9103e093746)\n\nDue to cognitive dissonance, many right-wing populists started believing one thing: they won, but due to Chinese manipulation, they lost.\n\nDespite the government and journals repeatedly arguing against such conspiracy theory, it still remained popular toward senior evangelicals and anti-communists.\n\nHopefully, the election of conservative Yoon Suk-Yeol seemed to resolve the conspiracy theory.\n\n4. Resurrection\n\n[\\\\\"The chaos of ROK... was invoked by Election Commission!\\\\\" - \uc804\ud55c\uae38\\(Jeon Han-Gil\\)](https://preview.redd.it/kzkd4d4hh5fe1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2cae9aba8f80ea3e0db36355fbd93ee4d297cc)\n\nYoon Suk-Yeol himself turned to believe such theory - according to former centrals, he[ said](https://weekly.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=38819) \"My election was kinda weird too. I should have won the liberal in distance of 10\\~15%p, but it was mere 0.73%p. How?\".\n\nAnd, it turned out that, Yoon's (as well as martial law forces') primary object was investigating the Election Commission, and \"persuading\" the officials and politicians to confess that there were election frauds.\n\nYoon Suk-Yeol himself insisted that the country was \"in serious problem\" due to Chinese election intervention, and that was why he declared martial law to \"fix\" the problem.\n\nThe propangadized pro-Yoon protesters, now including not only evangelicals, anti-communists, and Mccathists but also alt-rights, xenophobes/Islamophobes, and homophobes, started chanting \"stop election fraud\",[ reporting pro-liberal entertainers to CIA and M16](https://n.news.naver.com/mnews/article/088/0000921367?sid=102), and even rioting in the court.\n\n5. Conclusion + opinion\n\nAs you learned through this article, right-wing populism, fueled with Mccarthyism and authoritarianism, is trying to deny the reality. This ironically emphasizes the importance of fact-checking in our activities.\n\nKeep these lessons in mind, comrades in Japan, Taiwan, HK, Tibet, Mongolia, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua, the USA, Canada, Mexico, Ukraine, Greece, Russia, Belarus, Germany, France, the UK, Romania, Hungary, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Croatia, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Kurdistan, Bethnahrain/Mesopotamia, Balochistan, Tajikistan, Pashtunistan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Circassia, Chechnya, Jordan, Jewish and Arab Palestine, Western Sahara, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, South Africa, etc. Thanks for reading.",
