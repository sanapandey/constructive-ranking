    "selftext": "This country is just complete shit, everything that's happening, and I need to do something, I can't sit back and watch. Nothing will ever change if it's ignored, and I want to help but I'm not certain how due to being chronically ill and unable to leave the house. I'm in college, studying library sciences and history in hopes of becoming an archivist, because it's my biggest passion, preserving history and culture for future generations, and the lives of people who aren't huge historical figures, the everyday person, so what I've been trying to do currently is archive things that are being taken down, or things at risk. Banned and challenged books, posts and videos and articles about everything going on, whatever I can. I'm also trying to speak out online, but I'm just wondering if there's anything more I can do, things I can archive, or ways I can speak out and fight.\n\nThank you so, so much.",

It\u2019s called Sick Woman Theory, and is a seminal disability justice text. Here\u2019s a quote from near the beginning.\n\n\u201cSolidarity is a slippery thing. It\u2019s hard to feel in isolation. In bed, in pain, I started to think about the kind of solidarity in which I could participate as someone stuck at home, alone. I started to think about what modes of protest are afforded to sick and disabled people at all.\n\n\u201cI thought of the many others who were not at the protest either, who could not go because it was in some way inaccessible to them, all the other invisible bodies, with their fists up, tucked away, out of sight. It seemed to me that many would be the people for whom Black Lives Matter is especially in service. I thought of how they might not be able to be present for the marches because they had to go to work, or because they lived under the threat of being fired from their job if they marched, or because they were literally incarcerated. They might not be able to go to the march because of the threat of violence and police brutality that exists at any protest. They might not be able to go because their bodies were this peculiar convergence of hyper-visible and invisible, marked and unmarked, which instantiated a dangerous vulnerability around them. They might not be able to go because of their own illness or disability, or because they were caring for someone with an illness or disability. They were many, and we were different from each other in key ways, but what was true for all of us is that we were not there.\u201d\n\nhttps://topicalcream.org/features/sick-woman-theory/",

I'm bipolar, I have C-PTSD, I'm autistic and I'm trans so the world is even more scary and overwhelming now than it normally is. Last year I suffered a home invasion, two as a matter of fact but it really made it so for months I would have a break down every time I left home. I was starting up working with a Food Not Bombs chapter when it happened and the main organizer offered me a chance to do some of the social media and send out emails.\n\nUltimately I responded to the offer too slowly and someone else got picked who had a little bit more longevity and familiarity with the affinity group but if you want a way to help, helping local groups have a social media presence might be perfect for what you can do.",
