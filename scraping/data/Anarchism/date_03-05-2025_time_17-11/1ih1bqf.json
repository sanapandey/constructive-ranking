    "selftext": "All I\u2019ve seen are statements about how this is a trap, but if people are showing up, shouldn\u2019t we be as well? If we refuse, who fills the gap? What happens when the auth-comms show up instead? You can say it doesn\u2019t matter, but history says otherwise. Occupy started as an anarchist movement and still got stolen. Why? Because anarchists were there first but didn\u2019t hold the ground.\n\nIf anarchists aren\u2019t showing up, who are we leaving this to? The same tankie organizers who will happily co-opt any movement that lacks a strong anti-state presence? The reformists who will pacify it into a series of symbolic gestures before declaring victory and going home? The state itself, which will push its own narrative in the absence of strong resistance?\n\nI don\u2019t buy the argument that this is some perfect \u201ctrap\u201d that can only result in failure. Of course the state responds to uprisings with repression\u2014that\u2019s how it works. But if people are out in the streets, being radicalized by the violence of the system, that\u2019s precisely where anarchists should be. If we\u2019re not, then others will shape the narrative. We\u2019ve seen it happen before.\n\nSo where is the strategy? Why aren\u2019t we salting this?\n\nSalting \u2013 when union organizers get jobs at non-union workplaces to organize from within. It works for labor, so why aren\u2019t we doing it for protest movements? Instead of armchair commentary, why aren\u2019t anarchists embedding themselves in these spaces to help push things further, keep them from getting co-opted, and actually make use of the energy that\u2019s already there?\n\nIf I\u2019m wrong, let\u2019s talk about it. I don\u2019t mind being challenged\u2014I\u2019m on edge, maybe not thinking clearly, but I don\u2019t feel hazy. Just frustrated.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\n\u2014Kelby\n\nEdit: the protests have been defined as \u201crejecting project 2025\u201d which includes a host of shitty things, I suggest you read up on it if you don\u2019t already know what it is.\n\nEdit 2: People have been asking for materials to pass out, so I will put them here because I said I would and what am I, not a person of my word over here? I'm focusing on printer friendly things and I don't have a ton yet but I'm hard at work to find some before the big day!\n\nLink 1: [Know Your Rights: If ICE Visits Your Home](https://www.aila.org/aila-files/20036845-F2B6-4749-9E38-E47CBA77C3EE/Know-Your-Rights-2025-Update-2.pdf)\n\nLink 2:  [Know Your Rights with ICE Flyer](https://waisn.org/kyrice/)\n\nLink 3: [I guess if you want to pay this org money you can for these nifty lil cards, but also you can just take the idea and print them out on red card stock.](https://www.ilrc.org/red-cards-tarjetas-rojas)\n\nLink 4: [IWW Booklet, if you're into it, I honestly am coming up short for things to just hand you. lol](https://www.iww.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/think-it-over-booklet.pdf)\n\nLink 5: [Some project 2025 stuff I barely vetted.](https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/project2025workplaceflyer.pdf)\n\nLink 6: [More P2025 stuff that looked right on first glance](https://addisondemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Project-2025.pdf)\n\nLink 7:[ this has some images when you scroll down that detail some more stuff, the site is very \"save our democracy, but I dunno what else to tell you, libs are out here reacting and shit, and you might find these useful.](https://www.stopthecoup2025.org/downloads)\n\nLink 8: [You get the idea, you might even run with it yourself! ](https://ibewgov.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Project-2025-Flier-black-red-version-3.pdf)\n\nMore to come, surely!\n\n\\-kelby(again!)",

Yes this protest is liberal, amateurish in several ways, and could have been better organized etc. Are you organizing something better? Or just complaining? Is this protest stopping you from organizing something better? \n\nA fascist presidency rapidly enacting its fucked up agenda needs a response, in fact as many responses as it takes to defeat as much of that agenda as we possibly can. Realistically none of these responses will be perfect and many of them will be organized by people who aren't experienced at this sort of thing. People who have more experience are more likely to be burned out, be more cynical and have other commitments that prevent us from participating as much. Also realistically none of us can honestly claim that we know for certain what it will take to stop Trump or his movement. A good guess though is that we'll need a lot more people, including ourselves, to get a lot more active. \n\nThis will mean creating a broad coalition where anarchists are in the minority. So inevitably the overall project won't be as far left or as anti-authoritarian as we are. Nonetheless fascism in the US is an urgent, existential threat that needs to be defeated by any means necessary -- and any means possible given the limited timeframe, and frankly the relative weakness and small size of the left & anarchism in the u.s. There are guaranteed to be things that are tried which fail, at least in the short term. We still need to build connections with each other and build momentum if we're going to have any chance of succeeding in the long run. Lots of people are going to need to build experience and be further radicalized than they currently are. This is mostly going to happen by participating in real world struggle, not by happening to read critiques written by people on the sidelines in subreddits. \n\nAnd I'm not saying that people need to stfu with these criticisms -- just that they need to be balanced by an appreciation that  (a) people are trying to do *something* (b) state level fascism represents a real & present danger that demands a (several) response(s) & (c) imperfect attempts to do something about it are better than much better attempts that don't exist.\n\nAs for the vagueness & open ended scope of the protest: a large part of that is dictated by the wide scope & simultaneous character of the fascist agenda currently being enacted. This is by design, the far right has been busy preparing these moves for *years* in advance, and is deliberately flooding the zone to overwhelm us. Another major part of this is that, imo, *none of us* has a good handle on what the best, most effective course of action is. So it's much easier to criticize people for making mistakes than it is to have a positive vision about what we need to do to win.",

Its bizarre to me that Trump is president, and there\u2019s a protest vaguely against that, and your first concern is the \u201cauth-comms\u201d who\u2019ve hardly been talking about the protest, and how you can \u201csalt\u201d (read: co-opt, sabotage) it. I think this is a super unproductive, pessimistic mindset. \n\nTrying to sabotage/co-opt a protest from the \u201cauth-comms\u201d even though you can\u2019t even show it\u2019s related to the \u201cauth-comms\u201d as opposed to just progressive liberals on social media, seems counterproductive to me. Even if it was being ran by \u201cauth-comms\u201d, aren\u2019t there bigger issues right now? It\u2019s not like the Reddit protest is gonna put them in charge of the government. This is exactly the kind of behavior \u201cauth-comms\u201d criticize us for - it\u2019s a bad look, as it makes us look antagonistic to any actual action.\n\nAssuming the protest is real/not a government astroturf: why would you try to harm it instead of help it when it\u2019s already unlikely it\u2019ll achieve anything (a 50,000 member Reddit group isn\u2019t the same as actual organization)\n\nAssuming the protest is a government astroturf: how does that make it related to the auth-comms? Wouldn\u2019t you want to \u201csalt\u201d it to disconnect it from planted government leaders, rather than these non-existent tankies?
