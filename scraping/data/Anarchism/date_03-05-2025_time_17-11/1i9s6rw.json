            "body": "From an anarcho-communist perspective, Global Discontents is an accurate critique of state power, corporate domination, and neoliberalism, but it stops short of fully rejecting the hierarchical structures that enable these systems. While Chomsky accurately identifies the problems of wealth inequality, imperialism, and climate change as products of capitalism and state violence, his analysis often falls back on reformist solutions that fail to challenge the root causes: the existence of centralized power and property relations. His focus on grassroots resistance is commendable, yet it sometimes frames activism as an effort to \"pressure\" existing institutions rather than dismantle them altogether.",

All through this book I am reading now (which had been published in 2000) he keeps saying that activism towards reform is better than allowing conditions to remain stagnant (civil rights, women\u2019s suffrage, American foreign policy (war)\u2026) but he never promotes that over dismantling power structures and adopting an anarcho-syndalist society.",

He simply points out that pressuring existing institutions is a worthwhile effort for activists that can lead towards a better situation for the working class and increase the possibility of dismantling the state.\n\nOther than educating each other as the working class, we do little else than pressure the state. \n\nI maybe wrong because I have not read this book, but I've read pretty much everything else he's written on American foreign policy and anarchism. If there is something new in this book where he defends hierarchical state structures, could you elaborate briefly, as this would be an interesting change in attitude.",
