Lotta good media analysis too\n\nEdit: left out Noncompete. Tbh his production style and the way he delivers his message isn\u2019t my favorite, but he was also one of my first exposures to anarchism. It\u2019s a good introductory source but as I learned more nuance I eventually drifted away from him",
