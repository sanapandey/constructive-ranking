    "selftext": "Please consider participating in a political protest on LinkedIn.\u00a0 LinkedIn hosts an international mixed audience with influence and money.\u00a0 Corporate, government, and religious bodies are exposed.\u00a0 A considerable fraction of its users are sympathetic.\u00a0 Over the past few days I did a test run and had some success.\u00a0 I did not see much concurrent resistance activity but there is quite a bit of existing political discussion.\n\nI began with my authentic LinkedIn profile.\u00a0 I have worked as a US engineer for a few companies and had around 500 contacts.\u00a0 I do not think LinkedIn is particularly useful for career purposes and have not been very active.\n\nI believe my most successful tactic was targeting company posts.\u00a0 As an example, many companies with millions of followers made posts \u201ccelebrating\u201d MLK Jr. day.\u00a0 On these I commented \u201cCompany Name CEO Name, what is your opinion on Musk\u2019s Nazi salute?\u201d\u00a0 I then liked the company post and reposted it to my account with the same comment as a description.\n\nI also commented on a few corporate disclosures.\u00a0 As an example, a Germany company posted a video where the CEO talked about political changes improving business prospects.\u00a0 I wrote something about these policies being similar to those of the AfD and asked whether he supported Elon Musk\u2019s salute.\u00a0 I happened to be the first commenter and believe many people saw this.\u00a0 Individuals with inside and industry knowledge could gather considerable attention in this way.\n\nI interacted with both conservative and progressive commenters.\u00a0 Many of my statements were upvoted or argued.\u00a0 I am not sure how effective this was but it is somewhat visible.\n\nI posted a few news articles.\u00a0 I am not sure how effective this is because it was hard to get impressions.\n\nA few people complained that my behavior was not work appropriate but I think most users are in favor of free speech.\n\nOver about three days I accumulated about 300 profile views and 4000 impressions.\u00a0 Some very influential people with job titles like VP and Chief Communications Officer viewed my profile.\u00a0 People from all over the world viewed my profile.\u00a0 A royal liked one of my comments.\u00a0 Women seemed particularly sympathetic and courageous.\u00a0 This was a test run and I am not particularly well versed in social media.\n\nIt is possible to directly post articles, videos, and Reddit content.\u00a0 I think it is possible to generate fake accounts with nothing more than an email.\u00a0 Someone named Elon Musk with a picture of Elon Musk liked a comment.\n\nThis morning I woke up to find that my account had been suspended.\u00a0 It took them 3 days to do this and I suspect they can be overwhelmed.\u00a0 The email indicates that this is due to potential identity theft.\u00a0 I was asked to provide images of government identification to restore access.\u00a0 I do not know if my account will be restored.\n\nI also received one warning for hate speech.\u00a0 This warning threatened potential account suspension.\u00a0 I had written \u201cFuck Trump.\u201d\u00a0 I do not think this is hate speech.\u00a0 This comment was up for something like 1.5 days before I received the warning.\u00a0 Using language like fascist and Nazi may or may not be recommended but I was very aggressive.\n\nI understand many people are hesitant to participate due to exposure at their job.\u00a0 It was very difficult to get upvotes from my network.\u00a0 I am not sure how many of my previous contacts were online but only one person had the courage to like an article that I posted.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\u00a0 If you like this idea please help distribute it across Reddit and anywhere else.\u00a0 I have been a Reddit lurker for about 3 years but have limited karma and am unable to make my own standalone post.",
