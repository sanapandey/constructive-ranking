    "selftext": "I read an essay on privilege here years ago. I'm about 95% sure it was on the sidebar of this subreddit as a resource, but appears to be gone now. It was quite an introductory essay to the concept, but was very influential for me at the time. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Is there a reason why it was removed or was it flawed? Thanks!",
