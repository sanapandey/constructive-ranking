    "selftext": "This is mostly a rant about my process of self discovery leading to anarchism. If you don\u2019t feel like reading a redditor\u2019s summarized ideological life story feel free to move on to another post. But thank you if you decide to stay. \n\nI am very happy to call myself an anarchist after several years of floating in the political limbo of not adhering strictly to an ideology. I grew up protestant in the US and from there I naturally became a good ol\u2019 american neoliberal, as I would have called myself a christian conservative when i was an older teenager. That didn\u2019t last too long as I only adhered to that ideology from growing up in that environment, but deep down I knew that wasn\u2019t really who I am even if i didn\u2019t realize that at first. \n\nA few existential crises later I was floating around in an ideological void after leaving american christianity behind, hanging out with my two new best friends who happen to be a tankie and an anarchist. How they are such close friends being so ideologically opposed in many ways is another interesting story entirely on its own. I began to realize i\u2019ve always had a pretty left leaning personality and values, but now i\u2019d fully get the chance to express them in their totality. But I had a choice to make. I was surrounded by auth communism along with anarchism at the same time, and I couldn\u2019t choose. I had convinced myself that \u201canarchy wouldn\u2019t work\u201d and that the auth commies had to be right. \u201cWho would run air traffic control in an anarchist commune?\u201d I thought. So I called myself a Marxist for a little while. It didn\u2019t stick. I kinda hated it actually. My body rebelled against the label. \n\nAnother year or so went by. And the answer ended up being a lot more simple than I ever would have thought: What do I want to live out as my own life and help welcome the world into? And that answer is anarchism. I don\u2019t like state power structures. I don\u2019t like vertical hierarchy. I hate oppression. There\u2019s hardly a worse feeling than the weight of authority upon one\u2019s being. I want every human being to have no one above them, no one below them. None be forced to bear the weight of nations. None be beaten down by the force of the state. \n\nOther answers followed from there. What\u2019s stopping us from running air traffic control? We don\u2019t have to have a hierarchy to do it. All it takes is action and coordination.\n\nA lot of ideas I had for a very long time have begun to click one after the other. Even when I was immersed in american protestantism I always disliked the power structures in church and school and wondered why we couldn\u2019t do things differently and actually be fair to each other and help each other. Like how some kids went without lunch cause they couldn\u2019t pay for it. I\u2019ve always thought money to be such a stupid concept. \n\nSo anarchism for me was a bit inevitable really. Wanting to dismantle hierarchy has always been in me. I hope I can find a place here on this subreddit and others like this one. If you\u2019ll have me, as a young anarchist, let\u2019s dismantle the structured world. ",

As an example they have their own private militaries basically. There is also a thing called Trauma Team, which is a subscription based ambulance service. If you get in a car crash and they arrive but you don't have the correct subscription then they ignore you and leave you to die.",

            "body": "Same, coming from a \"jihadi\"-Salafist background I became disilusioned with the whole Caliphate movement. My disillusionment with the modern Caliphate movement stems from its failure to learn from history.  Instead of simply replacing one dictator with another, a true Caliphate should prioritize decentralized governance and respect the self-determination of diverse communities.\n\nThe early Rashidun Caliphate, with its emphasis on consultation and community, offers a better model than the centralized control and discriminatory policies of the later Umayyads. The Umayyad's suppression of non-Arab Muslims, thankfully, led to rebellions and the emergence of the Almohad and Abbasid Caliphates, which embraced greater cultural and political diversity.\n\nUnfortunately, even these later Caliphates gradually strayed from this ideal. Over time, they increasingly centralized power and curtailed the autonomy of local communities and tribes. Even the Ottoman Empire, with its (falsely) celebtrated Millet system, fell short of genuine self-governance. True autonomy goes beyond limited internal affairs; it requires respecting the unique identities and aspirations of different groups within the broader Islamic community. \n\nThe concept of localized authority, with tribes and communes governing themselves, is a central pillar of (political) Islam, rooted in the very spirit of early Muslim communities.\nFurthermore, Islam, in its essence, challenges traditional hierarchies. It grants all believers the right and duty to enjoin good and forbid wrong, regardless of social standing. This principle empowers individuals to hold each other accountable, be it king or pauper. Everyone shares the burden of responsibility, exemplified by the fact that someone from the \"lowest\" social \"class\" can lead the prayer for those of a \"higher\" class, based solely on their suitability for the task, not their lineage. This is not a vapid recommendation, but a must. \n\nThis inherent egalitarianism is something Western Orientalists and Colonisers often struggled with.  Accustomed to rigid hierarchies, they tried to impose similar structures on Muslim societies, finding it easier to control them that way. But Islam rejects such imposed hierarchies. It matters not who holds what title, but rather their actions and adherence to Islamic principles. Even the first Caliph of Islam, Abu Bakr as-Saddiq(ra), exemplified this when he addressed the early Muslim community:  \"Oh people, as I have now been placed in a position of authority over you and I am not the best of you, if I do good, then help me, and if I do wrong then correct me. Truth is a trust and lying is betrayal. The weak amongst you is strong with me until I get his rights returned to him, God willing; and the strong amongst you is weak until I [justly] take the right from him, God willing\u2026 Obey me as long as I obeyed Allah and His messenger, so if I disobey Allah and His messenger then you owe me no obedience.\"\n\nIt's tragic that this core tenet of Islam \u2013  respecting the self-determination of communes and tribes, coupled with this inherent rejection of rigid hierarchies \u2013 is so often overlooked.  In their haste to establish a modern Caliphate, many seem eager to copy the Western concept of the nation-state, with its rigid borders and centralized power. This is a fundamentally flawed model, ill-suited for the diverse and dynamic world. Simply adding \"Islamic\" flavoring doesn't change its inherent flawed nature. \n\nSo yes, I'm an anarchist. I reject the centralized control and oppressive nature of the state and its bureaucratic apparatus. I advocate for self-governing communities that practice self-policing and prioritize individual autonomy within a framework of Islamic principles. Ultimately, I envision a world where communities manage their own affairs with minimal external interference, even from a Caliph, who, even if such title existed, would be a purely political figure with no religious authority \u2014 unlike a Pope, their existence or actions wouldn't impact one's spiritual path or salvation \u2014 and would remain a distant figure with no direct impact on daily life.",
