    "selftext": "Hi so I\u2019m graduating university in May and I want to make a statement when I\u2019m on the stage. I go to a huge school that has supported Ice and the police pretty heavily (and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s deeper things I am not aware of). I\u2019d really like to display a flag or something, I was thinking the anarchy symbol or just \u201ceat the rich\u201d but I\u2019d love more creative ideas. I\u2019m super passionate about the environment too and obviously disgusted with the current political environment and my countrys descent into fascist oligarchic rule. Id love anything to make a statement regarding one of more of these things. \n\nSide note: my dad (who will be there) is a huge Trump supporter and I love opposing his impact as much as possible. ",
