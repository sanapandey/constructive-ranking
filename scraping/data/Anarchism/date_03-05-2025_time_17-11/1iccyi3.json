Your CEO did not *just* praise a candidate, he also directly referred to the Democrats as no longer being the party of the \u201clittle guy,\u201d obviously implying that the Republican Party now holds that title. This is an extremely obvious political endorsement and the fact that your messaging has repeatedly doubled down on the supposed neutrality of the comments is immensely frustrating as a consumer. I read his statement with my own eyes. Being told that he never said what he *clearly said* is insulting and damages the trust I have for your services, and I am far from the only one who feels this way.\n\nIf you do decide to change your response to this controversy, I would recommend your CEO issues an apology that addresses the specific frustrations people have shared towards his thoughtless comments and that your company reaffirms its commitment to continuing neutrality now and into the future, including a zero tolerance policy for executives to make any public comments on politics except for issues that are 100% related to privacy. Doing this would help rebuild the trust that has been diminished and would do a much better job of addressing the issue than simply telling consumers that what they read with their own eyes was incorrect.",

It's the recipe of a bad apology. This challenges me as I just recently started my subscription.",
