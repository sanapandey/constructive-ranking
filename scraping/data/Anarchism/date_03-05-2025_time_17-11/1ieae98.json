            "body": "Depends on the organization you are joining and why you are joining it. Did someone approach you to make bombs? Well they're probably a fed so your retaliation from the US government is pretty big lmao\n\nDid you join Food Not Bombs, or Black Rose Rose Negra, or an SRA? There is likely someone surveilling those groups, yes. Probably a local cop more than a fed. As long as you're not advocating for violence and just hanging out then you're probably fine. Of course a lot of people still get arrested for feeding the homeless, so your risk is not non-existent. But you can get arrested anywhere for anything.\n\n  \nUse Signal. As often as possible have conversations in person away from any electronics. Do a lot of trust building with people. If someone offers to commit major crimes (arson, assassinations, etc.) within a month of meeting you stay away from that person. Don't fed-jacket them, but express your concern to others. Even if they're not a fed they are a dangerous person because their risk assessments are all out of order.\n\nIf you are publicly showing your anarchist credentials there might be retaliation from cops or random citizens. Your boss might give you a hard time. Local fash might put you on a kill list. It's random a lot of the times and you cannot control for all of it. Stay in touch with your local anti-fascists. They monitor for things like kill lists.\n\nYou'll likely be fine.",

It's a very thin layer of protection but it does help against network mapping, which is a really important thing cops use. After all if a cop elicits information from someone and all they know is you go by Alice or Oak or whatever but your legal name is actually Jane Doe then that can help keep you a little safer. But it's not a magic trick and it's not undefeatable",

Anyone who is racist, misogynist, transphobic, ableist, etc. and keeps being that after getting called out is a liability. They'll probably not stick with you through a trial or write to you in prison. Anyone who is all \"Let's kill some cops\" and none of the \"Make a meal for a stranger\" is probably not gonna make it long term.",

I suspect that I will be subject to increased surveillance at least, right? \n\nI am not planning to be an asshole but I am wondering what that means in regards to avoiding the consequences of US retaliation? \n\nAnalog as possible is a good shout. Maybe buying and using a burner phone for attending meetings..",

The government always takes your metadata, so you\u2019re as surveyed as usual. Don\u2019t make violent statements in public or on camera, don\u2019t give anyone your password, don\u2019t talk to cops. You\u2019re good. Bring a snack and drink.
