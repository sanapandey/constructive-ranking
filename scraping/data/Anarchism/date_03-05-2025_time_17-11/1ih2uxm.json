    "selftext": "With the tension rising in... pretty much anywhere, and having seen some threads in here about protests, I thought we could do a little thread about safety tips for protests. I'll start by contributing what I know and what I lived, and everyone can add stuff from their own experiences. Maybe we'll disagree on some points, but it's all for giving advices to people to make sure they stay safe. (Note: Also any advices here not encouraging anyone to talk about illegal stuff online, because those advices are about \\*safety\\* and talking about illegal stuff online definitely isn't safe.)\n\nI'm not the guy with the most experience doing radical stuff during protest. But I'll still share what I have. It's mostly about \"What to do if you don't want to get arrested\", and mostly rely on being able to avoid getting stuck in complicated situations in the first place.\n\n1:  \nIn 2012 (student strike in Qu\u00e9bec), I was arrested not following a protest, but 3 months after it, because our local police had nothing else to do (Small rural city), and they wanted to file who were among the students of that specific protest in which we had blocked an exit from a public park after the prime minister came there. I wasn't even among the most radical people there at the time. I was just standing next to them, and cops happened to take my picture. It's part of what radicalized me, really. I had only stopped a guy from falling because he had been shoved by the police, and I myself tried to avoid contact with police as much as possible.\n\n\\>So yeah, avoid getting close to the police because even if they don't touch you, even if you're not doing anything specifically illegal, they can find ways to arrest you if they want. Be aware of any officer further back who might be filming or taking pictures. If you spot them, (and don't want to be arrested), move away from the hot spots\n\n2:\n\nIn 2015, I went to a protest in Montreal. It was taking place just after the anarchist bookfair, and was part of the wave of student protest against austerity measures. I was at the anarchist bookstore, and saw around 50 people marching so I just joined them. I had shirts in my bag, and ski goggles, just in case.  \nThey went to up to a street, I don't remember which, I don't know Montreal enough. It was a pedestrian street for the summer, but the cops suddenly drove in with minivans, just a bit faster than the retreating protesters were running. When the protesters where moving to the sides, the minivan stopped. Cops in riot gear got out of the minivans and grabbed the students that just got out of the vans' path. I had already moved to the sides as soon as the vans had showed up. There were not enough people to go and take them back.\n\n\\> Don't stay in the streets if the protest can't hold it anymore (When you don't have the critical mass anymore). Move to the sides and keep your distance.  You can only hold a spot against the police if there are many, many more of you than there are of them, and you still need good protective equipment to do so, and it won't last forever.\n\n3:\n\nA bit later, during the same protest, I followed a group of C\u00e9gep students to the front of their college. Someone came and said that many of their friends were stuck in a kettle and they wanted to do something about it. I didn't want my picture taken again, so I used the shirts and ski google to become part of the black-bloc.\n\nBut while I was following the group, we came to an intersection. The street to the left was flanked by cops. So I stayed on the right side of the group. Seeing that all the people I was with were turning left between two rows of cops, I tried to say something, but quickly just left the protest and hid behind some brick pillar in front of a commerce entrance. When looking at the street, the cops had wheeled behind the small group I was with. They were now being kettled. I turned around the city block a while, found another protester that had been separated. We left the spot, and I had them check out while I was finding an isolated spot to remove my black shirts and goggles.\n\nUnder my t-shirt, I had a white, XVIIIth century style shirt and coat whose sleeves I had rolled up under the t-shirt. The person I was with told be: \"You don't look like a protester\". That was the point.\n\n\\>Learn to recognize the signs of a kettle. Have disposable clothes if you want to conceal your identity. Avoid profiling by not looking like someone who would go to protests  (I know that last one is entirely dependant on privilege, but do your best)\n\n4:\n\nA few months earlier, we had taken part in a protest in winter in my rural homecity. I had a big red and black flag. I was masked, but my clothes were very noticeable. Me and my friend of the time did the protest, nothing illegal, but we still slowed traffic which is such a crime in the eyes of rural people... Coming back from the protest, we waited at our University. After a little while, we left, passed through a little wood to my appartment, but in the street of my appartment, we got stopped by police who questionned us, illegally asked us for our names and adress saying that IF we didn't comply we would be arrested. Of course they wanted our names so they would have files on the local protestors because we're a small city and there are not a lot of us out there.\n\n\\>This is the counter-example to the last trick. A mask won't save you if your clothes are still recognizable and if you don't throw away your disguise in a spot that won't be seen. Also, scout ahead, even - or should I say - ESPECIALLY after the protest. Protests ends, but there are cops working around the clock and if they want to harass protestors, they can just wait for the protest to end and target people when they go back home, isolated and vulnerable.\n\n5:  \nIn 2017, there were protests organized by racist group \"La Meute\" (wolf-pack) in Qu\u00e9bec city. A bunch of reactionnary protesting against immigration. It was around the end of november, IIRC. There was a counter-protest organized by different leftwing organizations at the same time.  \nI went there with a few friends from my small city, a 2 hour car ride away.\n\nI was dressed with a good looking coat, something someone \"professional\" would wear. I walked here and there to try and scout things a bit. I went all the way up to the rightwing protest, and then came back down to our counter-protest. When I arrived, there was already a police line pushing on counter-protestors, many of which had white traces of maalox in their face to treat the pepper spray. I was behind the police line, they were on my right. I walked up to the foot of the Qu\u00e9bec wall near the parliament.\n\nI turned right in the little park that was empty and went back toward the parliament and the counter-protestors. A bit further back, a new police line was forming, flanking the more peaceful parts of the protest.  \nI feigned innocence and asked the police to pass. They allowed me to do so.  \nI went back into the protest and warned people that a kettle was forming up. Many more liberal counter-protestors told me that it wouldn't happen there.  \nI found the people I came to Qu\u00e9bec with, and told them it was time to leave.\n\nThe kettle was forming up. Near the parliament, there is a medieval-like wall in Qu\u00e9bec, with a big door for the cars to pass through, and smaller doors on the sidewalks. A policeman with a dog was standing there. We were far enough from the rest of the protest that we didn't look like part of it.  \nA policeman on the wall told another one that we could go through. The one with the dog said we couldn't. So I told him: \"Sorry sir, but your colleague on the wall told us to go. Can we know which one we must listen to first?\" He told us \"Okay you can go\".  \nWe went and reunited with other people of our region in a small cafe, waited an hour and then left Qu\u00e9bec city.\n\nWe learned later that a few of our friends from Montreal, and one of our guy from our city, were arrested a bit further away, they were still forming a black bloc.\n\n\\>Once again, if you don't have the critical mass, leave. If you see cops forming new lines on the sides of a protest, leave. Be able to become unnoticeable. Blend yourself in the crowd of ordinary people just walking by. People will say to stay in group.  \nThis is only good when standing your ground, and this can only be done if you're in numerical superiority.  \nSooner or later, the protest will scatter and cops will start targeting those smaller groups going home. Or the protest will just be kettled.\n\nYou need to know when it's starting to happen to be able to scatter and leave just before that. I'd even recommend people who decide to organize protests to adopt a \"guerilla\" style of protests: Do the protests with ordinary-looking people scouting ahead. At the first sign of cops, signal, scatter, and reconvene at another point.",
