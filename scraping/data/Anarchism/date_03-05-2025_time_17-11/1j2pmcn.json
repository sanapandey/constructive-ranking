    "selftext": "(WIP)\n\n**This list is mostly for personal use.** If you stumble upon this post by any means you are welcome to explore. However, I won't be structuring this list in any particular order of relevance or time periods. These are things that I have studied and the resources I have used to do so. Not all are academic or credible to be sourced. I will also refrain from imparting my personal interpretation and reserve this to a separate doc. It's all a work in progress as of 01 March 2025.\n\nI'm not someone who has access to very many resources, and in so many flowery words, I may never have the means of changing the real circumstances of my material conditions. **Academia is a fundamental human right.** I don't care whether or not I ever have the credentials to speak educatively. There is no guarantee that societal conditions may ever improve and social or economic mobility may never be possible for me. You may assume with access to the technology of the 21st century like AI, automation, cellular devices, global communication systems and the world wide web, these times would be a Renaissance of sorts with world peace. Yet Late Stage Capitalists and the systems of Colonialism and Imperialism do not relent. Arm yourself with knowledge. Resist.\n\n**Smart phones and access to internet** are the most accessible tools available to read literature that I have. (a broiling resentment)\n\nAll of this, however, should come with a caveat.  A big asterisk.  A footnote.  Or several.\n\nBefore you begin, abandon all ideas of belief when it comes to your reading.  Firstly, if you read it and believe it, you may be missing the point.  I think it would be fair to say that most polytheistic religions are not talking about literal dudes chucking lightning - they're mental processes, mental states.  Their interactions are human thoughts and internal processes that we are likely blind to due to the fact that we are taught as we begin to learn and categorize and classify our world.\n\nSecond, if you let your reading begin to form belief (as in, you say \"this is true\" and you mean it), it's a really, really good way to legitimately go insane.  Actually... Even if you form a disbelief and say it's not true, that can be bad too - though not as likely to make you lose your mind.  Especially if you get into new age-y stuff - ideas like Synchronicity are very dangerous for someone who is not mentally well or stable (I am including myself in that and speaking from experience, not making a judgment on others).\n\nThe worst enemy you'll find in comparative religion and trying to \"unplug\" is convincing yourself that something is real when it's not.  The second worst is fear.  If those sentences don't scare you, you might be good.\n\nList:\n\n\u25c7[Anarchist Cookbook](https://kolegite.com/EE_library/books_and_lectures/%D0%94%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B8/%5BWilliam_Powell%5D_The_Anarchist_Cookbook(z-lib.org).pdf)\n\n\u25c7[The Diary of Anne Frank](https://www.docdroid.net/N8uGQ0o/anne-frank-the-diary-of-a-young-girl-pdf)\n\n\u25c7Plato.\n\n* [The Allegory of the Cave ](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/seyer/files/plato_republic_514b-518d_allegory-of-the-cave.pdf)\n* [Gorgias](https://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html)\n\n\u25c7[Communist Manifesto](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf)\n\n\u25c7 Gnostic Theology\n\n* [The Nag Hammadi](https://gnosis.study/library/%D0%93%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%81/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/ENG/The%20Nag%20Hammadi%20Library.%20The%20Definitive%20Translation%20of%20the%20Gnostic%20Scriptures%20Complete%20in%20One%20Volume.pdf)\n* [On The Origins of the World](http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/origin.html)\n* [The Pistis Sophia](http://www.gnosis.org/library/pistis-sophia/ps005.htm) or [An Introduction to the Pistis Sophia](https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine/the-pistis-sophia-an-introduction)\n* [The Apocryphon of John](http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn-davies.html)\n* Norea, Daughter of Eve\n* [Against Heresies](https://ia904501.us.archive.org/11/items/SaintIrenaeusAgainstHeresiesComplete/Saint%20Irenaeus%20Against%20Heresies%20Complete.pdf) by Saint Irenaeus\n\n\u25c7 The [Aeneid](https://classics.mit.edu/Virgil/aeneid.html) is a Latin poem written by Virgil between 19-29BC spanning 12 books and 9,896 lines.\n\n\u25c7 [Orpheus and Eurydice](https://www.cusd80.com/cms/lib/AZ01001175/Centricity/Domain/4937/Orpheus%20and%20Eurydice.pdf) Greek mythology about Orpheus. \n\n* [The Derveni Papyrus](https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/the-derveni-papyrus-cosmology-theology-and-interpretation/) Cosmology, Theology and Interpretations\n* [Bacchic-Orphic Epistoma](https://chs.harvard.edu/chapter/chapter-8-yannis-z-tzifopoulos-the-derveni-papyrus-and-the-bacchic-orphic-epistomia/) Hellenic Studies\n* [Orphic Totenpass](https://www.academia.edu/19199575/Passports_for_the_Afterlife_Orphic_Totenp%C3%A4sse) Passports for the Afterlife, a research paper\n\n\u25c7 [The Ars Goetia](https://ia601408.us.archive.org/15/items/lesserkeyofsolom00dela/lesserkeyofsolom00dela.pdf) or [List of 72 Demons of Solomon](https://symbolsage.com/72-demons-of-solomon-list/)\n\n\u25c7 an excerpt from [Elimination of Satans Tail](https://glorian.org/books/the-elimination-of-satans-tail/the-seven-cosmoses) by Samael Aun Weor, published 1965.\n\n\u25c7 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTHLb8QGxf4)) Ask A Mortician's Caitlin Doughty visits the Charnels of Portugal\n\n\u25c7 ([video](https://www.ted.com/talks/alua_arthur_why_thinking_about_death_helps_you_live_a_better_life)) Alua Aurthr: Why thinking about death helps you live a better life.
