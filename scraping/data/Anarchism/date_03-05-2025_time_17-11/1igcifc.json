So I have some real evidence of new people getting into shit and reflecting on a similar trend that happened in 2016 leads me to conclude that it\u2019s not a psyop it\u2019s just another protest with varying degrees of organization",

It does seem strange.  Oddly last ditch and a little pathetic/11th hour.  I\u2019m curious to see how many of the 50 states had much of a crowd at their respective capital,",

Are all protests these days \"fishy AF\" because they're protests?\n\nWere all the protests for Palestine simply shockbait for Fox News and ADL to build a case of antisemitism against everyone who opposes Israel's actions?\n\nWere the protests against Trump in Los Angeles yesterday a pysop or a waste of time?\n\n>The early fliers I saw posted a couple of days ago had some weird grammatical errors which looked like they were from non-native English speakers, and they mixed up words like \"capitol\" and \"capital\". And its social media presence is, um, anonymous.\n\nSo I guess if non-native English speakers are organizing protests against deportations, we should slam them and give them the cold shoulder. \n\nAnd just yesterday someone on this sub was saying not to post photos of peoples faces from the Los Angeles protests (where they had tons of Mexican and Salvadorean flags) but if protest organizers are staying anonymous online (in this current repressive environment) then it must by a psyop?",
