I know it's not easy on dark fabric sometimes, so props to you for doing it!\n\nI'm in the process of crocheting a big house robe/wearable blanket with pockets hahaha. It's kind of just a big ass cardigan that has a lot of room in it so I can curl up under when it's cold. My house is 110 years old and I'm pretty sure it's the draftiest place on Earth, so I need something to stay warm haha.",
