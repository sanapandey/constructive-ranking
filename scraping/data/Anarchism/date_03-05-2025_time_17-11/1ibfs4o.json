I cannot tell you for sure that it isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nWhat I can tell you for sure is that there is a magpie outside my window, and that my eyes are dripping with love for it.\n\n\n\nI can tell you I went for a walk about an hour ago, and the ground felt delicious on my feet while the wind caressed my hair.\n\n\n\nMaybe we don\u2019t get to be here for much longer. I can\u2019t honestly tell you otherwise. But I can tell you it\u2019s very possible to relish each precious instant we are here.\n\n\n\nThe universe will sing to you, if you listen. There are kisses hidden in the rustling leaves. There are galaxies hidden in the sounds of trains.\n\n\n\nWe can live from there. Even amid the raging fires. Even amid the genocide and pain. Even amid all the advertising, the vapid Hollywood dogshit, the fast fashion, the phoniness, the deceit. We can cherish the world like a mother cherishes a newborn baby, even if we wind up doing so while watching it die.\n\n\n\nWe are living in dystopia, but we don\u2019t need to be living in hell. As fraudulent and destructive as this civilization is, and as all-pervasive as its madness seems to be, it is still built on the surface of an ancient planet which pulsates with primordial wisdom. Just below the superficial layer of the cacophony of human madness, there are uncharted depths in which strange leviathans swim.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not here to tell you we\u2019re going to win this thing. I\u2019m not here to sell a false and unearned certainty in a happy ending. I\u2019m here to tell you that this world is one hell of a glorious ride regardless of what happens, and that it would be a damn shame if you didn\u2019t appreciate it while it lasts.\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t need to waste your life as one of those jaded, world-weary politically conscious people who think they know too much to be happy, and that everything is too dark and dismal to enjoy their time here. You don\u2019t need to choose between being happy and being well-informed. We are engulfed in an endless explosion of miracles and beauty in every living instant on this earth no matter what happens and no matter how much we we know. It is only a failure of our own perception if we don\u2019t recognize this.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do here, and we\u2019re going to continue seeing some very ugly things happening in our world for the foreseeable future. It does nobody any good for us to let the darkness burn us out and exhaust us instead of learning to enjoy our time on this planet while we fight.\n\n\n\nI know I\u2019ve shared this same message before in various ways, but that\u2019s only because I see a great need for it. I\u2019ve heard too many people saying they are feeling torn down and broken by the terrible things happening in this world, and that they don\u2019t know how to go on. \n\n\n\nYou go on by going in. By diving right in to reality, in all its burning, blood-soaked, agonizing glory. By feeling it all, all the way through, without trying to lean back and compartmentalize any part of yourself away from it. The ocean is unbothered by the waves not because it is separate from them but because it is inseparably one with them.\n\n\n\nFeel the pain. Cry the tears. Witness the suffering. Experience the beauty. Notice the endless eruption of love which lies at the heart of all things. Celebrate the magpie. Cherish the wind in your hair and the ground beneath your feet.\n\n\n\nNo matter what happens, nobody can take these things from you. No matter what else the bastards might take, they can never take away your innate exuberance at living a human life on this terrestrial wonderball.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the secret to finding happiness in the midst of a genocidal dystopia on a dying world. Not by hiding from the reality of it, but by diving right into it without holding anything back. \n\n\n\nIf you do this, you will find that there is so very, very much more joy, love, beauty and exhilaration in this adventure than there is heartbreak and pain. There is vast delight to be found in the smallest of things. \n\n\n\nOur minds tend to focus on what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s bad, while overlooking how absolutely fucking amazing it is to be living as a human organism on this earth. This habit can be unlearned. The gift of each moment can be appreciated as it comes. Everything that arises can be met for the first time with wide-eyed marvel.\n\n\n\nAnd we can keep fighting in the meantime. And we can do so with deep gratitude in our chests for every magical instant.\"\n\n\n\nhttps://caitlinjohnstone.com.au/2025/01/14/how-to-be-happy-in-a-genocidal-dystopia-on-a-dying-world/",

Radical acceptance is a very powerful tool but it can be over applied. At its extremes it pushes for passivity.\n\nI am focused on how fucking amazing it is to be alive on this planet, that's why I'm stressed as fuck for my kids and others ability to continue to do so. \n\nOf course people are worried and scared, worrying and scary things are happening. For me the conversation is about what is meaningful action I can take, and what is meaningless rumination, how do I minimise the rumination so I can still enjoy my time with family, friends and my community while taking that meaningful action.",

                            "body": "You just made the distinction: right action vs thinking. Einstein said the intuitive mind is the sacred gift and the rational mind is its faithful servant. Think of the rational mind as the corner of an acute angle and the intuitive mind the infinity behind it. It's the zoomed in perspective vs zoomed out perspective.\n\nYou are not your mind, but the awareness behind it. Once you realize this you'll be able to always be tapped into the intuitive mind. Then, the rational mind goes from master to servant. You'll find that 80%+ of your prior thinking was useless, just spinning your wheels, running you in circles.\n\nRead A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle for an in depth illustration. He gives some very simple and basic techniques to ground you in the now, in the intuitive mind. Then, you just take right action naturally. That is, if you can stay alert enough to not fall for the tricks of the ego. It will scratch and claw to survive. The key is to remain NEUTRAL to pain, to be cool with being uncool, to accept your non-acceptance, to surrender to your non-surrender. This will create space between your true self (consciousness) and the mental/emotional conditioning (thoughts, emotions, sensations, memories) that pass through it. Eventually the emotional pain buried in the enteric nervous system will be transmuted into life affirming energy.\n\n\"When the noise ends the universe whispers its secrets.\"\n\n-Rumi",

I know this already. \n\nAlone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy. \n\nRemember this: Freedom is a pure idea. \n\nIt occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they\u2019ve already enlisted in the cause. \n\nRemember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. \n\nAnd then remember this: The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. \n\nTyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. \n\nAnd know this: the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire\u2019s authority and then there will be one too many. \n\nOne single thing will break the siege. \n\nRemember this: Try.",
