Scott, Yale professor of Anthropology and Agricultural studies is a self proclaimed anarchist and has written many university level books on historical and social topics seen through an anarchist lens. I just finished reading his book *Against the Grain, a Deep History of the Earliest States.* \n\nThis book specifically investigates whether or not emerging agricultural methods (such as the discovery/cultivation of grain and millet using flood plains) led to centralized settlements, and whether this centralization led to hierarchies. It's sort of a trojan horse argument against the capitalist / nationalist claim that hierarchy and institutions create the greatest human potential for development and progress. James C. Scott says, no, actually, we were doing just fine before hierarchy and institutions began to control us.\n\nIf your tastes are more offbeat, I recommend Terrence McKenna, the godfather of psilocybin research. Some of his theories match up quite nicely with James C. Scott. I enjoyed *Food of the Gods*. While much of McKenna can be refuted through hard archaeological evidence, his stoned ape and death of the feminine divine theories are fascinating.\n\nScott & McKenna would both agree: Capitalism=/=Imperialism are the current forms of a millenia old subjugation of humanities greatest potential.",

Absolutely fascinating, totally blew my mind and made me see human sociopolitical structures in a whole new light. I could not possibly recommend it more highly.\n\nEdit: Also, the sci-fi work *The Dispossessed* by Ursula K. Le Guin is in my opinion an absolute masterpiece.
