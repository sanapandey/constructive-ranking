    "selftext": "Cultural anthropology in a nutshell: Human life occurs in group realities, lived systems of concepts and practices, meanings and activities, that lay out the structures and contents of worlds of experience.\n\nThe worlds of experience built out of meanings and practices that we occupy and enact include forms of agency and personhood, general structures of intention and desire, general conceptions of self and others, and the social and physical terrain of everyday life.\n\nWe are socialized into group realities, with their particular systems of concepts and practices, which we then produce and reproduce as we enact ourselves and live our everyday lives using the available symbolic and material resources.\n\nSociocultural realities (group enactments of worlds of experience and practice) are potentially (and usually) constituted with various forms of inequality and domination built in. Building inequality into daily life generally benefits the privileged by making it hard to see from the inside, where the inequality may appear \u201cnatural.\u201d Thus, people can enact inequality, as either privileged or subordinated, as they enact everyday life, without being fully aware of what they are doing.  \n  \nAnthropology raises (but mostly avoids addressing too clearly) the question of what we can do about the realities we live in. Does having a good higher-order theory of human reality, language, and power enable us to develop a better \u2018language-practice\u2019 that could facilitate the construction of better realities, based not on power concentration but on democracy, freedom, time, love, or whatever other values groups of like-minded people decide are best for them at any given moment? I don\u2019t see any good reason not to be optimistic, to believe (even as faith if necessary, as it probably is) that groups of humans acting in good will have the capacity \u2014 the freedom and the ability \u2014 to create much much better ways of living than we\u2019ve got going now.\n\n",

It showed me the systems we have and hold so dearly are not \"natural\" or \"just the way things are\" but that they are just social constructions of groups of people.\n\n\nRealizing this showed me how that what we have now wont always exist in the future and that the future can be made better by us if we wish it",

            "body": "If anyone felt like they needed this translated,  I got you. \n\nCultural anthropology studies how people live in groups and create shared beliefs, customs, and ways of life. This study is useful to anarchists as its description of humans behavior, especially inside and outside dominance hierarchies and how they shape societies, tends to agree heavily with anarchist theory. Understanding cultural anthropology can help anarchists better understand how group systems shape how we see the world, ourselves, and others.\n\nPeople are born into these systems, learn them - often without knowing they're doing it - and then continue them in their daily lives. Many of these systems include hidden inequalities that feel \"normal\" to those inside them, making them hard to notice or challenge.\n\nAnthropology asks whether understanding these systems can help us change them. If people work together with good intentions, they may be able to build fairer and freer ways of living. There's reason to be hopeful that we can create something better than what exists now.\n\nAnd I personally agree strongly.  I think one of the books that makes the most convincing argument for anarchism, without ever mentioning it, it's an anthropology book called Hierarchy in the Forest.",
