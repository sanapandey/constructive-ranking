I would say that we *are* cooked though, that's undeniable, it's just a matter of rare, medium or well-done,  depending on our actions.\n\nIn defense of Doomerism, I think it *can* motivate people to act, under the right conditions. Similarly, forced Revolutionary Optimism might be dismissed as bullshit for people who are deep in the pits of despair, and will make that despair worse if the messaging conflicts with their lived reality. Doomerism and Optimism are both psychological copes, and can both be active or passive.\n\nWith despair and doom, sometimes the way out is through. For some people, Radical Doomerism *is* that way through.",
