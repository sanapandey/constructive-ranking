The sad reality is that language does evolve and is fluid, which while lending itself to positive change, can also mean terms that were once ableist take on new meaning. \n\nI think if we cast too wide a net and accuse anyone who uses the term \u201cstupid\u201d for example as ableist we begin to diminish our own argument and any potential for solidarity. \n\nBeing a leftist is about challenging necessary prejudice and inequality. For example the R word is directly used to prejudice people. I don\u2019t think all of the words in this video meet that criteria. The down votes are likely because this feels a bit \u201cculture wars-y\u201d if I was to guess.",

I hear my daughter and her friends using the word gay all the time, like \u201cthat\u2019s gay.\u201d I asked her about it since the majority of her friends are queer in some form of another, and she said it\u2019s her generations (younger GenZ) fight against language policing. She says the left and the right are becoming more authoritarian and language policing is part of it. But maybe that\u2019s good. Maybe the youth will break out of this dumb left/right dichotomy we have going in this country. The left has been co-opted by democrats anyway.\u00a0\n\nAnarchists, as far as I am concerned, are anti-coercion. Social pressure is coercion. It\u2019s one thing to give an opinion or explain to someone about how a word affects you or people you love. It\u2019s another to call people ableist (which is loaded word) or bigots because they use words that are deemed bad or unenlightened. I can\u2019t even comment of the negative environmental impacts of pre-chopped onions without being called ableist. It\u2019s like the biggest movements on the left are arguing about \u00a0individualistic semantics and there are no anti-war, anti-fascist movements. No labor movement. No environmental movement, just a bunch of squabbling leftists. Trump is taking a wrecking ball unimpeded to the country, and there is hardly a resistance, because everyone is hyper focused on their one little thing, on their personal politics, of wanting the world to adapt to their personal desires about how others treat them.\u00a0\n\nDamn, I\u2019m going in a rant. Nevermind. Forget everything I said. I\u2019m done.\u00a0",

Etymology often reveals something about our culture or the deeper meaning of a word.\n\nOne of my favorites is \"entt\u00e4uschen\", which literally means undeceive. But over time it developed a negative connotation and now means to disappoint.\n\nPersonally I approach language with this kind of curiosity. I think the culture war is won through honest, good faith engagement and by forming connections.\n\nThe stronger those connections are, the more we can _trust_ each other to use language freely and without harm, regardless of the terms themselves.\n\nOr rather turn the war upside down into a form of mutual aid, where we cooperate and communicate with curious mind and goodwill.\n\n> One need not destroy one's enemy.

The first can basically be dismissed out of hand. The origins of these words, as presented in the video, are completely irrelevant. How many of us knew about this before our adult years? How many more people who aren't in these kinds of circles even know about the origins *at all for their whole lives*? If a word completely evolves away from its original meaning, what does it matter to me what it used to mean other than as a historical curiosity?\n\nThe second, more interesting pillar, really seems to me like a gap in language combined with a misattribution. Even ignoring the origins, I can see how these words can still be used in an ableist way, but that would be made clear by tone and intent, not the word itself.\n\nNow, obviously that sucks, but the simple fact of the matter is, in English, we have no other words to convey what people normally use these words for. We have ignorant for someone who simply doesn't have the proper information, and we have willfully ignorant for someone who refuses to obtain the proper information. But what about someone who has the same information as you, and yet somehow comes to the wrong or faulty conclusion? That's what most people are using the word for. Someone who clearly has the same information as you and somehow still manages to come to an improper conclusion (whether that's factually improper or one you don't agree is proper, even if there's no definitive conclusion). So to wholesale call the words ableist seems to me a misattribution of what people are generally using said words for. It mostly means someone who can think just fine and chooses not to, not someone who literally can't.\n\nAnd for someone like me who doesn't even believe that intelligence is fixed (outside of mental or intellectual disabilities), I simply fail to see how using the proper word for the concept above is ableist. I suppose you could make the case that far more people do think intelligence is fixed, but even then, these words have two meanings generally. There's just not really a word for the concept above that I can think of that couldn't, in some way, be defined as ableist, since they generally all share the two meanings.",

But if I'm at a work meeting and someone thanks me for holding down the fort while going on PTO, I'm not going to be like \"wow this person hates native people\". \n\n\"No can do\" originated in mocking the way early Chinese immigrants to the US talked. If you've ever called something a \"cake walk\" you're referring to a practice where slave owners made slaves do funny dances for their entertainment in exchange for a piece of cake.\n\nI guess I'm saying we have to pick our battles. R*tard should probably not be thrown around because it's used as a slur today. But every English speaking 10 year old calls stuff stupid or dumb or lame. All media uses these words. Only a tiny percentage of the population know what they used to mean, and people who want to call disabled people slurs use different words aka the words we more readily recognize as slurs",
