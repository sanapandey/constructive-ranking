Fighting requires organizing and preparation.\u00a0\n\n\nI recommend picking one thing you are really passionate about, let's say stopping deportations. Set a certain amount of time per week to work on it. Let's say 6 hours, so 3 days a week you spend 2 hours learning as much as possible. The history of the boarder, which airports are used for flights, how I've tactics have evolved, what groups have been doing good support work, etc.\n\n\nLink up with other like minded people. Join a rapid response phone tree. Actually dig into the complicated world of organizing. We're not all just on our phones, but until it needs to be seen it won't be and that keeps us safe.\n\n\nSome resources that MIGHT be helpful.

I appreciate the energy, but if people don't know what the local vulnerabilities are what are they going to attack?\n\n\nPeople are already starting if you saw some of the other links I shared. Some anarchists think working in small temporary groups based on affinity works well for targeted attacks. I assume to build the skills and capacity necessary for larger actions. That is not what I'm trying to do, but those people are quiet about it otherwise they go to prison.\n\n\nI personally focus more on social struggle and support for those who have taken action.

In my area, we've now organized monthly clothing swaps to clothe people. There were always clothing swaps, but they were small and the word never really got out about them. But now, we've made them huge! :D I've already heard from several parents that it helped them get winter clothes for their children, several trans people that it helped them get gender affirming clothes, and houseless people that they were able to find winter gear! I love clothes, and fashion, and upcycling, and mending, and so this was the perfect thing to get involved with! Find something you love, are passionate about, enjoy doing and go out and do it. \n\n\nSome things to think about are clothing swaps, repair cafes, pull over prevention clinics, immigration help, covid safety help, food banks and soup kitchens, the list goes on!",
