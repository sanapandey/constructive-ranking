I see neonazis absolutely everywhere, bots and humans, and the owners of the platforms we foolishly flocked to and believed to be safe in, believed to be our own spaces, have made them into Nazi propaganda hotbeds. We need to act, the Internet is in the hands of the wealthy and we need a new medium. Let us go back to paper-and-voice-based propaganda. Distritibute pamphlets and talk to your community, organize events and meetings. We cannot go silently. Its seriously now or never. This is the last round.",
