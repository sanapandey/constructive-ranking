Another term for anarchism is libertarian socialism. https://lucyparsonsproject.com/anarchism.html",

To pour life into moulds, is the aim of those who would try to dominate, maim, torture, disable, and kill others.\n\n>Oppression demands the domestication of life.  Such power in turn calls for policed categorisation and individualisation (of 'slaves', of 'women', of 'races', of 'labourers', of all of those recognised and excluded and othered by an oppressor), systems of surveillance and control, organised authority in the State, forced labour for the extraction of energy, dominion over those whose lives are necessary to the reproduction of oppression.  Free singularities are lost to catalogued individuals under diverse and overlapping reigns of hierarchy.\n\n>To render this behavior acceptable, even seductive, wild thought is necessarily tamed to speak of supreme divinities, eternal truths, moralities, and laws of nature, a metaphysical babble wedded to material trinkets and hallucinogens, to assure our silence and slumber.\n\n>To awaken is to awaken to life, to life beyond any absolute truth, any absolute right and wrong; to life attentive only to the needs of desires as lived in the times and spaces in which singularities surge forth. If human 'progress' ever meant anything worthy of the word, it was exclusively in the sense of expanding freedom and the constant increase of solidarity and continuity that depend upon the free attraction of its component parts, and in no way upon compulsory forms.\n\n>The anarchy of life thus finds a resonance in a human anarch-ism, in the great foundational belief that all forms of external authority must disappear to be replaced by self-control only.  Such an anarchism lies beyond labels or adjectives, programmes, methods and/or organisations.  The idea sweeps through all the realms of art, science, literature, math, education, sex relations, and personal morality, as well as social economy. For this is what Anarchism finally means, the whole unchaining of life.\"  \n  \n\\-Voltairine DeCleyre",

Most simply, sure, anarchism is that which makes anarchy possible, with the \"end goal\" being anarchy. The absence of *archy*, the absence of rule, government and authority.\n \nBut it seems silly to suggest a more concrete *end* than that, much like it would be silly to fixate on an end goal for my life. My focus is on what happens in between, on the on-going, changing, evolving. Anarchy is a continuously renewed commitment, a practical and pragmatic commitment in favor of unforeclosed beginnings, more so than it is an end.",

But I have certainly grown a bit allergic to attempts at reducing anarchism to *anti-statism*, for example. It's the sort of inconsistency and disregard for anarchy that gave rise to anarcho-capitalism, anarchist democratic \"governance\", and other such nonsense.\n \nI'm not sure I fully understood your questions, my English may be reaching its limits.

In my experience it's no more difficult to untangle the confusions about anarchy than it is to clarify our ideas about loaded terms like libertarianism and socialism. YMMV I guess.",

There's no good anarchist rationale for that to be anywhere near accurate.\n  \nSimilarly unhelpful is a fixed subordination of anarchism to socialism, characterizing it as a mere 'branch' to a larger socialist 'tree'. One of my concerns is that such a framing suggests an easily shareable understanding of socialism from which we can derive the meaning of anarchism, when for all of its history socialism has been a highly contested term, with many of the dominant socialisms outright denying the possibility of anarchy. My stance here is informed by a good look at the earliest developments of anarchist and socialist thought, before relative late-comers anarchist communism and syndicalism emerged, so it's probably not a question of being 'classic' enough.",
