Had my libertarian phase in my late teens for a moment, was a conservative for about a year in my early 20s when I became religious again, which faded away as well. The compass always points north for me. I've always been a democratic socialist or an anarchist of some form. Probably comes from growing up between a working class home and a middle class home. I always knew which side I was on. Mom was a union organizer and rep when I grew up, took me to strikes and union meetings when I was a little kid. I helped organize protests and walkouts in high school. And I've always lived in an anarchistic way. I'm not interested in making money. And I'm very hesitant to be anyone's boss. Even though I've had authority over people while working in social work. I always navigate things ethically as an anarchist and treat my authority carefully with responsibility.",

Being relegated to a life of slave labour, forced to take part in economic and social systems opposed to my inclinations towards freedom was revelatory. I realized that, ultimately, I want to be free. This transition occured in my 30s.",

Call me a romantic but I do have faith we can achieve the goal, maybe just not on a globalist scale- but a return back to small community living with the environment- just like the aboriginals did for the last 65,000+ years",

I grew up distrusting institutions, and wanting to be free of social restrictions like a good kid of the 90s lol. But what compels me about anarchism isn't that flat view of it, but what Chomsky said, that power must justified itself, and if it can't be, it ought to be dismantled. My political education began when I learned about the electoral college, and my experience with politics in the stolen election of 2000, thru 9/11, the disappointments of Obama, the Ferguson uprising, the mob murder of Ahmaud Arbery, Trump and J6. All those since I have been able to vote, to participate as a citizen. So it's little surprise to me now that I am an anarchist: American power has no justification.",
