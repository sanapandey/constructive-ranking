    "selftext": "\"The functioning of the [autonomous government](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/zapatistas-lecciones-de-auto-organizaci%C3%B3n-comunitaria-en/), schools and clinics, as well as other collective projects, is financed by earnings from cooperatives and land collectives. These are at the center of Zapatistas\u2019 aspiration to reach economic self-sufficiency from the state and to build an economy based on equitable distribution of resources. While cooperatives and collectives coexist with family land and individual entrepreneurship, participation in collective work on a rotating basis is obligatory. \n\nThere are also popular banks in the form of revolving funds that make low-interest loans to members of the support base communities. These banks generate funds that get invested in new collective projects. Some collectives are women-only and intend to provide an opportunity for women to gain confidence and participate in the social life of their communities.\"\n\n[That is mutualist banking!\n](https://solidarity-us.org/p4135/)\n\nWhy don't anarachists in the US try starti g a mutualist bank. Micro loans do not require all that much money we have lawyers and doctors and nurses. Would it not be enough to invest part of your savings or retirement in a mutualist initiative and have low interest returns that also help grow anarchist worker empowerment in your community? \n\nAre you already way ahead of me? I wanna know about how you are doing it, or plan to so we can make this happen more often.\n",
