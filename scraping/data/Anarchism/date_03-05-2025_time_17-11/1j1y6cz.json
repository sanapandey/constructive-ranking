    "selftext": "A lot of people are introduced to anarchism via our anti-state arguments, and most often I suspect this leads to people seeing anarchism as being simply impractical. After all, how else can you organize a society other than with a state? It would be complete chaos. And yes we have An Anarchist FAQ to answer questions like these, but I think it's likely not many get that far.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting is a combination of tactics to change the way in which anarchism is introduced to people. Rather than starting off by making anti-state arguments, I think we should focus on introducing people to alternative ways of organizing. We should be promoting things like consensus decision-making and its egalitarian nature. Egalitarianism is an extremely popular value, after all. We should be pointing to real-world examples of these kinds of organizations, like the Zapatistas, Rojava, anarchist Catalonia, Freetown Christiania, the Makhnovists, and various examples of \"primitive communism\". Of course this means that anarchists must become more familiar with these topics in order to talk about them, but there are many books on this topic. There are quite a few at the [AK Press](https://www.akpress.org). Further examples may include workers' co-ops.\n\nOnly once people understand alternatives to the state will they become receptive to anti-state arguments. This approach can be extended to include a similar approach to anti-capitalist arguments. Emphasizing alternatives to capitalism should come before critiques of capitalism.\n\nEssentially what I'm suggesting is a shift in focus away from critiquing the state and towards constructing alternatives. Of course we should not do away with critiques of the state, but the promotion of alternatives should precede these critiques, not follow them.",

            "body": "Hi, I'm really interested in one of your statements here, but I want to emphasize first, this is genuine curiosity, not meant in any way as a disagreement.\n\nTo preface, I was largely disillusioned from even vaguely broaching these topics with anyone for years because it seemed anyone who hadn't already bought into the idea of socialism/leftism/communism/anarchism, any of it, was practically programmed to reflexively dismiss these ideas, no matter how much more coherent they are than capitalism could ever possibly be. So I'm really interested in methods of introducing anarchism now that there's a tiny, bubbling bit of class consciousness in society.\n\nNow, on to my actual question. Why do you say that alternatives to capitalism should be emphasized before critiques of it? My original process was to slowly introduce the concept of surplus value, because I figured learning mathematically how the value of our labor is stolen from us would land for a majority of people. Then I would move on to emphasizing that the world is actively dying because of our economic system, since only the types of people I could never reach would be able to deny that.\n\nI'd largely ignore alternatives, unless asked about it directly, in which case I would explain anarchism, its different subsets, as well as different concepts for socialism and even communism that weren't ML.\n\nSo anyways, obviously that didn't work very well for me, so I'm curious why explaining alternatives before critique is a better approach? Is it because people are so propagandized as to believe nothing other than capitalism could function as well, therefore critiquing it is largely purposeless? Or is this an anarchist specific approach? I could see how introducing the extra concept of anti-state could be unrelated to what I was trying to do (just generally make more anti-capitalists of non-specific variety).",

I feel like a lot of people are not receptive to critiques not because they\u2019re bad critiques but because they cannot conceive of how it could possibly be otherwise. Or in the specific case of capitalism, they might immediately think of a command economy like the USSR had. If they oppose that or they can\u2019t think of any other alternatives, their opinion will probably be something along the lines of \u201cyeah, maybe it does suck, but what else can you do?\u201d",

            "body": "I think you're very right about this. A positive program (i.e. something you're *for*) is much better for building long term strategy than is a politics of opposition, which often struggles to connect even a successful campaign to next steps ([The Shock of Victory](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-the-shock-of-victory) is a good piece on this). A positive program also makes it clearer what people and groups are allied with you on just one or two issues versus whose politics are actually aligned with yours. \n\nCriticisms of capitalism and the state are important, but they don't do anything if people don't see a viable alternative-- it becomes \"this sucks but it's as good as things can get and at least I'm not at the very bottom of the social pyramid\".\n\nGelderloos' [Anarchy Works](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works) is one of my favorites for the reasons you outlined, because it shows what the basic principles of anarchism are and how many different societies and subgroups have put those into practice. Too many people see anarchism as a purely hypothetical future utopia than as a set of practical, useful methods that people are applying in the here-and-now to organize their lives and societies as they see fit.\n\nFor these reasons one of my main goals in organizing is to learn methods of horizontal organizing and practice them with other people.",
