With everything that's going on in the world today I feel I have no right to just sit back and watch as fascism is slowly becoming a potent and powerful force in our daily lives. I want to get off my ass and get involved in direct action and participate in all the protests that have been going on. There aren't any in my community though because I live somewhere very rural. If there was a demonstration nearby I'd be more than willing to travel to get there, but the problem is I'm not sure how or where to find out where people are meeting. How exactly do you find out where and when protests will be held so you can join? I'd appreciate some advice. Thanks in advance for your reply.",

            "body": "Honestly? I don\u2019t think protesting is a great use of time.\n\nI say this as someone who has been involved in anarchism basically my entire life, got started with food not bombs when I was 14 and lived in a punk house with a lot of anarchist activity when I was young as well. I have worked as a professional organizer and I have orchestrated successful, long-term rent strikes, and things like that. I say all that to say, I have a good bit of experience in this stuff lol\n\nIf you really want to \u201cget off your ass\u201d and make a difference, I think pre-figurative work and mutual aid is going to be the most rewarding, and the place where it\u2019s most helpful to apply your time. \n\nThe left doesn\u2019t need more protestors lol-we got the \u201cagitation\u201d in our AEIOUs down.\n\nPeople love to do the \u201csexy\u201c stuff like protests because they are high visibility and you get a lot of positive feedback, but the true work is going to be building out mutual aid structures and community care, and maybe community defense.\n\nEspecially going into the current situation we are in, they want you to protest so they can put you in jail lol. Everyone is aware there\u2019s a problem and aware that people aren\u2019t happy about it, so protests have minimal value unless they have a very specific goal like blocking a certain thing or intimidating a certain person. And even then, the risk is usually not worth the reward and there are ways to handle it that do not end up with everybody being on the news and in jail.\n\nIf you want to get involved in local organizing that\u2019s actually meaningful, I recommend looking for local labor organizing, local tenant organizing, or something like that with a concrete material, but less highly visible goal. \n\nAny of these organizations that are perpetually putting together protests is only going to burn you out and put you on whatever list your local government is keeping. \n\nAlso avoid the DSA and PSL like the plague.\n\nYou could also form your own direct action pod. Direct action is high risk and I don\u2019t recommend doing it with folks that you don\u2019t know and trust with your life. It might be better for you to find a couple other like-minded people and start your own as opposed to trying to plug-in with strangers. You want to be with people that you know will do their best to dearrest you, or stay around to use their stop the bleed training if something happens to you, as opposed to running away.\n\nETA: to evaluate if a group of people is worth spending your time on, you want to look and see if they have a very explicitly and directly articulated goal-ie \u201c our organization provides free legal resources and kyr training to tenants facing eviction\u201d or \u201c our organization helps organize childcare pods in underserved neighborhoods\u201d - you want to look for concrete material things that the organization is providing and proof that it is doing it well. \n\nAnd you want to make sure it\u2019s happening in a mutual aid/sustainable/solidarity way that actually gives more training/autonomy to the people it\u2019s helping, not just a charity thing where they throw some canned food at people once a month and call that helping.\n\nStay away from any organization that has liberal word soup in their goals, vision, etc: ie \u201cWe aim to legitimize the ideas of identity politics and DEI to create a sustainable space where we spread joy through acts of self-care, because self-care is resistance\u201c\n\nThey literally just said jack shit right there about what they actually do, and I bet they don\u2019t actually do jack shit",

So I put what I was doing on pause and joined in. I met a DSA organizer and she's been helping me keep up since. I've only done one more protest since then but it's only been like 4 days. \n\nI'm not a Democrat or a communist because I'll work with them happily to obtain a better world. \n\nYou could also try doing it yourself. At one I got so frustrated never hearing about protest until after that I made a protest sign and marched by myself up and down the busiest road in my small conservative city. The sign said \"it's ok to punch nazi\" and I think i did a good job making it. \n\nOf course I understand that no everyone can do that. But if you're like me, so constantly anxious that embarrassment no longer exist, that could be an option for you.",

So the best strategy is to try to join this \"reformist\" struggles and try to promote a more radical stance while you help them to gain little demands.\nThis strategy is really talked a lot from historical anarchists like Malatesta and some anarchosyndicalist groups like \"Los amigos de Durruti\".",

That way you now how horizontal organizations works, how to participate in those spaces and how to to detect entrism from authoritarian communist.",

It would be much harder if you are rural though. A group of women in my community called \"women in action\" started before the election. They just wrote postcards for candidates. This morning they wrote a letter demanding a town hall meeting with their federal representative, tried to set an appointment to deliver it. They wouldn't agree to appt but we delivered letter along with marching and protesting at his local office. It was pretty effective and made the news",
