            "body": "Ok so this question has weighed heavy on my mind for a few years- how to transition outside of the capitalist system. I mean we need hormones and surgeries. Before I realized I was trans, when I was living as a man I was way into homeopathy and natural remedies and herbal medicine and stuff. But none of that is very powerful for transitioning. I know a girl who says she is anarchopunk but she just plays video games all day and she also is part of the capitalist exploitation (she has a job) she just listens to punk and wears some punk band t shirts . But I mean how to reconcile the cost of surgeries/hormones with being an anarchist? This question is for trans and nb anarchists",
