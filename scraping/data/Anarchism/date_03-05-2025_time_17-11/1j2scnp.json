Communist who do not recognize the role of anti-statist hierarchy can\u2019t be entirely scientifically socialist. Marx has so many ideas that are applicational to everyday praxis when we utilize the anarchist lens. Organization of the working class only works when we acknowledge complexity theory and recognize the needs of individuals can\u2019t be uniform we must work towards progress in which we do not damn each other to hold authority over the other.

They are at peace around the watering hole.\n\nMake a watering hole and see the people come drink. So that is money,resources that meet peoples needs,  entertainment, power, wisdom, art , spiritual inspiration, communion. A place with any of these things people will gather as these places meet their needs, without competition. These watering holes reward cooperation and punish competition. \n\nThe material opportunity that creates the win-win environment that anarchy needs. The watering hole can make new watering holes.\n\nCooperatives can continuously contribute 20% profits to a fund for starting other cooperatives and also providing funding for some community initiatives---that createa money for autonomous assemblies to decide on. As more and more cooperatives are created that contribute to the communal pool more pools of various types can be created.\n\nYou see changes to material conditions shape culture, the relations of production do shape the culture and communities that form around them. So go make a watering hole and make more. Soon enough it will be more than oasis it will be a lush paradise with drinking ponds of all types all around. \n\nWe must begin with that goal in mind.",
