    "selftext": "Hi friends, forgive me if this is pointed out a fair bit but Wikipedia has gotten some diabolically good information about the history of anarchism.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anarchists\\_by\\_nationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anarchists_by_nationality) \\- for example, this category contains around 1,500 anarchists. Including many outside the usual stories we learn about anarchists from the USA-France-Spain-Russia world. If I may point out a few from random places I find really interesting:\n\n* [Canek Sanchez Guevara ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canek_S%C3%A1nchez_Guevara)(Cuba/Mexico) - Artist and Che Guevara\u2019s grandson.\n* [Miguelina Acosta Cardenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguelina_Acosta_C%C3%A1rdenas) (Peru) - First woman to graduate in law in Peru and the first trial lawyer in Peru.\n* [Moises Santiago Bertoni ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mois%C3%A9s_Santiago_Bertoni)(Switzerland/Paraguay) - Botanist who introduced Stevia to the west. Actually has a town in Paraguay named after him. ([Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Mois%C3%A9s_Bertoni) is the Wiki for that town).\n* [Omar Aziz ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Aziz_(anarchist))(Syria) - During the early stages of the Syrian Civil War, he helped organise neighbourhood committees. It seems like his death in 2013 was partially induced by torture from the Syrian government. \n* [Virginia Bolten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Bolten) (Argentina/Uruguay) - Early Argentine feminist, she led the first womens strike and established the first feminist newspaper in Argentina.\n* [Wong Sau Ying ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Sau_Ying)(China) - Tried to assassinate a British colonial official in Malaysia around 1925 - indirectly causing a moral panic modern women\u2019s fashion in Malaysia.",

I was recently reading about Japanese anarchists like [\u014csugi Sakae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C5%8D_Noe?wprov=sfla1) and [It\u014d Noe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C5%8D_Noe?wprov=sfla1) from the main list you posted.\n\nI'm currently learning Japanese so it was fun to translate and learn words like \u30a2\u30ca\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8 (annakisuto) from digging into quotes and biographies further. \u2764\ufe0f",

Try to fiddle with the pneumonics to make them include the kunyomi, onyomi and radicals and they need to be memorable. You don't really need them for the first 30-100 kanji but you REALLY need them afterwards. Eventually after a year or so you forget them and just remember the kanji. You do have to do the anki deck everyday though\u00a0",
