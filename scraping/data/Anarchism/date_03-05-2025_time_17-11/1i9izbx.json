The lack of \u201cquote tweet\u201d is really much more significant than you\u2019d think, and it takes way more work to self-manage, which most people don\u2019t want to put in because we\u2019re tired. \n\nRight now, Bluesky is better than lots of social media, there\u2019s no algorithm, and you can control your interactions much easier. But it probably won\u2019t last because it\u2019s ultimate purpose is not to be good but to make money.",

Even if you block somebody, the API will let anybody get a list of everyone you have blocked. There are people who are getting their followers to harass anyone who has blocked them.\n\nI don't know what the solution is. I wish there was a way to have a system with an open protocol, where it was still possible for me to have privacy. I need to spend more time researching the Fediverse. And, I do not consider blue sky to be part of the Fediverse because it really isn't federated or distributed. It may be an open source software platform, but, every instance of the blue sky software setup will act as an independent silo, rather than a federated co-contributor.",
