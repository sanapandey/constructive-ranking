We were talking about certain former president of our country (I'm not from the US and neither are my family), and she said this former president fucked up the immigration policy. I asked my mom: \"Why do you think that?\"; and she answered with \"Now, the country is full of Haitians!\"\n\nI frowned, and I asked her what's wrong with that. To be honest, I don't mind Haitian immigrants, and, why should I? My mom replied with, *you know*, the standard phrase \"They're stealing jobs from us!\" I explained to her that what really happened (in our country) was that immigrants took all the jobs people in my country **don't want to do**, and for less than minimun wage. There aren't solid protections for immigrants in my country, so, employers, take advantage of this, and prefer to hire immigrants (whether they are illegal or not) and pay them a pittance in wages, as cheap labor, rather to hire non-immigrant people. I explained to my mom that this isn't immigrants' fault, this is a failure within the legal system of our country. \n\nMy mom is strongly against illegal immigration. She said: \"Delinquents enter to our country through illegal immigration!\" And, even though that's true in some cases, organized crime enters countries illegally, we can't assume every single one illegal immigrant crosses borders with that intention, especially when there's a fucking dictatorship near my country that's starving people to death. Obviously, people escaping from that dictatorship will do so by illegal ways, otherwise, they would be shot in place",
