This is a followup to a post I made last week https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1ie36co/why_did_you_stop_organizing/\n\nThe themes I'm seeing are hopelessness, frustration, burnout, poor communication, issues w/ charismatic or controlling leaders, misogyny and anti-queer sentiment. \n\nHere is my followup question to you: what about the right wing makes their organizing so successful? What do you feel is lacking in anarchist organizing that other ideologies succeed in? ",

Right wing ideology is essentially easy mode for people. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the problem it\u2019s (insert some other group) ruining everything.\u201d\n\nPropaganda and hegemony eroding critical thinking and creating an instantaneous consumption and distraction society mean we lack the internal critique to accept leftist values and solutions because it requires people to take actual responsibility and self-empower. \n\nFolks have to want this self- and therefore collective empowerment for themselves.",

Therefore, by its nature, right wing organizing tends to be more stable as long as existing power structures remain intact. In contrast, revolutionary/anarcho-communist social structures bloom in power vacuums and are inherently unstable -until power structures have been completely dismantled and replaced by anarcho-communist ones. I believe this is why, historically speaking, we see revolutionary movements coming in waves. \n\nThe question is, how can we make revolutionary organizing to be worth it, even in defeat?",

He hates organized religion, hates the powers that be, organized and still does occasionally with his local community. And he's not the only guy I know like this. I think we really need to not be so quick to write people off as conservative based on their looks. It's one thing if they're wearing a Maga hate or some Nazi symbolism, but just because they're former military or a cis-het looking white dude doesn't mean they're not gonna be rallying around the same things we are.",

One of the most influential people in my life that set me on the path of politics I have now was my high school religion teacher, an older, religious cishet white dude. He has a strict belief in non-violent tactics of resistance in large part because of his radical understanding of Jesus Christ as an enemy of the state. We can disagree and diverge on tactical perspectives and still broadly be on the same boat about our intended end goals. He has been doing the incredible, long and slow work of building up consciousness and rallying within civil society that I have to give credit for. He's an example to me of why I can't fully write off Christianity, even if I've experienced pain and hurt at the hands of the Catholic Church and its followers.",

They typically use the same techniques to indoctrinate people in religion and politics.\n\nPull back the curtain and show them the man manipulating them.

And, of course, he's likely (allegedly) paying off judges, police officers, etc...because he's got theomey to do so. So, leftist groups tend to be a bit guarded about who they do actually let in to help because they often have to be. They'll help anyone, but to be a part of the group takes a lot.

I thought a lot about your first question and i hadn\u2019t included this in my first answer but another burnout was authoritarian people or very divisive (hateful) people joining anarchist affinity groups and then either taking charge in the case of the authoritarian or dividing everyone and doing witch hunts and gross hatred, or both. That also made me disillusioned with anarchist organizing.\n\n\nBut for question 2- right wing people aren\u2019t adverse to authoritarianism, as long as it is worded with terms like leader and whatnot. They also have nothing else to commit their passions to than to protest a gay church or whatever the right wing mobilization does. Anarchists live free and if they are activists, along with radical left wing activists, they have spread their energies thin by fighting an uphill battle on many fronts.\u00a0\n\n\nAnother thing- right wing activists and organizers are clever with their omission of details, with their wording and phrasing which makes it seem like it would be a noble cause. For lack of money, in 2000 I got a high paying temporaryjob getting people to sign petitions to get Pat Buchanan on the ballot. I hadn\u2019t known how anti-human he was until an anarchist told me and then I looked him up. (That is also point 3, right wing has money, left wing, especially anarchists and radicals, don\u2019t.) so I quit my job and was dirt poor and working some crumbum job.\u00a0\n\nLater on I lived in France and the right wing mobilized these massive (10,000+ people) demonstrations called \u201cMarriage for All\u201d which used pink signs and banners and t-shirts and crowded the streets with their people. Well, I had to cross the street to get some groceries, so I made my way through that 10,000+ crowd and I asked one of the persons what it meant. And he told me it was to make gay marriage illegal (it had been legal in France.) but when I had read the banners and the slogan and saw all the pink I had thought it was the opposite.\n\n\n3rd reason the right can mobilize and organize- they have money. Whether it is from shady think tank lobbies or corporations, they have money and use it, to promote and to advertise and as in my case, to employ with a good wage.",

Another commenter pointed out the irl organizing in spaces like churches which absolutely is also quite powerful. I think the combination of both online and in-person tactics both contributed to the current environment of a global shift in power dynamics. There were clearly a diversity of tactics the right employed, but they continued to push hard on what they found out worked. There is also a tenuous class colloraboration on the right that I think matters significantly to how well funded their efforts are.",

Lots of people feel like the system is rigged by the elites and the state against the common people. They are rejecting the established conventional systems that have continued to let them down and are desperate to get involved and make substantial changes at all, even just feeling like this will satisfy them. In the case of the United States, the Democrats have failed to offer this to the people on the level that Donald Trump superficially has. Right wing narratives are Dionysian rather than Apollonian, they make people feel active and engaged in a great cause, even if recklessly or superficially so; they are sick of it and they aren\u2019t going to take it anymore. This is why so many leftists like Hasan Piker: he has wide appeal on that level of \u201csilver-spiritedness\u201d to borrow from Plato.",
