But there have never been such tremendous gulfs between the wealthy and the poor.\n\n\"When we say anti-work, we don\u2019t mean an abstract political position disapproving of work; we mean a practice that actively abolishes the necessity to work, the way that anti-matter annihilates matter. In other words, an activity aimed at doing away with all the mechanisms that serve to concentrate power\u2014from debt to intellectual property rights and the prison-industrial complex. All the things that force us to keep putting our noses back to the grindstone when there are so many other things we\u2019d prefer to be doing.\"\n\n[https://crimethinc.com/antiwork](https://crimethinc.com/antiwork)",
