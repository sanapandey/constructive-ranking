    "selftext": "Some context, for the past 6ish years I've been doing what's called protective presence work in Palestine, basically hoping that my privilege (I'm white-skinned and Jewish and have Israeli citizenship) reduces the chance of colonial violence. When violence does still occur I document everything and insert myself between Palestinians and soldiers/settlers. \n\nI'm soon relocating to Boston and trying to find out how to best put my niche skillset and experience to good use. A friend suggested ICE watch or some other direct form of solidarity with undocumented people. I'd love to learn about groups that do this sort of work, and am more than open to other suggestions about other ways I can contribute. DMs are also welcome. Thanks in advance!",
