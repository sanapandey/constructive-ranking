In context, his recent tweet about Republicans fighting for the \"little guys\" seems to be talking about Trump appointing someone to the DOJ who supports smaller tech companies over big tech. \n\nThere's also a wide range of evidence that Proton donates money to liberal organizations and the CEO himself wrote an article being suspicious about how much personal information the Trump administration has through big tech companies.",

Lina Khan was literally the most aggressive FTC chair in the last 100 or so years, and the guy running the DOJ antitrust division under Biden wasn't exactly sitting there doing nothing either, he was prosecuting Google.",

There's 2 main threads on r/protonmail and he provides a deluded full-throated support for the GOP based on bizarre ideas that they are more for \"the little guy\" and more likely to support antitrust which is laughable at best. He went and deleted and altered his responses later but i spent one night digging into them since other user's screenshot the responses and the support was astonishingly partisan, delusional, and extremely defensive and antagonistic. the other weird thing was that he responded using hte official proton account, not some personal account. At one point both andy adn proton were responding to individual comments on reddit and bluesky- they were all very oddly defiant.",

Nuance is seriously dead. I'm as opposed to this absolute nightmare Republican administration as the next guy, but praising specific nominations and arguing anti-trust regulation might be more likely to come from a Republican administration shouldn't be seen as the full-throated endorsement of Trump that news networks reported it as, *even **if*** it turned out he was a Republican, because it's simply just not what he said! Lazy journalism and even lazier critical thinking.\n\n\nThank you for sharing this, I'm very glad it came to my attention.",

Many of us looking to switch out are doing so to avoid the day when trump starts railing and blackmailing and extorting proton for digital information of political opponents.
