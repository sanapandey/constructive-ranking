    "selftext": "I never want to make money for someone. I never want to be rushed in my process for the sake of profit. I enjoy meaningful labor, and i enjoy science, botany, horticulture, entomology, ecology, permaculture.\n\nI was working towards a degree in Horticulture before 2020, and now that I'm in the industry I see that horticulture is just training for industrialized farming practices. Are there any colleges that offer degrees in sustainable and truely valuable subjects? Should I just finish this degree course and then go find something more suited to my interests?\n\nIf your advice is skip the college bit, please offer a job idea or a concept to replace it because I'm good at school, and need more documented experience in something besides landscaping/greenhouse management to get a job doing something meaningful. \n\nThank you <3",

Your green thumb will be greatly needed in the coming years!",
