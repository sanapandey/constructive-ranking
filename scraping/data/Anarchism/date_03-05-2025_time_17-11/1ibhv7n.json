            "body": "interesting, They are great ! It seems that they are talking about the need for sub or counter culture. People say that most of this died in the 90\\`s... time to bring it back. Im from the uk and have been an active diy creator of sub culture in the form of punk and rave. Maybe im getting old (no maybe about it lol) but the last wave of subculture was techno in the late 80s. I'm personally going to knock my head together with some old heads and do some squat parties with a table for propaganda as these events overcame alienation and fostered a DIY mentality that i know has inspired many activists.",
