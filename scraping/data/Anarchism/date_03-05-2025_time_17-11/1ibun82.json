I mean most of this was like actually the silliest mistakes possible and so embarrassing I\u2019m not sure most people would\u2019ve made these level of errors haha. If you\u2019re gonna talk about anything regarding this, I would focus on the SFL campus president that I\u2019m gonna mention. Because she is genuinely dangerous. And in the Florida case they had their own version of that where some awful local powerful btch had ties to the fake clinic and had a lot of influence in their case or at least claimed to on social media.\n\nCopy paste starts now:\n\nThat is so embarrassing to talk about lol but I guess I will. Basically, I was too comfortable with getting caught and made myself too much of a target while already also being a major target. So, god this is embarrassing but the local news channel wanted to do a story on it and wildly they actually emailed me for an interview (like not knowing) because I was the president of an on campus student organization dedicated to fighting for students\u2019 rights including reproductive rights. So I said yes and then me and the reporter were talking with the camera and mic off and I actually admitted to her. Already massively big mistake but surprisingly she was absolutely not the person who told on me. Because that night they played the news segment and they had cut out my and another person\u2019s entire interview and basically didn\u2019t share our message in any capacity like they could\u2019ve done so without showing our interview if they wanted and instead only kept an interview from someone staunchly opposed. So then, mistake number 3000 or something, I made a video on our student organization insta saying I was disappointed in the news coverage. And from there the president of the students for life organization on my campus saw the video and decided to report me to the FBI (and would later go on to say she \u201chelped with the investigation\u201d). To be clear though, she had 0 evidence and she had already routinely been trying to get me in trouble with the school and was already writing slanderous articles about me on the students for life national website. So like she already knew who I was and wanted to see me go down. And then the final big mistake I made was not throwing away the bottles of spray paint because I\u2019m unintelligent af. Again though, I did all that not really because I\u2019m too unintelligent to not be more cautious, but because I was again comfortable with being caught because I was na\u00efve and thought I was only going to get charged with vandalism. And that had been a sacrifice I was willing to make from the beginning. If I knew a FACE Act charge was on the table, I either wouldn\u2019t have done it or I would\u2019ve taken soooooo many more precautions beyond the ones I took which was like only black blocing (mask included) and changing outfits before returning to my dorm.",

So it's not a clear message is it, we're actually in agreement? - the best way to mock the people using \"God\" as an argument is to demonstrate that they've never read the Bible. Jesus called women Daughters of Abraham because he considered them his equals. That would've been cool to write, instead of \"haha\" abort God\" like an edgy teenager - I find it juvenile. Jesus was an ally to the oppressed, as was the Buddha, as was Krishna, as was Muhammad - religion doesn't oppress women, the patriarchy poisons religion to do that.",
