As long as white people continue to benefit from that privilege, they won't be eager to fully give it up. The best way to destroy the narrow & oppressive definition of whitness that benefits people of European descent is by creating a counter identity that can challenge its assumptions ( also by making sure that the new identity doesn't take the same place as whiteness did )\n\n\nI don't think whitness and its privilege will go on forever. People make the faulty assumption that what is here now will go on forever. It will take time but whitness can and will be dismantled\u00a0",

In fact, it's anti-genocide. Whiteness is a contrived identity used to control and conquer people. It has no basis other than supremacy. The black identity originated from dark skinned Africans being enslaved. They didn't call themselves Black before that. Because of enslavement, y'all lost a lot of cultural knowledge and heritage. This is why the Black identity is legitimate and whiteness is not. White people are more likely to be able trace back their ancestry.",

Black as a social categorization was invented by Europeans to justify slavery. The social categorization is still around to this day and black people use this categorization as well. Ethiopia, because it was never colonized didn't have this categorization imposed on us. For me as an Ethiopian, the social categorization of \"black\" doesn't make sense because everyone around me is black and thats the way it has always is. I am black ( light brown precisely ) and I am proud of it but for me blackness is a type of skin color, not a social group\u00a0\n\n\n2. Ethiopians catagorize ourselves mainly on ethnic & religious grounds. Those two are the main social categorizations and since everyone is black, \"blackness\" has no meaning.",

            "body": "For me, historian Barbara Fields poured cold water over the entire field of \"whiteness studies\" with her 2001 essay \"Whiteness, Racism, and Identity.\" Basically, focusing on \"whiteness\" is missing the target. What we should be doing is understanding the history of the concept of \"race\" to begin with, and why it was invented in the first place. Hint: in its initial formulation in the United States, there was only one \"race,\" and that race was black-\n\n>Whether as rough-and-ready ideology or as legal definition, racism in America has served, not to classify or categorize people, but to specify who is black and who is not. It is considered chic in some quarters to elide that fact, with the concept *racialize* disguising the elision. *Multi-racial* and its euphemistic synonym, *multicultural*, occupy a place of honor, on the supposition, presumably, that a blight becomes a blessing if widely enough diffused. Whatever their defects as historical analysis, they have become obligatory public gestures. Among breaches of propriety, defining race in \u201cbipolar\u201d terms ranks well ahead of wearing animal fur. Nevertheless, bipolarity and asymmetry are the essential historical constituents of American racial ideology and of the actions that the ideology distills.\n\n>Inseparable from the bipolarity and asymmetry of American racial ideology is the \u201cunmarked, unnamed status,\u201d \u201cseeming normativity,\u201d \u201cstructured invisibility,\u201d and \u201cfalse universality\u201d of those who are designated \u201cnot black.\u201d That is the datum the whiteness literature seeks to extinguish or overrule. Rather than explore what the absence of a mark or name means, whiteness scholarship mulishly insists upon inserting the mark and name, officiously making good the failure of people in the past to do it themselves, as Professor Arnesen properly complains. The point, it seems, is not to interpret the past but to change it. By its insistence upon marking and naming and making visible, whiteness scholarship first strews race and races everywhere and then, *mirabile dictu*, discovers them everywhere.\n\n>Race then becomes so ubiquitous as to lose determinate shape\n\nYou can find the essay for free online. Also highly recommend her and her sister's book *Racecraft*. Absolutely changed my perspective on the history of race and racism, and how we should actually go about destroying both of those concepts",

(Personally I just say other, or \"descendant of European colonizers\" or 2 or more, depending on what they ask, what's listed, and what it's for)) and the Black identity being a legitimate expression of culture, while the white identity is not, it's on so called white people to abolish and do away with whiteness.

Her conclusions are interesting and she is a much better writer than I am, so I'll let you discover her arguments for yourself.\n\nAn easier entry point into the work of Fields sisters might be this [podcast episode](https://thedigradio.com/podcast/revisiting-racecraft-with-barbara-and-karen-fields/) where they speak in more plain language, and not so academic. But I still do recommend reading their book Racecraft to everyone interested in this topic",
