Especially as someone that has a wealth of hidden disabilities that make it hard, either emotionally or physically, to actually act out / protest in the way I used to when I was in my twenties. \n\nI have to constantly remind myself of this:\n\nSometimes just making sure your mental health remains, you know, healthy, is a revolutionary act, especially if you suffer form depression, panic attacks, anxiety, etc.That may mean ignoring the news for a long while. That may mean not being able to protest like I was able to. That may mean finding little ways, between just my friends and family and I, of how to help each other through all this mess. \n\nI talked about this in therapy today. How I'm still filled with rage, and I'm not even close to giving up, but I just need to withdraw for a while, maybe for a long while, for the ability to fight better in the future if need be.",

Going all out, all the time, is exhaustive, and counter-productive. Letting the dust settle, even a little bit, gives you time to fortify your position, gather strength, so you can be available and fully present for when things get very serious. That's not to say things aren't very bad atm. They are. But we are at the start of a marathon. Maybe a very long one. It's ok to take stock, and formulate a long-term plan.",
