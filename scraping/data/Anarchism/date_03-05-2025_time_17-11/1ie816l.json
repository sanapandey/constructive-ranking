    "selftext": "For starters, I don't consider myself a leftist, I consider myself a revolutionary/radical. The topic of censorship, expands beyond my criticism of the left, because censirship can happen with individual people, groups,anfd just overall it can be a societal problem. \n\nI'm no stranger to censorship, and critizing online spaces. The reason why censorship is problematic is because it doesn't allow for open discussion conversation and valid criticism of particular rhetoric/ideologies, people/groups/societies can be so sensitive as not to allow such criticism of their beliefs and ideologies. I've encounterred censorship many times simply for giving honest opinions, or critique of certain views, and reddit as a platform is well known for its censorship habits, it can be irritating. \n\nCensorship for me is unappealing because it sends the message that people/groups/societieds are closed-minded, and  lack critical thinking. Censorship severely limits growth and critical thinking, and expansion on philosopical thinking. \n\nAnyways, I feel as though the left is pretty authoritarian, it's filled with authoritarian leftist that believe that \"State Socialism\" and \"State Communism\" is possible, when In the past revolutions with Russia and the soviet union/USSR, and China with the CCP have failed, because these system reproduced State Capitalism. Simply by referring to these countries as Socialist or Communist isn't accurate to what Socialistm and Communism is defined as. \n\nSocialism is classified as workers having free association and ownership over the means of production and the abolition of the Capitalist class and their monopolization of the means of production and workers control.\n\nCommunism is defined as a Moneyless, Stateless and Classless society, none of which the USSR and the CCP have achieved, therefore they aren't Socialist or Communist, for many authoritarian leftist they have a visceral reaction to this criticism, which led to me being banned from the Sociallist reddit forum. Which is precisely why I criticize the left, and don't consider myself a leftist because of their authoritarian views with Statism, Socialism and Communism.\n\n\nWe can never move forward and make progress if we can't have opened minded discussion or people not being to sensitive with their ideology/rhetoric. Censorship prevents this, and it precisely how it's supposed to function by suppressing free speech and having certain biases to the more conformist or favorable ideologies/rhetoric. \n\nI believe it's an oxymoron, to say that a country can be Socialist or Communist, and operate in a Socialist and Communist ways. Countries serve the purpose of Nationalism, Statism, Imperialism, and Colonialism.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I made this post to critque the Authoritarian left and biased censorship, so if you're not an Authoritarian leftist this post isn't for you, and if you're not a biased moderator that censores people because they have different political opinions then these criticism are definitely not for you.\n\nI made this post based on my observations of Leftist spaces, not every reddit is the same, however im particular to Revolutionary/Radical spaces, when it comes to expressong opinions, I believe it's okay to disagree without censorship, (that's what downvotes are for).\n\nThis post may seem controversial to some and maybe taboo and that's completely fine. But I'm mostly critiqing the Authoritarian left and biased moderators of Revolutionary/Radical subreddits. \n\n ",

We know what a lack of forum moderation looks like; personally I don't want anarchists spaces to have the same discussion culture as 4chan does.\n \nIn regards to the rest, anarchists would largely agree that the dominant socialisms are unfortunately all too authoritarian and \"statist\", you're not telling us anything new here. Some of us go as far as rejecting the association with \"the left\", but usually in part of a rejection of the left-right political spectrum more generally (and with some emphasis that we're not \"right wing\" either).",

But overall I was addressing how censorship and biases within moderator spaces can deeply hinder philosophical discussion and debate. It's fine to disagree with others but censorship completely closes off any willingness for ideological challenges. \n\nThe criticism of censorship and the Authoritarian left shouldn't offend anyone personally, it's just an observation and a critique of flaws of censorship and ideological biases.\n\nAnd I have faced censorship in Anarchist spaces as well for my criticism of censorship and the Authoritarian left which is why it's weird and I made the post in the first place. So overall I gave my valid criticism. \n\nIt's easy to make light of the situation but it can be problematic, and discourage other people from expressing opinions and debate topics. It's pretty foolish to make light of censorship. Furthermore if we want to grow in revolutionary and radical spaces we need to be able to disagree with one another without being so sensitive as to use censorship as a tool to suppress another speech. \n\nIt's just a major turn off for me when, in revolutionary and radical spaces, censorship occurs so rapidly it prevents actual discussion.\n\nAnd yes, I do take an interest in Buddhism, lol. But that's irrelevant to the topic of censorship and critiquing the Authoritarian left.",

Not to whine but to give my criticism about the Authoritarian left and Censorship in general. And it was extra annoying when I encountered censorship in Anarchist spaces because I was giving my criticism of the Authoritarian left. \n\nIt's not about the ban, It's about the abuse of censorship and how it prevents political opposition in debate and discussion.",
