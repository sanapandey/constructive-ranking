DOGE is an organization operating with almost no oversight, filled with grossly unqualified staff, including in the field of security, as evident by several security incidents already happening involving dodg, all the while accessing personal information of not just US employees but also millions of US citizens.\n\nI also like free speech. That's why I don't like a businessman who's trying to get in the business of providing security and military services to governments and has deep financial ties with governments that don't respect privacy, including governments such as the people's Republic of China, have near unlimited access to US databases without oversight.\n\nElon Musk is the sort of narcissistic bitch, who decided to leak DMs with a YouTuber who called him out over Elon lying about being a \"pro-gamer.\" This was a serious violation of privacy, and a violation of Twitter's ToS done to punish a critic. And something tells me that narcissistic bitch is going to be a lot more dangerous when he has extensive access to the data collected by the US government on Americans and non-American, when one of those people decide to criticise him over something more serious than a video game drama and Elon Musk inevitably decide to retaliate and punish speech that he doesn't like.",

This is the same as folks automatically claiming that the swamp auditing the swamp is sus. What they really want is transparency which they mistakenly assume is a bunch of random tweets that are stupid.\n\n\nBtw 185 year old collecting SS is cuz the idiots he hired can't convert dates.
