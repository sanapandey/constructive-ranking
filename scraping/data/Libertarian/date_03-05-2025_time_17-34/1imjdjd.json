Is it the same as it was 10, 20 years ago? Have your views evolved?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives, especially from those who\u2019ve been involved in libertarian movements or have seen changes in how the philosophy is applied.\n\nHonest question, and asking outside, of the current political climate. Hopefully it would be ok asking questions more involved with the climate further in discussion but that's not the agenda of the question.\n\nIf it matters, I'm from Massachusetts, and I am rather center of the current red and blue system. I do support social democratic policies specifically in Massachusetts because I see how they effect my family, myself and my friends who are ultimately the most important thing to me.",

It should not be a sin to have some conservative views, or some liberal views or some libertarian views (on various issues: immigration, abortion, taxes, foreign policy etc)\n\nI\u2019ll add that if a government policy is moved toward a more libertarian policy that can be celebrated.\n\nFor example: a libertarian may argue for 0% income tax. But it\u2019s ok to celebrate income taxes going from 39.8% down to 37% or whatever.\n\nAnyway - that\u2019s my two cents!",

The Right in the US does not inherently support, for example, gun rights. \n\n>Not really as libertarianism is incompatible with command economies, it's antithetical to freedom.\n\nYou forgot to include the first half of the quote where I explained my reasoning. You can't just ignore my reasoning and not provide a rebuttal, that's called conceding an argument. Please read my *entire* argument and rebut my reasoning? \"The political compass has 2 dimensions for a reason. left/right (left/right) is independent from auth/lib (up/down), you can place a dot anywhere on the compass, top left\u00a0*or*\u00a0top right, and this contradicts\u00a0*your*\u00a0original claim that libertarianism is tied to any one side.\"\n\nAs to your obsession with command economies, you have failed to prove thus far that command economies have any tie to either the left or right, and as a matter of fact you contradicted yourself on this by bringing up the political compass. According to the political compass, it is, indeed, antithetical to libertarianism, but just as with libertarianism, you can place a dot anywhere on the political compass on the bottom (authoritarian) half and it can be on either side- left or right. The whole point of the political compass is that there are 2 dimensions that are independent from each other - left/right and auth/lib. You would know this if you addressed me saying this exact same thing in my previous reply. \n\n>The modern definition of left and right being economic ideas. Leaving it to the old definition is entirely too vague, essentially if you aren't a monarchist you're on the left.\n\nI'm down to use this definition instead of the original definition, and I assume you are referring to it in the sense of the political compass being economic on the x-axis and freedom along the y-axis. Both of your points, that libertarianism is tied to the left or right, and that a command economy is an inherent practice of the left or right, are disproven by the fact that the political compass denotes economy and freedom as independent factors from each other. \n\n>It's not, as it's far more subjective than the political compass model. Again, the original definition is regarding monarchy vs republicanism.\u00a0 Anyone opposed to a monarchy is on the left. That's a wide range of opposing political ideologies.\n\nAlright, let's use the political compass definition from now on. Please read my reasoning through and either rebut them or concede this time. \n\nBy the way, thanks for the civilized discussion. It's a breath of fresh air to not have an argument degrade to personal attacks on a platform such as this.",

Your disparaging of libertarian philosophy as nothing of worth is evidence that your claims have been made in bad faith, and that you refuse to accept any outside information than that which is already so deeply ingrained in your mind. \n\n>You've yet to defend this claim under either definition of the left/right terms.\n\nI have already defended this claim by pointing out that the political compass is 2-dimensional in nature, where the two axes are independent from each other. You proceeded to try to refute that by claiming the \"libertarian\" in the political compass is somehow irrelevant to my original claim, despite you being the one calling upon it to back your rebuttals, further proving your refusal to argue in good faith. \n\n>You are continuing to demonstrate that you aren't grasping what I'm saying. The term libertarian as used in the political compass has nothing to do with libertarian philosophy or \"actual libertarians in the real world\"\n\nYou were the one who originally called upon the political compass model to attempt to disprove my claims. You are failing to grasp what you yourself are saying, and refuse to decide whether the political compass is of any meaning to this discussion, or if the libertarian term in the political compass has no relation to do with libertarian philosophy, which is ridiculous. You can't just throw away the entire field of study that explores the meaning of libertarianism just so that you can assert your own meaning in bad faith. \n\nDespite my best efforts to use sound logic and attempt to find a common premise between ourselves to build off of, you have time and time again moved the goalposts, from refusing to acknowledge the value of the original definition of libertarianism to claiming that your made-up definition of libertarianism somehow has more value than the entire field of libertarian philosophy, manned by countless experts with several magnitudes of more experience than either of us. \n\nI have attempted to steer this discussion back on track, only for you to make arguments in bad faith and clench onto the idea that your completely arbitrary and abstract definition of libertarianism is of any more relevance to the discussion than libertarian philosophy, which explores the actual, real life characteristics of libertarianism in action. I will no longer be the hind end of a bad-faith argument. Have a good day, and consider enrolling in a logic class next semester.",

Pure capitalism would be a great way to live, but that doesn\u2019t exist in reality either.  The same goes for libertarian.  Any of these forms of government in their purest form would be great.  But humanity has to fuck them all up.  Greed, jealousy the pursuit of women.  All reasons why any government breaks.\n\nThe real question, similar to op, which government can best exist slightly modified to get the most out of humanity while minimizing our weaknesses?\n\nI think you need a blend of capitalism, libertarianism and some socialism to best govern a society.  You need a government with individual liberty and freedom where the vast majority of what you work for is yours and protected by government.  You also need a society with enough social support to keep the most despondent from becoming desperate.  Plus it\u2019s just the right moral thing to do.\n\nI believe most of those core values live in libertarian views within a mostly capitalistic state.",

Two things that don't help are some of these leaders trying to pretend to be libertarians (like when Trump claimed he was a libertarian, there's also some people in this sub who are actually just conservative) and Milei, a libertarian leader, positioning himself more closely with this group.\n\nIt is true that libertarianism, if it really had to be placed in one of these current political blocks (current left and right wing) would arguably be better placed in the right, but it doesn't have to and it is really its own thing.",
