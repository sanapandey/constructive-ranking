You could cut everyone and we'd still be running enormous deficits.\n\n\nSpeaking of which, Senate GOP just passed a budget that would increase the deficit by $2.8 trillion, based on the presumption they can cut $2 trillion in spending (unlikely). Without the spending cuts it'd be nearly 5 trillion.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is all just political theater.\u00a0",

National debt tripled under Reagan. Clinton brought us a budget surplus (granted, Gingrich forced his hand). Bush blew massive deficits in a warm economy and Obama steadily decreased deficits in a sluggish economy, only for Trump to add trillions more in debt. I'll grant you Biden was no better. But there's nothing worse for the federal budget than GOP control of Congress + POTUS.\u00a0",
