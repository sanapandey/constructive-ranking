                    "body": "Clinton's surpluses are misleading because he counted Social Security revenues as extra money for the government. This makes no sense because they are a legally binding obligation that must be paid to future beneficiaries; they are not \"extra money\" that the government can claim offsets deficits.\n\nHere's a quick summary of the accounting trick:\n\n1. Social Security collects money through payroll taxes and holds onto a pile of money\n2. Any investment returns on this pile of money must be paid to future beneficiaries\n3. The government takes out Treasury bonds on these investment returns\n4. The Treasury bonds are an obligation from one part of the government (Treasury) to pay back another part of the government (Social Security Administration), this inter-governmental debt is not counted as part of the national debt\n5. The Treasury Department counts the proceeds of these bonds as revenue\n\nThe scam happens in Line 3. The Treasury is pretending the money belongs to the Social Security Administration, saying that the government borrowing from itself does not increase the debt. But that's not true, it's an obligation to future beneficiaries. So they are borrowing from the public, and increasing the debt, while pretending that they are borrowing from the government and trying to say the debt did not increase.\n\nA couple things I should mention to be fair to Clinton:\n\n1. This is not unique to Clinton, all presidents do this. (So if you think the deficits that are being reported are bad, they're actually worse!)\n2. If we take this into account, Clinton did not have a surplus in 1998 or 1999. However we did have a true surplus in 2000 and 2001, even if we re-subtract any borrowed Social Security surpluses. Clinton can take credit for the one in 2000. Since Clinton and Bush were both president in 2001, I'll leave it up to the reader to decide who should get credit for that year.",
