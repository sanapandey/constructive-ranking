They don't just read the news like, \"hmm that executive order sounds illegal\" and go issue a block. So one judge wouldn't be blocking everything unless attorneys are filing lawsuits for everything and it gets assigned to that judge over and over. The higher up the ladder your lawsuit goes, the less options there are for judges, until eventually you reach the supreme court. \n\nMaybe I am wrong? Either way, the president can always appeal the ruling or motion to have a new judge review these things. If the entire judicial branch is just all in on capriciously blocking the president, all the way up to the supreme court, then it would fall on Congress to draft and pass a law that unambiguously authorizes the president's actions OR passing a constitutional amendment via one of the afforded avenues, depending on the reasoning being used to block the president (and assuming everyone agrees that the judicial branch is being bad).",

The Executive and Legislative branches are elected within a Constitutional Republic through a democratic process (with the caveat that the legislative does not have term limits where the executive does).  This is the crux of my statement that if an elected EXECUTIVE administration seems too \"authoritarian\" or too \"powerful\" like the TRUMP Administration - then vote someone else in.   Pretty simple.  If you don't like how the current executive administration is handling their policy enforcement, well, perhaps you can help vote for an alternative direction for the next round of campaigns.",

I think there is a big oversight here - everything else stopping the executive from just becoming autocratic being dissolved at the same time. But many people, and often the same people, have been around forever and are just desperate for a \u201cwin\u201d and forgot republicans were not on their \u201cteam\u201d - the risk you take when you give in and treat politics like a team sport. Hopefully they will be right and the cuts are used to fix the debt and not enrich the oligarchs but I think that's optimistic at best. I\u2019m seeing a deficit ceiling that was just raised by a fucking trillion. And when you hear libertarians celebrating them talking about removing income tax remind them that they are also talking about hiking taxes on all goods and services by 30%. \n\nAlso many from the alt right who find small government subs and think they're just republican-extra-crispy.",
