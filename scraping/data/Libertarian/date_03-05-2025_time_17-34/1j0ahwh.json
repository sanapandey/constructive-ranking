American and European leaders, eager to consolidate their influence over Eastern Europe, repeatedly dismissed Moscow\u2019s security concerns, expanding NATO\u2019s reach closer and closer to Russia\u2019s borders.\n\nWhy is so called \"Libertarian\" media peddling tankie lies? Even Gorbachev himself said that such promise had never happened. This is just \"West bad Russia victim\" coupled with the sheer arrogance that the Eastern European countries were just mindless puppets to be \"influenced\" and manipulated into joining NATO, not because they were victims of Russian imperialism. \n\nIf you want to read up against foreign influence, look up how Putin forced Yanukovych to against the population and against the parliament to withdraw from an association agreement with the EU, something that had nothing to do with NATO. And then, not even weeks after Yanukovych had fled the country, Russian soldiers invaded Ukraine. Now talk about foreign influence!\n\nWhy is a libertarian outlet spreading tankie and Russian state propaganda?",
