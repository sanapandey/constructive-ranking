It's basically a Utopian text. \n\nCommunism and Ayn Randian forms of libertarianism are very similar in that they describe a utopian place you could end up, without literally any description on *how* you end up there, or what governance structures are in place while you're there.\n\nChina is probably the only modern state that has actually tried to fill in the blanks on how you *get* there, to the \"end goal\" of communism. But all they've really done is re-invent a mixed-economy with free market principles and specific regulatory responsibilities of a government.\n\nMost \"communist\" governments are simply autocrats wrapped in a flag they believe the common peon will find appealing. \n\n\"Hey, let US have the government, and we'll give all the shit BACK to you!\" \n\nThis is the same exact thing happening with the Trump administration right now, except they just don't use the word \"communism.\" \n\n\"Hey everyone, give TRUMP the government, he'll cut all the government spending, and then you'll get it back!\"\n\nExcept, once all the agencies are dismantlled, they're not going to give it back. It's going to be diced up and divvied out to the oligarchs who are now running the government, which is the same thing that happened with Soviet Russia collapsed.\n\nThis is what I wish libertarians understood about the existing crisis. I see so many cheering on the destruction of the administration state. They don't seem to understand that what replaces that **will not be liberty**. It is just straight-up authoritarianism. \n\nEverything you hate about states like Venezuela - that's what you're going to end up with here.",

It was Hjalmar Schacht (economist, and non-Nazi who tried to advocate free market principles to the Nazis) who was keen on privatization and free-markets, but the Nazis only went along with as a way to help finance their military buildup. Schacht resigned after a few years in office when he realized the Nazis had no interest in free-markets and instead were all about government control over the economy. In reality while the Nazis \"privatized\" some nationalized property, they also increased government control over private industry to the point that they were private in name only. \n\n>You can have gestapo and also be selling everything off to your industrialist backers at the same time.\n\nNazis did not have industrial backers, they had subjugated industrialists who followed them because not doing so meant they get their property nationalized or their company shunned and discriminated against.

Neither the Nazis or the Italians operated socialist economies and weren't particularly collectivist since they oriented themselves in opposition to the socialist/marxist/whathaveyou movements of the time, even when the depression hit, I'm pretty sure Italy shifted more toward corporatism and crony capitalism than any sort of socialist policy.\n\n> reprivatisierung\n\nYou literally went to the wikipedia article, linked to the NYT article referenced for \"privatizing,\" and then make a claim about reprivatizaton that runs counter to the following paragraph.\n\n\n>The term privatizing first appeared in English, with quotation marks, in the New York Times, in April 1923, in a translation of a German speech referring to the potential for German state railroads to be bought by American companies.[5] In German, the word Privatisierung has been used since at least the 19th century.[6] Ultimately, the word came to German through French from the Latin privatus.\n\n>The term reprivatization, again translated directly from German (Reprivatisierung), was used frequently in the mid-1930s as The Economist reported on Nazi Germany's sale of nationalized banks back to public shareholders following the 1931 economic crisis.\n\nC'mon, dude.\n\n\n>Nazis did not have industrial backers, they had subjugated industrialists who followed them because not doing so meant they get their property nationalized or their company shunned and discriminated against. Before 1932 the Nazis were the biggest grassroots funded party (even above the communists, who were funded largely by the USSR), and had very few industrial or capitalist backers. After taking control Hitler made it clear to them what would happen if they oppose him, and most fell in line. \n\nThis is just you making shit up again.\n\nBy the 1930s the NSDAP had significant backing of the industrial elite: Thyssen and Krupp, Emil Kirdorf, IG-Farben, Albert Vogler, etc.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freundeskreis_der_Wirtschaft\n\nYou had a group of industrialists and other financial elite, including prominent figures like Hjalmar Schacht, writing letters to the president telling him to appoint Hitler as Chancellor.\n\nThis shit is even more explicit in Italy where Mussolini venerated the ancien regime.",

I will spare words as it is totally superfluous. In fact, it is harmful, because it makes us confuse the types of genuine revolutionaries of whatever hue, with the man of reaction who sometimes uses our very language.\n\n--\n\n\n>From the Doctrine of Fascism, which you should maybe read:\n\nHere's what the author of \"Doctrine of Fascism\" and one of the earliest fascist thinkers said:\n\n>It is necessary to distinguish between socialism and socialism\u2014in fact, between idea and idea of the same socialist conception, in order to distinguish among them those that are inimical to Fascism. It is well known that Sorellian syndicalism, out of which the thought and the political method of Fascism emerged\u2014conceived itself the genuine interpretation of Marxist communism. The dynamic conception of history, in which force as violence functions as an essential, is of unquestioned Marxist origin. Those notions flowed into other currents of contemporary thought, that have themselves, via alternative routes, arrived at a vindication of the form of State\u2014implacable, but absolutely rational\u2014that finds historic necessity in the very spiritual dynamism through which it realizes itself.\n\n--\n\n>For yucks, here's mussolini laying out his totally socialist economic policy to business leaders in Rome:\n\nAnd here's Mussolini laying out his free market liberalism:\n\n>\"Fascism is definitely and absolutely opposed to the doctrines of liberalism, both in the political and economic sphere.\"\n\n--\n\n>The finance minister privatized everything the state controlled and drastically lowered or repealed taxes.\n\nHe was minister for just a couple of years before Mussolini and his fascist party even properly took over as dictator. Mussolini moved pretty quickly away from any kind of free-market policies and towards state controlled corporatism. \n\n>Neither the Nazis or the Italians operated socialist economies\n\nThey had state-controlled economies, whether you call that socialist or not is irrelevant. \n\n>weren't particularly collectivist since they oriented themselves in opposition to the socialist/marxist/whathaveyou movements of the time,\n\nThis is wrong. Their opposition to Marxist socialism had nothing to do with opposition towards collectivism, they simply disagreed on how to achieve said collectivism, fascists were syndicalists/corporatists, and Nazis favoured \"synchronization\" (government control) of the industries for the betterment of the state/people, without complete abolition of private property. Their biggest disagreements with Marxist socialists was nationalism vs internationalism, as well as class collectivism vs national/racial collectivism. \n\nLudwig Von Mises:\n\n>The German pattern of socialism (Zwangswirtschaft) [\u201ccompulsory economy\u201d] is characterized by the fact that it maintains, although only nominally, some institutions of capitalism. Labor is, of course, no longer a \u201ccommodity\u201d; the labor market has been solemnly abolished; the government fixes wage rates and assigns every worker the place where he must work. Private ownership has been nominally untouched. In fact, however, the former entrepreneurs have been reduced to the status of shop managers (Betriebsfuehrer). The government tells them what and how to produce, at what prices and from whom to buy, at what prices and from whom to sell. Business may remonstrate against inconvenient injunctions, but the final decision rests with the authorities.\n\n--\n\n>The term reprivatization, again translated directly from German (Reprivatisierung), was used frequently in the mid-1930s as The Economist reported on Nazi Germany's sale of nationalized banks back to public shareholders following the 1931 economic crisis.\n\nFunny you quote that when in reality the sale of the nationalized banks just highlights how misleading this description was. They had sold nationalized banks while at the same time gave the government controlled central bank (Reichsbank) significantly more power over the banks. Resulting in nominally private, but increasingly government controlled banks. \n\nAdam Tooze:\n\n>For the first time, the Reichsbank was given the power to define basic reserve requirements and to fully regulate the deployment of private banking assets. The Great Banks of Berlin were thus saved from nationalization. The evidence suggests, however, that they never really recovered from the damage done to them by the financial crisis of 1931. In purely commercial terms the Berlin Great Banks were amongst the chief \u2018losers\u2019 of the Nazi economic recovery.\n\n--\n\n>This is just you making shit up again\n\nHere's what historian Stanley G. Payne says about this: \n\n>Hitler worked during 1931\u201332 to establish ties with influential sectors of society, cooperating part of the time with the right and trying to reassure businessmen that they had no reason to be apprehensive of Nazi \u201csocialism.\u201d Yet despite massive leftist propaganda that Hitler was the paid agent of capitalism, Hitler garnered only limited financial support from big business. While there was considerable support for Hitler among small industrialists, most sectors of big business consistently advised against permitting him to form a government. The Nazi Party was primarily financed by its own members\n\nAnd Richard Evans: \n\n>The Nazi Party depended on such commitment; much of its power and dynamism came from the fact that it was not dependent on big business or bureaucratic institutions such as trade unions for its financial support, as the \u2018bourgeois\u2019 parties and the Social Democrats to varying degrees were, still less on the secret subsidies of a foreign power, along the lines of the Moscow-financed Communists\n\nHenry Turner:\n\n>The notion that Germany\u2019s capitalists contributed significantly to Hitler\u2019s rise has become something of a truism\n\n>(Full quote continued in comment below due to character limit)\n\nRichard Overy:\n\n>Even heavy industry, that had favored some degree of autarky and state aid in the early 1930s, found that the extent of state control exercised after 1936, and the rise of a state-owned industrial sector, threatened their interests too. The strains that such a relationship produced have already been demonstrated for the car industry, the aircraft industry and the iron and steel industry; but much more research is needed to arrive at a satisfactory historical judgement of the relationship between Nazism and German business. What is already clear is that the Third Reich was not simply a businessman's regime underpinning an authoritarian capitalism but, on the contrary, that it set about reducing the autonomy of the economic \u00e9lite and subordinating it to the interests of the Nazi state\u2026\n\n\n--\n\n>. By the 1930s the NSDAP had significant backing of the industrial elite: Thyssen and Krupp, Emil Kirdorf, IG-Farben, Albert Vogler, etc.\n\nOther than Thyssen, those only \"backed\" the NSDAP after they took power, and again, not doing so would have meant punishment. \n\nThyssen, ironically, ended up having his company nationalised and was sent to a concentration camp. So much for the \"selling everything off to your industrialist backers\"..\n\n> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freundeskreis_der_Wirtschaft\n\n>You had a group of industrialists, including prominent figures like Hjalmar Schacht, writing letters to the president telling him to appoint Hitler as Chancellor.\n\n> formed the Circle after Hitler's request in ***1932*** for the formation of a \"study group on economic questions\".\n\n>the size of the group never exceeded 40\n\n>Historians have argued that the membership of the group was not particularly influential, with few members from large industry.[4]: 513  Motivations for group members may have included strong anti-labor and anti-socialist positions, rather than pro-Hitler positions as such\n\nSo yeah, a small and mostly irrelevant group that was formed in 1932 (I specifically said before 1932, although even in 1932 it was rather limited) who mostly just wanted Hitler because he was anti-communists and the communists were perceived as a bigger threat to them than the Nazis were. \n\n> This shit is even more explicit in Italy where Mussolini venerated the ancien regime.\n\nHow does venerating the ancien regime mean Mussolini is against government control, exactly?",

I don't even know how to respond to this. One of the companies/individuals I listed controlled one of the largest, maybe the largest, company in Europe.\n\nHow to respond to this? Read your own source. It was a tiny group of less than 40 people, not even all businessmen. It was basically irrelevant, and it doesn\u2019t change that big business support for the Nazis pre-1932 was almost nonexistent (Thyssen being pretty much the only one).\n\nWhich individual controlled the largest company? The manager who worked at I.G. Farben? You do realise he was just a plant manager? He did not own or control the company, you know that right?\u00a0",

This is outside the purview of authoritarianism, which relates to how much authority the government can exert on its own citizens/people to restrict their freedoms. Even fighting revolting peasants is hardly authoritarian, every modern government regardless of how authoritarian it is would fight a violent insurrection if people started one, do you for example consider the shooting of Ashli Babbitt as authoritarianism? \n\nThe medieval monarchies were authoritarian, but nothing compared to modern totalitarian states. But discussing how authoritarian medieval monarchies are is a red herring, one that is based on some hypothetical imagined scenario you have of Nazi Germany where the government only \"had guns... to control the proles as it materially decreased their quality of life for the benefit of the elite\", when in reality they had the government/party embedded literally everywhere controlling proles and elite alike to do their will.\n\n> I literally quoted peer reviewed journals describing the vast privatization the Nazis undertook and you quote Wages of Destruction having never read it.\n\nThe government selling some state-owned stocks while at the same time greatly increasing government size, control, and power, does not mean the government shrunk.

Payne says about this: \n\n>Hitler worked during 1931\u201332 to establish ties with influential sectors of society, cooperating part of the time with the right and trying to reassure businessmen that they had no reason to be apprehensive of Nazi \u201csocialism.\u201d Yet despite massive leftist propaganda that Hitler was the paid agent of capitalism, Hitler garnered only limited financial support from big business. While there was considerable support for Hitler among small industrialists, most sectors of big business consistently advised against permitting him to form a government. The Nazi Party was primarily financed by its own members\n\nAnd Richard Evans: \n\n>The Nazi Party depended on such commitment; much of its power and dynamism came from the fact that it was not dependent on big business or bureaucratic institutions such as trade unions for its financial support, as the \u2018bourgeois\u2019 parties and the Social Democrats to varying degrees were, still less on the secret subsidies of a foreign power, along the lines of the Moscow-financed Communists\n\nHenry Turner:\n\n>The notion that Germany\u2019s capitalists contributed significantly to Hitler\u2019s rise has become something of a truism\n\n>More often than not, that is the message conveyed by American textbooks for students of European history and by other instructional works\n\n>With astonishing frequency, in short, evidence and purported evidence bearing on the subject of this book as been dealt with by historians in a fashion marked by striking suspension of professional standards\n\n>Most publications that explain the rise of Nazism in terms of capitalism have no need to rely heavily on evidence...\n\n>Since most of what occurs in the economic sphere is assumed to remain concealed from the public and even from the historian, much must be surmised from a few clues rather than demonstrated by a sustained marshalling of evidence, as in traditional scholarship\n\n>Even solid evidence has frequently been interpreted in such manner to distort it \n\n>Bias, in short, appears over and over again in treatments of the political role of big business even by otherwise scrupulous historians. \n\n> That bias should not come as a surprise. Professional historians generally have little or no personal contact with the world of business.\n\n>Like so many intellectuals, they tend to view big business with a combination of condescension and mistrust.\n\n>Relatively few of their number find it a congenial subject for research.\n\n>As a consequence, most of what historians have written about the political role of German big business in the period dealt with in this book as been largely uninformed by knowledge about businessmen or their institutions.\n\n>Since almost all of those who have concerned themselves with the relationship between the business community and Nazism have, to one degree or another, stood left or at least left of center in their political sympathies, a great many have found it difficult to resist the temptation to implicate big business, which learly belonged to the right, in the rise of Nazism.\n\n\n--\n\n>just being forced by mean old mr. hitler to take ownership of previously nationalized industries\n\nOwnership doesn't mean much when you're forced to be ccompletely subservient to the government. \n\nRichard Overy:\n\n>Even heavy industry, that had favored some degree of autarky and state aid in the early 1930s, found that the extent of state control exercised after 1936, and the rise of a state-owned industrial sector, threatened their interests too. The strains that such a relationship produced have already been demonstrated for the car industry, the aircraft industry and the iron and steel industry; but much more research is needed to arrive at a satisfactory historical judgement of the relationship between Nazism and German business. What is already clear is that the Third Reich was not simply a businessman's regime underpinning an authoritarian capitalism but, on the contrary, that it set about reducing the autonomy of the economic \u00e9lite and subordinating it to the interests of the Nazi state\u2026\n\n--\n\n>why are you just making things up. the socialist diehards in the SA were literally grousing about needing a second revolution due to hitler's coddling of business. that was the point of it.\n\nNo that was not the point of it, it was to eliminate opposition and potential threats to the regime. The SA was a huge paramilitary organization who, other than the Germany Army, were the only ones who had any power to overthrow Hitler. Hitler wanted to limit the power of the SA, and win the loyalty of the Germany Army who wanted the SA gone as the SA's leader R\u00f6hm had wanted to replace the German Army with the SA. There was also a power struggle between Himmler and G\u00f6ring against R\u00f6hm. Although R\u00f6hm disagreed with Hitler's gradual revolution (no, not \"coddling of business\"), neither he nor the SA had any intention to stage a second revolution, there wasn't any coup planned, Hitler just used it as an excuse to get rid of him and neuter the SA. He also again, targeted conservatives like von Schleicher and allies of von Papen, who were literally the furthest thing from socialists as possible.",

It was a one party government.   So putting the Nazi party in charge of everything meant they were still \"public\"... as in government owned and operated. \n\nWhat they actually did was restructure these corporations. Got rid of people that failed to tow the party line. Got rid of Jews and other people deemed unworthy.  And put Nazis in charge of everything. \n\nIt isn't any different from a Communist Regime putting Communists in charge of state corporations. \n\nThe type of socialism the Nazis were was National Syndicalism. \n\nThey nationalized businesses and nationalized the unions. They operated one of the largest Unions in human history, far larger then anything Germany has today.  For most workers membership was mandatory.   \n\nThey raised wages significantly, pushed for higher quality food, exercize yards, and entertainment in every major factory.  Workers were heavily \"encouraged\" to donate significant amount of their wages to welfare programs. \n\nNazis had Commissars placed in key positions in every major business and in the unions. \n\nThey set price controls, set quotas,  Told people what they could manufacture, at what price they could sell, and where they were allowed to sell it.  Workers and owners were monitored and had to tow the party line or would be passively aggressively punished.  Like workers that openly criticized the regime would be forced to take jobs in less desirable places. Business owners had to get approval for hiring and firing from  Commissars. Owners that didn't tow the party line would be displaced. \n\nThey tried to control most aspects of food production, took over the transportation industry, and attempted to control the movement and usage of coal. \n\nThe results were 100% predictable.  After a short growth spurt brought on by massive government programs and spending the growth in the economy ground to halt.  Coal shortages and harsh winters took their toll and food crises became a thing.  So despite pushing for higher wages the actual quality of life declined as the economy suffered. \n\nThis is no different from any other major authoritarian socialist regime.  One of the major motivations for the invasion of the East was to loot their economies and gain access to natural resources they felt was necessary to keep Germany afloat. \n\nThe difference between German Syndicalism and full blown Marxist regimes was that ostensively people could retrain their private property rights.  Meaning you were still technically allowed to \"own\" homes and capital.  \n\nHowever despite ownership on paper everything you were allowed to do, economically, was tightly controlled by the state.",

Privatization to industrialist party members is not socialism. A major aspect of both Italian Fascism and Nazism was stamping out egalitarian worker movements to preserve and reinforce class hierarchy.   Nazis were violently anti-egalitarian, literally created entirely new classes of undesirables.\n\nFascism is literally intended to be an antithesis to left wing egalitarian movements leveraging authoritarian force to preserve hierarchy.  You can say its not \"free market capitalism,\" but the idea of a free and equal market is itself more left wing, more egalitarian, than a controlled market benefiting the aristocracy, landowners, and financial elite.\n\n>if you think that socialism can maintain itself without government, you are delusional.\n\nanarcho socialism and anarcho capitalism are both fantasy but are both things that exist as ideologies.\n\nthis is a boring discussion.  what are you doing.",

The government sold public ownership in several State-owned firms in different sectors. In addition, delivery of some public services previously produced by the public sector was transferred to the private sector, mainly to organizations within the Nazi Party. Ideological motivations do not explain Nazi privatization. However, political motivations were important. The Nazi government may have used privatization as a tool to improve its relationship with big industrialists and to increase support among this group for its policies.\"\n\n>It is a fact that the government of the National Socialist Party sold off public ownership in several state-owned firms in the middle of the 1930s. The firms belonged to a wide range of sectors: steel, mining, banking, local public utilities, etc.\n\n\n///\n\n> A comparison between the expenditures of the Reich Winter Relief in 1931 and the Nazi Winter Relief in 1933 \u201cshows that this new Nazi organization has not provided in Winter Relief more than the former contribution made by the Reich alone under the Nazi system\" In short, delivered by private and public bodies before the Nazi regime, Winter Help was completely privatized by the Nazi government and was transferred to a Party Organization. The funding of the service was based on a compulsory scheme of fees and levies. Because of this, the Reich Budget was relieved of the expenditure implied by this social service program. \n\n///\n\n\n>Hitler firmly embraced the wishes of big business, ordering the reduction of spending of social services to ease the tax burden on businesses. He even demanded that the tax burden in the following five years not exceed those set in the worst crisis year of 1932, when private tax rates had dropped to a low level unheard of in the 1920s.\n\nfrom:  Primary problems of German economy policy, 1932/33, Vierteljahrshefte f\u00fcr Zeitgeschichte, Dieter Petzina",

This is the consensus among credible historians. For example:\n\nRichard J. Evans (Historian, author of The Third Reich Trilogy):\n\nEvans argues that the Nazis were staunchly anti-socialist and that their use of the term \u201csocialist\u201d was a propaganda tactic to attract working-class support while actually crushing socialist and communist movements in Germany.\n\n\nIan Kershaw (Hitler\u2019s leading biographer):\n\nKershaw makes it clear that Hitler was anti-Marxist and that his regime was built on a coalition of industrialists, militarists, and conservative elites. The economic system remained capitalist, albeit under state influence.\n\nRobert Paxton (Historian of fascism):\n\nPaxton argues that fascism, including Nazism, co-opted left-wing language while serving the interests of big business and suppressing socialist organizations. The Nazis aligned with major industrialists and fought actual socialist and communist movements.\n\n\nTimothy Snyder (Historian, Bloodlands):\n\nSnyder has emphasized that Hitler was explicitly anti-socialist, targeting leftist movements and advocating for a hierarchical, racialized society.\n\n\nSo yeah, you\u2019re talking out your arse.

Private property was still allowed to exist and private enterprise thrived under the nazi party. Do you even know what seize the means of production means in a Marxist sense\u2014it means the WORKERS seize the means. Socialism isn\u2019t just statism or when the government does stuff, there are meaningful distinctions you clearly don\u2019t grasp. Every credible historian agrees that whatever vague socialist policies Hitler alluded to basically dissipated when he was elected. For example:\n\nRichard J. Evans (Historian, author of The Third Reich Trilogy):\n\nEvans argues that the Nazis were staunchly anti-socialist and that their use of the term \u201csocialist\u201d was a propaganda tactic to attract working-class support while actually crushing socialist and communist movements in Germany.\n\nIan Kershaw (Hitler\u2019s leading biographer):\n\nKershaw makes it clear that Hitler was anti-Marxist and that his regime was built on a coalition of industrialists, militarists, and conservative elites. The economic system remained capitalist, albeit under state influence.\n\nRobert Paxton (Historian of fascism):\n\nPaxton argues that fascism, including Nazism, co-opted left-wing language while serving the interests of big business and suppressing socialist organizations. The Nazis aligned with major industrialists and fought actual socialist and communist movements.\n\nTimothy Snyder (Historian, Bloodlands):\n\nSnyder has emphasized that Hitler was explicitly anti-socialist, targeting leftist movements and advocating for a hierarchical, racialized society.\n\nI could go on. Please for the love of god, read a book and double check your claims before spouting embarrassing nonsense.",

He used the term strategically to appeal to the working class. Communism and socialism were increasingly popular in Europe at the time. Hitler needed to compete with them. In fact the conflict between socialism and fascism is one of the defining forces of 20th century European history. There are COUNTLESS other examples that bear this out.

It is no question that it was anti-Marxist, but what\u2019s contentious is the anti-socialist claim. The working class in Germany was becoming quickly disillusioned with Marxism with the acts of the Spartacists and the bohemian culture in Weimar Germany, not to mention the massive economic problems ( arising themselves out of printing money to pay off debt and workers,) loss of industrial heartland to foreign powers, so they in turn bought into the NSDAP; we could call it race socialism. Economically they were quite socialist if you consider the State owning the means of production socialism, as it *represents* the workers, but the Nazi economy was atrociously run and didn\u2019t promote the working class above all (rather the Volksgemeinschaft) They did not run off of Italy\u2019s syndicalist model and resembled more the USSR\u2019s central planning. \n\nFascism tends to resemble Marxist movements in many of its forms because it arose out of the contemporary issues of Marxism, seeking to reconcile it with the nation. Nazism was very heterodox in its application of Fascism though. You could call it a *reaction* in this way, but not *reactionary* (the NSDAP was revolutionary and by no means conservative, that goes for Italian Fascism too.)",
