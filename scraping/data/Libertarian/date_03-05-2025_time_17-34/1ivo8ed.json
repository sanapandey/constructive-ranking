But I still have a question on why the above two differ and how.\n\nIf I buy a stock at 100 and sell it at a price of 150, I pay tax on 50.\n\nIf I hold 100 in cash and it appreciates in this hypothetical situation to be able to buy 1.5x market basket for the same amount, they don\u2019t collect tax on that appreciation?",

                            "body": "Using made up round numbers for simplicity, say you make $100k and you owe 10% on your taxes. The next bracket up is at $150k at 15%. After a few years of inflation your salary has gone up to $150k and all the goods you buy have also gone up 50%. So you\u2019re no better off financially, but now you owe 15% on that extra $50k instead of the original 10% you were paying before the inflation. So inflation has the effect of pushing people up into higher tax brackets without making them any better off.\n\nObviously the real world scenario is much worse than this because most of us experience the price of all the goods we buy go up *before* we get the increase in our wages, while all the government bureaucrats and cronies get paid with that newly printed money *before* prices go up. This is referred to as the Cantillon effect.",
