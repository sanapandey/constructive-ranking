I don't think it's a secret that SS is wealth redistribution, and its not some personal pension fund investing for you. Wealth redistribution is a debatable topic on its own, but this is hardly a \"gotcha\" moment when it's literally the intent of the program. Without it, the rich get their $32,583 from SPY, most likely never spend it to stimulate the local economy, and the poor die younger, most likely never retiring.",

The fact that Social Security has a guaranteed payout without marketing fluctuations and is still going to go belly up, is indicative that the program is not sustainable. So you\u2019re comparing the disadvantages of investing in the stock market which of course there is to the easily to forget in solvency of the program. Again, I will put in something like I don\u2019t know 11 grand into the system this year. Let me invest eight grand, and then tax me another three grand to go into the general fund for everybody else. And then tax that income afterwards. I\u2019m fine with it.\n\nI guess we are appealing to the general lack of future planning that many people have.  People want the newest iPhone, the newest car, but they don\u2019t think about saving for the future because delayed gratification is something that takes a certain amount of intelligence and foresight.",
