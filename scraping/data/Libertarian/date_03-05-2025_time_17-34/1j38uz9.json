I would assume that JP is saying that is it \"easy\" to post on social media or wear a T-shirt or stick a pin on a lapel saying that one is supportive of Ukraine. However, if given the option, we would not fund it with the money/funds out of our own pockets, nor would we want our family to go and fight in the war. I also don't mean to say that ALL of society is like this. Like you said, there are families out there that are MORE than willing to provide money of their own budget, or to volunteer themselves or be okay with family volunteering themselves to physically fight in a war.   \n  \nI've read through some of the comments regarding the \"money\" part. I believe there is a difference in how that money comes from us/US taxpayers. We pay taxes, and the government does something with that money - is different than saying \"i'm going to donate $20 to the SPCA\", or \"$20 to the homeless shelter\", or \"$20 to my local religious group\". Regardless of the situation, the government will take taxes, and after those taxes are taken, individually, we don't have any direct influence in how that dollar is spent.",

In that regard, I'll try to answer, starting with how I would prefer to use my money instead of it going to some civil servant:\n\n1) Denver doesn't always plow snow on smaller side streets, with the expectation that it will be 50-60 degrees within 48 hours. This isn't always the case, and roads are left either icy and slushy (especially Northern facing roads that are covered by larger houses). This is where smaller, private companies have been far more effective at handling not only certain streets, but apartment complexes and parking lots. I used to be part of an HOA decision to contract out people for this. Much easier dealing with these guys than the city.\n\n\n\n2) Recycling and Composting services with city have been reduced/scaled back. Dealing with private contractors tangentially affiliated with WM was easier and cheaper. Easier to build relationships with those guys and work communication.\n\n\n\n3) Couple years ago, we had crazy ass winds and a massive tree toppled in front of our yard. When tree owner called the city, they will take care of it within the week, while another branch they told him to call said they could not get to him. But he had to have the sidewalk cleared and tree moved within 48 hours. But they wouldn't be able to help. So instead, us neighbors all grabbed chainsaws and axes, and cleared it all within 6 hours. The next day, some other city official came by unannounced and tried to get him to pay a fine for damages to my sidewalk and fence.\n\n\n\n4) In my own Ron Swanson moment, I tried filling potholes and building drainages in my back alley because it was an eye sore and dangerous when filled with ice. I got a fine from the city.\n\n\n\nI know you're speaking primarily about national and state services being cut, but these city gov inefficiencies could logically be extrapolated. More bureaucracy, more inefficiency.\nAll this time, my taxes continue to go up and up while the services my taxes supposedly pay for are getting reduced and cut. While things we the people never voted on are being implemented or pushed forward.\n\n\nAnd yes, I am also into prepping and have converted some friends to the lifestyle. Fuck it, if I have a child, I would trust myself to better educate them at home than send them to shit public schools that my property taxes pay for. I am very much looking to achieve self sufficiency and know personally of plenty other libertarians who want the same. They just aren't on reddit.",
