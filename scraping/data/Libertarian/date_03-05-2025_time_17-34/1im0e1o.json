However, a Christian couldn't commune with a Muslim, nor a Muslim with a Hindu, b/c they were seen as irreconcilably different.\n\nThese days, Christians, Muslims, and Hindus commune and intermarry and whatnot all the time b/c we're supposed to be accepting of everything. However, a leftist who preaches love and tolerance wouldn't be caught dead communing, let alone intermarrying, with a MAGA affiliate, b/c the LW and the RW believe that the others are heathens (the word that gets thrown around in the same context is \"Nazis\").\n\nA political difference is something that two people can get past, whereas a religious difference is one that people can't get past.\n\n> I disagree that it requires faith to not believe in a god\n\nLook at it this way. People separate ideas into categories of faith and reason, and they see reasonably justified ideas as self-evident like 2+2=4.\n\nThe thing is that even 2+2=4 requires you to assume that the natural numbers exist and are well-defined (there's fields of abstract math that _don't_), so even math, which is as \"reasonably justified\" as it gets, requires assumption. In other words, you have to have _faith_ that your assumptions hold true about what you're observing.\n\nBasically, you need faith to believe literally anything. You need faith in order to believe your own eyes, i.e., faith in your own existence; in fact, faith in your own existence is a prerequisite for faith in a divine presence manifested by your existence.\n\nThis is why I keep saying faith, which is the basis of religion, is a required part of life. You can't get rid of it without getting rid of yourself (which is what the Buddhists are trying to do!)\n\n> you agree that god killed no less than 2,391,421 people in the stories therein\n\nWhy is killing people bad?\n\nAccording to the Bible, humans killing other humans without righteous cause is bad, sure, but God isn't human, so you can't cast the same moralistic imperatives on Him.\n\nMind you, I'm not a Christian; I'm a Hindu. With that said, the same holds true across all religions, so I'm willing to accept Christianity as the \"lingua franca\" of the West without perpetuating the \"Tower of Babel\" in religious exclusion.\n\nAgain, according to Christianity, God is definitionally good, and the absence thereof (characterized by Hell) is definitionally bad. Holding God to human moralistic imperatives is itself sinful, in fact, b/c then you're not acknowledging His supremacy.\n\n> I find it quite un-libertarian to inflict so much harm on others without their consent\n\nImagine you're a farmer. You might love your sheep and go out of your way to make sure they're well cared for; your daughter might even run around with the lambs and talk to them as if they were her friends.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, you're still going to use their wool and milk and kill them for meat. You'll do your best to be good to them while it's economically feasible, sure, but you're entitled to own them as property b/c you, as a human, are above them.\n\nHowever, at the same time, the state isn't entitled to own you as property b/c the state is run by humans, and slavery of humans by other humans is wrong.\n\nGod is as far above you as you are above your sheep. This is why the Bible characterizes you as belonging to His flock. Therefore, you can't cast moral imperatives on Him for killing you, just like a sheep can't cast moral imperatives on a human for killing it.\n\nJust have faith that He'll be good to you while you're alive and that you'll \"go back to Him\" in the end when your flesh turns into dust, even though He doesn't give you what you want _all the time_.",

But okay for god?\n\nIf a human dies in a bear attack, then there's no moral onus on the bear; the bear is an animal, i.e., a force of nature.\n\nIf a human gets struck by lightning, then there's no moral onus on the lightning; the lightning is a force of nature.\n\nHumans can only cast moral imperatives on other humans. The problem is when you cast moral imperatives on and find fault in every human other than yourself. In atheism, that's called Messiah-complex, and everyone trolls people who are subject to it. In Christianity, that's called blaspheming the Holy Ghost, which is the one thing Jesus can't forgive you for.\n\n> Even with sheep, it is a moral imperative to kill humanely and minimize suffering. But god can inflict decades of suffering in a downward spiral to death.\n\nYou might beat the sheep when it gets aggressive with your child, and the sheep might feel that you're a cruel god in that moment (b/c it doesn't understands the reason for its pain), but again, it makes perfect sense FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE why the sheep can't cast moral imperatives on you.\n\nI'll bet the Father feels the same way when the Son martyrs Himself for your sins. Fortunately (for you), His desire to rain down hellfire on you is toned down when the Son implores Him: \"Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they've done.\"\n\nIf you're asking \"Why did God create evil if He is all good?\", then the answer is that evil is the absence of God, and you often need to experience His absence (in hopefully small doses) before you start to notice and acknowledge His presence.",

If your point is that any belief, even in demonstratable facts, is religious, then let's agree to disagree. Faith in something that can be seen or proven in a repeatable experiment is totally different than faith in a magic sky man that you can't see, cannot talk to you, and cannot be proven.  \n\nBears and lightning are not intelligent beings.  Morally does not apply to wildlife or inanimate objects, or a cluster of photons.  Morality only applies to intelligent beings, of which only one - Humans are known to exist.  I suppose you could argue that dolphins, Chimpanzees, and Crows are also \"intelligent\", but that's a grey area, and not my point.  My point is that a omnipotent being is absolutely smart enough to be held to high moral standards - possibly higher than humans! Allowing suffering when you are capable of disallowing it is immoral.  Causing suffering is even worse. An all powerful god would be guilty of both.  An all powerful god would simply disallow evil. Disallow suffering.  Disallow death.  By not doing so, they must be immoral, evil, or not exist.  One of these three options is not like the other.",

You're acting like He's the government to just disallow stuff that people don't like. You make it sound like you were expecting George Washington, but you feel shortchanged b/c who you actually have is Joe Biden.\n\nFunnily enough, it's actually a short walk from there to Marxism. Marx was trying to get rid of the king and pope in one shot with the concept of a Messianic state.\n\n**TL;DR:** I know it sounds like I'm asking you to believe in something with no evidence, but the goal of religion is to get you to look inwards and accept yourself for who you really are. We're all flawed and broken, but that's OK as long as we try to be better instead of acting like we're perfect. Similarly, we all have the propensity to be better, and all we need to do is accept imperfection for the sake of progress and believe in ourselves. If you can do that, even if you don't believe in God, He'll show you in His own way that He was there all along.",

Adult HRT works surprisingly well to change secondary sexual characteristics but it can't fix everything, and it'd be pretty obviously alarming if your body was changing its shape in ways you knew you didn't want it to and could never fix, or at best could only fix with lots of money and effort. \n\nThe traditional solution to this issue is puberty blockers, which are explicitly for the purpose of delaying this decision until the kid has reached the age of majority (and which basically all medical experts support).

If that issue is fixed, they stop puberty blockers and let it proceed as normal; studies indicate that girls that undergo puberty blocking treatment for precocious puberty do not have any detrimental effects in terms of fertility or menstrual activity.   A patient that has taken puberty blockers until the proper time is actually more likely to be properly developed in terms of height and skeletal structure;  untreated, the puberty often outpaces the bone growth and causes it to end early. \n\nIn their usage in gender dysphoria, puberty blockers are just buying time; the actual treatment is hormones for a full transition.   Patients that undergo puberty blockers and then cease all treatment in early adulthood generally just resume puberty and develop normally.   The known side effects (lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, lesser bone density) seem to basically remedy themselves once treatment is ended.  \n\nHonestly, though?   It only really matters if there are lifelong problems caused by the treatment during the portion where they are a minor.   Resuming puberty at 30 could totally fuck you up (again, it seems unlikely this is the case), but that's the decision of the person who spent 12 years as an adult making their own medical choices, and it's not really our business.",

See how I see it, there are prepubescent kids with a legitimate mental illness called gender dysphoria. Then there are prepubescent kids who think that it's \"cool\" or will relate to some sort of validation/recognition. Then there's also breaking down the many forms of mental therapy. We have Psychology(Talk therapy with very little medication involved), Psychiatry(Medication takes the forefront here and talk therapy a back seat), then CBT(Cognitive behavioral therapy where talking is the most important as well as challenging behaviors to approach a more positive change), and within that are many subtleties. There has been many stories of kids going to therapy, primarily psychiatric care, related to gender affirming care, and they end up getting duped into THINKING they have gender dysphoria, when really it was something else. They then will have gone through the whole process of HRT and Surgical intervention before they realize they have made a HUGE mistake and regret transitioning to begin with.\n\nSee the problem with the whole \"IT PREVENTS SUICIDE\" is in the cases where a person doesn't have ANY mental illness related to gender dysphoria, and then they transition it can actually make the suicide tendencies worse. Some people will do it for the validation, for the attention to fill the void they don't receive from family or friends. Maybe to find acceptance, then after the initial burst of \"OH YOU'RE SO BRAVE!\" fizzles out they are left alone with the same problems they had at the beginning but now it's worse cause they are left with irreversible changes to their body. Another problem with listening to health care providers on this issue is American healthcare is a big money business. If you have people who are trans, then they are lifelong patients, forever on hormones and other medications, seeking multiple surgeries which all cost large amounts of money. So do I think that therapy is effective against suicide? Absolutely, when it comes to Psychology and CBT, but psychiatry is literally something that has roots to mental conditions such as schizophrenia where medications are ESSENTIAL for the mental condition.\n\nOn top of all that the studies that show gender affirming care equals suicide prevention is very spotty as it's fairly new in terms of actually gathering data and analyzing the results. As a matter of fact the data shows that the overwhelming majority of people transitioning are actually more volatile and less mentally stable/happy which shows that the overwhelming majority of people claiming to have gender dysphoria, don't have it. This is why back in the day there were rigorous roadblocks for anyone with gender dysphoria to get HRT or Surgery. It was often needed to take therapy for many many years, in which one of the things therapy recommended was living your life as if you WERE the opposite sex for many years before then jumping into the pool and making irreversible changes to the body. What is fucked up is there are countless parents in America making these changes to kids as low as 8-10 years old based off of the trans activism narrative being pushed and the biggest scare for these idiot parents is \"YOUR KID WILL COMMIT SUICIDE!\".",

But this transwoman who regrets her transition explains the whole process in england. Her and thousands others who have massive regrets of being duped into transitioning is WHY the U.K has banned serious interventions for kids under the age of 18.

Sounds like a double standard if you ask me.\n\nI never claimed kids younger than 17 have received HRT or Surgical interventions. I said that kids at a shocking young age from 8-10 have received gender affirming therapy which just enables them and doesn't challenge them. Hence the term \"affirming\". Psychiatrists in these situations will often just enable the kids and affirm their feelings without challenging them and their thoughts. Also there's a shocking number of idiot parents who bought into the whole trans activists talking points that will actively make the decision for their children. You probably hate him, I don't agree with what he says all the time but I did manage to watch this video from Matt Walsh reporting on the HBO documentary \"Transhood\" about parents of trans kids. It's not very long but the very first scene he shows is a woman who is affirming her son's gender identity and is actively raising him as a girl and he is literally fucking 4 years old. What I'm saying is there's an alarming amount of errors happening when it comes to trans activism not based in science or even common sense.\n\nMatt Walsh Video [https://youtu.be/eJy-xrqskTg?si=5i4djW8JEliH5Ur9](https://youtu.be/eJy-xrqskTg?si=5i4djW8JEliH5Ur9)\n\nI am heavily biased against Psychiatry and medical intervention on kids of any kind, for any condition as I am one of those kids diagnosed with mental conditions at the age of 14 and immediately put on medication without any talk therapy. When I started talk therapy and CBT I was able to get off all my psychiatric medications all together. I was also duped into believing I had Bi Polar and medicated for it which was just an excuse for my shitty behavior as a kid. I was never challenged on any of my feelings or thoughts and for years believed I had Bi Polar Disorder. Turns out I don't have it, never had it, and my mood swings were justified from going through a traumatic childhood and the medication just made it all worse. So yeah when I say talk therapy is the most effective for almost all mental conditions I mean it. In very rare cases I can see the argument for medication helping kids but those are exceedingly rare in a society of heavily medicated children.",
