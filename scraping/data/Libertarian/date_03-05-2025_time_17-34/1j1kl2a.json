    "selftext": "The idea of the U.S. government funding foreign conflicts, especially one like the war in Ukraine, fundamentally ignores the primary responsibility of public officials to serve the interests of U.S. citizens. Imagine being employed by one company to serve its interests, only to take company funds and give them to a completely unrelated business, all while justifying it with the claim that it somehow benefits the original employer. That\u2019s the situation the U.S. government is in when sending taxpayer money to Ukraine. Public funds are not meant to be used to support foreign conflicts when the U.S. itself is not under direct attack or facing any immediate threat from Russia. This is not only an imprudent use of taxpayer money, it\u2019s a breach of the trust that U.S. citizens place in their elected officials to act in their best interests.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the social contract between the government and the citizens it serves. Taxes are not voluntary; they are levied by force, based on the understanding that the government will use them for the common good of its people. This is a tacit agreement where citizens accept the coercion of taxation in exchange for the assurance that their money will be spent on infrastructure, security, healthcare, education, and other vital services that directly benefit them. The people are not asked to fund wars in foreign lands that don\u2019t affect them. If U.S. officials want to act on behalf of other nations or international causes, they are free to do so with their own personal funds or through private organizations, not with the hard-earned money of American taxpayers. There is a clear and necessary distinction between private philanthropy and public duty.\n\nUkraine\u2019s war with Russia is tragic, but it is not the responsibility of U.S. taxpayers to bear the financial burden of this conflict. The idea that sending billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine somehow strengthens U.S. national security is a weak and unconvincing argument. The U.S. is not under attack by Russia, nor is it in imminent danger from the conflict in Ukraine. The only result of sending money overseas is the diversion of resources from critical needs at home, such as infrastructure improvements, healthcare access, or even the basic welfare of American citizens. These are the areas where U.S. taxpayer funds should be focused.\n\nMoreover, the American people have a right to demand accountability. Public officials must understand that their primary job is to serve the interests of the U.S. citizens who fund their positions. When they direct taxpayer funds to foreign conflicts, especially ones that don't directly involve the U.S., they are failing to uphold their end of the social contract. Misusing public money for foreign aid not only misrepresents the will of the people, it undermines the legitimacy of the democratic process. It sends the message that the U.S. government works not for its citizens, but for foreign governments and global agendas.\n\nThere is nothing stopping individuals or private organizations from contributing to Ukraine or other causes they believe in. Anyone who feels strongly about the situation can donate their personal money, resources, or even time to support Ukraine. There are countless private groups and international organizations that welcome voluntary donations and support. The difference, however, is that this money comes from personal choice, not the forced contributions of the public.\n\nThis is not to dismiss the importance of international solidarity or the need for cooperation between nations. However, the role of the U.S. government, funded by its citizens, is to prioritize domestic issues first. Americans do not have a social contract with Ukraine; they have one with their government, which is obliged to focus on their welfare and needs. It is not the responsibility of the U.S. to act as the world\u2019s policeman or to fund wars that do not directly affect the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, all U.S. public funding for the war in Ukraine must stop. The government must refocus its resources on issues that directly benefit the American public. This is not a matter of indifference to global suffering, but of prioritizing the needs of the citizens who fund the government through taxation. If individuals or private organizations wish to contribute to Ukraine\u2019s cause, they are free to do so. But public funds, taken by force from U.S. taxpayers, must be reserved for the common good of the people who are directly impacted by the decisions of their elected officials.",

If Ukraine were to fall, the resulting instability is going to embolden Russia. That's a signal to Putin he essentially has Carte blanche to do whatever the hell he wants. I promise you that IT DOESN'T STOP AT UKRAINE.\n\nYou might ask: \"Why do we care about what happens in Europe? It's not going to affect us.\"\n\nNope, not directly at least, but it does affect our NATO allies (unless Trump abandons them) and if they get involved that could eventually drag the U.S. military into this and that would cost trillions in a prolonged engagement. Not to mention American lives. At the moment, we're propping up Ukraine to do their own dirty work - a situation I don't want to see changed.\n\nYou might say: \"Even if a NATO ally is involved that doesn't mean we have to fight.\"\n\nArticle 5 of the NATO agreement states that \"an attack on one NATO member is considered an attack on all members\". The U.S played a leading role in creating NATO.  Contrary to what this current administration says, we've greatly benefitted from it for many decades. It's allowed us to have bases all over the world securing our economic interests.\n\n\"So what? We just won't honor Article 5.\"\n\nIf the U.S. were to renege on Article 5 of the NATO agreement\u2014the cornerstone of collective defense\u2014it would effectively undermine every treaty and alliance this country has ever signed. That would be a diplomatic catastrophe, signaling that U.S. security commitments are unreliable, eroding DECADES of strategic partnerships.\n\nBeyond the immediate geopolitical fallout, this would also have profound economic consequences. Nations that rely on U.S. security guarantees would have every incentive to pivot away from the Western-led financial system, accelerating de-dollarization and strengthening alternative economic blocs like BRICS. As countries seek to reduce dependence on the U.S. and hedge against American unpredictability, the dollar\u2019s status as the global reserve currency would weaken, threatening U.S. economic dominance and long-term financial stability.\n\n\"Who fills that vacuum?\"\n\nChina most likely.\n\nWith the situation we're in with Russia, funding a non-NATO ally to fight their own war is America first because the alternative is much much worse...",

Funding an anti-Russian war weakens Russia\u2019s ability to project power elsewhere (e.g., Armenia moving out of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence) and support other authoritarian regimes (e.g., the fall of Bashar Assad). Both cases ultimately shift influence toward the U.S.\n\nB) Moral Considerations: While morality may not be a top concern for Americans, Ukrainians have largely continued fighting based on U.S. and European assurances of full territorial integrity. Abandoning Ukraine now, when Russia has increased its mobilization, would be both unfair and immoral. Had the West signaled otherwise earlier, when Russia was weaker, Ukraine could have secured a better deal.\n\nC) Credibility: Abandoning Ukraine would signal to the world that American commitments mean little\u2014at best, they last only four years. This would push nations (e.g., post-Soviet states, Mongolia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, the Philippines) to seek security through authoritarian powers like China and Russia instead of aligning with the democratic world.\n\nD) Nuclear Deterrence: It would send the wrong message: never give up your nuclear weapons. Instead, countries would be encouraged to develop nuclear arsenals, knowing that major powers can annex weaker states with little outside support.\n\nE) Economic Interests: A rushed peace deal would be financially foolish for the U.S. After spending $100 billion and securing a foothold in Europe\u2019s LNG market, lifting sanctions on Russia would allow cheap Russian gas to undercut American LNG dominance.",

                    "body": "The fundamental flaw in the argument for funding Ukraine is that it ignores the basic principle of public money: it belongs to U.S. citizens and must be used to meet their direct needs. The U.S. government exists to serve its own people, not to act as a global benefactor for foreign conflicts. If individuals believe in supporting Ukraine, they are free to donate their own money or even fight in the war themselves, but they do not have the right to force every American taxpayer to contribute against their will.\n\nThe geopolitical argument fails because U.S. citizens are not obligated to fund wars that do not directly affect them. If weakening Russia is a priority for some, they can form private organizations to support Ukraine\u2019s war effort, but the government has no right to take money from the American people for this purpose. Public funds are not meant for global strategy games; they are meant to serve the taxpayers who provide them.\n\nThe moral argument is irrelevant because morality is subjective, and government spending should not be based on emotional appeals. If individuals feel morally compelled to help Ukraine, they can do so with their own resources. U.S. taxpayers should not be forced into moral obligations they did not consent to, especially when their own needs, such as healthcare, infrastructure, and economic stability, are still unmet.\n\nThe credibility argument is meaningless because America's credibility should be based on serving its own people first, not on how much money it hands out to foreign nations. If credibility is so important to someone, they are welcome to fund Ukraine personally to maintain whatever global image they think the U.S. should uphold. Public money, however, must stay focused on American interests, not foreign perceptions.\n\nThe nuclear deterrence argument collapses under the same logic. If someone is worried about nuclear proliferation, they can support nuclear policy groups or personally invest in nonproliferation efforts. But forcing U.S. taxpayers to fund a foreign war in the name of nuclear deterrence is unjustified. The government has no right to take Americans\u2019 money for abstract global concerns when that money is meant for domestic needs.\n\nThe economic argument is absurd because U.S. taxpayers are not investors in global energy markets. If businesses or investors see economic opportunities tied to Ukraine, they can fund Ukraine through private means. Public money is not a tool for advancing private financial interests, it exists solely to benefit the people who pay into it.\n\nEvery argument in favor of funding Ukraine crumbles under the same basic truth: U.S. taxpayers provide public money, and that money must be used to meet their needs, not foreign interests. Anyone who believes in the Ukraine cause can donate, organize, or even go fight. But they have no right to force their priorities onto the entire American population by using public funds meant for domestic welfare.",

                                    "body": "You assume that American taxpayers have an obligation to fund foreign wars just because the world is interconnected. But interconnectedness does not justify forcibly taking money from U.S. citizens to fund conflicts that do not directly impact their lives. Public funds exist to serve American citizens, not to micromanage global affairs. If some people believe that supporting Ukraine is crucial for global stability, they are free to organize, donate their own money, or even fight in the war themselves. What they cannot do is force every U.S. taxpayer to fund their foreign policy vision.\n\nThe idea that geopolitical interests are \"indirectly\" personal interests of U.S. taxpayers is vague and unconvincing. American taxpayers have immediate and tangible needs, economic stability, infrastructure, healthcare, security at home. You cannot ask them to sacrifice their own well-being for abstract, long-term global strategies that may or may not benefit them. If someone wants to gamble on geopolitical outcomes, they can do so with their own resources, not public funds.\n\nThe claim that ignoring Ukraine will lead to a shift toward authoritarianism assumes that U.S. taxpayers have an obligation to prevent this. They do not. America\u2019s responsibility is to its own people first. If the concern is authoritarian expansion, individuals and private organizations can fund efforts to counter it. But you cannot force American workers to pay for foreign conflicts on the assumption that it might prevent some future geopolitical shift.\n\nThe argument that allowing Russia to violate security agreements will lead to a chain reaction of wars ignores the fact that U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts has often caused instability, not prevented it. Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya interventions that were supposed to prevent chaos instead created more. U.S. taxpayers should not be funding wars based on hypothetical domino effects when history shows that intervention often worsens situations rather than stabilizing them.\n\nThe nuclear deterrence argument is another case of misplaced responsibility. If countries are going to develop nuclear weapons, that is a global issue that requires international cooperation, not endless U.S. war funding. American taxpayers are not responsible for policing the entire world to ensure nuclear non-proliferation. If anything, reckless involvement in foreign wars only increases global instability and encourages nuclear proliferation, rather than preventing it.\n\nThe claim that resource control by China or Russia harms U.S. taxpayers is misleading. The U.S. has vast domestic energy and resource potential that it underutilizes due to policy choices. If securing resources is the concern, the solution is not to fund foreign wars but to invest in domestic production, energy independence, and alternative supply chains. Instead of spending public money on Ukraine, America should be securing its own resource security through investment and strategic trade partnerships.\n\nThe final claim that democracy leads to peace and prosperity for U.S. taxpayers is idealistic but irrelevant. Many democracies have been at war, and many authoritarian states have stable economies and trade relationships. U.S. taxpayers should not be forced to bankroll democracy promotion worldwide, especially when that effort often leads to instability (as seen in Iraq and Libya). If people are concerned about global democracy, they are free to fund initiatives privately, but public money should remain focused on American interests at home.\n\nAt its core, this argument tries to justify taking money from U.S. citizens for vague, speculative, and long-term geopolitical goals while ignoring their immediate needs. It assumes that government officials have the right to redirect public funds toward foreign wars without clear, direct benefits to the people funding them. But public funds belong to the American people, and their primary purpose is to serve their direct needs. Everything else, including foreign conflicts, can be funded voluntarily by those who truly believe in the cause.",

But I'm afraid this administration is now doing the US a massively huge disservice with its recent actions.\n\nI mean if it was net negative charity, then why the hell would the Chinese now be doing the Belt and Road program. Because they're such nice guys???",
