The official modus operandi of the dullard dregs. \n\nLMAO. \n\nPathetic. The lot of you. \n\nDo you think hawaii was taken over via war? I can't tell. \n\nHow is Hawaii being annexed off topic? It is a perfect analogy. Hawaii is much further from the US than Greenland, too. \n\nWe came in with a small military force, informed them we were annexing them, and it was done. Zero notable violence. \n\nDo you consider that war?\n\nDo you even have a point? \n\nIt seems you are more interested in shifting goal posts than making any kind of salient point. \n\nIs winning (getting up votes)on reddit the highlight of your life?  \n\nDown votes are a badge of honor on reddit now thanks you and your ilk. \n\nTrump needs to endorse reddit and discourage jumping from tall buildings. \n\nIt would get rid of so many worthless people from what was once a decent site, and our plane of existence, due to the intense TDS plaguing the world. \n\nI'm not even a fan of Trump or Elon, but you people are so completely delusional I think pointing it out is prudent. \n\nHow will you further alter your argument? \n\nI look forward to your next dumbshit delusional response.",

You're acting like you're putting me in my place and talking down to me but my comment is my observation of the country's current state and my opinion on what both parties are doing. \n\nWhat's implied in my comment is that I don't align with the radical leftist ideology.\n\nYou think you're making relevant points but clearly aren't eloquent enough to do so sensibly and making false accusations and assumptions of me. \n\nJust makes you come off as irrational and insecure.",
