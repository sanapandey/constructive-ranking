    "selftext": "I'm curious about your thoughts on government funding for research like COVID-19 vaccines and SpaceX rockets without requiring ongoing royalty agreements, assuming the government continues funding projects with public benefit under a Keynesian approach (which I know is contentious, but assuming that doesn't change). Taxpayers fund the initial research, but companies keep most profits from the resulting products. For example, Moderna received $1.5 billion in government support, made over $36 billion in vaccine sales, and paid a $400 million one-time fee with some ongoing royalties. SpaceX got over $5.5 billion in contracts, with no clear share in commercial launch profits. Is this fair? Does it distort the market? Should the government seek more royalties?",
