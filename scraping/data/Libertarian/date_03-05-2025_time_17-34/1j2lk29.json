In order to redraw a states borders, or create a new state, it would likely take an act of the US congress to admit a new state into the union.\n\nThere's an argument that if say Indiana and Illinois both agreed that counties X, Y, Z could leave Illinois and join Indiana, that it should be permissible. But I don't see the courts allowing that without congressional approval. Also let's be real no state is going to voluntarily cede territory to another.",
