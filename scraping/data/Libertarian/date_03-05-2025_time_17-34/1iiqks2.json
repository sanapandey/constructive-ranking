If Congress allocated funds for things like USAID, then Congress needs to be the ones to shut it down.  \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t like a billionaire entrepreneur with billions in government contracts being the one to make the calls on which gov\u2019t funding gets cut short.   That\u2019s a huge conflict of interest as he can gain insight into his competitors with government data and then directly negatively impact them through funding cuts.",

It was created through EO after legislation was passed requiring implementation of a foreign aid program (significant paraphrasing as, so do look it up if you have interest). \u00a0 USAID was the implementation, but there\u2019s nothing that I see stopping the dismantling of USAID via EO so long as the foreign aid requirements are met through an alternative government office. Word on the street is that the responsibilities from this program will move to the state department.\u00a0\n\nSo lesson learned: don\u2019t rely on EO long term.\u00a0",

Look at what you said, DOGE can exist because Title IX exists and the department of education used that to expand their mission. The department of education has nothing to do with doge, it can not be used to say doge can exist no matter what.
