And he's identified some specific big-ticket items: evidently a big effort to \"modernize the nuclear stockpile\" was going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars, so he now wants to negotiate nuclear arms cuts with Russia and China to save everyone a bunch of money.\n\nTrump is all over the place on this, but seems to be settling in towards some actually military cuts, which at least is a step in the right direction.

That way, if a member of congress decides that we don't need another defense budget boondoggle, that member of congress can be voted out due to loss of jobs.\n\nI'll believe Trump and Musk are willing to shrink the defense budget when I see it.
