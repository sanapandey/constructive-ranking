            "body": "Libertarianism is opposition to authoritarianism, state oppression, and government overreach. Generally speaking, libertarians want the government to leave everyone alone. Libertarianism is associated with the American Libertarian Party, but that party does not hold a monopoly on the ideology. Some people here support the party and some oppose it for various reasons. There are also different factions within the party that clash with one another. \n\nLibertarian is somewhat an American term. Elsewhere in the world it would be the Libertarian Party would be called the Liberal Party. The label libertarian is often associated with libertarian socialism, not free market liberalism. America in general had dumb names for its political identities. \n\nLibertarians are often, but not necessarily, individualists. Collectivist libertarians believe in working with their community to better every member of their community. This does not require state action, but because collectivism is often associated with the state, this sometimes causes disagreements with individualist libertarians. \n\nA commonly held libertarian ethic is the Non-Aggression Policy (NAP). The NAP holds that it is wrong to violate the negative rights of anyone and that violence is justified to defend those rights. Negative rights are things that can't be taken from you, positive rights are things that you are entitled to (e.g. gun ownership is a negative right, free healthcare is a positive right). Libertarians typically do not support positive rights. Many libertarian believe the only role of the government should be enforcing the NAP.\n\nThere is no one single social position that all libertarians hold. The American Libertarian Party is an offshoot of American Conservatism, so many older libertarians were somewhat conservative. However, libertarianism often attracts anti-war activists and their like, who tend to be socially progressive. There is also a large population of young men who were radicalized on the internet who tend to be socially conservative (anyone claiming to be a Hoppean almost certainly falls into this category). All of these people are libertarians, but they can vehemently disagree with each other. For example, the legalization of gay marriage is a libertarian position because it denies government overreach and supports freedom and equal negative rights. However a queer gender abolitionist and a staunch \"homosexuality is an abomination\" Christian could both hold the position that the government shouldn't interfere in marriage. Those people would have a serious disagreement while still being libertarians. \n\nDisagreements on social positions can lead to disagreements on the application of libertarian ethics. For example, trans people and their allies believe that gender affirming care is good and healthy. Therefore the government preventing gender affirming care is horrific overreach. However, a person who is opposed to transition would view puberty blockers as child abuse. They would say that gender affirming care for minors violates the NAP and it is the job of the government to stop those doctors. Similar fights arise around abortion, immigration, and other issues. This is the main cause of fights on this subreddit that I've seen. \n\nAnother common source of disagreement is Trump's recent actions. Those who are sympathetic to Trump view his cutting of various government departments positively. They see this as a reduction of the size of the government, which aligns with libertarianism. Those who oppose Trump point out that his actions are drastically increasing the power of the presidency. While he may be currently using those powers to do things that are nominally libertarian, the erosion of checks and balances to accomplish that is extremely dangerous. They would point out that mass deportations and building detention camps at gitmo matters a lot more than cutting USAID and the DoE. \n\nFinally there is the issue of astroturfing and brigading. It is a commonly held belief that liberals and conservatives infiltrate libertarian spaces to try to bring libertarians to their side. I don't know if that's true, but I do know that before the election I saw a bunch of blatantly pro-Trump posts and since then I have seen a bunch of accounts complaining about immigrants and trans people while not caring at all about civil rights and the military industrial complex. And that's the story of how I got banned from libertarianmeme.\n\nSigned, The Only True Libertarian",

The core tenet of libertarianism is private property beginning with the recognition of ownership of self and your own body and extending to ownership of that which is self-acquired and self-produced with that body.\n\nSocialism and communism deny private property rights, and the right of ownership of what is self-acquired and self-produced.\n\nThis means they deny the ownership of self, and someone who does not own themselves is a slave.\n\nSocialism and communism are totally incompatible with libertarianism, and are nothing more than forms of chattel slavery dressed up in pretty words to serve collective masters. Wealth robbery by the collective is just as immoral and unjust as much being robbed at gunpoint by an individual.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Hence \"conservative\", they're supposed to be the ones conserving American values that the founding fathers instilled. If you believe that a gay couple can marry and protect their Marijuana crop with AR-15s, you're halfway there. Why? Well... if you believe guns should have any sort of laws, you're not libertarian, period. Any gun law is an infringement on the second ammendment and conservatives are of with a little bit of infringement. If you believe gay ppl can't be married, PERIOD, you're not libertarian. Marriage is a religious ceremony. If your preist doesn't wanna marry you, move on to the next. No need to force them through government intervention. If you believe that marijuana should be straight up illegal or have any restrictions, you are not libertarian. \n\nTLDR; if you believe government intervention is necessary in any shape, form or fashion, you are not libertarian. If you believe we should have taxes, even if it's a little bit, you are not libertarian. The libertarian view on taxes is that they should be voluntary, PERIOD. So... charity. \n\nThere was this one government lady that would evaluate me every year and would always ask what I thought about the law. And I'd always say \"if there was no injured 3rd party, then no law has been broken. Everything else is a tax grab\" and shed always reply with \"so; no body, no murder\". I'd always break it down barney style for her until, one year, i asked her \"why do you always say that?\" And she said \"oh, it's bc there was a murder in my neighborhood. Everyone knew who did it, but there was no body so they never arrested him\". I told her, \"then it's a missing person's case. If everyone knows he did it, why don't they get a confession from him? He'll confess the murder if you get him drunk, they always do. Record him confessing and he's done\".",
