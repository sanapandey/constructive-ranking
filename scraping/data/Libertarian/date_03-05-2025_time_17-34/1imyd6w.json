Sounds like the government is protecting private property rights, as is it's proper function.I think it turns into a criminal, instead of civil, matter when you flee the scene or don't report it after a certain period of time, or are you proposing you have a right to damage others' property? \n\nThere are many examples of government overreach, but I don't think this is a good one.",

Then you would take your complaint to court and if the court finds in your favor then the government will help by enforcing the judgment.\n\nRight now even if you and the person who caused the property damage negotiate a settlement it doesn\u2019t matter since the law says they still need to go to jail.\n\nWorse is that since a settlement with you would be seen as an admission of guilt there is a huge disincentive for someone to work it out.",

I think this law applies to a hit and run scenario. \n\nThe offender wouldn't necessarily need to go to jail. Sentencing is at the judge's discretion, within legal boundaries. Language matters. \"Up to 6 months\" includes no jail time. \n\nIf you and the offender reach a private settlement, why/how would the government get involved, unless someone also tries to file a fraudulent insurance claim? \n\nProbably also need to read the driver's license laws in FL. You voluntarily agree to certain reporting requirements by obtaining and using a driver's license. (I'm not saying all of the rules are just).",

Another charge, tire marks on the curb another charge.\n\nThe government\u2019s incentive is not justice, it\u2019s revenue. \n\nLet\u2019s say that the tree is damaged enough that it would have to be replaced. That could cost anywhere from $1000-$5000 that money doesn\u2019t go to the person who\u2019s tree was damaged it goes to the government and so the private property owner is still not made whole even though the person who hit the tree might have had to pay $20k-$30k in fines and other fees.",

Judge would likely order restitution to the property owner as well as paying a punitive fine for not reporting. The fees likely go to cover court and offset investigative costs since the offender didn't turn themselves in or report the offense. Again, if the offender does the right thing and reports damage to private property this is all avoided. \n\nI still see this law as upholding private property rights after damage has been done. We're not talking about arbitrary fees for a victimless crime or \"crime against society\". \n\nI'm not sure where you're getting $20-30k fines from, I'm assuming hyperbole for argument sake. I've never seen a fine that high for minor property damage before.",
