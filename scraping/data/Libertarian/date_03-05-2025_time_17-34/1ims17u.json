    "selftext": "What went wrong with Russia and the West?\n\nIt has been often said that Germany doubled down on the idea that nations with strong economic ties would be able to avoid war and conflict, this was its strategy for containing future Russian aggression prior to the Ukraine war.\n\nGermany purposely made itself reliant on Russian gas and even took bribes in the form of artificially cheap gas it then exported to the rest of Europe at a profit.\n\nGermany, particularly under Angela Merkel, operated on the assumption that economic interdependence would act as a stabilizing force in geopolitics. \n\nGermany even turned down gas deals from other suppliers like Ukraine in service of this theory.\n\nThe idea was that if nations had enough mutually beneficial trade, particularly in essential resources like energy, the cost of war would be too high for any *rational actor* to bear. \n\nThis belief, rooted in classical liberal economic theory and sometimes attributed to a libertarian worldview, held that voluntary exchange fosters peace more effectively than military deterrence alone.\n\nSo what went wrong with Russia and the West?\n\nThe primary failure was the assumption that economic rationality overrides political and ideological imperatives. \n\nWhile market forces do influence decision-making, history has repeatedly shown that nations, especially authoritarian regimes, do not always act in purely economic self-interest.\n\n Russia, under Vladimir Putin, never fully bought into the notion that economic interdependence would prevent geopolitical confrontation. Instead, it leveraged economic entanglement as a strategic weapon--particularly through energy dependence--to enhance its leverage over Europe.\n\nIn this sense, Germany's strategy wasn\u2019t just economic idealism but a fundamental misunderstanding of power dynamics. \n\nUnlike Western democracies, where economic hardship can lead to political change, Putin's Russia is insulated from such pressures. \n\nSanctions, economic losses, or trade disruptions do not function as effective deterrents when a regime prioritizes nationalistic and strategic objectives over GDP growth. And when they're as pigheaded as the average Russian.\n\nAnother critical flaw in this approach was asymmetry. While Western Europe became dependent on Russian energy, Russia did not become similarly reliant on European markets. \n\nEnergy exports can always find alternative buyers\u2014especially in a world where China, India, and other nations are willing to act as economic backstops. \n\nGermany, on the other hand, structured its economy around cheap Russian gas, making it vulnerable when the geopolitical situation deteriorated.\n\nFrom a libertarian standpoint, this raises the question of whether free trade truly fosters peace or if it can sometimes be used as a weapon. \n\nThe answer lies in the difference between free markets and crony capitalism. When trade is voluntary and diversified, the risks of weaponization are lower. \n\nHowever, when trade policy is dictated by political entanglements--such as state-controlled energy monopolies--it becomes a tool of coercion rather than cooperation.\n\nThe fundamental issue, then, is not that economic interdependence is a bad idea. Rather, it was the overreliance on interdependence as a substitute for realpolitik. \n\nTrue stability requires both economic cooperation and strategic deterrence. Western Europe, and particularly Germany, learned this lesson the hard way when Russia demonstrated that trade relationships are not an insurance policy against aggression.\n\nA more resilient approach would have been to encourage diversified energy sources, ensure reciprocal dependence rather than unilateral reliance, and maintain credible deterrents. A process now known as \"de-risking\".\n\nInstead, by assuming that economic ties alone would be enough, Germany and much of Europe effectively disarmed themselves in the face of a regime that saw those ties as a vulnerability to exploit rather than a reason to cooperate.\n\nThe broader lesson? Economic integration is a tool, not a guarantee. \n\nIt can foster peace under the right conditions, but when dealing with actors who do not play by the same rules, it can become a liability. \n\nLibertarian principles of trade work best in an environment where all parties value voluntary exchange over coercion. \n\nWhen one side sees trade as leverage rather than partnership, economic ties can become just another front in a broader conflict.\n\n",

They can literally drink the vodka in shithole with no toilets and be glad that their army \"has liberated\" a village in Ukraine 1000 km away of his town. The only exception to this are Muscovites who are more aligned to Western values than periphery and live decent life.",

            "body": "Reminds me of the widespread narcissism or cosmopolitism or wokism in the west. We tend to think that there are not differences between humans and that culture doesn't matter. Western or German politicians probably projected themselves in the role of russia without actually trying to understand the unique perspective of the other party. It's easy to say these things afterwards though. It's a very often reoccurring theme in political failures that idealistic fantasies triumph over reality. This is true for big events like revolutions, socialism and also for smaller businesses like the nuclear deal with iran. An oversatisfied and mostly physically inactive human being automatically tends to lose grip with reality, because the energy doesn't simply disappear when we don't need to work hard anymore. Instead, it binds itself to the most fantastic and abstract ideals. That's why most people today still love nationalism, even if it's no longer ethnic nationalism, but civic nationalism. States and parties replace the national flag. And this trend is continuing, first the European Union and then global citizenship. A completely utopian, blatant distortion of reality. Evil is limitless.\n\nOne\u2014the smallest of the numbers. \u2018The One that alone is wise.\u2019 That is the infinite. A number\r which increases thinks that it is getting near to infinity.
