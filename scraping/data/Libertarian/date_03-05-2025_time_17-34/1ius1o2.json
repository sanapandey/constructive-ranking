They are massively price gouging the government. If we renegotiated those contracts, the GAO estimates say we could save $40 Billion+ per year. \n\nWe could also let the Medicaid Advantage plan directly negotiate the prices they pay for drugs, which is estimated would save another $20+ billion a year. etc. etc. etc.\n\nThat is not what DOGE is doing. They are just firing random people + Trump's enemies and pausing any program they can - especially if it is something that might be DEI related. Many of these programs and contracts will have to be un-paused, and this will cost a ton of money. They have already had to try scramble to rehire some of the people they accidentally fired who were handling things like the bird flu and our nuclear weapons. \n\nTo me, DOGE also represents the Executive branch massively increasing its powers in a way that is seemingly unconstitutional (the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse). Imagine if the next Democrat President could just cut military spending and use it to pay for Student Loan relief or whatever. It is a worrying precedent to me.\n\nFurther, there are going to be massive legal battles over this +  Labor Unions and Employees suing over wrongful termination.  I wouldn't be surprised if DOGE ends up costing more than it saves. \n\n**BESIDES** The Republican House Budget is estimated to cost **$5-11 trillion dollars** (it increases border spending, military spending and extends Trumps tax cuts for the rich). Even if DOGE saves $2 trillion, and the Republicans are able to gut $1 trillion from Medicaid and SNAP and raise student loan interest rates like they want to, we will still be like $3-8 trillion dollars in the hole.",
