Do you think the receipts of the millions upon millions of dollars we\u2019ve seen being wasted and laundered from the DOGE discovery are fabricated thus they are lying? I\u2019m confused by how even if nothing else came out of this massive cover up of incomparable misuse of our money it is still good and you should start boiling water to soften up those shoes. Transparency in and of itself is good. \nFWIW- I also believe that @abi_giggles is 100% right in hoping that henceforth tax money will be going to American and our basic needs rather than BS. \nI\u2019m just trying to find some solid reason other than disliking the people, some are so inflamed about the recent transparency discoveries.",

I don't trust them, because they are untrustworthy as evidenced by the parade of their demonstrable lies, half truths, and all around bullshit. \n\nElon Musk not only stayed in this country illegally, but he lied to acquire a massive loan from the US govt. I don't remember all the details, but I'm sure they're easy to find. He lies about how good he is at videogames, for fuck sake. \n\nAnd Trump? The grifter in chief? He lies like he breathes. Practically everything that comes out of his mouth is horse radish, and he cannot be taken seriously. It's why he loathes fact checkers. I feel genuinely sorry for people who have put their faith in him, because they're total suckers. \n\nAnd upon first meeting, I now know not to trust anything said by the new press secretary. The second she said \"condoms in Gaza\" it was over. \n\nAnd besides, even if those \"discoveries\" were true, the amount of money they're talking about is a drop in a bucket. That \"crap\" they're spending money on is like me buying a hobo a nipper one time. I'm not against charity. I also consider some of the aid that's being provided as matters of national security, so I personally don't think suddenly stopping aid to combat HIV in Africa is the best idea. Not only does it mean shittons of babies being born with HIV, but it increases the potential for its spread, and that includes spreading to the United States. Just as an example. Actions have consequences, ya know. \n\nIf they were serious about cutting spending, they would look at the military. That's it. Period. The end. They're not gonna do that.",

GUFFAW. Like a third of eligible voters didn't even show up, and the race was so close, the only reason he won is because a group of extremely determined Republicans went on a campaign to disenfranchise Democratic voters by getting their ballots thrown out via some weird ass loophole. Look it up. That's reality. \n\nMaybe not a \"vast majority\", but definitely a majority of Americans did not actually vote for Mango Mussolini to give Elonia Musk unfettered access to, like, the whole shit where he just so happens to have several govt contracts. Before Trump gave it to him, he couldn't even get the highest security clearance at space x, because he's too much of a threat to national security due to his connections to China.\n\n I don't trust him. This loser tells lies, some of them quite embarrassing, and you don't become a billionaire by being an honest, altruistic person. I've never witnessed something this flagrantly corrupt happen right before my eyes, all shoved in my face before. So disrespectful.

The project cost the tax payer $55 million \u2014 and when it reopened you could truly barely tell that they did anything but they boasted it was a huge success. Like, where tf did the $55M go??

Do those grain fields just rot (why would they harvest it if there was no one to sell it to)? And, Musk should start with himself if he wants to show some responsibility: He receives billions from the Federal Government in terms of corporate welfare - he should start by cutting this (after all, if a business needs government subsidies to remain in business, then that is not a good business model).",

I think we can all agree that spending and taxation should be tied to representation and that is what our founding fathers fought for. \n\nBut what happens when congress becomes so corrupt that it no longer represents the will of the people, but rather the will of themselves? There are checks and balances for a reason. Thankfully, our founding fathers had the foresight to create them. I see doge as a check given by the executive branch. Doge isn\u2019t legislating, nor do they have financial control. The intended purpose is to bring to light all of the frivolous, corrupted, and wasteful spending that would otherwise go unchecked. The goal is to hold congress to accountability on transparency - because they will not and have not done it themselves. That is what the American people want in 2025, that is the will of the people. To know how and where our tax dollars are actually being spent. So, my argument looking at the totality of federalist papers and constitution is that it\u2019s not unconstitutional, albeit controversial.",

Unions are like government where the organism/organization itself wants to survive aka the leadership. I agree the organization aka union desperately want to survive. For example, if the Union was offered something in a contract that was of exceptional benefit to the membership but it was hinder the union power or leadership the leadership would never go for it or even present it to the membership.\n\nAn extreme example would be if you offered a blank check to XYZ union but told them they needed to redefine whom they represented and those that it represented needed to fit in the bubble of \"only those employees who are currently employed with ABC Agency/organization.\" The Union would refuse because this would take away their power or influence.\n\nHowever much of the membership (People) if they knew about this offer would love a blank check.",

Again with the ideological inconsistency. If you're a libertarian, why should the US go around assassinating foreign generals? Weren't you *just* complaining about the US sponsoring coups? How is this any different?\n2. If the president is completely unpredictable, that doesn't change anyone's calculus. They might as well do whatever they were going to do anyway. Having a president that is *predictably* harsh would be more likely to influence peoples' decisions.\n3.

These private contractors are allowed to lobby and spend in elections (and legally should be allowed to lobby and spend in elections as private companies) but are difficult to get rid of once they're part of the system. For example, if your county government is undergoing a fiscal crisis and tries to save money by outsourcing legal services to a private law firm... what recourse does the county have to bring those services back in-house if they learn of financial fraud or abuse? If your spending is already high, which is why you need to \"shrink government\" and cut services, how is the county even going to be able to afford to do that?\n\nI think the view many people have of DOGE is deeply naive. Elon Musk is one of the largest government contractors and is clearly more interested in raiding the government for U.S. Treasuries to funnel to Tether to stop a crypto crash and instability that he helped cause himself (https://beincrypto.com/tether-13-billion-net-profit-2024/). \n\nThe failure to provide any answer to the question of corporate corruption and abuse is the number one sin of the Libertarian Party, especially when the most egregious examples of it are by private prisons and prison healthcare contractors, including prison contractors operating at the border that funneled hundreds of thousands to Trump's 2024 campaign. I understand people wanting to be careful about regulations, but that's a totally different problem than refusing to enforce good contracts or defend the rule of law.",

Certainly hasn\u2019t been libertarians moving the needle much, until maybe now.\nYes it would be nice to have had Congress actually dismantle some agencies long before now instead of the usual net two a year.

I expected DOGE to get caught up in all kinds of bureaucratic red tape, get blocked by special interest groups in both parties, and accomplish little to nothing.

Moving this fast, I'm sure they're crossing some lines and not quite doing everything by the book, but I now see that may be the only way shrinking government could ever actually work.\n\nThough as for doing things by the book, they clearly planned this carefully in advance. Consider the \"submit your resignation now, still get paid through September\" offer to federal employees. Offering genuine official severance packages would require Congressional funding, and asking Congress to act slows everything down. However, federal employees' regular salaries are already fully funded by Congress through 30 September, and Presidents can give employees time off. So legally this is just, email your resignation today, and the President will give you the next 8 months off! Legal. Clever. No Congressional approval needed. Too bad it only achieved 1% reduction though.\n\nI wonder if any of this came by watching Milei in Argentina? He won the Presidency but lacked support in Congress, so had to limit his *afuera* chainsaw actions to things the President can legally do. It turns out that's quite a lot.",
