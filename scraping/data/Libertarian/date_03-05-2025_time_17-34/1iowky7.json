If forced labor for criminals was defined in the law, that might be perceived as a binding liability agreed upon\n\nI guess the issue is that the person should start hurting others less, or just dont hurt others if u dont wanna be rented to a company during ur sentence i suppose",

If citizenship is a contract, then penal labor is a contracted liability for criminals. You can say \"but i dont like it\" sure but thats not really an argument. The goal is to save innocent people from captivity\n\nPeople wont be put in 'prisons' without taxpayers permission, bcs that would be the slavery of taxpayers. You dont ask consent from taxpayers before funding prisons, why should i pay for your prison stay? I dont even know you\n\nNevertheless, in penal labor scenario, you are still free to rent a criminal, put him in a room in your house, feed him with your own money. That should give the criminal prison vibeees, nice",
