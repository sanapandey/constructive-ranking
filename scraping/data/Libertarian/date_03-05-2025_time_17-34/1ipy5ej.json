Only $20 trillion US dollars exist, which is about 60% of what we owe. All federal land cannot be sold for the $37 trillion the USA has in debt, at least not with US dollars. The USA owns less than $1 trillion in gold. \n\nAdditionally, the plan to increase the debt by $4 trillion in a single year would increase our debt to $41 trillion. \n\nThe USA and its citizens/corporations do not have the resources to purchase all federal lands. Foreign investment will be a significant part of doing so. Even if all existing USD and gold were spent to do so, a significant portion of the debt would remain. Obviously 100% of America\u2019s cash and gold supply cannot possibly be used to purchase 60-70% of federally owned land.",
