It would have to be a completely different arrangement of how much risk is created and who shoulders the risk.",

                                            "body": "Normally a loan is a win-win exchange. Whoever takes the loan out gets immediate benefit at the expense of long term cost. The loan writer gets long term gains for the cost of losing access to the money. Basically an exchange of the time value of money.\n\nBoth parties assume risk. The person taking the loan out could get consumed by interest if they cannot make payments. The loan writer is at risk if the lender defaults. These risks are hedged with collateral. Even for the borrower, the collateral is hedging risk because it sets an upper limit on the max loss.\n\nI understand you are taking on risk, but I don\u2019t yet understand why the private sector would enter into a loan agreement if there is no collateral. They would need to do something to manage their risk. They could restrict who gets loans, but most students haven\u2019t started building credit yet to evaluate that. They could restrict that loans are only given to those seeking high income degrees. They could raise the interest rates, so that they can tolerate more defaults. I can come up with several small ideas like this to make it more appealing for the private sector, but I haven\u2019t convinced myself that they would get over the fact there is no collateral. It is just too important in risk mitigation.\n\nSince I haven\u2019t convinced myself that the private sector would take on these loans without some type of government intervention, I think the only effect would be that less students have access to college educations. Many people might point to it lowering the cost of college, but I actually think it would cause the opposite. Universities are not good at cutting. If you think the government is bad at cutting spending, you haven\u2019t seen university administrators. They need to spread their fixed costs across the number of students that attend. If the number of students goes down, the per student price goes up.\n\nI am curious if you have other thoughts. I think my biggest sticking point is that I can\u2019t imagine a world where private industry takes on student loans",

Here are seven key reasons:\n\n1. Complex Bureaucracy\n\t\u2022\tMultiple agencies, including the Department of Education (DOE), loan servicers, and collection agencies, are involved in loan origination, servicing, and collection, leading to inefficiencies and miscommunication.\n\t\u2022\tThe DOE contracts private loan servicers, which can lead to inconsistent borrower experiences and poor oversight.\n\n2. Lack of Market Discipline\n\t\u2022\tSince federal loans don\u2019t operate under competitive market conditions, there is little incentive to improve service quality, reduce costs, or innovate in loan management.\n\n3. High Default and Non-Repayment Rates\n\t\u2022\tIncome-driven repayment (IDR) plans and frequent policy changes create uncertainty about repayment and forgiveness, making it difficult to manage the program efficiently.\n\t\u2022\tThe government often extends repayment pauses or modifies forgiveness terms, complicating long-term financial planning.\n\n4. Political Interference and Policy Instability\n\t\u2022\tFrequent changes in loan policies, such as interest rate adjustments, forgiveness programs, and repayment options, make it hard to maintain consistency.\n\t\u2022\tPolicies often shift depending on the administration, leading to uncertainty for borrowers and inefficient program management.\n\n5. Poor Loan Servicing and Collection Practices\n\t\u2022\tPrivate loan servicers contracted by the government have been criticized for misleading borrowers, misapplying payments, and failing to provide proper guidance on repayment options.\n\t\u2022\tThe DOE has struggled to enforce accountability among these contractors.\n\n6. Inefficient Debt Forgiveness Programs\n\t\u2022\tPrograms like Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) and Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Forgiveness have faced issues with low approval rates, poor communication, and bureaucratic hurdles.\n\t\u2022\tMany borrowers struggle to navigate the requirements, and many eligible applicants have been wrongly denied.\n\n7. Rising Costs and Ballooning Debt\n\t\u2022\tFederal lending policies allow unlimited borrowing for graduate programs and PLUS loans, contributing to rising tuition costs (the \u201cBennett Hypothesis\u201d\u2014colleges raise tuition because easy loans inflate demand).\n\t\u2022\tThe government bears the risk of unpaid loans, which ultimately falls on taxpayers.\n\nThe less government does, the better off we are.",

The federal funding accounts for like 7-13% of the total funding. The amount that is funded is not correlated in any meaningful way with the states total dollar spent per pupil, hurting your case they are \u201cleveling the playing field.\u201d It seems the money they send is a minority, just as the YouTube man said. \nFurthermore, the states actual [academic performance](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile?sfj=NP&chort=1&sub=MAT&sj=&st=MN&year=2024R3) is almost *negatively* correlated with dollar spent per pupil. I\u2019d like to highlight Idaho and Utah especially, who have very much embraced charter schools. So the whole idea we need the DoE to send all the poor states money to improve their education seems to lack and validity to me and my quick research, so I could have just listed to 1 minute YouTube vid.",
