The slave doesn't.\n\nYour most basic private property right is the right to own yourself. Everything else extends from that.\n\nI don't care if you are left right up down center or none of the above. None of that is really relevant or even that important.  But if you are anti-private property rights that makes you anti-liberty and anti-freedom.",
