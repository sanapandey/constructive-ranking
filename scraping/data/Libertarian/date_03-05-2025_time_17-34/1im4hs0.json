In the very short term, you may raise prices based on what you expect to pay to replenish your inventory (gas station model), not on what you paid for what you have in stock.\n2. Asset allocation is affected by inflationary expectations. Hard assets like real estate or precious metals may get bid up if people think the central bank is doing something stupid.",

Usually written an an equal sign with three bars.\n\nM is money supply, however defined- currency, various bank accounts, etc.  Variously described as M0, M1, M2, etc depending on what's counted.\n\nV is how fast it's spent.  V0, V1, V2, etc to go with the Ms.\n\nP is the price level\n\nQ is the actual stuff that matters- goods and services\n\nP adjusts up easily but down is hard and very painful and best avoided.\n\nQ is what the economy is about, up is growth, down can easily happen.\n\nM is the money supply.  It can adjust up easily but down is hard.  \n\nV is the catch.  It strongly depends on the behavior of the population.  It can be affected, but not controlled, by government actions.  Think of the the economy as a videogame with the Fed playing with a laggy mushy controller that drifts.  \n\nSo. Yeah.  The Fed is right.  The beliefs and actions of the public affect inflation more than government actions do.",

                    "body": "That varies from school to school. MV = PQ is a fundamental identity in monetary economics, yes, but the interpretations diverge. The public perception affects much but it is a *direct result* of Fed policies. \n\nFor example, the Monetarist school would fundamentally disagree with the downplaying of M in determining inflation here. The famous dictum \u201cinflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon\u201d says that sustained inflation is caused by excessive growth in the money supply. V fluctuates but it doesn\u2019t drift in an unpredictable manner over long periods, instead it\u2019s influenced by systemic factors like technological efficiency.\n\nCentral banks control M, perhaps not directly but through open market operations, interest rate policies, and reserve requirements. If the Fed expands M faster than the economy\u2019s ability to produce P and Q the price levels might rise. Here we see that it\u2019s a feedback loop and not necessarily up to random majority public perception or activity. Fear to invest during the Great Depression for example largely came from constantly changing and terrible policies on part of FDR and the Fed.\n\nSo even if V changes due to public sentiment it\u2019s not some mystical exogenous force beyond government control, but directly responds to expectations and actions on part of the government and central banks.\n\nThen there\u2019s the Austrian school which says the real problem is not V per se but the distortions caused by fiat money expansion. The critique sees inflation as a consequence of artificial credit expansion that misallocates capital and therefore causes boom-bust cycles.\n\nThey say that V is not an independent variable but a derivative of people\u2019s time preference and the quality of money: if people expect inflation, they spend more quickly (raising V) but this itself is a reaction to the Fed\u2019s monetary policies. They say the idea that downward price adjustments are hard and should be avoided is Keynesian dogma that ignores the need for price corrections in economy. \n\nThe mushy controller analogy ignores in this case the fact that central banks cause the distortions in the first place. \n\nThen there\u2019s the post Keynesian interpretations and the real bulls doctrine but it\u2019s too much to write. The point is that public expectations are an *effect*, not a *cause.*",
