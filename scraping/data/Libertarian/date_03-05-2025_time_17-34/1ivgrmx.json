Socialists, communists and statists thrive and upvote each other, and any disagreements about political issues that doesn't correlate with mainstream voices and the corporate media (and therefore very often leftists) gets downvoted into oblivion. \n\nThis is my experience after all. \n\nI love to have dialogues and debates both with people I ideologically agree with and those I disagree with. This social caste system Reddit inherently is with regards to the voting system, is basically a very orwellian way to create non-creative echo chambers and shut down dissident thoughts. \n\nIs this your experience as well?\n",

            "body": "I agree that healthy discourse here and on most social media platforms has been near impossible. It\u2019s an echo chamber everywhere I turn. I get attacked/downvoted in all subs- in ones that should be neutral, by liberals, by conservatives and even here. The only productive exchange of ideas I\u2019ve had has been IRL. I suppose this speaks volumes about technology and the state of modern culture.\n\nI find folks will go to my historical comments and make a snap judgment based on the ones they cherry pick. Then I get accused of trolling for just offering up a different opinion/fact or asking a question. Wild assumptions are made about my character, work/life experience. Cognitive dissonance is a bitch. A reader will immediately apply some sort of tone or dark motive when I\u2019m genuinely just trying to engage in adult discussion (I mean most of the time, certainly I\u2019ve had sarcastic moments when someone is over the top). I know it\u2019s all to protect the ego, but damn it\u2019s exhausting.\n\nI\u2019ve historically been a left of center thinker, but I\u2019d identify myself as independent since becoming disillusioned with politics/media/modern culture about 10 years ago. I\u2019ve been lurking around your group because I\u2019m interested. I understand the basic principles of libertarianism but can\u2019t really picture how a true libertarian society would play out in our country. In all honesty, I have some fears but I understand that\u2019s human nature when it comes to the unknown. \n\nAnyway, I share all that in hopes you folks will welcome my participation. True wisdom is knowing the extent of my own ignorance. So I intend to be respectfully open to your ideas and input and hope you\u2019ll do the same.",

Libertarians are 80% male, higher in reactivity, score lower in overt empathy, and have slightly higher IQs.\n\nMy POV: true Libertarians are not centrists. They care about consent, liberty, private property, free markets, proportional rewards, and non aggression. That\u2019s about it. It\u2019s an awesome political persuasion when you are surrounded by like minded people, but because it IS a minority of personalities that gel with it, it won\u2019t happen.",

No one wants to talk to you when that is what they see.\n\n\nPeople on the right, and that includes the libertarians in this sub, do everything you accuse the left of, just in their own subs. How can you expect the left to come to the table with good faith discussion when the right refuses to as well?\n\n\nInstead of complaining about it, be the change you want to see. Listen to the left honestly and actually hear what they have to say and then give a good faith response. You may get some people who won't discuss in good faith, but you will get some who will. And for goodness sake, please don't call an argument bad faith just because it disagrees with your beliefs.

Good moderators are essentially invisible. You don't notice the good work they do. \n\nThe rare bad ones are extremely conspicuous, because they affect you in a shitty and unfair way.

I think the issue really boils down to each individuals personal battle with and understanding of the theory, history, cultural moments etc. \n\nMost people, simply put, aren\u2019t engaging with these things on nearly the depth they believe they are. Insofar as any of us are engaging deeply, that brings us to unique conclusions that serve as our launching points into conversation. This means that we are all coming at every conversation from a vastly different starting place, but the conversations typically neglect that reality. We end up clashing at some weird mid point, neither person being able to see or understand the core of the other.\n\nObviously people with similar foundations are goi g to coalesce into specific communities, where they find relatively greater understanding with other member of these communities. These groups are going to have varying cultures and approaches that will reinforce certain aspects of thought and will reinforce certain styles of communication. Most people aren\u2019t going to be engaged with communities across the spectrum enough to understand the thinking, culture, and communication of groups they disagree with. This creates a gap between people and there\u2019s a lot of ground to cover before productive conversation can be had.\n\nI think most of the misunderstandings come from lacking not only a depth of knowledge of the opposing foundational thought, but also our own. This is probably the case with the universal healthcare issue. You have your set of moral and ethical foundations, I have mine, and somebody else has another. When we engage on a conversation about health care, we are doing just that: talking about healthcare. We aren\u2019t talking about the moral and systemic foundations which frame the way we view the issue.\n\nMost people simply aren\u2019t equipped to do that work. It takes a lot of time and varied reading across a broad spectrum of ideas and disciplines to develop a nuanced view of those things, and that is uncomfortable to do.",

Online groups are a little harder to find genuine discussions overall.

Sometimes it\u2019s forced by the \u201cno true Scotsman\u201d fallacy, even here there are sometimes arguments about what qualifies someone as a real libertarian when the definition isn\u2019t even solid. \n\nAll of that leads to people that do have differing opinions to leave, further concentrating those who are more extreme. In leftist spaces for example, liberals who are left leaning get bullied out a lot for not understanding leftist ideology. This leads them to not want to pursue more info since they were denied genuine discussion and ridiculed.",

I'm an average Joe with a background in forestry/biology and currently self employed as a farmer. I'm not an economist or well versed in the theories you mention so I'll have to give it a google to educate myself. My basic philosophy is that some services should not be run for profit as I think it can lead to human right violations (for profit prisons) or a lack of quality care for all citizens, such as Healthcare or the postal service. If it's not profitable to operate a hospital or post service in a small or remote community then the private sector won't do it, or at least not well. I'm ok with providing taxes for these types of services so people in my community are cared for, even if it's less efficient than privately run.\n\nThe goverment should enforce anti-trust laws and prevent monopolies, I think competition from businesses is a good thing. But that doesn't currently happen, big business has bought out goverment officials. I think workers should have the right to organize and collectively bargain, I don't think minimum wages work. I think borders should be open for the most part and the state should not restrict movement of people. I'm a gun owner but don't think it should be a free for all. Banning guns won't solve anything, there are other underlying social issues that lead to violence such as lack of healthcare and economic opportunities. I could go on but you get the gist.",

That has been removed from Reddit and it appears that is being scrubbed from the internet.
