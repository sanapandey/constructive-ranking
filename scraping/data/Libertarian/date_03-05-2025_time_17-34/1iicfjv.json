    "selftext": "[OFFICIAL STATEMENT] English translation: The president's office informs that President Javier Milei has made the decision to withdraw the Argentine Republic from the World Health Organization. \nThe WHO was created in 1948 to coordinate responses to global health emergencies, but it failed in its greatest test: it promoted quarantines without scientific support when it had to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\nThe quarantines caused one of the greatest catastrophes in world economic history, and according to the Rome Statute of 1998, it could be classified as a crime against humanity.\nIn our country, the WHO supported a government that left children out of schools, left hundreds of thousands of workers without income, led hundreds of thousands of businesses and small businesses to bankruptcy, and still cost us 130,000 lives.\nToday the evidence indicates that the WHO measures do not work because they are the result of political influence, not based on science. Furthermore, it has confirmed its inflexibility to change its approach, and far from admitting its mistakes, it chooses to continue assuming roles that do not correspond to it and limiting the sovereignty of countries.\nWe must rethink from the international community why there are supranational organizations, financed by all, that do not meet the objectives for which they were created, they are dedicated to international politics and seek to impose themselves above the member countries.",

In future instead of having several hundreds CDCs the WHO could standardise medical procedures to make conducting business easier. Also if Libertarians are pro free trade than the WHO is the only thing that somehow keeps everything a bit safe, in a purely isolationist libertarian world without WHO, you would have measles infested third world countries with horrible health standards that would damage everyone. \nIts like routine check ups and preventive medicine actually costing less than curing smth after doing nothing.\nPlease don\u2019t downvote as Reddit does not care about free speech and has karma points to not let people ask critical questions, better prove me wrong.\n\nEDIT1: On the other hand, I can see your points. WHO becomes useless as an illness gets to a country, a more regional health department becomes a lot better at management here as it knows how the country \u201cworks\u201d and regional specifics and thus can allocate resources more efficiently (thats why I\u2019m also against world government, it would be tempting to have one set of regulations for everyone and basically have the whole earth as one market but at such heights governments just become inefficient with today\u2019s technology (imagine having a more or less functioning centralised country the size of India during the middle Ages, one reason people had feudalism). \nBack to the point , WHO is efficient in helping countries COORDINATE their strategies on a worldwide scale (not control the countries but plan together). \nOn another note. Many leftists put neolibs/soclibs and libertarians in one basket, while its true that many things overlap, issues like WHO show the difference: Neolibs see the government as one of the pillars of liberty and think that WHO helps free trade to flow easier and creates some kind of \u201cbase level\u201d that helps to save costs.",

He states the WHO was created to coordinate responses with global health emergencies, and that they called for global quarantines without scientific data.\n\nBreaking it down a little\n\n1. \"Global health emergency\" - I believe that at the time, the scattered pieces of information the WHO and governments had about COVID (seemingly easy to spread , affects different people possibly leading to death, no testing, no data, no vaccine, unknown effective treatments, etc), was a global health emergency. If you don't know anything about a virus that is spreading uncontrollably, and the prognosis is uncertain (no symptoms, severe symptoms, death, loss of senses, etc) , then it should be quarantined to allow experts to GET more data.\n2. \"Coordinated\" - I think they did coordinate action. They called for governments to impose quarantines.\n3. He estimates his country experienced 130,000 deaths. Could it have been more had there been no quarantine? I'm not any sort of a medical expert, but I in post-mortem, I wouldn't believe it'd less than 130,000.\n\nNobody likes to submit to the government. I get it. But, we're only as intelligent, strong, effective, etc as the weakest link. And if weakest link think that COVID virus is indeed not a real thing, then *~~that's how the government should treat it at first takes~~* at first take the government should treat it as 'deadly' and react accordingly to the weakest links by imposing quarantines and trying to get a handle on it before things get worse.",

But I believe they did recognize the contagious aspect, and reportedly people were dying or experiencing effects requiring ICU-level hospitalization.\n\nI could make the analogy about soldiers in a base area. If there's a sniper firing upon soldiers while they're walking about conducting normal-ish business, what would we expect the soldiers to do? Take cover, communicate, try to figure out where fire is coming from. What I wouldn't think they should do is continue about their business, walking about without cover.\n\nIn similar fashion, a virus was spreading through the country at a surprising rate. \"Where did it come from? How is it spreading? Why are only some people experiencing severe symptoms and others not? Not everyone exhibits symptoms but can still carry the virus!?\" To me that is good criteria to hold down the fort, quarantine, and figure out what the crap is going on.\n\nAgain, I'd prefer people have their freedom of handling their own business. But, as we  should acknowledge, not just with COVID, but in general. In a lot of civil/social behavior people just don't act accordingly to the threat. I still find people STILL don't wash their hands after using the toilet in public settings; mainly males, since I use the male washrooms \ud83e\udd2a. People still sneeze into their palms, pick their nose, cough without covering, and then go about using their shopping cart. It's nasty. I'm not a germophobe, but the most important thing I learned coming out of the whole 3-4 year ordeal was to avoid touching my face when out in public areas.\n\nYes, I can just go on with washing my own hands and minding my own business. But when people are out in public, I feel there should be a common or basic behavior to practice a good level of hygiene. By not doing so, it then becomes the business of the public, and the public business is the business of the government.\n\n\\*edited\\* for grammatical and spelling issues",
