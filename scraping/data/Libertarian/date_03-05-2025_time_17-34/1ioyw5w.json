These are held by companies all over the world, foreign and domestic individual investors, and foreign governments. From Investopedia, Japan owns $1.1T worth of US government debt, China and the U.K. each own over $750B, and it decreases from there. Another article I found said that about a third of the government\u2019s debt is held by foreign governments.",

Theoretically, I\u2019m sure the debt could be reduced by allowing bonds to be directly redeemable as tax payments from individuals and businesses or something like that. I just don\u2019t know (a) if it would make a difference in how the government operates or (b) if there\u2019s any incentive to figure that system out. Honestly, something like that might lead to more spending because suddenly the debt number went down even if nothing changed in real terms.",
