    "selftext": "EDIT: Disclaimer - I am NOT stating that they should be invaded, or that any agency shouldn't support them in *this* war, I'm more stating that it's logically possible to be against the invasion of Ukraine and also anti-Ukraine.\n\nI understand the sort of support for Ukraine, as a proxy for being anti-Russia. I can understand and even appreciate this.\n\nI also understand support for the Ukrainian people who are victims of war.\n\nBut what are the *positive* reasons that people support the nation, Ukraine, in their fight to keep their national border as it is against Russia?\n\nBut by all measures and understanding, Ukraine as a nation-state is not very progressive, liberal, or democratic, or well managed, or tolerant, etc.\n\nI'm citing this *merely* as a shorthand to express their problems quickly: they rank outside the top 100 on every \"Human Freedom Index\" published by major thinktanks. \n\nWaging war is an absolute wrong for me, and so whoever is being invaded, Russia should be held accountable.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that one has to become a diehard fan of what previously would be someone's 120th favourite nation-state when it's invaded by their like... 150th favorite.\n\nAm I missing some *positive* qualities of *Ukraine* outside of the nation being victims of Russian aggression?\n\nI would like to imagine it's mostly support of Ukrainian people who are being attacked,  but there's an odd amount of support for Ukrainian Governmental leadership that I see as well.

            "body": "My sympathy (European living in the US) besides the whole \"their territorial integrity is being threatened by an authoritarian state\" thing is simple... Ukraine has over the last decade or so, actively worked to shift away from post-Soviet corruption toward Western values of economic freedom, justice reforms, curbing corporate raiding, implementing land market reforms, strengthening democracy, and diversifying trade away from Russia.\n\nThey were clearly on a path toward re-aligning with Western and European values. Is it a perfect country? By all means absolutely not\u2014there remain significant problems, but they were making meaningful progress and essentially got invaded for it.\n\nThe contrast between Ukraine fighting for the right to determine its own future and Russia's authoritarian model couldn't be clearer. They're part of the broader Western community, so naturally I care more about their fate than if this were happening in a distant region. Was I particularly focused on Ukraine before the war? Probably not. Has the Russian invasion changed that? Absolutely",

And even if they could, with what Navy and Air Force? They don't have any bases or allies in the Americas, their Navy is . The US is the only country with a supercarrier, and we have ELEVEN of them. Our Navy has the second biggest Air Force in the world, behind the US Air Force. And we spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined. Our military budget is literally half of Russia's entire GDP, which is less than Italy's, which is like 4th or 5th biggest in Europe. None of this even touches the difference in land forces and capabilities. Nor, does it suggest Europe would literally do nothing if Russia tried to invade the US. Just because we're not in a military alliance with each other doesn't mean we won't help each other out occasionally. Were we in a military alliance with Britain and France before WW1 and WW2 before helping them out?\n\nSo where will this Eastern Front threat come from? Maybe if they send Chuck Norris like u/orwll suggested.\n\nAs for China, there is a MUCH bigger threat from them, which is a big reason why we're trying to pivot our energy and resources to the Western Front. However, most experts don't even think they can invade Taiwan. WHICH IS RIGHT OFF THEIR COAST. If they can't even do that, how the heck will they invade across the Pacific, which is twice as big as the Atlantic? They are now the second richest country in the world (although it takes them 2 billion people get close to our 300 million). If you're genuinely curious about their military which is much more formidable than Russia's I'd encourage you to do some research.",
