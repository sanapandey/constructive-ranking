Also, with the Israel military having a lack of personnel to cover all of Israel's borders, wouldn't it be to their benefit and safety for the US government to offer AID and protection to them?\n\nDifferent approach, if you moved into a region where you eventually found out that those who lived there before you are extremely hostile to outsiders and those hostile inhabitants often threaten your livelihood, life, liberty, family, and property slowly breaking down all of those five things, plus your mental state. Wouldn't it be wise to do what you have to in order to protect yourself and those around you from harm and enslavement? Slavery in the Middle East outside of Israel is legal in the other Middle Eastern nations (a statement, not necessarily a fact; a quick Google search can either validate or discredit my statement). \n\nDon't the violent prey upon the weak? If the weak doesn't seek out protection from the strong, will they not meet a tragic end? The US government/military comparably is a very strong nation to Israel, which hasn't been around for eighty years. If the strong doesn't help out the weak, how are we any different from those who prey upon the weak?",

What is the point that bringing that up is even trying to address? \n\nAre you against the original logic opinion that says that America should not be involved in dictating future outcomes? Because it sounds like you do.\n\nBy staying short your silence makes an implied outcome.\n\n\"Because history justifies A...\"\n\n... then what? His original point is wrong and that America should intervene?\n\nHence why he brought up the interventionist. Which you denied. Either you implied that by negating his overall point, or your logic is wholly pointless and you are simply picking and choosing parts of words.\n\nOr you are disingenuous.\n\nI will note that is logically sound to blame both sides in this perpetual conflict because both sides have done actions deserving of blame. The OP can blame Palestinians simply because using history in a bloody conflict is arbitrary. You cannot absolve public acts of terror using context and calling it war. It isn't a war if the force difference is so asymmetric that one side has to use civilian shield tactics.\n\nThis isn't a war. It is colonial suppression and ethnic cleansing. The population is a sub-group of an asymmetric sovereign power.\n\nNone of this matters anymore because we are rapidly approaching rule by might. Might makes right. And might is derived from the mandate of the people, in this case, the popular plurality of the people of the empire.",
