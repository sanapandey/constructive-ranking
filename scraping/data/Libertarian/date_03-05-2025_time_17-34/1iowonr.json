Who's more likely to steal bread. So someone who's starving because they don't eat bread  (making someone working for the US government being the starving party starving is moronic as hell but I digress) vs someone who's fat because they love or is addicted to bread. \n\nHummmm really isn't the the win you think it is lmaooooo.",

It probably feels like I\u2019m particularly critical of trump. I am.\nWhen you have legal avenues and you ignore them, against law and the constitution, sign clearly unconstitutional EOs, and then demonize the branch of government who needs to check your power, we should all be against that. Elon and Trump are doing that so, in this case, I do think they are bad.\n\nI\u2019ll point out I\u2019m not even attacking flaws in their actual policy I disagree with but are completely within his executive scope (tariffs being one example). We could probably have an interesting discussion around policy and find things we like/don\u2019t like he\u2019s doing however, those aren\u2019t in active defiance of the constitution or court orders. The clear centralization of power and demonization from any disagreement or effort to check to their power grab feels like it has to be a non-starter\n\nThe third option is no be apathetic to founding documents or an administration that is trying to solve government overreach with historic overreach.",
