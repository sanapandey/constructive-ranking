I also believe that my beliefs have decoupled from what I see posted here and in other libertarian circles. What initially attracted me to libertarianism was the NAP, and, above all, civil liberty. Sure, less regulations, smaller government, less budgetary waste, and decreased involvement in foreign wars are great, but my main draw was the idea that every American should be able to live how they want without fear of anyone, including the government being able to stop them, providing they are not infringing on the rights of another citizen. I think that this concept is very popular with a wide spectrum of political views, but whenever I see libertarianism discussed, the conversation more often than not veers in the direction of the extreme, and I believe that turns a lot of people off. I mean, let's be realistic: we're not going to see large sweeping changes in policy immediately. We need to start with the libertarian ideals that also appeal to the masses, and make concessions if necessary in order to make libertarianism more palatable.\n\nAnyway, I know this is not a very popular opinion, so downvotes to the left.",

The reality of the situation is that Milei drew in a ton of attention to the ideology and painted it in a very good light, with real results to back it up. We need more Mileis, libertarians who are willing to work within the framework of society, if we want to make any real progress.",

Then you immediately follow with \"scarcity causes criminality in underdeveloped countries\" which is at least more plausible, from an economic, criminology or even a conflict theory standpoint. \n\nI'd argue that it's always TOO LITTLE FREEDOM that is \"quite bad\" and truly dangerous! Even in anarchy, a moral person who internalizes the NAP will not become a criminal, regardless of the total freedom of self-governance they enjoy. On the contrary, it's always locales where there is too little freedom that people become \"criminals\" (at least in the eyes of the state or what passes for it, and always in the 'malum prohibitum' sense of the word.) In either case, 'justice' and 'enforcement' are neither necessary nor morally just.\n\nIn many underdeveloped regions, the inhabitants are anything but 'free.' Yet, there's no shortage of order, hierarchy and tyranny - it just may not call itself 'the state.' Something to consider. And thanks for giving ME something interesting to ponder, too!",

Controlling Parenting\n\n* **Characteristics:**\n   * High levels of control and pressure to conform to parental expectations.\n   * Use of external motivators such as rewards, punishments, and guilt-inducing tactics.\n   * Parents make decisions for the child and provide little room for autonomy.\n* **Consequences:**\n   * Children often experience diminished intrinsic motivation.\n   * Higher risk of anxiety, defiance, or dependence on external validation.\n   * Lower capacity for self-regulation and creativity.\n\n# 2. Laissez-Faire Parenting\n\n* **Characteristics:**\n   * Low structure, minimal guidance, and a hands-off approach.\n   * Parents may avoid setting clear expectations or providing meaningful support.\n   * Sometimes mistaken for \"respecting autonomy,\" but lacks meaningful involvement.\n* **Consequences:**\n   * Children may feel neglected or lack a clear sense of direction.\n   * Risk of poor emotional regulation and underdeveloped self-discipline.\n   * Difficulty internalizing values due to insufficient guidance.\n\n# 3. Autonomy-Supportive Parenting\n\n* **Characteristics:**\n   * Encourages independence while providing appropriate guidance and support.\n   * Acknowledges the child\u2019s perspective and feelings.\n   * Offers meaningful choices and rationales for decisions.\n* **Consequences:**\n   * Fosters intrinsic motivation, creativity, and problem-solving skills.\n   * Higher psychological well-being and better academic performance.\n   * Stronger internalization of values and self-regulation skills.\n\n# Summary\n\nSDT emphasizes that **autonomy-supportive parenting** strikes the best balance between structure and freedom, leading to well-adjusted and self-determined individuals. **Controlling parenting** may suppress autonomy and creativity, while **laissez-faire parenting** can leave children without the structure necessary for healthy development.",

Well you're on reddit right now I'm sure you have no shortage of examples here. \n\n  \nBut Libertarianism requires both sides to kinda be less cult like and irrational about alot of things, especially on the less economic side of things like gay marriage, gun control, the trans stuff, etc.\n\n  \nEconomically, I disagree but still understand why people would be reserved about going full on Libertarian economically, I think those hesitations are increased quite a bit by the way we have ai now.

The idea of not having a vehicle for change makes them uncomfortable. A libertarian candidate doesn't have strong policies, they don't promise these big things because that would be an overreach, and irresponsible way of spending money.\n\nSo while candidates run off of these big promises that excite people, a libertarian policy isn't exciting, it doesn't get people inspired to vote, they don't get anything out of it. Most people would rather pay higher taxes and get healthcare not tied to their job, universal healthcare is an idea a lot of people like. A libertarian can't make such promises. A strong foreign policy, and a strong military force to protect American interests around the world is also not a thing to campaign off of, since that is not libertarian. \n\nMost people are comfortable with where things are, even if they whine about it. There is no revolution forming for one side or the other, people say strong words, but it is all just posturing. People are worried, even if they don't admit it, about the government growing, or shrinking. Change is scary, so even though a lot of people like libertarian Ideas, they don't want substantial government cutting. They mostly vote for who they think will deal the least amount of damage to their current way of life. No one liked Joe Biden, they voted for him because he was the safe choice.

For example, the party explicitly against the welfare state will immediately alienate people benefitting from things like social security, medicaid, etc. The other side of it is that the overton window largely dictates what ideas are reaching the average American. So, unless you deeply look into politics and try to gain an understanding of why shit is the way it is, you're really only exposed to status quo and status quo adjacent ideas that get propped up by the corporate media or other mainstream news outlets. \n\nI think the Trump victory is a good sign for us, as it is at the very least evidence that Americans are fed up with the status quo and opted for a more anti-establishment candidate, but I also think libertarians need to capitalize on the idea that Trump's plan of action is milquetoast at best and that libertarianism offers much better solutions to the problems he campaigned on.",
