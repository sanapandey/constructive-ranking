But before I can jump into anything I want to ask for assistance in acquiring the correct knowledge for being able to form proper educated opinions. What books should I read , who should I listen to , what should I study , where do I start? I genuinely wish to seek change and educate myself. Any help or direction on what to read and where to start would be extremely helpful.\n\n",

Hazlitt is more economics based and doesn\u2019t exactly fit on here.\n\nIf you look for these authors you\u2019ll find good books. I personally really like Hoppe and I think his speech called \u201cGetting Libertarianism Right\u201d is the best in-depth explanation of libertarianism and its logical conclusions. But if you want to get a good background I recommend a formal framework with Mises, Hayek, and Rothbard.\n\nWARNING: A great deal of libertarian history reading is opposite of the common narrative pushed. While some people will call it \u201crevisionism\u201d it is highly academic and more than that it is just a part of libertarian academia to challenge some (not all) narratives.",
