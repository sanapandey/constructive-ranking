Please look into it yourself, don't take my word for it. He's the glue that ties all the seemingly disparate elements of the current executive branch together, hell JD Vance quotes him constantly, but somehow quoting a literal Nazi multiple times isn't a red flag to some libertarians? Again, his words, not mine (although he's switched to calling himself a Corporate Monarchist now while keeping the same beliefs entirely).",
