Having said that, for the ills it may bring if it manages to ween the US public off its illogical support for the unquestionable commitment to military expenditure, and by extension scale back spending to reasonable levels, then it will be one of the greatest successes in post-war US government policy.\n\nThe US is one of the wealthiest nations in recorded human history but large swathes of its population experience living standards comparable to developing nations while their government spends $1tn on defense",

The US geopolitical interests in the region are well known but recent conflicts have greatly inflamed opinions and intensified interest in what has long been a divisive topic.  Whatever strategic direction they pursue won't go without some serious scrutiny and will have to weigh up how it will be perceived by their voter base:\n\n* Evangelicals (whom I don't consider Christian - they might read the Bible but they definitely don't follow the teachings of Christ) support Israel.\n* Far-right White Nationalists (the type that might align with a late 30s/early 40s European political party) are evidently anti-Israel.\n* Libertarians and similarly-minded small government proponents would clearly support a scaling back or withdrawal of military funding\n* I imagine a decent amount of moderate conservatives would at least question why the US would continue providing military aid to Israel while discontinuing it to Ukraine and killing off US AID. Not to mention how a $4bn annual military aid commitment to a top 30 GDP nation is out of step with a whole of Government approach to a reduction in spending.\n* The US public's general dissatisfaction with Israel's action in the war in Gaza. As much as the media portrayed it as a dividing issue, the public were fairly unanimous in their lack of support for it. This one is a swing issue - think it hurt Dems more than they're willing to admit\n* How any pro-Israeli policy would impact the rising suspicion that foreign influence is dictating US policy. This one less likely to be a concern for the cable news voters for obvious reasons but would be an element to consider for the new wave of voters that consume information from social media and other alternative sources",
