Additionally population density. The US infrastructure is a logistical nightmare. That Europeans don't understand just how big we are.\n\n* Dallas, TX to Houston, TX = 240 miles, 3 hours 15 minutes. \n\nWe have not left Texas. Oh, and that's \"close\". \n\n* Houston TX,  to El Paso TX - 747 miles, 10 hours drive time.\n\nWe *STILL* have not left Texas. Granted Texas is our 2nd biggest state, but in Europe it's cost effective to build public transit and infrastructure because everyone is close together. It is faster to go from Paris to Berlin, than from one end of Texas to the other.\n\nName the 3 most populous cities in any one Euro Nation. Chances are you could hit them all in a weekend. Now let's look at the top 3 US cities. Going from NYC, to Chicago, to LA. Would take 41 hours of drive time. Not including fuel stops, bathroom breaks, food, rest for the night. 41 hours on-the-road.\n\nSo yeah, when your major population centers are all within a few hours of each other, and the US is massively subsidizing your national security, kind of easy.\n\nAlso Norway specifically generates its wealth from oil.",
