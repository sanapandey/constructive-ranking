I'd like to get the community's opinion on people watching reels and having video calls in public without headphones.\n\nIn my opinion it's just outright rude to subject me and everyone else to whatever it is you're entertained by. Part of me wants to make this blatent disregard for everyone within earshot a capitol offense. However, I like to look at things in a logical manner. This is a public space and they are entitled to enjoy it as much as I am.\n\nThoughts?",

If so, do we need to determine where your private \u2019property\u2019 begins within a public space?  So, would that line be drawn where his sound waves hit your body/ears?  Would that line change based upon the distance between you\u2026 or should it be static, I.e. within 5 feet you\u2019ll overhear his phone even at a reasonable volume, but past that it won\u2019t?\n\nI always liked David Friedman\u2019s treatment of the NAP as relative\u2026 if I\u2019m talking on my phone in a normal voice nearby, the amount of sound reaching you probably wouldn\u2019t be considered a violation of the NAP by most of us.  But if I\u2019m blasting reels, music, videos, etc.  it probably is (as well as just flat out rude).\n\nI think public shaming is probably the way to go.  Or if you aren\u2019t worried about physical escalation, maybe sit down next to them and start blasting the Tibetan throat music alternated with your favorite sitar instrumentals.  Maybe some bagpipes as well.",

Just because it\u2019s a public space doesn\u2019t mean everyone in the world has equal access to it or can do whatever they want there. For example, a homeless guy doesn\u2019t have the right to do homeless guy stuff in a public school bathroom or go to a public park with kids around and do heroin or jerk off. Just because it\u2019s a public space doesn\u2019t mean there can\u2019t be rules. Unfortunately the space is owned by the government so there\u2019s no a priori way to determine what the proper rules should be, similar to how, given that public schools exist, there\u2019s no \u201cobjective\u201d way to determine what the public school curriculum should be.",

Or is human decency in public, part of the consent you give in being in a civil society?  Where does your right to be left alone clash with a person's right to be obnoxious?",

Capitalism requires some sort of state, there's never been a counter example. I've read like a hundred hours on the principle, I understand it pretty well, and I get the philosophy behind it. It makes sense in a book. But I don't see much use for it from a pragmatic standpoint. Not to mention how many hypothetical scenarios there are where the principle completely disintegrates. For example, someone buys up all the property 360 degrees around your house, and if you follow the NAP, you starve to death if your neighbor is an asshole.\n\nIn situations where it actually can be applied in real life, you can get the exact same solution just by following the most basic moral compass.",
