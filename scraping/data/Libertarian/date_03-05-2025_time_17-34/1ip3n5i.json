Just depends on what social media apps you are looking at. And in any case, that's not exactly an organized effort by the Democrat Party, but rather just... something that people do. \n\n>think the internet should ban 'disinformation'\n\num... have you looked at Twitter in the last couple years? Elon has been banning pretty much anyone he disagrees with, including journalists. but yeah the dems are trying this too, just in a more subtle fashion.\n\nI think while the question of which party is more libertarian/less authoritarian is up for debate, I think it goes without saying that neither party is libertarian to enough of a degree to be called a libertarian party. While the GOP has been campaigning on small government, they have also done things like restricted abortions, trans rights, and have been circumventing some limitations in the Constitution meant to keep the branches of the government in check, and thus, less powerful (POTUS can't meddle with funding, only Congress can per Article 1 Section 8)",

If one company banning people it disagrees with isn't disinformation, then how could you argue in good faith that any other social media platform banning people they disagree with is disinformation? Please clarify.\n\n>No, this does not equate to the Republican Party being libertarian.\n\nI'm glad you caught yourself before I had to call out the assumption that the Democrat Party lacks a single person who has libertarian values, which is obviously false.\n\n>State issue\n\nA state issue... that the GOP in those state governments restricted. Small government does apply to the state governments too, you know...\n\n>Libertarians don\u2019t believe in trans rights. Libertarians believe in\u00a0**individual rights**, and\u00a0**trans people are individuals**.\n\nLibertarians believe that the government has no authority to tell you what you can or cannot do with your body. Your body is your body, not the government's. And this applies to any individual, regardless of whatever they might want to do with it. I hope this is what you were getting at there, as letting one person get, say, tattoos or plastic surgery, but refuse to let another get gender-affirming surgery would indicate a significant contradiction in logic. \n\n>\u201c*LGBTQ+ people*\u201d do not get special privileges under libertarianism.\u00a0**They are equal**.\n\nNever mentioned special privileges. Rights != special privileges. When women won the right to vote it wasn't considered a special privilege, it just brings everyone up to the same level. Gay people winning the right to marry shouldn't be considered a special privilege either, as all it does is bring everyone up to the same level. Not accusing you of having that stance, of course, but it's strange that you are arguing against a claim that I didn't make.\n\nI am glad we were able to agree on some points, however.",

Instead, I find that the Two Parties in particular simply vacillate over time on the authoritarian/libertarian (small \u201cl\u201d) scale.\n\nI\u2019m in my 40s, so I can well remember when the Republicans were gung-ho for rampant censorship in the 80s-90s, and I can recall when the Democrats were actually anti foreign intervention and pro free speech. The Republicans used to be the arbiters of media and entertainment control; now it\u2019s the Democrats pushing for such things. Up until Covid the majority of the antivax and anti-Big Pharma folks were wealthy Liberals; whereas during Covid many Democrats would happily have supported throwing the unvaccinated into camps.\n\nYou\u2019ll rarely find a less tolerant or empathetic human than a \u201cLeftist\u201d encountering someone who doesn\u2019t fall within their rigid expectations of behavior; they support those who vote their way, and to hell with the rest. Conservatives never appear to be terribly strict with those individuals in their own Party who \u201cstray from the path\u201d; they behave the same way that Leftists do, they\u2019re simply more tolerable at the moment because they\u2019ve been forced to pull back from some of their more authoritarian dogma after losing their asses in the mid 2000s.\n\nI find little of worth in the \u201cLeft/Right\u201d stereotypes, and we\u2019re long overdue for a return to judging people on their individual actions and behavior. If we must stereotype, better to identify friend versus foe based upon how authoritarian they are in practice: If they\u2019re libertarian minded, we can agree to disagree. If they\u2019re authoritarian, they\u2019ll try to force their opinions upon me, and members of both Parties are happy to do so when they\u2019re in charge.",
