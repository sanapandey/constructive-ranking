    "selftext": "Why I think redistribution of wealth after death is beneficial for a purely liberal society. And why this particular type redistribution of wealth is not socialist.\n\nRedistribution of wealth, during life, sinks an individual's will to innovate.\n\nRedistribution of wealth, after life, is meritocratic.\n\nInheritance shouldn't exist. In a purely meritocratic (perfect) world, I shouldn't receive my parents' inheritance. I have no merit in being born into a richer or poorer family.\n\nIn fact, inheritance should be removed with an immediate effect: if you're born into a wealthy family, you have no merit in that, so the wealth should be redistributed to those born into poorer families. But this must happen immediately, right at birth. Otherwise, a person born into a rich family will already have had better opportunities in the 20, 30, or 40 years before receiving their inheritance (when their parents die)\u2014better education, better health, and generally a time advantage leading to a higher social status.\n\nThis would shift the focus from leaving a better world for your child to leaving a better world for everyone. It\u2019s a way to combat selfishness and think of society as a single entity with a unified goal (scientific development). It\u2019s a way to make everyone equal, but without the downsides of socialism.\n",

And anyway, people will always find ways to avoid inheritance, such as freedom of donation during lifetime or whatever.",

Merit is subjective and you are not more qualified to assign wealth based on merit than the owner of that wealth. Morally, it has the same problems as any tax.\n\nEconomically, it has the same effects as any tax on wealth. Saving is the base of growth, and if we all want to live better in the future, we need vast amounts of accumulated capital to make us productive. \n\nI saw you in another comment make a point similar to that of Piketty in The Capital in the 21st Century, implying that too much freedom will lead to too much inequality. To that I just ask that you elaborate, since I think you are mistaken. The value of what Elon Musk or anyone else holds is just the actual value of what they are expected to produce in the future, produce for all of us.",
