It\u2019s a swirling shitheap of misinformation, Musk\u2019s claims don\u2019t stack up with the numbers posted on the site and they keeps moving goal posts on the goal of the thing\u2026 first $2T, now $1T, and we\u2019re only about a month in? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if DOGE doesn\u2019t survive pst the midterms. Not to mention the conflict of interest, who\u2019s auditing Musk\u2019s business\u2019s contracts, after all he is the biggest recipient of government hand outs. Its only purpose is to provide a smokescreen to distract the media with sensationalism and satiate the wing of MAGA that want to own the libs. It\u2019s barely making a dent in the actual debt and deficit.",
