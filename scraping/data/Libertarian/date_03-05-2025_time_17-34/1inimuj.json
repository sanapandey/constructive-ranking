The only place in the world where it is a thing, you can live in many rural areas in many countries where the government doesn't care, but it doesn't mean that it values liberty. \n\nAs someone born in an underdeveloped semi-socialist country, the United States is the only place where liberty exists even if not so strong. Y'all may take the United States for granted but trust me that country is the best in the world. There is no country in the world where you can say anything (except calling for violence and giving threats) and not be arrested.",

In reality, a lack of government creates a power vacuum which is either filled by factions or an invading force, which can be extremely authoritarian and oppressive. Governments naturally come to be, and so you want a government where your liberties are paramount. The best thing a libertarian can do is live in a stable country with a government of the people and to participate in politics to help secure as many liberties as possible.",
