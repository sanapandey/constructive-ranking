Capitalism allows cost to go down, quality to go up, and accessibility to go outwards.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m a bit iffy on healthcare. Healthcare has inelastic demand. It\u2019s true that there is no true free market in healthcare, but even if there was would it actually be better? When people need emergency care, and it\u2019s a life or death situation, they don\u2019t have time to look up which hospitals give them the best prices. I think this is where socialism with publicly funded R&D serve as the driver of innovation could potentially be superior.\n\nSo I support trying out universal healthcare. I have a lot of trust issues with the government, but I trust them a lot more then the big corporations who is more than willing to deny insurance claims in order to make more profit. Frankly, there\u2019s a moral element to it as well. I think there\u2019s something deeply wrong if your motive to find the cure for cancer, is so then you can become a billionaire. Hence why I think it\u2019s better that the incentive for innovation in healthcare is to save lives (that\u2019s why we have the hippocratic oath). I think under socialized medicine we should still pay our healthcare professionals well.\n\nThe cost of drugs is a separate issue. On that the free market does work as once patents expire, generic drugs do radically bring down cost. So on that front we can let free market decide the price, but we need patent reform for that to happen. No more patent extensions loopholes and shorten the lifespan.",

One of the core function of government is to protect its citizens which is why we have cops, firefighters, and military. So one could argue that healthcare would fall under that.

Sure, the shelves in capitalist countries might be full, but what good does that do if people can\u2019t afford what\u2019s on them?\n\nUnder capitalism, the basic necessities of life food, housing, healthcare are commodified. They\u2019re not rights, they\u2019re products. And if you can\u2019t pay, you go without. We see this every day: families choosing between rent and groceries, workers unable to afford the very goods they produce, and millions struggling under the weight of medical debt.\n\nSocialism, on the other hand, seeks to prioritize people over profit. Yes, there have been challenges in socialist systems, but the goal is to ensure that everyone has access to what they need to live a dignified life. It\u2019s about creating a society where the economy serves the people, not the other way around.\n\nSo, while the photo might show empty shelves, let\u2019s not forget that capitalism\u2019s \u201cfull shelves\u201d are often just an illusion for those who can\u2019t afford to reach them.",

Let\u2019s not forget that in the 1950s USA, socialist policies like the New Deal played a huge role in reducing poverty, creating jobs, and building infrastructure that benefited millions. Programs like Social Security and public works projects were rooted in socialist principles and remain foundational to American society today.\n\nSimilarly, the USSR transformed from a feudal agrarian society into a global superpower in just a few decades, industrializing rapidly and providing universal healthcare, education, and housing to its citizens. Vietnam and Cuba, despite facing brutal sanctions and external pressures, have achieved remarkable successes in literacy, healthcare, and poverty reduction. China\u2019s socialist policies have lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, creating one of the most significant economic transformations in history.\n\nOf course, no system is without its challenges, but to dismiss socialism as a \u201ccatastrophic failure\u201d ignores the tangible improvements it has brought to billions of lives worldwide. The issue isn\u2019t socialism itself it\u2019s the conditions under which it\u2019s implemented and the external forces that often work against it. Let\u2019s focus on the successes and learn from the challenges rather than writing off an entire ideology based on oversimplified narratives.",

As for the USSR, it\u2019s important to contextualize its history. While it\u2019s true that the Soviet Union faced significant challenges and made grave mistakes, it\u2019s also undeniable that it achieved rapid industrialization, universal literacy, and healthcare access for millions who previously had none. The numbers you cite are often debated and lack historical nuance they\u2019re frequently used to dismiss socialism entirely without acknowledging the complexities of its implementation or the external pressures (like wars, sanctions, and sabotage) that shaped its trajectory. China, while it\u2019s not a perfect system, its socialist policies have undeniably lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and transformed the country into a global economic powerhouse. The idea of \u201ctrue freedom and liberty\u201d is subjective and often tied to ideological perspectives. For many, freedom isn\u2019t just about political rights but also about access to healthcare, education, and economic security areas where socialist policies have made significant strides. No system is without flaws, but dismissing socialism outright ignores its tangible successes and the lessons we can learn from its challenges.

It used to be that a single family needed just a parent to work a good or mediocre job and have the means to support their family, however now both parents have to work and still might not meet ends.\n\nMost Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, and it looks like the stigma of pulling yourself up and just \"getting a job\" isn't enough, and you'll need several or a spouse that makes more or equal to you just to survive.\n\nCollege (Which applies to the free-market model) costs thousands of dollars and causes you to pause your life for years just to study. While some companies may hire you without a degree, very many refuse to even for an entry level job.\n\nThis is the reality of American capitalism. We don't need to jump straight into socialism to fix things, but it seems some socialist/federal-leaning programs are necessary to prevent us from like, dying?\n\nI live with my parents; I wanted to go to college and get a degree to go into aircraft maintenance (about a month ago), but the uncertainty of our country's economy and the state of federal aid terrifies me way too much to take out loans and quit my job (Out of necessity to study) for school.\n\nThis isn't coming from a socialist or anyone in leftist economics, but like how would straight American Capitalism help any of these problems?\n\nEdit: This also isn't just my \"Capitalism bad\" take. There's good things that can come from it, but there's also bad things that come from it. I favor a system where there's a balance between welfare and a free economy, and these models DO exist just across the ocean.",
