These officials have been around for years, longer than most presidents even. They have a vested interest in keeping things running as is and keeping their department as funded if not more funded than it already is.\n\nIt doesn't require any grand collusion or supremely sinister motives it just requires a bunch of less than perfectly moral people to do what is best for them and the tools to do that (i.e. increase their funding, decrease checks on their power and increase the scope of their power). The apparatus with which they secure these tools is the state for without it they wouldn't have the peecieved authority to steal our money.",

She\u2019s never ran for or won election but she served in the state department of every administration from Bush Sr. To Biden with the exception of Trump. Doesn\u2019t matter if the president was an (R) or a (D), she was there, making foreign policy decisions, pushing for NATO expansion and orchestrating bloody massacres overseas. \n\nAnd while not as overtly, evil as fomenting civil wars and global violence, there are plenty of similar such people who make their careers in other federal departments. Agriculture. EPA. Health and Human Services. FDA. Etc. they are appointed and they all work on behalf of the industries they\u2019re allegedly regulating.",
