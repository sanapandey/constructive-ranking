MentisWave or MRH: Legacy address these points in detail if you'd like to hear the reasoning behind this in a easy-to-access format.\n\nAs for the question of defense and general protection in a Hoppean society, I'm going to have to refer you to \"The Private Production of Defense\" by Hans Hermann Hoppe himself, as it's a topic I can't explain without a wall of text.",

But let me ask you, if it is in human nature to naturally cooperate with people and taking advantage of others is very rare, why has there been conflict throughout most of human history? Why do we see conflict even in other primates? \n\nMy personal view is this; the human species is very competitive, and had to be because before agriculture, we needed large habitats. Severe scarcity was always lurking, so often taking others' resources by force was more advantageous than cooperating to increase productivity together.\n\nHowever, since all the revolutions in productivity we've had, it is most definitely more advantageous for all peoples to cooperate. Sadly, many people have a hard time realizing this. Just look at all the people promoting socialism and cheering when business leaders are killed because they are \"capitalist scum.\" Furthermore, I don't think private police, defense or arbitration would work. It would highly increase the risk of corruption and it would be impossible to deal with the free rider problem. But I suppose your suggested reads would cover that part.",

                                    "body": "To focus on your point on the inherent competition of humans, I completely agree.  I've found that humans will always find ways to disagree and fight with each other.  But this is exactly why I find the Mises Camp's natural law (or natural rights) to be such a good basis for de-escalating conflict.\n\nDemocracy's biggest challenge and failure is in trying to properly address allocation of resources, specifically when people disagree on where to spend those resources.  A single resource can't be used in two locations or two purposes simultaneously, so there must be a decision within a collective to allocate that resource.  By voting (either by direct or representative), we quickly run into the problem of mob rule, where a majority can decide a minority's lives without much input from those whose lives are affected.  Federalism, republics, and the idea of checks and balances all mitigate this issue without solving it.\n\nFocusing society on self-ownership and property rights of the individual almost completely defeats this problem (especially with the concept of the homestead principle).  Any disagreement on the allocation of a resource - let's use a car for example - defaults to the owner.  Only the owner of the car can decide how that car is used, so long as it doesn't interfere with the allocation of a separate individual's property.  Thus, he can't use it to ram into people, he can't use it to trespass, but he can use it to drive on a road that he is permitted on.\n\nDoes anarcho-capitalism work for this sort of society?  I don't know, but I can guarantee that a centralized government which decides what property can and can't be used for fails this type of society entirely.  As such, even if the government is not \"abolished\" (lol), it would be advantageous to shift it into a form that focuses on arbitration of these sorts of conflicts.  Basically, shift the fed into an organization of loosely associated courts that deal with property disputes, with an ethos that is determined by natural law.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, got a little carried away.",

Democracy is definitely a flawed system. I tend to think that in life, especially concerning human behaviour and interaction, there are no absolutes and no perfect systems, so you always have to look at the context and design your system based on the circumstance. My go to example is morality/ethics. People tend to think their ethics are constant and unchanging, yet people will clearly be able to find exceptions on the margins, and if really pushed, I bet most people could think up an implausible but definitely possible situation in which they might kill an innocent. Maybe if their children were starving and there was no other way to get food except for killing and taking it from someone (think apocalypse).\n\nBut I digress. Democracy is one of those imperfect systems that I think can be extremely harmful if used by itself and applied broadly. I do however think it's a necessary evil when it comes to certain things. I live in the Netherlands, where we have giant dykes, levees and even [one of the largest moving objects in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maeslantkering) in the form of two gigantic 'doors' that form a storm surge barrier. These goods and services are incredibly hard to fund privately since they are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, so unless it was publicly funded, they likely wouldn't be built. Furthermore, if they were built, people who didn't pay for them would enjoy the fruits of their construction. So in cases of public goods like that, including defense, law enforcement and arbitration of conflict, I do think they should be publicly funded and policy should be centrally determined. I do however think that these things should be kept as locally as possible. There's no reason why people in New York should pay for L.A. cops. That way, differences between locales can also develop, so that when you vehemently disagree with the way things are handled in one area, you can move and find some place where people's values align more with your own.\n\nNow, there's obviously some unclear issues in that 'philosophy', like, should roads be considered public goods? Well, I think the main point is that Western societies have gone in the exact opposite direction of freedom, and that that is the first priority. The founding fathers of the U.S.A. had it right to design a constitution that guaranteed freedoms through certain checks and balances on democracy, but where I think they got it wrong was to not limit the government enough--especially on economic issues. The first thing Western societies should do is to restrict the plausible modes of intervention of the government. Government should have ***NO*** role in the distribution of money. The only role the government should have is to guarantee the negative rights of each citizens, to protect them against each other and foreign threats. Once that is secured, I think local governments should be allowed to expand on, for example, infrastructure works, because those issues often concern public goods and issues that are much more economical to organise as a collective. How are you gonna ensure that the one guy who doesn't want to pay along with the municipal roads doesn't actually use them, for example? It's obviously possible to do this, but considering where we're coming from, I don't think 'forcing' people to pay for roads they'll most likely use anyway is too extreme.\n\nLooks like mine also became a bit of a wall of text, and quite rambly, but I hope it clarifies what I meant and I answered your questions sufficiently.",
