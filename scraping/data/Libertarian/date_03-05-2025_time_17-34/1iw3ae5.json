    "selftext": "I think a lot of our problems we're having right now stem from our inability to maintain the separation of church and state, and I think that can be traced back to first the invention of the radio and then the television.\n\n Those inventions gave the likes of Billy Graham and other televangelists of the day flocks of 10s of thousands practically overnight. Billy Graham started appearing on ABC in 1951. \n\nBy the time the late 50s and early 60s rolled around, televangelists commanded congregations of millions who faithfully sent them money. So not only did they build immense power, but they also built immense, tax-free wealth.\n\nIt was during these times that the battle against intellectuality really ramped up. This is when the Southern Strategy happened and Strom Thurmond and  the dixiecrats defected to the republican party because the Democrats started having radical ideas like maybe black people not being so bad and they should maybe end segregation and Jim Crow laws. So the most racist of the southern Democrats became Republicans.\n\nThe Republican party then became the party of God and religion moreso than they ever had been. This is because they had a built in voting block of millions through Billy Graham, and all they had to do was keep pushing for, and passing laws that align with southern evangelical interests and they could stay in power. \n\nAnd then it goes back even further. It's a little known fact that \"The Pilgrims\" or Puritans who came on the Mayflower, didn't come because they were being persecuted by a strict government.  They came here because they thought the government and Church in England weren't strict *enough* they wanted to come here and start their own, super strict,  God fearing society. These people were even against celebrating Christmas in a festive way. \n\nIt is also another fact that 1 in 10 Americans can trace their bloodline back to that boat. Now I think a lot of the descendents of these people became modern evangelicals and other strict fundamental religions. And it has been a battle to keep them out of politics for generations.  \n\nNow here we are after 60 years of them being in control of the Republican party, pushing for some of the most invasive laws we've ever known under the guise of being the party of \"small governemnt.\"  I'm afraid that Project 2025 is a culmination of everything they've been working for since November 11, 1620.",

I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t still exist but feels like a quiet shift to more libertarian ideas. One can only hope.",

There are others like climate change, environmentalism/conservationism(nature/forest/river/ocean gods) there are more but those are the most commonly discussed.\n\nMost people are not operating on logic that doesn't contradict.  Taxation is a forced tithing.  Voting, the stuff you do at the dmv ect are all rituals.  Thinking capitalism is bad, welfare good, central planning good, military worship, all of it. It's all based on contradictions in logic.(It's mythology and magical thinking)\n\nStatism is not logical. If statiststs gave up their contradictions they would be anarchists. This could be many pages for further detail. Idk if anyone has done a essay on this before but statism and religions are 1:1.\n\nThe social contract is criminal/slave contract theory rebranded.\n\nBack in the days of the catholic church people would have felt much the same about it the way they do government because it was the explanation for reality. It is the same as people now who think they need a government and there is no other way or can't imagine what things would look like without it without falling into statist propaganda and lies.\n\nWhen someone commits a victimless crime like driving without a license or doing drugs and the police kill them because they won't comply. That is religious laws. That is human sacrifice. People say all the time it is for society.\n\nNote society is an abstract concept that does not point to anything specific for most people.(the religious ones. Not everyone does it, they just don't realize what it is.)\n\nSame with the concept of god or gods. There is nothing to point at and go \"That is god right there.\"",

To me the whole \"statism\" concept is somewhat unkonown. \n\nWhat is your take, can there be a state without statism?   \n  \nI would like to think that we can have a state , a country, or some sort of a collective that follows the same rules, without those rules being written by a religion.\n\nThis is a very interesting topic, could there even be a libertarian state? or what would the extreme outcome of libertarianism be?\n\nThanks for your reply",
