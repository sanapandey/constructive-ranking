Every once in a while the mom on disability would come and scream at her daughter because it was her house and it was full of weirdos wandering in and out all day long.\n\nit was great entertainment for my dog. She'd sit out side all night long on the porch watching them. \n\nLike one evening they would decide that they all needed to do yard work so they'd start working on it at 10 or 11 oclock at night.  I'd wake up the next morning to see that the law was half mowed, a small trench was dug, there was a bunch of rocks piled up next to the driveway and the law mower was upside down and half disassembled with parts strewn across the yard. \n\nOr the night they delivered a broken down car at 2:30 in the morning to the street in front of their house, then the truck that was doing the towing broke down as well.  And then you'd wake up to see that the hoods were open on both vehicles were left open and on jack stands with, and a couple wheels were now missing with tools left here and there, and one of the vehicles never had its headlights turned off so those were about dead as well.  And they sat like that for a couple weeks. \n\nCrap like that was pretty much a constant. \n\nMy dog would sit out there all night long and just watch them or be watching them through the window as they moved around like little busy ants.  Like it was a soap opera. \n\nEventually the daughter left, the mom moved in, cleaned everything up and that was the end of it.",
