I worry about the same thing let\u2019s you and me do our best to be better representatives of our ideology than they want to paint us as. Here\u2019s a stupid example remember Pepe the frog ? they tried to paint him as a white nationalist, racist, blah blah blah, but the world claimed Pepe and now you\u2019ll probably see him more on Hasan Piker\u2019s and Vaush\u2019s stream than you would on a Nick Fuentes one. Don\u2019t give up the fight. Common sense is winning things like the Gadsden Flag need to be stood up for and not confused by the masses for a swastika or the confederate flag.

Left and non-authoritarian as can be on social issues.  My main gripe with libertarians are the ones who want to defund/privatize public education, the highest ROI program of any government.  \n\nThe Trump administration did 2 great things.  Cut taxes (Thank you democrat Gary Cohn who wrote the Tax cuts and jobs act) and end the wars in the middle east.  Everything else is an absolute shitshow disaster of lies and incompetence masked behind extremely performative political theater, complete with gross social liberty violations.  \n\nAlso, calling me someone on the left with the whole \"I see through your mask\".

There are tons of laws/regulations that go with/against this, that of course aren't being looked at/considered.  \n\nSince you laid out the differences between legal/illegal protesting, here is my take.  \n\nIf colleges and universities fail to manage protests ***that begin on their campuses*****\u2014allowing them to escalate into illegal demonstrations that spill into surrounding areas**\u2014then I can understand withholding their funding. If they won\u2019t help maintain peace, but offer a place for the disruption to start and spread, they shouldn\u2019t receive support. \n\nIf these institutions don\u2019t want to risk losing their funding due to protests, they have two options:\n\n1. Allow **peaceful** protests while actively monitoring and preventing them from escalating.\n2. Ban all protests because option 1 proved too difficult, and they prioritize protecting their funding over any issues the people may have.\n\nEveryone has the right to protest, but no one has the right to engage in unlawful or disruptive behavior that harms others, especially to those who are simply trying to live their lives and manage their businesses in the areas that are most effected by these protests. The message behind a protest doesn\u2019t justify harming others, and nothing spreads hate and division faster than people attacking people and businesses who might even agree with them\u2014all in the name of \"change\". \n\nbut something tells me........ someone.........SOMEONE is hoping on option 2.",

If you are arrested or assaulted in the process of a lawful protest, you can get the charges expunged and the officer can be charged with a crime if they assaulted you.\n\nMany lawyers live to fuck with police. If you were assaulted during a lawful protest and injured, a lawyer can help you get paid.\n\nKeep in mind that these protest rules apply to everyone. You might find they come in handy when a MAGA protest turns violent and we need to prosecute the offenders (as we did on Jan 6th).",

I fail to see how simply existing in a space and speaking somehow prevents aid workers from doing their job. Is an officers job more difficult when there are crowds of people? Sure,  same with a sporting event for example. But yes, my speech rights are more important than making law enforcement's job easy.\n\nEdit: to provide an example, if I am in a protest,  and there is some emergency behind me, it is reasonable for me to step aside to allow emergency services if asked. What is concerning is that I am expected to suspend my speech rights immediately, disperse,  or face life altering consequences.  If that isn't a direct threat to free speech I don't know what is.",

I think it would also be judged case by case on the individuals with things such as connection to the group protesting. For example, a more spontaneous protest that forms, but isn't organized by a group, would be harder to prosecute/demonize as a whole since it's just several individuals potentially with their own agendas. An organized protest held by a specific group would make it easier to hold the whole group accountable if crime breaks out. If a large number of individuals belonging to a certain group are all committing crimes during a protest then it would be easier to make the claim that the group supports these kinds of actions. \n\nThink Antifa holding a rally that turns into a vandalism filled protest versus a Facebook mom who calls for a march at the school board HQ in a couple of days. Both could potentially harbor criminal acts but the Facebook mom's group would be treated as individuals. Which they most likely would be. While antifa might show up in common dress code, with specific intentions, organized into smaller groups by either singular or collective leadership. \n\nMaybe not the best examples but I'm hopefully explaining my own opinion decently.",

Most of these activist type F1 students are a nuisance to many, I\u2019ve seen it first hand. Freedom of speech and protest doesnt come at the cost of others. \n\nAlso F1 visa is at will from the US govt, based solely on enrollment. Enrollment and the visa both can be cancelled at any time and the student will be de poo under the pretense of invalid visa/expired visa.\n\n\nI\u2019m all for showing your disagreement towards the government. But when foreign students enter a country; then protest against the same country, while being a nuisance for the citizens, blocking roads, stopping other students from studying and attending college maybe even vandalizing property and turning colleges into political cesspools instead of a place for study, I think they should stay at home in their origin country. Why did they come to America if they hate the policies so much? Did they come to study or protest?\n\nAlso no country has the obligation to accept terrorist sympathizers and supporters, supporting the Palestinians people is one thing, so is supporting the innocent affected by the Yemeni civil war. But sympathizing with Hamas or supporting the Yemeni aggression towards civilians is another, anyone that does that clearly outlines their biases and character and is probably not a good \u201cguest\u201d to have.\n\nIf they cared so much, they could apply for a visa of the country that they oh so support and fight there. \n\nCuz I am ready to die on the hill of liberty for what I support, but are they ready to give it all up for their cause?",

Think about it, of all the major protests and demonstrations in the last 20-30 years... how many of them have ended is massive police involvement with arrests all over the place and violence galore? And how many of those were Second Amendment protests? Exactly zero if memory serves.\n\nJust have to look at the Don't Comply charity in Texas. Something like 15 years ago their city made it a long and expensive process to get permission from the government to feed and cloth the homeless. The first year the charity fed the homeless the cops showed up and handed out tickets to the volunteers like candy. Thousands in fines racked up in a few short hours. Next year... the charity volunteers came back to do the same thing but did so while openly carrying firearms and ready to defend themselves. Not a ticket was written that day and not a day since then and they ALWAYS run their charity while visibly armed now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ABSyDOzFz0",

At that point they can be ordered to disperse, cease actvity, etc.\n\n**When Does a Protest Legally Become a Mob?**\n\nA protest is protected under the **First Amendment** in the U.S., but it can legally turn into a **mob** when it crosses the line into unlawful behavior. This typically happens when:\n\n1. **Unlawful Assembly** \u2013 A group gathers with intent to commit a crime, disturb the peace, or refuses to disperse when ordered.\n2. **Riot** \u2013 Violence, property damage, or threats to public safety occur. Many laws define a riot as involving **three or more people** engaging in violent or disorderly conduct.\n3. **Criminal Acts** \u2013 Looting, arson, assault, or vandalism shift a protest into illegal territory.\n4. **Failure to Disperse** \u2013 If authorities declare the protest unlawful and order people to leave, refusing to do so can legally classify the gathering as a mob.\n\n# Key Takeaway:\n\n* **Peaceful protest = protected**\n* **Violence or illegal activity = potential criminal charges** (rioting, inciting violence, property destruction, etc.)\n\nLaws vary by location as well as police policy\n\nExamples - a strike line .. when strikers block traffic, damage property, threaten others, disturb the peace  \nor at abortion clinics .. when protesters block people from driving into the parking lot or walking into the bldg, or cut tires on patients cars.\n\nWe would normally determine who is in charge of the protest and have him sit with us and explain what they can and cannot do. When they violate we would go to that person and try to correct it. Sometimes that works, but sometimes not (when windows are broken, things are in fire, bricks are flying)\n\nWhen things get out of hand we would declare an \"unlawful assembly\" and often give then XX minutes to disperse or cease the illegal actions.\n\nThe threshold for any of these things vary based on each case , jurisdiction, local laws, state laws, policy of police, policy of the DA.",
