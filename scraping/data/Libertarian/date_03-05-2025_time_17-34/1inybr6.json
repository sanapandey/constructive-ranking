Kennedy\u00a0initially created USAID through an executive order in 1961, and Congress later formally established it as an independent agency through the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.\n\nSo a president created it, then over 3 decades later it got its blessing from Congress. \n\nSounds to me like a president can destroy it and over 3 decades from now Congress can act on it if they want. \n\n\nThe Constitution has not been followed for a very long time.",
