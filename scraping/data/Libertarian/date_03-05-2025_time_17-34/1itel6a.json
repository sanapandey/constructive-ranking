Otherwise you hurt millions of Americans for nothing because as soon as they feel that \u201ctemporary\u201d pain they\u2019ll vote democrat and ALL OF IT will be undone. All of it. And then what? Try again next time hoping everyone forgets? The whole thing is illogical. We are on our way to a dictatorship with how much power is being centralized into the executive branch and you think thats good simply because the government is smaller? A monarchy is small government too, do you want that? This is being done all wrong and will not last. Unlike you and so many other \u201cancaps\u201d I want *lasting* change and to not turn the majority of people away from the idea of small government. Because right now? This is *exactly* how you do it. We need things like ranked voting to get more independents in congress and someday as president so we can erase corruption and get money out of politics. Only then will congress be okay with downsizing because then there is no incentive to keep everything big in government. But fine take your temporary \u201cwins\u201d if that makes you happy, but don\u2019t complain when they immediately get overturned in 4 years OR if Trump decides he\u2019s here for the rest of his life and we go full blown authoritarian regime which at that point any chance of liberty in America dies. But if thats what you really want, so be it. Let the billionaires and millionaire politicians they own rule and control our lives and tell us what is good for us. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re looking out for us and don\u2019t care about their own wealth, in fact I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll start donating their piles of cash to the American people and lower all their prices so we can all live like kings. Surely they won\u2019t use their power to enrich themselves. President Elon would never have ulterior motives to \u201caudit\u201d the fed using anyone but forensic CPAs. Surely nothing could go wrong. I mean seriously, this isn\u2019t the governments money, this is OUR money that was taken from us. And billionaires are stealing it from us against our will. Like social security- entirely funded by workers. OUR money. Slashing it will not reduce what is taken from your paycheck, THEY WILL JUST BE STEALING MORE FROM THAT FUND FOR THEMSELVES. They are NOT on our side. They want our money just as much as the fed but their motives are even more nefarious.",

This is how you turn everyone away from the idea of small government. People are overwhelmingly going to vote democrat in 4 years and ALL OF IT will be undone. And for what? Nothing! You think Elon is doing this out of the goodness of his heart? He\u2019s gutting programs like USAID that make up 0.4% of the budget. I\u2019m happy we\u2019re looking at the pentagon and defense budget next because 1 TRILLION is crazy and they never pass *real* audits. But let\u2019s be real, we aren\u2019t going to see a dime in personal savings from this. We\u2019ll be taxed just the same and more people are going to suffer while we save nothing. Don\u2019t let them fool you, this isn\u2019t saving funds- it\u2019s simply redirecting them to tax cuts for corporations and the billionaires who own them. Nobody in the government is looking out for our benefit. No. Body. Not Trump, not Musk, not any of his clown brigade administration, none of them. You\u2019re blind if you think there aren\u2019t any ulterior motives to their actions. How are you as an ancap trusting the government now of all times? They throw us a few bones and you bend the knee? You played yourself, traded one boot for another. I hope you know you aren\u2019t ever going to be in their club so don\u2019t expect to be spared from the avalanche thats coming.",

Good grief dude, how many things can you get wrong in one sentence?\n\nUnelected: just like every other dept head in the executive branch. \n\nTrust fund: His father is pretty wealthy but was divorced from Elon 's mother when he got rich. No evidence for trust fund.\n\nNepo-baby: how could be be a nepo baby when his father is in South Africa? They're not even in the same industry. His mother has no pull & was pretty poor. \n\nFascist: you're just making the word have no meaning except person I disagree with.\n\nhttps://marketrealist.com/net-worth/errol-musk-net-worth/",
