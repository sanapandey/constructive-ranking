There were no warnings, there was no opportunity for civilians to leave.\n\nThe fact that in the Israeli response there were warnings for civilians to gtfo or be bombed along with the fighters makes it proportional enough. If the Gaza military hides in civilians building, hospitals, mosques, or fight using civilians clothes, they bear the responsibility of civilians causalities. This is simply how the laws of war work. \n\nUsually when you fuck around, you find out.",

You wallow in your role as victims, while systematically demonizing the other side and your last sentence, oh my god, is so vulgar and irrelevant, it's downright an insult to the victims, whether Palestinian or Israel",

Along with that, it is a well known fact that Israel provided water and electricity to Gaza. What other countries provide stuff to a countries committed to it destruction? \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry my friend, but in this world if you fuck around you will find out. Germany found out, Japan found out, Iraq found out. U don\u2019t invade another country, kill people and expect that a response is not coming for your people. If Hamas invested its time in providing for the people of Gaza instead of invading Israel none of this needed to happen.",
