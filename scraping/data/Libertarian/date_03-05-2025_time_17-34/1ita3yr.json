If everyone suddenly disregards it, we\u2019re left with nothing more than a massive parasitic organization that terrorizes and robs people in broad daylight to sustain itself.\n\nAccordingly, one of the greatest threats to the US federal government is the potential for Americans to reject it en masse.\u00a0Our government is heavily invested in instilling \u201cthe state is everything\u201d worldviews into as many people at possible. Conflating threats to its political security with any actual threats to national security is dishonest at best.",
