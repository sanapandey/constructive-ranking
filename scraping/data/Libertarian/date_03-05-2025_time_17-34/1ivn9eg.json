    "selftext": "That sounds crazy but hear me out for a second. I see tons of posts on this sub saying that the IRS should be abolished. If that happened though, it would reduce taxes brought in without reducing much spending and massively increase the national debt, which none of us want. Also, taxes fund what minarchists would call essential government functions like the courts.\n\nMy main point here though is shouldn\u2019t the focus first be on cutting programs that waste the money, not cutting the IRS which brings in money and therefore increasing the national debt?",

So all purchases, up to the federal poverty rate are tax free. You actually begin to pay taxes once you spend past the federal poverty rate.

They would still be funding the largest share because a 10% sales tax on luxury cars, boats, and other luxury items would add up to a lot more than the 20 cents they\u2019re getting from those in poverty. \n\nEven better is if they do a 10% sales tax on everything besides groceries.

You can expect a poor person to spend every dime. So if the sales tax is 30% you mail out a check to every American for $4800  (16k * .30). \n\nThis means you pay zero taxes on purchase less then 16k. \n\nYou don't need to monitor income or anything like that because every American always gets a check.\n\nYou can throw a couple grand on top of that to replace all of welfare.. food stamps, etc. And eliminate those bureaucracies as well. \n\nSo what you accomplish is:\n\n1. Eliminate the IRS\n\n2. Eliminate welfare bureaucracy\n\n3. Eliminate tax loopholes for the rich \n\n4. Eliminate billions of dollars wasted on compliance with tax regulations.\n\n5. Eliminate the vast majority of tax fraud.",

They have forced all financial institutions to essentially become spies for the government which monitors all your activity and is required to report on you for the mere appearance that you might be skirting some tax law. \n\nFor example if you move 10,000 dollars around they are required to report that to the government. That is the cut off point. But if you move $9,500 you might be trying to avoid the 10,000 dollar reporting requirement.. which means they are required by law to report on that as well.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nFrom Bing AI:\n\n> The tax preparation services industry in the United States is projected to generate approximately $8.015 billion in revenue by 2024. As of 2025, there are 128,252 enterprises in the tax preparation services industry, showing a 1.26% increase from 2024.\n\nThat is all directly from costs and regulations imposed on the American people by the IRS.\n\n\nMonitoring and reporting on the income and every meaningful financial transition  of this imposes horrific levels of cost, stress, regulation and spying on each and every American.\n\nAnd it is all completely unnecessary. Also it hides the cost of government.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAll of this could be replaced by flat sales taxes.  \n\nAlaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming already have no income tax. All of them operate just fine without them. Going from Georgia or Alabama to Florida doesn't show any meaningful difference in quality of life, except that Florida has a slightly better economy.\n\nThe feature that people like most about income taxes is that it is progressive.  That is the money you are taxed is graduated.  \n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/filing/federal-income-tax-rates-and-brackets\n\nThis can be replicated fairly accurately by simply mailing a \"tax rebate\" check out to every American.  Call it 'reverse income tax' or 'basic minimal income' or anything like that.. it amounts to the same thing. \n\nSo you could do something like:\n\nThe poverty level for a individual is $16k yearly income. The Federal flat sales tax is 30%. So you would do the math and say they would pay about 4000 in taxes.  Add another 2000 to that for good measure and to replace food stamps, etc.  So you would mail out a $500 check to every American, regardless of income or working or whatever. Every month.\n\nThis means that any money you earn and spend under the poverty level + a small extra is tax free.  No need to track income. No need to spy on people or force people to do taxes, etc.\n\nYou don't even need a Federal agency for this. States could be responsible for collecting the taxes and sending them off to the Feds.",

Great, move to California, Oregon, Washington State, Illinois, or New York State. \n\nDo you want limited government and would rather pay a use/sales tax instead of a high income tax? Sweet, move to Texas, Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee, etc..\n\nA common issue in modern politics is that people think their way of life is \"the correct way\" while not realizing that everyone's American Dream is different. That's why it's so important to have limited federal government so that each independent state can determine what's best for their people. If something is nearly universally agreed upon (sounds unlikely today, right), then it should be federal and centrally controlled. But if you leave your house I'm sure you'll see that people have wildly different views about the way things should be, and we as Libertarians should support a limited federal government so that each citizen can persue their dreams as best they can.\n\nI always say I'll take state contol over federal control because I can elect my state leaders and live with the consequences of that decision. However, with federal control, the leaders of 26 states that I do not live in (and cannot vote for) can decide the way things are going to be, and that is no bueno.",
