So if corruption, political elites, and institutional extortion are just certainties of life, libertarianism doesn't tell you how best to deal with those realities. It doesn't tell which tradeoffs are the correct tradeoffs for the best outcomes. Those are differences in method or strategy, not differences in high level goals. Low level goals can be different, because of assumptions in how politics will play out, and how you can make progress on your higher level goals.  \n  \nThis is why libertarians argue about specific cultural issues and strategies all the freaking time. The AnCaps vs. the Minarchists. The Mises Caucus vs. the Prags. The CATO Institute vs. the Mises Institute. We don't have a unified theory of political strategy.  \n  \nIf you are asking me personally, I tend to lean towards an \"upstream\" approach. Politics and culture are downstream of education and community. If I can have a positive effect on my own friends, family, and community, that is far more likely to bear fruit than any political activism (apart from specific, achievable goals on politics, which I view opportunistically).  \n  \nIf other people want to devote their time, thoughts, plans, efforts, and mental well being on a form of political action - you do you. I don't view that as my \"lane\" in my life right now. I just want to educate people and encourage people to stop worshiping the idols of statism and utopianism, because I don't think those are helpful - either personally *or* politically.",

What AIPAC implies (and why they always put that question in their talking points) is that to ask the question *must be* a form of bias against Israel. They are begging the question. They imply that there is no objective reason to have particular interest in Israeli money, aid, or influence.  \n  \nBut this is incorrect.  \nA) Israel is not a poor country, so why do they \"need\" aid in the first place?  \nB) The result of this aid is to make Israel more bellicose, which leads to less stability in the region and more war.  \nC) The political and financial incentive for the spending isn't centered in the Israeli \"people,\" but in the political interests themselves: the military industrial complex, the intelligence agencies, the energy industry, the media (with a financial interest in state apology and sensationalism), and the banks (which benefit from the spending and debt that come from war).  \n  \nSo the answer to \"why\" Israel isn't Antisemitism. The answer is that the aid has a negative result: not least for the people of Israel, who now have a target on their back amongst their neighbors and the rest of the world. The military industrial complex made life for Ukrainians massively worse. Why would it be any different for the people who live in Israel that just want to live in peace and prosperity? Israel doesn't have a target on their back because of *Jew hatred.* It is because of geopolitics. So supporting that geopolitics is only going to make things worse.",

That guy steals 2 of my coconuts, which sucks for me, cause now I have 3 coconuts, and he has 12. Basic logic: theft sucks. That would be worse for me, obviously.  \n  \nBut you are saying that if I were to have 5 coconuts, and the other guy finds a way to get himself 20, I'm worse off? Why? Why is it preferable for me to have 5 and him 10? Why is it worse for me to have 5 and him to have 20? The only reason is greed and envy: if I despise the success and status of others for my own wicked pleasure.  \n  \nPerhaps you are saying that it isn't just two of us. Maybe there is a third guy named Guber. Guber steals 2 coconuts from me, and 4 from the other guy, and gives me a single acorn as a \"service,\" the result of the 6 coconuts Guber took. As it turns out, Guber mostly just spent the coconuts to get hookers and blow for himself and his friends, instead of giving me a \"service.\"  \n  \nSo you are telling me that it would be better for me to have Guber keep stealing 2 coconuts from me, but *increase* stealing 4 coconuts from the other guy to stealing 10 instead. Now instead of me having 3 coconuts to the other guy's 16, I have 3 coconuts to the other guy's 10, and Guber spends the extra coconuts on extra hookers and blow for Guberment pleasure.  \n  \nAnd this is better in your opinion. So I ask again... Why is this better for me? I should celebrate Guberment stealing from the rich... why, exactly? Income inequality doesn't mean crap. I get it if you think it is better if *you* steal coconuts from the rich guy. But you aren't actually advocating for that. You are asking for Guber to steal from rich guys to give favors to *different rich guys.*",

When the Treasury issues bonds, the FED will continually pump new currency into the market until all of those bonds get bought up, or the FED will just buy the bonds directly. If the FED didn't do this, then the interest rate market for Treasury bonds would need to skyrocket in order for the Treasury to actually sell all the bonds. Otherwise, if no one buys the bonds, then no money, and no spending.  \n  \nOur current system is a shell game, where each institution pretends that every other institution is at fault, but the key to all of it is the FED. The FED creates the boom/bust cycle, and allows the monetization of the debt. The boom/bust cycle allows for insiders to benefit from insider knowledge, manipulation, and trading. And all of the access to easy money fuels war, military spending, entitlements, subsidies, and every other evil in D.C. So that's why I feel that way.  \n  \nBlaming \"Congress\" is too politically convenient for the D.C. insiders, in my opinion, because it makes it sound like deadlock and partisanship is the issue. But it isn't partisanship. It is a specific group of interests and institutions that are in unanimous agreement, and who benefit from the arrangement, and have worked for over a century to maintain this arrangement. If the public knew how terrible the FED was, we could abolish it.  \n  \nD.C. insiders are not threatened if the public conversation becomes, \"Congress needs to get spending in check.\" Why? Because the \"solution\" to that problem is for 330 million people in 500+ districts to organize to campaign to unelect 300+ representatives, senators, and party leaders to achieve a majority by selecting new \"angels\" to replace those elected positions, and expect those \"angels\" to follow through on the promise to \"cut spending\" by unelecting those 300+ people *again* if they don't do what they said they'll do, and to repeat this process infinitely until you succeed - once - for one budget year/political term, and then start the process all over again the next budget year if necessary. This is obviously a fool's errand, and it will never work.  \n  \nBut abolishing the FED? That is doable. Is it difficult? Yes. But it is doable. One good media and marketing campaign across the country that gets 67% of people to accept the (completely true) idea that the FED benefits no American citizen at all outside the elite, and that we'd be better off just signing a single bill once to repeal the FED and go back to a gold standard? That would require a massive public movement, but it is a manageable one. A campaign that rallies behind that idea *could* work.  \n  \nSo that is what D.C., the elite, and the \"establishment\" fears. Stuff like that.  \n  \nAnd that is why they fear Elon. They fear a group of elites coming in and replacing the FED and all of the leech banks with something like a Central Bank Digital Currency instead, with all the Tech-bro elites (like Elon) acting as the next generation of movers/shakers. Because getting rid of the FED might mean adopting gold, but politically, a CBDC is more likely.  \n  \n---  \n  \nBut in the subject of tax cuts, I don't think it is necessarily the case that tax cuts \"for the rich\" don't benefit society as a whole. Because the reality is that the private sector would put those resources to *far better use* than the public sector ever could. Could Elon or Bezos get richer? Maybe. But *how* would they get richer? By engaging in productive economic activity. Them would use that money to produce more things and run more businesses. The rich getting richer hurts normal people if the rich *use the government* to do it. But if they use market exchanges? That leads to *better* outcomes for normal people, not worse.  \n  \nIf the rich get richer, then invest that money in a new industry, that is good for society. However, I disagree with the erroneous misapplications of \"trickle down economics,\" because I don't think that benefits to the rich are magic. It isn't like *whatever* is good for the rich is good for everyone. But *market activity* is good for everyone.  \n  \nTaxes hurt the economy because they take resources out of the economy and waste them. The pile of \"stuff\" in the economy goes down, and everyone (except the government) ends up worse off. But it isn't just taxes that do this, but spending as well. Spending reallocates resources in the economy (wastefully) just as much as taxes remove resources. The two distortions work hand in hand to make society worse.",

It's useless to look at just the top bracket because it likely constitutes a fraction of all the receipts in a fiscal year.

There are two problems I have with deficit spending in general.\n\n1) Interest. Because we have to borrow extra money, we end up paying MORE over time for things that we're spending on right now. So, assuming, for example that a particular project requires a 3% tax for 5 years right now, deficit spending might mean that we need a 5% tax for 5 years down the line. That extra taxed amount goes entirely toward servicing past debt. If I'm not mistaken, here in Canada, at least, about 10% of our taxes go toward servicing existing debt. IMO that is one of the most unethical uses of tax money because not only are you using coercion to tax people, that money is going toward something that you could have paid less for in the past.\n\n2) Shifting the burden to future generations. Speaking of the ethics of deficit spending, I also consider it more unethical to tax citizens in the future for things we are doing right now. If there is a social contract, it should be narrow because we don't have a choice in accepting it. The narrowness of the social contract makes it difficult to argue that current generations should not only be taxed for spending right now, but that they should be held responsible for the actions and decisions of previous generations. That's a hard sell to me.\n\nSo ultimately, here is my hierarchy of outcomes, from best to worst:\n\n1) Tax cuts and spending cuts\n2) Spending cuts without tax cuts\n3) Tax cuts without spending cuts \n4) Spending increases without tax increases\n5) Tax increases without spending increases\n6) Tax increases and spending increases\n\nPS: also consider the macroeconomic principle that deficit spending is inflationary policy that should be done during recessions. Meanwhile, surpluses are deflationary and are better reserved for the height of the business cycle. We are currently a lot closer to the peak of the business cycle than the trough. That makes it even more pertinent to avoid deficit spending.",

All else being equal, debt will steal more from society that a direct tax will, because A) interest, and B) debt will act as a subsidy to the banks, who will now leverage their interest to squeeze more money from the government and the system. If there is a budget surplus, then the incentive to spend is dispersed. But if the budget ends up in the hands of a *particular* interest, then it becomes much harder to wrestle it away later.  \n  \nThe point I was making earlier is that tax cuts aren't the cause of the theft of resources from society. Spending and inflation are the cause. It is helpful to state apologists to confuse the issue and imply that \"deficits\" are bad *because they are bad for society,* because they mean to imply that *the state represents society,* but this isn't the case. The state is its own interest. What is good for the state is not necessarily good for the people, and vice versa. There is a partial symbiotic relationship there, but not a complete one. The interests still compete. I believe that the discussion about tax cuts relates strongly to this concept.  \n  \nI would also disagree with your take on the business cycle. I agree with the austrians, not the Keynesians or the monetarists. Their understanding of \"inflation\" and \"deflation\" is inherently flawed, in my opinion. Aggregate demand is not the cause nor the cure to economic woes, and inflation is not a phenomenon of demand primarily, but of supply mostly. Inflation/deflation is a neutral aspect of the economy if it happens A) predictably, so as not to interfere with economic calculation, and B) naturally, as by the natural industry of mining gold and increasing supply naturally. Fiat currencies and inflation manipulation allow the unnatural transfer of wealth from everyone to the currency issuer, same as how a counterfeiter steals from society. The only difference between the FED and a counterfeiter is that the FED has declared themselves legitimate, but the counterfeiter a criminal. But the theft is the same either way. That is just a difference of perspective and interpretation that an austrian-school economist would have.",

That has the potentional to save a lot if the initial numbers they released are anywhere near accurate. And there was also a few pretty high profile Medicare fraud cases that should also have the potential to save quite a bit.\n\nSome quick math is here; the average Social Security check is\u00a0$1,783.55 per month. They showed around 21 million odd looking ages, for argument sake lets say theyre all fraudulent (unlikley but we're being generous) that's like $37.5 billion saved per month or $450 billion per year. Thats close to 1/3 of the Social Security budget",
