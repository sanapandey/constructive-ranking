They were the ones who allowed big corporations and the swamp to get in bed with them and pass legislation that rig the system to their benefit. So a bigger socialist government would only work once it earns our trust back. \n\nTyranny of government is bad, but is tyranny of corporations any better? Should there be no check and balances for one corporation gaining too much market share by merging with their competition? So like all things it\u2019s definitely a balancing act.",

They'll try to gain the upper hand over their competition at any means possible. This is how you get lobbyist trying to sway politicians. If you take away power from the politician then you take away the interest these corporations have to sway them. \n\nSocialist answer to this is for the \"right people\" to gain power. An uncorruptable entity that has the power to make the utopia but is also benevolent enough to resist temptations of special interest. They're essentially looking for government Jesus.",

Referring to him as the greatest hero of the ideas of freedom. It means:\n\nLiberalism is the unrestricted respect for the life plan of others, based on the principle of non-aggression and in defense of the right to life, liberty and property.\n\nWhen government is reduced to this level and this level alone it's impossible for the birth of an overpowering corporation. The game today isn't being played fairly. The fact the US has the biggest and most powerful bureaucracy in history and that corporations like BlackRock exist isn't a coincidence.",

I think there used to be 50+ defense contractors and they all got eaten up.\n\nDo you not believe in anti-trust laws? Isn\u2019t it dangerous if very few corporations are allowed to charge any price they damn please because they control large market share. This is the problem with anarchy, the first thing a corporation will do is make the free market less free not more. Corporations don\u2019t operate with a moral compass, they want to accumulate more power and money and expand operations for themselves.
