    "selftext": "I am all about firing gov workers, but I find the method distasteful to normies. Instead, I would propose cutting pay and lowing GS pay ranges especially on the higher end. That would not only piss off gov workers but would lead to mass walk offs, which is really what we should want (not getting fired but instead voluntarily quit) \n\nNow I am not saying lets pay GS 1 and 2 less. Taxation is theft, but we all do still live in a progressive tax system, and as a result we should be supporting a progressive pay cut in which the more you make the more you have your paycheck cut. \n\nThoughts? People say working in gov is a public service, I would like that be more the case by impoverishing you if you work in the gov lol. ",

That is a hard sell for members of Congress in tight districts afraid of losing votes.\n\nJust one more reason why I say democracy rewards deficit spending, especially in a single-member district.",

It's more like a minimum prerequisite for retirement. \n\nWhen the term first came to prominence, I think in the 1920s (?), a millionaire was Mr. Warbucks being chauffeured around in a limo.  Now it's Bob down the street with the late-model Hyundai.",
