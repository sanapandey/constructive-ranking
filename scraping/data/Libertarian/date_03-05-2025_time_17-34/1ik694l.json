If you ask me, this is an assault on both our privacy and the First Amendment. I hope the Supreme Court does the right thing and protects the First Amendment. Do we really wanna give the government even more control over the internet?\n\nWhat does the future state of the internet look like? Will our currently free and open internet remain free and open or will the government just keep on seizing more and more control over the internet?\n\nThe government always wants more control over our lives!\n\nFrom the article:\n\n[Judge David Alan Ezra](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/ezra-david-alan), of the Federal District Court in Austin, blocked the law, saying it would have a chilling effect on speech protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBy verifying information through government identification, the law allows the government \u201cto peer into the most intimate and personal aspects of people\u2019s lives,\u201d wrote Judge Ezra, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cIt runs the risk that the state can monitor when an adult views sexually explicit materials and what kind of websites they visit,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn effect, the law risks forcing individuals to divulge specific details of their sexuality to the state government to gain access to certain speech.\u201d",

However, that is a vast difference between claiming that it is being collected by law, as the conspiracy posts have made and storing it to persecute people.  Also, if you are this alarmed at porn sites doing it, where is your outrage at all the other businesses that do the same?  Every single company in the US stores your data when you apply for a job with them, and that is a far more insidious collection of data.  But yes, the porn sites are the biggest threat to your data collection.",

Nor is this legislating morality.  There are literally laws on the books for porn already.  You can't waltz into a store and buy pornography without ID.
