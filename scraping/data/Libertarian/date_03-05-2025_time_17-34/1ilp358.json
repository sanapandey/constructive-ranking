Why shoot yourself in the foot with DEI policies with Trump in the White House?\n\n> Also if they are scrapping it, it must mean its a total failure so any studies on that I can find?\n\nScrapping something doesn't = total failure. Even if ACN reaped massive benefits in previous years, the current admin might still cause ACN leadership to cancel policies in the hopes of improving their odds of winning government business. Anyways, some stuff will still be around like the employee resource groups as well.\n\n> Why were they waiting for Trump to win and sticking with them for so long is what I don\u2019t understand and why did they even adopt them in the first place?\n\nThere's no \"waiting for Trump to win\", you just go where the money is. Dollars to donuts they wouldn't be so publicly cancelled if Harris won instead.",

Esg scoring over profit was ruled as misleading investors in a court case a few months ago.\u00a0\n\nThis case (among many other examples) demonstrated that DEI does not increase profit, and is actually a legal liability.\u00a0\n\nMajor studies that ostensibly showed DEI was profitable turned out to be bogus. Which makes perfect sense. How would race trump merit??? If race actually did trump merit, as those who claim DEI is profitable swear, THAT would be racist af. It would prove some kind of race essentialism, which itself is a theory of the most racist people in history.\u00a0\n\nNow Trump has pointed out, correctly, that per civil rights law DEI hiring and programs are actually illegal and directed his agencies to look out for private companies breaking the laws. Again, the CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS that have existed for half a century. \u00a0These laws demand meritocratic judgment and fairness in hiring and such, WITHOUT regard to race. They demand colorblindness. So DEI was always illegal, as it is 100% based on racism, whether you see that as good or bad, it is NOT colorblind. They were only allowed because the previous administration in the White House was racist woke asshats. And they were only carried out because money was held hostage by esg bullshit.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0So companies are no longer forced to play this dumb fucking game. Surely the vast majority never wanted to anyway. Anyone with a brain can see merit hiring makes money, not mindless diversity goals. Now they are free to drop the act and hire based on merit alone, as the laws require.\u00a0\n\nhttps://notthebee.com/article/american-airlines-just-lost-a-case-over-their-commitment-to-esg-practices-and-how-it-affected-401ks-heres-why-thats-a-big-deal\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/\n\nhttps://notthebee.com/article/mckinsey-studies-used-to-justify-and-promote-dei-in-the-workplace-as-a-positive-for-business-were-just-shown-to-be-unreliable-yeah-the-results-show-dei-is-bad-for-businesses",

They use computer programs.\u00a0\n\n\nBlackrock, besides being the largest financial management company on the planet, also make the computer programs everyone uses to figure out what stocks to choose.\u00a0\n\n\nLong story, but Blackrock decided to give companies a score based on their stance on environmental and social issues. This scoring is very important to any company, as having a large city or company invest their employees 401k in you will greatly effect your stock price.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is also why you started seeing companies putting mixed race or LBGT couples in their advertising.\u00a0\n\n\nThese same companies also implemented DEI hiring practices.\u00a0\n\n\nAfter the BudLight debacle Blackrock slowly backed away from this rating scheme and these hiring policies companies had been using have out lived their usefulness.\u00a0\n\n\nSounds like companies have decided that hiring someone based on qualifications instead of race works better.\u00a0",
