People are so infected with culture war bullshit that they'll betray their own beliefs over something trivial. Yes, democrats really suck, but they happened to be on the right side of this bill. Broken clocks, etc.",

It was the absolute crushing of free speech of the team mates and opposing teams to even voice a dissent that I saw as the real problem.\n\nThe young women actually competing had no voice and no part in the decision ( and for high school, it appears neither did their parents). That's straight up wrong.",

Ignoring my opposition to the public schooling and federal funding systems, it is completely within the right of the government impose terms and conditions on competition that takes place within their schools. If this order extends to private institutions, however, it's completely wrong and I would be vehemently opposed to it.",

As the recipient of money, you have a choice. Accept it on the terms of the benefactor or do not accept it.",
