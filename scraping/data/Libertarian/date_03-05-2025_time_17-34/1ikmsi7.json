I haven\u2019t seen others ask it before so I thought I would drop the question here for others. \n\n\n\nDo you generally believe that a right should not impose an obligation on others to provide labor or resources?\n\nGiven that the Constitution guarantees the right to legal counsel, including court-appointed attorneys for those who cannot afford one, would you consider this a legitimate right? \n\nIf so, how do you reconcile it with their broader views on rights and obligations?\n\n",

Procedural rights are rights that exist out of pragmatism to ensure fair trials, which is vital if you want to have a defense of natural rights. So just like minarchists believe that some taxes must be paid (usually out of pragmatism), the existence of procedural rights are a price to pay in order to correctly enforce natural rights, and can be defended from a libertarian point of view.",

Wainwright that the  right to appointed counsel was extended to state felonies based on the 14th amendment due process right. \n\nAnd then in 1972 in Argersinger v.
