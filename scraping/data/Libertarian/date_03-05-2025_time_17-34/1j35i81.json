Just from recent history: Moldova, Finland, the Baltic states, Georgia, Kosovo, Croatia should just bow to dictators and conquerors, and not search ways to protect their integrity and independence?\n\n\nJust because ENVYisEVIL, Trump and Ron Paul want to dictate what other people from other countries should do geopolitically?\nThat's not very libertarian.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat about NATO without USA? Shouldn't that be the goal? What's your reasoning for disbanding an alliance comprising of 32 countries? Why not advocate for just leaving?\n\n\nIt's probably because you're stupid, a Putin/fascist lover, or both.\u00a0\n\n\nEither way, the way things are going it won't matter: everyone will suffer the consequences of appeasing and bending over to dictators.",

It wasn\u2019t a broader pledge against all eastward expansion, and Gorbachev later said NATO expansion wasn\u2019t discussed beyond that context.\n\n- \u201cDozens of Western Leaders and Diplomats\u201d: Assurances came from a handful of figures (e.g., Baker, Genscher, Kohl) in 1990-1991, not \u201cdozens.\u201d They were diplomatic statements tied to Germany, not a widespread public campaign or \u201cmantra.\u201d\nNATO\u2019s Eastward Expansion: 13 Countries: NATO has expanded to 16 countries since 1990, not 13 (e.g., Poland in 1999, Finland in 2023). U.S. bases followed in some, contradicting the spirit of 1990 assurances, though no formal agreement banned it.\n\n- \u201cDumbasses Should Have Got It in Writing\u201d: No evidence Western leaders said this exact phrase. NATO claims no broader agreement existed beyond Germany, and the lack of a written treaty reflects Soviet oversight, not a flippant dismissal.\n\n- Historical Context and Responsibility: The Soviet collapse was due to internal issues, not just NATO assurances. Expansion was driven by Eastern Europe\u2019s choices and U.S. policy, not a broken promise. Russia\u2019s aggression partly stems from this perceived betrayal, but both sides share blame in the geopolitical fallout.",

What I know is that while Gorbachev claimed that US Secretary of State James Baker had agreed with not expanding NATO (during a 1990 meeting), no binding promise against NATO expansion seems to exist.\n\nCould NATO have made a promise and then backed out of it? Sure. Could Russia use a non-formal promise as an excuse to start a war? Sure.\n\nIt's fine to call out the USA's faults, totally, but let's not pretend Russia is innocent here (or completely justified).",
