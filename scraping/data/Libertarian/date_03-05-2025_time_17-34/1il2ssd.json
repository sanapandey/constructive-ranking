If there's no chance of getting it through the Senate, then what is the point of pushing it?",

But Bernie is modifying it to make something happen, even it is not the 'large' audit. And it didn't even get taken up in the Senate. \n\nSo what is the issue? A more 'stricter' version that would also go nowhere?",
