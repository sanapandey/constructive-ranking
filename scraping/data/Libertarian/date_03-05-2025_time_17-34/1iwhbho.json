Not much waste here. Some of the most effective military spending since WW2 because of how much the aid directly damaged a geopolitical enemy. \n\nThe issue is that Biden was giving out aid for free and now Trump is retroactively changing the terms of the deal.",

If that were true, why did Congress approve an additional $26 billion last year to replace weapons stockpiles sent to Ukraine? \n\nA healthy dose of skepticism is always good on Reddit\n\nhttps://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106649",

It is probably partially true in the case of the older vehicles, but that's also part of the strategic reserve, much like how Russia is re-activating a ton of old tanks and IFVs. There are some savings there because the military does maintain those vehicles, so as with all things there are tradeoffs. It will probably be years before we can have a good analysis, but we can be sure that the cost is not negligible based on the money already spent.\n\nThe other line that keeps coming up is that the expenditure was a \"good deal\" to deplete the Russian military capacity. What's interesting about that claim is that no one but Putin initially suggested this was part of the US's goal, and what that argument really claims is that the US prolonged the war to hurt Russia at Ukraine's expense... which sounds much more anti-Ukraine than anything to me.",

We do that because a country in an active conflict is going to use it almost immediately. That doesn\u2019t mean once they used all of those we\u2019re just like \u201cguess you\u2019re fucked then.\u201d We will replenish our stock and then sell them some extra to make some money. By sending munitions somewhere it helps stimulate that area of the economy by creating demand. The value of those weapons systems was basically spent to make new ones for us with an American contractor that has American workers and \u201cbuy American\u201d clauses in their contract. \n\nIt\u2019s not propaganda. If we didn\u2019t do that you would\u2019ve just seen those same munitions being used in training exercises and weapons qualification tests. The missile systems would\u2019ve just been fired in a desert, at sea, or made inert and buried somewhere. It saves us the cost of disposal and potentially hazardous waste accidents in the process. That doesn\u2019t mean they were bad though it\u2019s just we have very short shelf life requirements while other countries don\u2019t. By disposing of these munitions and not using them to force our influence on the world we would\u2019ve got much less value out of the whole thing. My source is having been around warehouses with expiring munitions that were taken to be sent to Ukraine.",

Give away. Pay for it twice. Look at Raytheon's stock price!\"\n\nA deal's a deal and I agree with you insofar as it applies to any degradable, end-of-shelf-life munitions (that don't take away from U.S. training requirements) and true third-tier systems that are half a step from the mothball yard but this is hardly all we've been sending.  ATACS stockpiles are significantly depleted, the DOD just had to double it's budget request for 155mm rounds, and for the most part those IFVs, M1s, self-propelled artillery, and F16s make up a not insignificant part of our strategic defense reserve, many platforms of which could be retrofitted with more advanced munitions and sensor and fire-control systems (albeit not cheaply).",

Not only do you expect the US to shell out billions of dollars but when the war is over who is going to rebuild every single power plant in Ukraine? The point is every day the costs are growing and growing with no end in sight.\n\nUkraine isn't our fight. There wouldn't be a war in Ukraine if there hadn't been a coup by western aligned western Oligarchs.\n\nAmerican government doesn't serve Europeans nor Ukrainians. If Americans want to cut off aid, who's money is it? Its not Ukraines. If Americans want to end a war then foreign policy changes. Isn't that what opposition is? Your advocating of forcing the opposition to not adhere to the will of the people to continue a war which is unpopular domestically?\n\nWhat is stopping Europeans from sending troops to Ukraine? Nothing. Europeans love war so much in fact that the continent has been filled with war from the beginning. America moving away from hawkish and not expanding the conflict into WW3 is the smart play. Risking New York, Los Angeles, and every other American city for a shithole corrupt country like Ukraine is the wrong play. Any US and Russian war would involve at the very least tactical nuclear weapons and possibly strategic exchange. All life ends.\n\nSo if the US doesn't want to start WW3 over this shitty proxy conflict what are the alternatives? US should further deplete stockpiles, money. and bring it closer to open conflict from Russia?\n\nLooks like your side lost as Ukraine is unable to win in a conflict that started well before the Russian invasion and is a result of a civil war between two political bases with pro western in the western part of the country and pro eastern aligned with Russia. Before the coup half the country, majority of the east, supported the pro-Russian President. You act like 50% of the populace is the entirety of Ukraine while ignoring the other opposition.\n\nYou know why Ukraine lost its civil war? Because its partners weren't willing to fight directly as Russia was. Only so much you can do with a proxy.",

And I'm not claiming to know his grand plan any better than you do, but given everything we know I just find the claim that \"he would go into Poland next, guaranteed!\" to be a bit silly.

The last offer on the table from Russia before the talks fell apart included Ukraine reducing it\u2019s military to only 100,000 personnel (about 10% of its current size) along with relinquishing nearly all its military equipment (keeping less than 10% of its current mortars, helicopters, missiles, etc). \n\nOn top of the demilitarization, Ukraine would be barred from entering any security agreement with other nations. They penned in a security promise into the proposal itself, but Russia gave itself unilateral veto power over whether that provision would actually get triggered lol.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do any speculation to see what situation that agreement would create.

The root of this conflict goes back decades, and a lot of it has to do with NATO\u2019s expansion and U.S. interference in Ukraine\u2019s politics.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the U.S. and NATO assured Russia that NATO would not expand \u201cone inch eastward\u201d beyond Germany. That promise was broken over and over again, with NATO absorbing 14 Eastern European countries and pushing military infrastructure right up to Russia\u2019s borders. This wasn\u2019t just a defensive alliance anymore\u2014it was a direct geopolitical threat from Russia\u2019s perspective. \n\nThen the Ukraine\u2019s 2014 coup, which was heavily backed by the U.S. The democratically elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, was overthrown after rejecting an EU deal in favor of closer ties with Russia. The U.S. openly supported this regime change\u2014Victoria Nuland, a top U.S. official, was caught on tape handpicking Ukraine\u2019s new leadership. After that, Ukraine became a de facto U.S. client state, pushing anti-Russian policies, integrating with NATO in everything but name, and ramping up military actions in the Donbas, where Russian-speaking separatists had been fighting since 2014.\n\nRussia saw this as a direct threat, and after years of ignored warnings, they acted. Does that justify the invasion? No. But it makes it clear that this war was avoidable\u2014if NATO had stopped pushing east, if the U.S. hadn\u2019t backed a coup, and if Ukraine had remained neutral instead of being used as a pawn in a proxy war. Instead, Zelensky played right into it, rejecting peace talks early on, thinking NATO and the U.S. would fully back him. Now, Ukraine is in ruins, and the U.S. is quietly looking for an exit strategy.",

Ukraine had assurances that they would be protected. THAT is why they gave up their nukes. It was clear after the annexation of Crimea & territory in Georgia that there would be a non-response by all Western nations.

The West made vague assurances, but there was never a real commitment to defend Ukraine militarily. That became obvious after Russia took Crimea in 2014 and nothing happened. By the time this war started, Putin already knew the West would talk tough but wasn\u2019t willing to send troops.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about letting dictators take whatever they want, but we can\u2019t ignore how the U.S. and NATO helped create the conditions for this war.
