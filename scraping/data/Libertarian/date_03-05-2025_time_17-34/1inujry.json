Libertarianism is the freedom to choose and live autonomously, within the guidelines of fair and acceptable laws and regulations for all, that don\u2019t over encroach on personal freedoms or freedoms that a reasonable adult should be able to make. If it doesn\u2019t directly affect or impact you, while you are able to freely choose whether or not to engage in the behavior, then you should be for it, within reason. Examples: zoning regulations for property\u2019s, permits for extending a wall or needing a permit to build a shed on your land, that\u2019s encroachment of the government telling me what I can and cannot do to my land. That\u2019s not fair, especially when I don\u2019t have an equal say in where my tax dollars directly go. Gay rights, if I can marry who I want, gay, trans, non-binary, Apache Helicopters, they all absolutely get to as well. If someone can own a gun that can be used to take the lives of others, you should be able to smoke and grow your own weed, as that is a \u201cvictimless\u201d crime. Whatever extends our freedoms without encroaching on others freedoms is the basis for my ideology. Might not be \u201clibertarian\u201d but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve interpreted it.",

I think it is perfectly fair to say that left-wingers can be libertarian too, as you bring up gay rights this is absolutely a value that libertarianism believes should be granted to the people. Your beliefs is completely in line with libertarianism, but it's important to note that there are certain liberties supported by the left, such as same-sex marriage and lax zoning laws, and there are certain liberties supported by the right, such as gun rights and parental discretion in education. \n\nThere are very few pure libertarians in this world, and everyone has some combination of these rights that they support. I think what turns you from the average person into a libertarian is your ability to concede that a government has no authority to restrict a certain right, even if you personally don't like the idea of that right being given to the people. e.g. you might be homophobic but concede that the government is in no position to restrict gay marriage.\n\nfor me personally, I see problems regarding gun rights and see that other nations with those rights restricted have no issues functioning and providing the people with other basic rights, but I concede that it is not within the vital and necessary functions of government to restrict gun ownership, so I would describe myself as a libertarian.",

It should also be noted that Argentina has a single aluminum smelter.\n\nArgentina was previously exempt from the steel-25%/aluminum-10% tariffs Trump enacted in 2018, but had quota limits (Biden continued this policy). The steel-25%/aluminum-25% tariffs are not \"new/in addition\". They are a readjustment of the existing tariffs and remove the exemptions (quotas) for Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina, Japan, the United Kingdom, and European Union. By removing the exemptions these countries are now no longer limited by the quota. I would assume this is a better deal from Milei's perspective since they ranked 8th (by metric ton) for steel and 4th for aluminum allowed under the quota.",

                    "body": "The morality matters because that is what morality is... it is \"what behavior should we engage in that will most likely yield the best results for us and everybody\"\n\nAnd a policy of autarky and protectionism is good when your goal is to start wars and start crises  Because it allows politicians to downplay and minimize a lot of negative aspects of their bad decisions and bad policies. \n\nBut it is a lousy policy if you want your country to actually be successful. \n\nLike if your goal is to protect domestic steel industry in the USA then the right course of action would be to introduce a industrial policy that streamlines and reduces overhead involved in creating new steel making plants, lower the barriers of entry to new businesses, and remove any legal or bureaucratic hurdles that inhibit the adoption of new technologies. \n\nLike it is a extremely energy intensive business.  Do what you can, in the government, to make cheap and reliable energy production possible. Reduce costs and overhead and barriers there as well. \n\nOtherwise, yes, you can paper over these problems caused by bad policies and bad leadership by throwing tariffs at it... But in the end tariffs are as much of a tax on the American people as it is a tax on other countries. Because it causes costs to rise and goods to become scarcer on any good that is taxed.  \n\nIs it worth to decline the quality of life for 300+ million Americans to protect a industry that employees tens of thousands because the government can't be bothered to implement good industrial policies? \n\nLike one of the reasons electronics and such things have moved overseas is because it just takes so much more damn time to get anything done in the USA.  I don't know what it is like after the latest crackdowns by Xi... but developing and designing products in one of China's SEZs would take days to do what would take weeks in the USA.   Meaning if you wanted to be competitive you had to leave the USA.  And that is for relatively small scale electronics like phones and such things.  I can't imagine the nightmares around creating a new state of the art fab facility. \n\nAlso we have a lot of dead weight in the American corporation sphere.  Throwing money at companies like Intel to try to re-kickstart domestic chip manufacturing is just throwing good money after bad.  The leadership crisis isn't just in government it extends to these big corporations, too. \n\nThere remains a massive need to cut the deadweight. And the deadweight is at the top. \n\nTrump uses tariffs as a weapon to bully other countries into adopting policies he considers good for this country.  Hopefully that is all this is. \n\nThe only reason I would be in favor of tariffs is because I believe that the IRS and income tax and all the overhead and costs and regulation and spying and all that nonsense that goes along with that is worse.  So if tariffs are the price we have to pay to get rid of the IRS, then that is acceptable to me. \n\nOtherwise... it really doesn't benefit the American people any.  Just a small select group of Americans.",

It is blatant protectionism to shore up domestic steel and aluminum producers, ostensibly to prevent damage from a supply chain crunch like we recently experienced. \n\nWithout commenting on the morality of tariffs, these particular tariffs appear to make sense to me from a strategic sense.  We need secure supply lines in times of crisis and tariffs are one of the least interventionist ways to make sure our smelters and rolling mills don't shut down.  \n\nIt is similar to the incentives for domestic microchip production.  When we couldn't get chips from our trading partners it caused a lot of disruption.\n\nNot to mention there are safety problems with importing steel.  I worked on a major petrochem project that had to be re-designed because the chinese steel that was imported failed all the QC tests.",

It has no relevance to globalism.  \n\nThere is no such thing as global free trade unless every single country on the planet is a libertarian nation (which is not in the cards in any time in the foreseeable future).  Shitty governments put their hand on the scale constantly.  Capitalism requires government to get out of the way.  We can barely do that here; we can't expect other countries to do it.",

Trade is trade.\n\nFor the US, I think this is bad because its what my country kept doing for a 100 years, textbook peronism. It will lead to increased prices, the strenthening of local protected industrial castes and an overal decrease of the US' trade relevancy as it is pushed further into isolation.",

Just because we import more than we export to a country like Argentina doesn't automatically mean there's a problem.\n\nArgentina has about 1/7th the population of the US, so our demand for goods is naturally larger. Plus, when their Peso is devalued, it's cheaper for us to import from them, creating a trade deficit that actually benefits US consumers by giving us goods at a relative \"discount.\"",
