    "selftext": "If you used to believe in forced wealth redistribution through taxes, wealthfare, etc, what made you realize it was actually theft?\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand the mindset of people who think it\u2019s okay for the government to steal people\u2019s money regardless if they worked hard for it just to give it to away because someone else is doing worse than them. Especially when the untrustworthy government is already corrupt and not even using the money for what they claim to use it for. So much money goes missing and so many promises broken yet people still trust them to manage our money.\n",

You know what this means for employees of companies that offer product when this happens?  Yeah, you can wait, the laborer can't, hell, not even the business can't hold out for as long as you can and will have to close shop at some point.\n\nSo yeah, supply and demand my friend.. don't forget that and what role a currency plays there that can be withheld from the market at mostly no cost(\\*) to the money holder.\n\n\\*) it's actually a bit different once one looks at closely what money, what currency actually is, but I don't want to overload the comment.

I brought up the employer/employee relationship because the government has no hand in that, and they aren't entitled to any part of your labor. Your labor is yours and yours alone. Your property is yours and yours alone. The things you pass onto your children are theirs, and theirs alone. Yet the government takes a portion of all of it. They force you to pay into a retirement system that you will likely never benefit from. They force you to pay for other people's Healthcare even though you yourself likely don't qualify for those systems. Taxes are a scam designed to keep people poor. They've convinced you that you can't survive without their oversight and their protection. The amount of money the federal government \"lost\" last year is more than the GDP of most countries, but sure, they only do things that benefit me with my money. It doesn't matter that the amount of taxes just the fed took from me would pay my rent for two years. It doesn't matter that I worked almost 600 hours of OT this year so I could make sure we had savings as the economy gets worse, nah, someone else needs those savings more. So 25% of that goes to someone else. The best part? After a harsh winter of regular ice and snow storms, the roads in my neighborhood have yet to be treated. Not once. So please, explain to me again how taxes make my life better.",

Go ahead and look into how many tax dollars have been issued out in government bailouts. How much of our Social Security fund has been taken and replaced with an IOU to fund nonsense like that. \n\n>I doubt that you can protect yourself and your loved ones and your property 24/7 as reliably as a service provider who does this professionally..  well, in theory at least.\n\nLast year I was forcibly evacuated from my apartment at 9 pm by police so they could have a 3 hour standoff with the empty apartment next door. They did this because the person that was staying there *slipped his cuffs and jumped out of the moving police car and got away.* The same cop that physically removed me from my apartment regularly pulls me over to make sure I'm not driving inebriated, because I often go to the store late at night on my days off (i work nights.) I've never gotten a ticket. I don't have a record. Yet the dude latches onto me. Late last year, I recieved a notice from my bourous zoning authority stating a date and time they would be entering my apartment to do an inspection to ensure the space was livable. Why? Because apparently they don't trust me to report my landlord if there's a condition that makes the space unlivable. The best part? The guy showed up 45 minutes late, didn't ask to enter, walked into my infants room and woke her up, then left. Didn't explain what he was looking for or what he was doing. My taxes paid for that. I served for 10 years in the Armed Forces. I can protect my family just fine without the harassment of government officials. \n\nNot quite sure why the people creating the laws are relevant to my personal protection, but go off, I guess. \n\nYea, the government does create rules that benefit them at the detriment of others. So why are we financing it with our earnings from our labor? \n\nLibertarianism functions on a simple concept: individual rights are higher than any law, and the free market is the ideal economic form. The idea is to end reliance on government and rely on your community instead. Your money goes directly into improving the place you live in. Not financing some abortion clinic in Bosnia or some shit. That you can choose how to spend your money that you earned through your labor to improve your life, not the government telling you how they are going to use your money to improve someone else's. It's how the US functioned prior to the income tax, and there's no reason it can't again. \n\nObviously the ideal libertarian society is not realistic, but there's plenty within the libertarian ideology that's achievable. One of those? No income tax. Another?  No federal involvement with our lives. Another? No regulatory agencies arbitrarily making up and enforcing rules because they are the \"subject matter experts.\"",

Local law enforcement can handle disputes between people. And by \"local\" i mean funded by your city. No federal funding. Your money being used by your community to make your community better. Not being taken by federal entities and state programs for use elsewhere. \n\nIf you're talking about the civil war here, I don't know what you mean by \"you guys.\" The southern states were primarily democrats during the Civil War. That being said, the north didn't fight the war to free slaves. They fought the war for reunification. The Emancipation Proclomation only declared southern slaves free, not northern. This is in no way a justification of slavery (a direct violation of libertarian ideals), you just seem to have a severely misguided understanding of the civil war. \n\nMy individual rights depend on my ability to defend them. Funny enough, the right to defend yourself is an inherent right. You seem to think that because you can't function without being told how to live, others can't either. That is not the case. \n\nThe majorities \"overwhelming force\" is only as strong as the conviction of the individual. Are you willing to die to force someone else to live to your expectations, or are you expecting someone else to die in your place to enforce it?

Your protection is your responsibility. A crime that has no victim is not a crime. It's an extortion racket, and there sure are a lot of those. Once again, an example of you trying to convince me that I can't exist without federal protection. It is objectively false. \n\nThe founding fathers had nothing to do with income taxes. Income taxes were first used to finance the Civil War, and the 16th amendment wasn't ratified until 1913. \n\nFree from excessive government regulation that restricts the market to the point where there can be no competition. Government interference in the market is why multinational corporations exist, and why monopolies exist within every industry. \n\nAs a side note, your argument is extremely confusing.

They serve the will of the ones who show up to vote (or are allowed to vote), which is not 100% of the population and then it's enough it 50% + 1 of those votes (I think, not sure..

One paragraph you're sucking on the governments boots, the next you're calling the government a \"monopoly.\"\"*  A monopoly is not per se a bad thing - all it states that there is a single supplier of a commodity or service.  This can be happening on a free market as well and be just fine - by one supplier offering a commodity that no consumer wants anything different off at the lowest cost possible (at current production tech).  This satisfies the free market.  Competition can come in anytime it likes and try to undercut or outengineer the monopolist.. but if there is nothing to undercut or outengineer, then that is it.  The monopol will just be there.  No problem.\n\nThe same is true for the monopol on force that enforces the ideals of the overwhelming majority.  It's fine - IF THIS CONSTRUCT CAN'T BE CONTROLLED BY A MINORITY - but which our existing political systems the world over actually allow for (per above argument) - which then leads to economic monopols that maximize profits WITHOUT competition to be bale to come in and save the day.",

Not sure where you're trying to go with the \"symptom vs cause\" argument. \n\nNo. It means that the majority must be willing to die to violate the rights of the minority. Is that not the basis for the revolutionary war? On the flipside of that coin, the minority must be ready to die to defend their rights. Now who do you think has more conviction? \n\nIf you don't vote, that's your issue. You aren't required to vote, but it is well within your right to vote.

The founding principles cannot. \"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" Taxes are a violation of our liberty by demanding a cut of our labor at the threat of our lives.

It's the reason the system of checks and balances exists, and why the Supreme Court exists. Once again, the \"bigger group\" needs to have stronger convictions than me. I have no problem shedding blood or having my blood shed in the defense of my rights. If that \"bigger group\" doesn't hold that same conviction, then their words are meaningless and their movement dead on arrival.

Unfortunately, as you have pointed in in some shape or form over the course of this discussion, our elected representatives enjoy having corporate hands in their pockets and love using US tax dollars to shake up the stock market and make money. It's a problem that can be rectified if the people start to realize that the government is not their friend, does not have their best interests at heart, and can thrive without their interference. \n\nThe federal government is needed to enforce constitutional law on state governments.

The \"overwhelming majority\" are people who have grown reliant on government to do everything for them and tell them how to live. They are complacent in the idea that they won't have to do anything, because the government can do it for them. With the new administration, a lot of them realized just how fragile that relationship is, and how little the government actually cares. I'm not concerned about \"the majority\" taking anything from me without the power of government to back them up. \n\nYou seem to be confusing libertarian ideology with some sort of dictatorship. The libertarian ideology is extremely against centralized government and government authority. A dictatorship is incompatible with a libertarian society. \n\nVoting for laws within the states is done by popular vote. Voting for laws within the federal government is done by Representatives. We dont want the federal governemnt dictating how we live our lives. It seems you accidently argued on the side of my ideology.\n\nI didn't realize you weren't American.

If you have the right, others will not try to stop you from exercising it, usually out of fear of being punished by an overwhelming force they can't fend of.  If it's just you alone on the other hand.. yeah, you got arms, but they got them too and they can pick time and place (and more important think to have the right to do so).  You can't call something a right that you have no realistic chance to exercise at all times IMHO.\n\nMy human rights are on a much more stable ground than that, but even those have limits. They are being violated if I was to be in NK or Afghanistan for example - because the people wielding the sticks there have different moral convictions and are willing to act on them.\n\nAnd with that being said - how do you figure that 'a people' all agree on those rules?  Maybe the majority is not so keen on that egalitarian mumbo, esp considering race, ethnicity, gender, age, etc?  You think you got the bee's knees, but maybe you're wrong?  How do you navigate that?\n\n*\"If you think that is somehow \"beneficial to the few,\" then you might have a tyranical mindset.\"* I'm more worried about how you plan on bringing the gospel to the rest of us.  How do you want to avoid the monopol on force that is needed so everyone can exercise libertarian rights, if individuals can't enforce them on their own, but it requires an overwhelming majority, esp if it is to be enforced for all equally.  If you put representatives in charge of making & maintaining the rules you'll wind up right where you are - an exercise in futility.\n\n*\"plenty of instances in history where the smaller, less supplied, and less trained force beat the superpower\"*  Nope, they are usually better disciplined, geared and trained to achieve that feat.  The forces you have on mind use guerilla tactics with the goal to trick the larger force into leashing out at innocent bystanders - turning those into an enemy as well.  And yes, that works at times.\n\n*\"an overwhelming majority crushing the rights of a small minority simply because they don't want them to have rights\"*  When you wrote that, what 'rights' did you had on mind?  My right to steal?  My right to kill?  My right to do anything in my ability to stay alive, even at the cost of others?  Those kind of rights?  You think rights like that go hand in hand with majorities?  Or would you expect the majority to actually abolish such rights and anyone who exercises them?\n\nYour 'rights' for me are moral convictions of individuals.  We all have them AND THEY DIFFER.  What you postulate as 'libertarian natural rights' to me are options of moral convictions, that you and others that call themselves libertarians more or less have.  That is it.  They are not special.  And I don't assume other people to have them.  \nAnd as argued they do not constitute rights you can reliably exercise without them being the majorities view on things and being enforced with the majorities force.  Calling them rights is actually ambitious at best.\n\nIt's like claiming that human rights are a valid concept in North Korea, they aren't.  They are being VIOLATED there.  One does NOT have those rights there.  Simple as that.\n\nAnd yes, especially as a German who grew up in the GDR (labelled 'the 2nd dictatorship on German ground in the 20th century') and who got lectured about Fascism plenty after re-unification I know pretty well how this shit works.  Rights are what you can exercise without being disciplined for it by the overwhelming force.  People had the moral conviction they could walk out of the GDR, others the moral conviction that those are traitors and they had to be stopped, with bullets.  And so \\~1000 people lost their lives. Except for cruel stuff no one got locked up after reunification.  So much for your 'rights'.\n\n*\"The libertarian ideology is extremely against centralized government and government authority.\"*  Your personal flavor of it is (at this moment).  \nAgain, how do libertarians as a society get to the rules that govern you? How do you make sure there are only libertarians in there?  What about the Marxists, Fascists, Slave Holders, Kinderschaenders, Thieves, Sociopaths, etc. pp.?  \nYou might be fine protecting yourself from those and enforcing your moral convictions. how about single mums?  Elderly?  etc.?  What do they do?  And how do you get to figure how their moral convictions mesh with yours?\n\n*\"the government is not their friend, does not have their best interests at heart\"* No one else than yourself (and fam +friends) has actually - that's how nature works and which leads to you wanting to bear arms, while being murky about how you get to the rules that govern you, while at the same time you want to be able to discipline anyone who \"misgoverns\" you.\n\n*\"they won't have to do anything, because the government can do it for them\"*  That's called cooperative work sharing among specialists.

It's been two days, and you keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how little sense it makes, and no matter how I restructure what I say to help you understand. You ignore all of it and say \"well what if it was a bunch of people.\" I'm done responding, have a good day",

But usually do people who state 'I want my freedom' not consider that their freedom ends where the freedom of other people starts.  Libertarian ideals (on the surface at least) seem to be unusually self-restraining / observant in this regard - but I know about a couple constellations where what self-declared libertarians want actually restricts the freedom of others unfairly.  But to go into this would require exchange of concepts that this medium here is not suited for per my experience.\n\n*\"this guy looks at things differently than I thought he did.\"*  Na, it's more a case of 'this guy looks at symptoms while I try to get him to see the big picture and root causes of those symptoms' - to the best of my ability (which might be flawed or insufficient, I admit as much).  As I said, I'm a control engineer and deal with systems and if they have a flaw that shows up as dysfunctional symptoms - I look for (root) causes, instead of trying to discuss the symptoms and how those can be lessened.",

If an administration is running out of favor due to incompetence or lack of promise keeping, they can be voted out and have a chance to either change the common people's mind or have another admin take over. \nThe only problem I would see with this is the same problem we have when it comes to the elect. col., do we allow the popular vote to speak for itself or have a group of representatives from each state determine the matter.

If you want competition there you need to get rid of that principle of only a few being in positions of law-making-power and have the people be the final arbiter on any law or regulation that is being proposed.\n\nAnd there is another trap there.. say you want A and I want B.  How do we solve this?  Ultimately with violence.  The bigger / stronger / meaner wins, so simple majority is NOT SUSTAINABLE as it isn't obvious what the stronger support has and thus it doesn't tay peaceful.  \nSo say we are 3 and two want A and one wants B.  What is the most likely outcome, A or B?  \nThis is the principle that underpins democracy, with absolute majorities (not simple ones).  It is obvious with 2 against 1 that the 2 will likely win this (violently, if push comes to shove).  This means the one opposer should from the get go peacefully knuckle under and accept his faith..  at even higher ratios it becomes even more apparent.  \nSo for any law or rule that is to be proposed to rule 'a people' would require 66.7% or more of 'the people' to say actually yes to it, for all of it to make sense and **stay peaceful.**  Abstentions should count as no, as otherwise people can be worn out to vote on an issue that they do have no interest in, as this creates absolute majorities although there are none there.\n\nThis would lead to very simple laws and only a few of them.  There still could be politicians, but their influence would be minimal and the best of them would probably the ones who propose simple, logical and useful laws that the people want to have.  Minorities - as long as they are social will also have nothing to fear.. asocial minorities on the other hand, yeah, but that is what societies are about - (ideally) they are frameworks that suppress asocial minorities (for reasons).\n\nSo much for the theory - practically this can't be established right away.  But there are options that deal with some aspect(s) of this that could be pursued that would help getting there.. but that's another topic.",

My life. Your life, if you're the one trying to take them from me. The only person who can decide when I can no longer tolerate that violation is me. When enough people feel they have suffered enough of the same violations, you get revolution. \n\nThe government is not your friend. It can only take and hurt. We have to decide what issues are so serious that taking and hurting is an acceptable cost.\n\nWhen 51% votes to shoot the other 49% thats democratic. It's not good, but it's \"fair\". Your point starts on the assumption that the federal government is a good thing. It's not good, but it is necessary for a small number of things. And those necessities are debated among libertarians. Libertarians do agree that the government is good at 1 thing only: violence. Don't kill or steal, or we'll take you to jail (or shoot you). Don't invade or attack our country, or we'll shoot you and anyone who looks like you. Pay your taxes, or we'll take you to jail. Come willingly to jail, or we'll start shooting. \n\nLibertarianism deals with this issue by decentralizing the power to govern. The more localized the authority is, the more the laws will represent the will of the people subject to those laws. If my neighbors and I dont want alcohol in our town, we can decide not to have alcohol in our town. If the people in the next town don't feel thaf way, my town can't tell them what to do. \n\nYour points demonstrate the exact reasoning for this. On a basic level - 100 senators, 435 Representatives, 1 president, 1 vice president, and 9 SCOTUS judges get to decide how ~360,000,000 Americans live. And people are naturally self-interested - they should have very limited abilities in order to limit the potential to abuse their power. Those 546 people can not possibly decide what is good for all people on all issues. \n\nI can absolutely spend my own money better than the government can. I can absolutely decide better how my kids can get the best education. I can absolutely decide what foods are best for me and my family. The list goes on. If someone lies to me about what they're selling me, that's fraud, and they should be sued/jailed. \n\nNo, I can't stop every burglar and thief or thug that wants to do me harm, but 2A says I can try. No, I can't stop foreign invaders terrorists from trying to kill me and take my country, but neither can the federal government - obviously (see pearl harbor and 9/11). \n\nLibertarians acknowledge that the government isn't God, or superman, or my dad. They know the government is imperfect, and sometimes you have to solve your own problems for the best result.",

It does have the power to enforce it's authority, but it gets this power consensually - through the consent of the governed. The governments of the world have abused that consent and slipped closer to tyranny. You are correct in saying that special interests have taken control - creating laws that stifle freedoms of the many, and benefit the few. This is only possible when power is centralized and concentrated. It's what is known as a BIG GOVERNMENT. Big Government is bad. \n\nYou're also not wrong in your identification of \"The King(s)\" not being accross the ocean this time. Again, too much power has been concentrated in one place. That concentrated power allows people who are willing to lie and steal from their fellow citizens to do just that. They sell their influence to the highest bidder. They abuse their power to get more power - creating a constantly growing government that represents less and less of what their citizens want. This is bad. \n\nI do not \"wish\" for these rights. They are mine. I was born with them. They were given to me by God, or Natures God, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, whichever.\n\nAnd yes, at the end of the day, I have to defend them. Just as you have to defend yours. Together we enter into a social contract to promise not to violate the rights of each other - we enlist the service of a government to provide laws, police, courts and prisons to enforce this contract. Lately, western democracies have abdicated this duty. Even the cowboys in the wild west had judges and sherriffs.\n\nI hope someone doesn't try to kill me. I hope someone doesnt try to steal my property. And I hope to make the best life I can for myself. But your point here is that these rights don't exist unless the people around me agree they exist. That is wrong. They still exist, even if they are being violated by my government, or my neighbor. The people who do not view these rights as universal, and inalienable, are tyrants, enslavers, murderers, and rapists. Violence is a last resort, but sometimes it is justified when those tyrants arise and attempt to violate those rights. You say others \"will act out\" to try and take those from me. Self defense is another of those universal rights. \n\nYou're view here seems to shift with the \"town sized kingdom\" example. Yes, tyranny is a constant threat. So because Sparta conquered Athens 3000 years ago we should all just surrender to all tyrants? You know how those nation wide ethics were imposed, right? The more powerful city-state killed all the armies in the less powerful city-states and forced their ethics on the remaining people. What you're getting at is called war. This is how empires are built. This is bad. How do we stop this? By keeping the power to do this in the hands of the people - where the power to govern comes from. The right to bear arms is another of those inalienable rights. An armed populace keeps a tyrannical government in check, and a military controlled by civilians keeps enemies away. \n\nNo - might does not make right. Man's ability to reason, empathize, and sympathize are only some of the traits that separate us from the animals. If you believe this, all crime is forgivable. Ukraine is rightfully part of Russia, all Palestinians deserve to die, rape murder and theft are all morally correct. This is not an opinion - only sociopaths look at life this way. \n\nI dont think you even understand what you're arguing. \n\n\"The power is not decentralized enough unless all people consent to the laws governing all people\" - without some type of genocide this is impossible. That is why we vote. Some people are not happy with the results, but you are free to make your opinion known. Democracy is not perfect, but it is better than tyranny. And since some people are not happy, we should make sure no one is happy? That is also bad. \n\nThe 546 people in Washington should have less power to tell the 360million everywhere what to do. Yes this will help a lot. California can decide what's best for California, New York can decide what's best for New York. If all 50 states are doing what's best for themselves, then the whole country is better off than before. Example, just because California thinks it should be illegal to drill for oil, doesnt mean Pennsylvania should suffer. It's their land, they can use it how they want. \n\nYour last argument that true competion only comes when all citizens are participating in the legislation? Thats neat. All 360million people can hop on a zoom and try to discuss how we should address the latest issue. Or we can have smaller groups each send a representative to speak to their interests - like we do. The US Constitution is truly a great work - it just needs to be upheld by a government that isn't corrupted. \n\nYour last few paragraphs are all presented like some kind of \"gotcha\". And it all boils down to you believing might makes right. But that isn't true. And not all libertarians think anarchy is the only true libertarianism.  Like I said in my first comment - the government is force. It is legalized violence. Because of this it must be applied the most sparingly. Might does not make right, and men are corruptible - we need to make sure there is not an avenue for those corrupt men to use that monopoly of violence for their own personal gain. Right now, thats not going so well.",

It does have the power to enforce it's authority, but it gets this power consensually - through the consent of the governed.\"*  Yes sure, but, what about the ones whose morals, ideals, wishes & mindsets oppose that of 'the governed'?  They are not part of your 'gang'.  They want something else, like slavery or whatever..  You just let them be?  I don't think so.  Do they have a right to slaves - given to them by their God or not?\n\nFurther.. those libertarian ideals in the form of enforced rules.. they need to apply to all equally, which means they must be unitary.  Equals only exist if all are being treated equally.  This means you got one set of rules that applies to all.  \nMy question now - HOW DO YOU GET TO THAT SET OF RULES?  \nYou assume that it's a bona fide copy of 'libertarian natural rights'.. I don't expect that.  So how would you figure out what is common among 'a people'?\n\n*\"The governments of the world have abused that consent and slipped closer to tyranny. You are correct in saying that special interests have taken control - creating laws that stifle freedoms of the many, and benefit the few. This is only possible when power is centralized and concentrated.\"*   One rule set for all means there is one form of force that is being applied to all.. this is a monopol.\n\nAgain, how do you get to the rule set?  How does your competitive process looks like for that?  What we got (representative democracy / constitutional republic) obviously does not work.\n\n*\"All 360million people can hop on a zoom and try to discuss how we should address the latest issue.\"*   How many basic rules on a federal level do we actually need?  How often will those change?  \nThere will be few and they will be simple.  \nYou want SMALL Gov, THAT IS SMALL.  You want competition, it doesn't get more competitive than that.\n\nYou can still have 'politicians' work out the legalese.. but the sovereign has to sign it off, ie the people.   If 'the people' don't understand it or doesn't like it - too bad - no law is being created.  End of Story.  And if polit's come up with laws every fortnight the sovereign will sooner or later stop paying those clowns that think people have nothing better to do than vote on new rules.\n\n*\"I do not \"wish\" for these rights. They are mine. I was born with them. They were given to me by God, or Natures God, as Thomas Jefferson wrote, whichever.\"*  Yeah, right. Which is why to have human rights(\\*) nation states sign up to enforce them internally - but you were born with them.  \nIf so, then I was born with the right to take whatever I want any time and anywhere I want with the means at my disposal and at the cost (and against the wishes) of others if that is opportune.  That is how nature works.  This is how bears, wolves, chimpanzees, etc.  essentially any living being out there exist, how they behave.  And even that is not a right, bec if any of those living beings runs into another living being that has a mind of its own, it's own WISHES, then it is clear that those are not rights.\n\n*\\*) rights: a moral or legal entitlement to have or do something.*",

The government should have every penny accounted for, fire, police, military etc. (wishful thinking) As a functioning society we need taxes.

Not that l\u2019ve wished bad on someone, but I think we\u2019ve all haven\u2019t been the nicest all the time. I think people need self reflection, realize they are part of the problem(not degrading yourself, but realize you aren\u2019t perfect and should nonstop work to better yourself), then make the change. So I\u2019m working on making sure I do my part in creating a good atmosphere for discussion. I also have to remember the majority of people regardless if I think they sound insane (not referring to you), come from good intentions even if it leads to bad outcomes. It\u2019s hard on Reddit but regardless of how hard it is I have to overcome it and do it anyway. This is a new goal I set for myself so there is no other option but accomplishing it. \n\nHonestly my reasons are way too much to type but I\u2019ll try to keep it short as possible even though the more details the better I can convey my point. Btw I don\u2019t mind sales tax because it\u2019s voluntary but I\u2019m definitely against wealth and income because that\u2019s involuntary since you either have to pay whatever they demand or go to jail regardless if they are even using the money for its purpose. Voluntary donations are good as well. Many people will voluntarily donate to things they care about and find important. I certainly do.\n\nIt\u2019s still their property regardless. I don\u2019t believe in taking from others just because they are doing better than you so they shouldn\u2019t care if we take it from them. That\u2019s the same mentality thieves have when they take your stuff. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t trust the government with redistribution of wealth or trying to create equal opportunity. They say they are helping people when they only use part of it to help and the rest goes missing or is misused. The government has a horrible spending habit and refuses to learn their lesson because we are their money machine so they don\u2019t care. They can\u2019t even give people here a proper social security check yet will use the money collected to fund foreign wars?\n\nMany wealthy people already redistribute their wealth in discrete ways without government involvement whether it be something as small as giving 50%-100% tips, voluntarily financing community projects, or donating to charities but because they\u2019re not making it well known people arent aware. It\u2019s interesting because when you announce what you do to the world they think you are just doing it for attention but if you do it discreetly people don\u2019t know you are doing it so they assume your not. So they want to take more from you not knowing what you already gave. Yea some wealthy people are stingy with their money but some are very generous.\n\n\nReferring to the fact that some people are born into better circumstances in certain aspects in their life is true, but people seem to only think about the people who have it better than them and completely forget about the fact that they themselves also have it better than a lot of people too. Unfortunately even if you would give everyone a million dollars to start off many people would still complain because of the simple fact that someone else has more regardless if their necessities are met. The more we feed into this \u201cwell since the rich has it better than me and it\u2019s unfair to me, we should take what they have\u201d the further people feel more entitled and can\u2019t even realize their own privilege. So I\u2019m not feeding into it anymore. There are people who live in huts and have to hike miles for fresh water who are more grateful for their lives than people who have way more than them. Are a lot of people even grateful that they have supercomputers in their pockets? Are people even grateful that they can walk into their bathroom to clean running water? That\u2019s a luxury that many people in the world don\u2019t have. Do people think about how they already have more than a lot of other people, majority of people don\u2019t. They are so used to their own privilege and luxury that they can only think about what they don\u2019t have. That\u2019s a human nature/ behavior problem that will always exist no matter how much money you give people. Bezos and Elon may have way more than me but I also have way more  than others. Even when I was only making minimum wage as an adult and could barely afford my bills, I still had more than others and never believed in taking from the rich. I just worked on myself to get better. You can strive for more of course. I encourage people to always accomplish their goals and better their life but not when it means taking it from someone else. There is a difference between \u201cI deserve and want what that person has and I\u2019m going to work to get it too\u201d vs \u201cI deserve and want what that person has, so I\u2019m going to take it from them\u201d.\n\nAlso personal accountability\u2026some people regardless of how much time, energy, guidance, and resources you give them will remain in a horrible situation due to their own decision making but since they are too busy blaming bezos they don\u2019t even fix the real problem which is themselves and their bad choices.  Unfortunately there will always be many broke people no matter how much money and opportunities you give them. I\u2019ve seen it first hand. When people get bonuses or tax refunds what do they do with it? Some will save it and pay off their debt or will they see it as an opportunity to buy unnecessary stuff? I know people who have received hundreds of thousands of dollars and instead of saving it and paying off their debt, they spend it on materialistic stuff and go back to being broke living paycheck to paycheck. I rather make sure my resources arent going to be wasted on people who will continue to make bad financial decision because that wasted money could actually go to someone who really is just down on their luck but will ultilize that money well and actually get better. Unfortunately most people can\u2019t admit they are part of the problem because it\u2019s so much easier to blame others. I don\u2019t think people deserve to take other people\u2019s money when they can\u2019t even admit they are partially  causing their own problem. My best advice that even helped me out of a long bad period of my life I never thought I could get out of and now I\u2019m accomplishing what I thought was impossible is to stop blaming the outside world and blame yourself. You\u2019d be surprised how much control you actually have over your situation when your main priority becomes self improvement instead of trying to make everyone else change things for you. I really want everyone to succeed but most people can\u2019t admit their own bad habits so they continue to make them and stay in the same place. I know it\u2019s hard to do self reflection but regardless you have to.\n\n\nI tried to convey my point across as best as possible even though there is so much more to be said to fully get my points across but it\u2019s already pretty long.",
