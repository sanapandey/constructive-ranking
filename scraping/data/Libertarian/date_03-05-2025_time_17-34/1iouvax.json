                                    "body": "I can try:\n\n1) Lowering corporate tax leads to lower prices for consumers *only if* companies decide to take their *new profit* and distribute it down to consumers.\n\n2) Raising or instituting tarrifs comes out of a companies profit margins unless they decide to forego those profits for the sake of a consumer.\n\nSo, in summary, for a consumer to get more money, a company must either 1) give up some of their new profit or 2) lose some of their current profit.\n\nHowever, in reality, I think cutting corporate taxes doesn't work for 2 reasons. The first is greed. The second is most corporations [don't pay](https://itep.org/amazon-avoids-more-than-5-billion-in-corporate-income-taxes-reports-6-percent-tax-rate-on-35-billion-of-us-income/) the current corporate tax rate, they pay their share of taxable income.\n\nFor example, Amazon notoriously pays very little in taxes because of their deductions. Let's say they need boxes, tape, package material, etc. Well, instead of going to a packaging company, they create one. Then this *new* company charges Amazon a ridiculous amount for their services. This gets to be a deduction for Amazon. They also use stock incentives for payment to employees. Which, in general, is a great idea because it incentives employees to want the company to succeed. However, the increase in stock value is [deductible by the company ](https://tax.kenaninstitute.unc.edu/news-media/why-didnt-amazon-pay-any-taxes-despite-having-huge-profits/) but not taxable as income despite the company still owning the stock (they aren't vested yet).",

I don't know if Amazon does this, but a lot of companies use overseas subsidiaries to avoid tax. \n\nThe subsidiary or new corporation is in a beneficial tax environment, like Ireland or Luxembourg. You license the right to do business from your US company to that new one and move all the profits to it. \n\nYou can't get the money back into the US (legally) without paying tax on it, but you can store it in those overseas banks and avoid taxes until you need it or find a loophole (like creating a new company).\n\nTo be clear, Amazon and those companies DO pay taxes. It's just not maybe as much as the original intent of the laws would have thought. \n\nFor example, there is Net Operating Loss (NOL). As a corporation, if you lost money that year, you generate a NOL. Those NOL's can roll forward until you have a profit.\n\nLet's say you make a company. The first year you lose 1M, next year you lose half a million. In year 3, you make 1.5M, but the company will pay 0 income taxes. This is intended to ensure companies can still invest, create jobs, and survive in the first few years that may not be profitable. However, it also allows a loophole.\n\nI don't know if Amazon does this, but a lot of countries use overseas subsidiaries to avoid tax. Basically, you make a corporation in a beneficial tax environment, like Ireland. (They are typically small island nations that don't have much in the way of resources, Bahamas, Cyprus, Malta, Ireland). Then, you license the right to do business from your U.S. Corporation to that corporation and move all the profits onto it. The problem is, you can't get the money back into the U.S. without paying tax on it, but you can stash it in an overseas bank account and avoid tax until you need it.\n\nCouple these together, and you get low tax costs and recurring NOL to keep your US-based company taxes low too.",

If Trump is legitimately in love with tariffs then that's bad.\n\nIf he's SAYING he loves tariffs as a way to play chicken, put a brick on the accelerator and bluff harder until the other guy swerve, that's good politics. I personally think he is putting pressure on the EU to get tariffs against the US removed, not somehow thinking that tariffs won't eventually cost the consumer more money.\n\nTime will tell, but if we keep screaming and crying about the libertarian high ground we will never accomplish anything.
