According to various sources consulted by\u00a0[*La Naci\u00f3n*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Naci%C3%B3n), Milei maintains that he and Conan first met in a previous life more than 2,000 years ago as a\u00a0[gladiator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator)\u00a0and a lion in the\u00a0[Roman Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Colosseum), and that the pair did not fight because they were destined to join forces in the future, referring to his presidential campaign.[^(\\[13\\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_(Javier_Milei%27s_dog)#cite_note-De_Guzman_2023-13)\n\nWhy does Milei use a mystic to speak to dogs as a joke? Why does Milei claim he and his dog were reincarnated as a joke? Why does Milei claim he and his dog were assigned a mission by God as a joke? What role does the lion reincarnated as a dog, who Milei definitely doesn't seek advice from, play in this God-given mission?",
