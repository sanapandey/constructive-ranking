    "selftext": "I think there exists a problem when people discuss capitalism because there are two very distinct definitions of the word.  \n**First definition, common for libertarians**: capitalism is when you are free to do anything with your property (trade, develop, defend, etc.).  \n**Second definition, common for the left**: capitalism is a type of relationship between you and your employees, mostly marked by the fact that you pay your employees fixed wages and pocket the rest (\"taxation\" of the surplus).\n\nWhen somebody writes \"Capitalism is freedom & creativity!\" or \"Capitalism is exploitation!\", one or the other assertion seems really strange if we don't consider this distinction. To be honest, the 1st type of \"capitalism\u201d is a newfound freedom we all cherish, and the 2nd type of \u201ccapitalism\u201d is a byproduct left over from feudalism.\n\nI just want to highlight that distinction and maybe spur a discussion around the 2nd definition. Is it good or bad? And how do we make ourselves better understood in leftist or rightist circles with a word so ambiguous? (please disregard my post on the anarchism subreddit, I was exclusively using the 2nd definition but its a good example of the huge disconnect)",

It means, in effect, that broad decisions over the generated profit are taken by employees. This is similar to how equity is shared among investors in publicly traded companies (in fact I can't come up with any difference between the two)",

If I paid my employee more than his productive worth then my company or product isn't competitive. If I paid my employee less than his productive worth it's so easy for my competition to offer him a better salary and keep all the best workers.\n\nFurthermore, what socialists criticize about capitalism (that it robs workers of their wages), is inherent and inevitable in socialism. A socialist society where all the means of production are state owned, with socialized healthcare, socialized education, socialized infrastructure, armies, etc, CAN ONLY BE MADE POSSIBLE BY PAYING THE WORKERS LESS THAN WHAT THEY PRODUCE AND USING THE DIFFERENTIAL TO FINANCE ALL THOSE THINGS.\n\nWhat are taxes, then, if not wage theft?",

But I don't see how a profit-sharing structure makes a company less price-competitive if all that is being shared is profit after expenses (expenses includes money saved for reinvestment). It's like saying giving dividends to investors makes a company inherently less profitable, which is true only if that money could have meaningfully been reinvested into the company. Sometimes its preferable to save, other times its preferable to cash out",

Worker-owned cooperatives are just companies where the employees are also partial owners. Where the ownership falls has nothing to do with being more or less competitive. In this case the worker/owner is receiving a salary based on his productive worth as an employee and also his share of profits for his capital invested in his own company. \n\nThat doesn't mean the company is paying him more as an employee, and that all other companies are robbing productivity from their own employees. It's just that other companies' productivity isn't adjudicated only to their employees by virtue of them being also owners, but to the capital invested initially by the actual owners, and the decisions made about what to do with that capital.",

For example: you can be capitalist but against the American corporate form, or for the LLC, or for some more European worker-owned forms. You can be capitalist but against consumerism and the need to make things more breakable, worse, cheaper, more addictive etc. \n\nYou can be a consumerist and believe in the importance of CSR and even be corporatist who thinks work should all be organized in a very specific way (eg 100% union owned) and therefore not be a capitalist. \n\nAnd so on",

They both make more money together then either one apart.  They both benefit from their agreement.\n\nWhat is more is that the risk is very different for both parties. The employee gets paid no matter how well the business is doing.  The risk is on the employer. If they have a bad day he makes nothing while the employee still gets paid. \n\nThis is why most people choose to be employees. Because there is a lot less risk and, most of the time, a lot less effort and commitment being a employee.  As a employee I can quit anytime i feel like it and move on.  And I done so more then once to get paid more. The owner of a company can't do that. \n\nAnd for every one billionaire out there there are tens of thousands of people just as driven and just as capable and just as smart that failed miserably and made nothing.  That is why it is idiotic to try to idolize and copy the behavior of a few hugely successful people.  Success for them is as much as a matter of dumb luck as it is hard work, intelligence, and drive.  Don't base your life on survivor bias.\n\nSaying that the employee \"steals the excess\" when they pay employees is like claiming \"I steal the excess when I purchase a apple\".  Because if I spend 75 cents on a Apple obviously the value of the Apple to me is higher then 75 cents. Because otherwise there wouldn't be any point in buying the apple in the first place. \n\nAll is this that nonsense around \"labor theory of value\" that was easily debunked in the early 1900s and was known to be flawed long time before that.   This isn't something that Marx got wrong all by himself. He borrowed wrong ideas from people that came before him and didn't have the insight or understanding of economics to be able to correct them. \n\nin fact it is so wrong it isn't even a argument that real Marxists make anymore.  They know it is dumb.\n\nThat is why it is very unfashionable to talk about economics among leftist circles.  They now focus only on \"social justice\" and such things because they know they lose on every economic argument.\n\nBelieve it or not one of the biggest arguments for socialism and communism was how vastly superior and more efficient that it is then capitalism and how it will be so efficient and so wonderful that people could just do whatever they wanted all day long and it will still just work out.  Which is complete bullshit and demonstrated by history.  They end up essentially enslaving entire countries to try to make it work and still came out vastly worse off then even very mediocre Capitalist economies. \n\nWhich is why they don't bother anymore with this nonsense.",
