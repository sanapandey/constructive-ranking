                            "body": "I can give you a few examples I was personally involved in:\n\n1.  In my state, we passed a constitutional carry law\u2026 Poof!  Less government.  By amending the law to allow constitutional carry, citizens of the state who may legally possess a firearm can now carry a concealed firearm.  No more safety course, proof of proficiency (like military training), background check, and no ability for state authoritarians to deny permit applications.  Yay for less government!\n\n2.  My state used the referendum process here to legalize same sex marriage, in the process overturning older laws designed to prohibit gay marriage by protecting \u201cTraditional Marriage\u201d.  I\u2019d still prefer the government get out of the marriage licensing business altogether, but hey\u2026 it\u2019s a start.  And conservative authoritarians who would use the power of government to enforce their view of morality on others.  Again, using the current political process to reign in government power and abuse.\n\n3.  Occupational licensing reform is an ongoing issue that has resulted in less government and more economic freedom.  My state isn\u2019t quite the worst when it comes to burdensome and just plain stupid licensing requirements\u2026 but it\u2019s not for lack of trying.  Have you ever heard of \u201cLog Scalers\u201d?  We\u2019re just one of two states that require this profession to be licensed.  If you wanted to braid hair in this state, you previously needed a cosmetology or barbering license.  That required hundreds of hours of classes and testing, at considerable expense in addition to applying snd paying for a license.  And it\u2019s important to note that you might not actually get the license even if you pass everything and pay all the money.  That\u2019s because many of the Boards issuing these licenses have \u2018good character\u2019 clauses they abuse to deny applicants.  Removing these occupational licensing requirements from professions and industries that don\u2019t really need them not only results in less government, less fraud, and less abuse\u2026 it unleashes the economic power and benefits of small businesses and gainfully employed professionals.\n\nThese are all examples of using the current political process to get less government.  I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re defining anarchy in this context, but hopefully these examples are illustrative.",

            "body": "My plan is to talk with people and share my observations & ideas to get them to come around to my position?\n\nThere are many practical reasons to reduce & decentralize the federal government that don't even require people abandoning their Democrat or Republican platforms.\n\nThe population & size of our union in the United States has become too large to reasonably represent at the federal level. There were not 50 states and 300+million citizens when the constitution was established. A senator in Congress represents *millions* of constituents these days. It is absolutely not practical for Congress to legislate matters such as welfare programs and education when people have so little influence or access to them at this scale. The scope of the federal government in a republic should match the scale at which it is needed, and no more than that - things like national security, foreign policy, international trade, maintaining interstate transportation, and managing our borders. There is no practical reason why the federal government needs to regulate our systems of healthcare, safety nets, education funding, and so on. \n\nMost states on their own are large and productive enough to be their own country. And a citizen's influence is far greater at the state level than it is the national level. Your state legislators often only represent 10s of thousands of people, maybe 100 thousand or two in a district - not MILLIONS. They are far more accessible and able to be influenced than your representatives in Congress. \n\nI used to be active in my state politics and it's really incredible how much of our power is wasted on people being obsessed with national government where their voice amounts to a passing whisper in the breeze. I have frequently sat down and met with my state legislators, had engaging conversations with them, etc. It's not even very hard to get everything set up. If I wanted to meet with my representative in Congress, I would need to be lucky enough to just pass them by at an exclusive political event or fundraiser or I would need to have some kind of clout to make me \"somebody\" enough to pay attention to and schedule a meeting with, usually interest group organizations.\n\nThis is all to say, it simply makes way more sense to leave the vast majority of issues up to the states to resolve. Allow them to function as intended and give people the freedom to participate in influencing policy to better represent their unique needs. For example, the needs of gun control are vastly different in the state of California vs Alaska. Ergo, Alaska doesn't have a rampant history of gang violence and violent crime. They are a remote wilderness state where people actually have to contend with large predator animals regardless of how blue any one resident might bleed. In fact these nuances make it very challenging for the current political parties to establish a cohesive national platform. The geography, ecology, culture, resources, etc of each state are so varied from one to the next that it is merely impossible to adequately address all of their priorities in one-size-fits-all legislation at the federal level. \n\nI'm willing to make more policy concessions at the local level because I don't really think it is possible to actually make everybody want or need or prioritize the same things I do. I don't necessarily think everybody should either. BUT I'd much rather participate in a system where I have more influence & where I can talk with my neighbors and share our points of view and negotiate solutions in good faith as opposed to what we have right now where the majority of people are apathetic and unengaged. I don't think it is unreasonable to feel apathetic towards politics at this scale. People can barely manage to be engaged with 50 people in their lives let alone millions. But I think if we can shift things in a more grassroots direction we will at least have greater opportunity to enact creative and innovative solutions to community problems. I would like to see more diversity in this regard.",
