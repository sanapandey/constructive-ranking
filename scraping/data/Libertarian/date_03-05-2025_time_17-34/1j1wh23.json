            "body": "Your money is worth more when the government stops stealing it. The true value of the dollar is the labor performed to earn it. When the government steals it and \"redistributes\" it, it devalues, as it was not earned. When it is stolen and given to foreign actors, it shrinks our economy as a whole. When every exchange for goods and services is taxed it forces more people into poverty.\n\nEven with the reduction of government, we still face many fundamental crisis in the US to reverse the downward spiral we've begun. Rather than tariff we should be offering free trade with countries in return for their cooperation on any foreign policy issues we face at the borders or elsewhere. It would be the only way to grow manufacturing within the United States for the long term. \n\nOur current energy plans are to pitch clean energy as a way to secure campaign funding but continue to use coal and fossil fuels. This will have to be a complete 180. If fixing the environment isn't your thing, energy independence is essential going forward if we are to become a beacon of free trade. Requiring another country's resources to function as a society has impacted every foreign policy choice we've made since the oil embargo in the 70s. \n\nThe Pentagon is going to be the biggest piece of this puzzle, one that a country like Argentina does not have to deal with because, well, we are their Pentagon. And a lot of other countries as well. They've never passed an audit. How much of it can realistically go away without destabilizing the entire world is going to be the $1 trillion question.\n\nThe DMV could be eliminated with a federal ID system tied to your SSN. Plates are merely operator tax tags so you pay your state the same as you would and frankly, our driving tests in most states are an absolute joke. Make  driving part a of high school curriculum, maybe take six weeks of square dancing and turn it into driving education and have the tests conducted during school hours. DMV eliminated.",
