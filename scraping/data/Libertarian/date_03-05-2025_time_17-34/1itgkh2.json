Some here believe he is super authoritarian.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s still important to note when he actually has good ideas; such as cutting the \u201cdefense\u201d budget.\n\nI have doubts congress would pass anything like this, considering the reported House GOP budget bill called for increases in defense spending.",

For these principles we\u2019ve been shouting from the rooftops for years to finally get into the \u201cmainstream\u201d politics of America this is a major win.
