They believe that if things get worse, instead of being a neoliberal normal, that a revolution will take place and they can install their communist utopia.\n\nAnyone else I believe to be thinking more about group identity.  Kind of like when someone says they're a \"libertarian\" and they something along the lines of \"we have to tax something.\" If you sway in a different direction at all then that means you're an \"opponent\". \n\nIf I agree 50% with you, then we may actually overlap in where we frequent,  so it's easier to get into fights with these people so you see it more.",

            "body": "From what I can tell, they typically hate people they categorize as \"fascist\" or \"fascist-adjacent\" the most, where people who have significant political or economic power and use it to uphold wealth inequality (especially in violent ways) are the first people they put in that category, and people who purposefully promote ideas that discriminate against other people based on physical immutable traits with the main purpose being either discrimination or upholding wealth inequality are the second. They consider them as having decided to make violence against disadvantaged people a core value and as likely unwilling to change so they don't bother engaging with them, and in their community circles hating them is already a given so it's not brought up as much (also considering them violent and threatening along with often knowing people who have been victims of it is why they support use of violence against them in response).\n\nWhen it comes to other non-leftists, it becomes more nuanced. People who treat politics like a purity contest tend to throw all of them in the \"fascist\" category, and those people tend to be very loud as well. Others take into account environmental factors like economic status, the education system, availability of healthcare services, and surrounding culture, and judge people based off of that and usually consider them \"victims of the system\" instead.\n\nOn the internet, \"progressives\" are the most similar to them so they tend to be who they spend most of their time around and are the most likely to sway, and as a result they also tend to be who they get into arguments with the most. They also overall felt betrayed by people who previously branded themselves as progressive then flipped on border and trans issues or started openly promoting racism toward Latinos and Arabs due to losing the election, so that has been a major source of criticism as well.",
