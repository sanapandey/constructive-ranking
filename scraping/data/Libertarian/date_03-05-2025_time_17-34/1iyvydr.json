You're saying something is a fact, yet if I ask 10 different people what that term means I will get 10 different answers.

How many people do you know that identify as \"Christian Nationalists\"?  I'm generally Christian and a libertarian nationalist and I don't identify that way.  \n\nAlso, from a purely logistical point of view, how does one shrink government and then also impose a theological government at the same time?  I can't think of any theocracy that has a small government.  Especially one with a Constitution that specifically bars government from sanctifying a state religion.  \n\nChristians believe in a higher power above government.

Just because someone asks you to clarify your opinion doesn\u2019t mean they lack their own perspective on the matter. Maybe try to be less abrasive/demeaning and focus on developing a well-reasoned argument\u2014writing in all caps doesn\u2019t make you more right or contribute to a constructive conversation.\n\nYour comment is a bit of an oversimplification. Yes Jesus was crucified by the Roman authorities, but his death was driven by the religious leaders of the time who saw him as a threat to power (Matthew 26, John 11). The Roman governor was even reluctant to crucify him. \n\nIf your argument is that supporting law enforcement is ironic bc the govt executed Jesus, then by that logic any form of government or authority would be inherently wrong, but the Bible doesn\u2019t take that stance. Paul affirmed that the governing authorities can be legitimate enforcers of justice and Jesus acknowledged the role of government when he said \u201cgive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s and to God what is God\u2019s\u201d (Mark 12:17). \n\nThe real issue isn\u2019t authority but how it\u2019s used. Jesus advocated for justice and righteousness. Corrupt or unjust law enforcement, like what happened in Jesus\u2019 trial, is obviously wrong but that doesn\u2019t mean all law enforcement is inherently bad. Plenty of police officers serve with integrity and uphold justice, which aligns with Christian values. Someone who displays the above pictured cross is saying they believe in justice, protecting the innocent and maintaining peace and find their faith & hope in Jesus. \n\nSo I can see how you\u2019d think it would be ironic, but I disagree.",

I\u2019m talking specifically within the US - as the symbol is a blue line within the American flag. So that is the context I\u2019m going off of for this conversation. \n\nThis also doesn\u2019t change the fact that Jesus, regardless of the known corruption, still supported law and justice. That is why he was willing to pay the price of sin on the cross, the carry the weight of the penalty we would otherwise have to pay for. The wages of sin is death and he took that on. If he didn\u2019t believe in Justin or the law, he couldn\u2019t have had to die.

Libertarians generally support law enforcement that exists to protect individual rights and privacy, maintain order, and ensure rule of law. Of course while opposing militarization and intrusive policing policies. \n\nSo you might want to stop calling yourself a Ron Paul Libertarian, it seems as though you don\u2019t actually agree with Ron Paul or the majority of libertarians. I\u2019m getting more of an anarchistic vibe honestly, which is fine but maybe you should really explore your beliefs and what they mean. \n\nWe are just going to have to agree to disagree at this point because your argument is pretty in-cohesive and scattered.",

In Romans 13:1-7 we learn that the powers that be are chosen by God to have said power to advance his will. That could be for the good or bad for the people, but those will generally advance the will of God. Yes yes, Hitler, but look at what that did, it brought the Jews back to the land of Israel, that was given to them by God (yes, I am a Zionist). In the old testament much, much worse was done to the House of Israel. All of these examples brought them closer to the Almighty God and his will.\n\nIn Matthew 22:21 Jesus says, \"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.\" This is specifically talking about taxes, but also speaks to civil obedience in general. There are instances where those are not to obey authority, but only when going against God's will/commandments. For example, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in Daniel Chapter 3, or taking the mark of the beast outlined in Revelation 13. \n\nThere is a LOT more that would need a lot more context and explaining, but in general, Christians should be \"model citizens\" until it contradicts what God tells us to do. So for me, I will follow all firearm laws, zoning laws, tax law, and so on. Not because they are constitutional, but because God told me to. Fortunately, the 1st amendment says it is fine for me to criticize these laws, and show they that are unconstitutional.\n\nThe bottom line is my job as a Christian is to make sure that no-one has anything against me other than their hate that I follow Christ and acknowledge God's authority and commandments. As well as to preach the Gospel that Christ was alive, lived a sinless perfect life, was crucified in place of us for all sins, and rose again never to die again, defeating death and giving a pathway for everlasting life to all that believe on him.\n\n  \nIf anyone wants to chat or ask questions feel free to message me, I am available at all times.",
