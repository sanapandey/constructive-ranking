    "selftext": "Is there still a push to end income taxes for Americans living abroad or has that prerogative been abandoned?  It was one of Trumps talking points before he took office.  I don't expect Trump to deliver on every single promise, but it seems like this should be a pretty bipartisan policy considering USA is the only developed country in the world that does this.  \n\nAnyone else thinking about this and should I hold out hope?\n\n",
