Tariffs in 2024 only brought in a total of 77 billion. Our tariffs would have to be insanely high and coupled with massive cuts to the government, which I think even from a libertarian perspective, would be excessive.  Not to mention the backlash from other countries enacting their own tariffs in response. It's just not feasible.",
