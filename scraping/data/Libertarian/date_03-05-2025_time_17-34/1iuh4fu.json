Just letting you know where I'm from so you understand that I've experienced government overreach my entire life\u2014also, because Argentina is the greatest country in the world, and all other countries are run by little girls.\n\nSpeeding is bad; we can all agree on that. But it can be addressed simply by installing speed bumps in specific places, making it impossible for people to speed wherever they are present. There are many types of speed bumps designed for different speed limits, and they work fine. Installing CCTV cameras to issue speeding tickets, on the other hand, is just a way for the state to generate extra revenue.\n\nI've been living for many years in a country that had a liberal free-market system for decades. A few years ago, however, the people elected a president who is extremely left-leaning and expanded welfare programs to an unprecedented degree. This country, fortunately, doesn't have the ability to print money to cover expenses (though the current administration would certainly love that), so they started raising taxes. When further tax increases became politically unfeasible, they resorted to raising fines for speeding and vehicle irregularities, even inventing arbitrary rules with heavy penalties (such as requiring car windows to be engraved with the license plate number).\n\nTo be honest, it all feels very familiar to me\u2014I've seen it happen in Argentina many times.",

The speed bumps that are on roads with speeds of around 25mph are all gentle rolling speed bumps, which I assure you do not slow down speeders who are intent to speed. My car has stiff suspension and is slightly lowered, and I barely feel those speed bumps if I angle it right. There has also been a study that suggests speed bumps cost more lives than they save because...while those speed bumps don't slow down speeders much (and if it does, the difference in speed rarely results in a life saved), it DOES slow down certain emergency response vehicles, particularly ambulances, which increases response times, when every second that goes by reduces the survival rate of a person.",
