Do you believe it has the potential to cause great harm? Do you see it to have any positive benefit whatsoever?\n\nPersonally, I am in the dead center on a lot of things. Namely because many stances inherently cannot be claimed to be the objectively right direction. Some sweet spot in between is most ideal, in my view. \n\nRegardless, I am very much against psychiatric medicine. I am against it being handed out like candy, some \u201csilver bullet\u201d, in the face of a diagnosis based on fundamentally flawed \u201cscience\u201d. I am very against harming people\u2019s minds with drugs. I am against damaging children\u2019s development due to the ostensive \u201cauthority\u201d of psychiatric doctors.\n\nYou might find I disagree with some of you on other things, but I\u2019m curious to see your opinions on the \u201cscience\u201d of psychiatry, psychology, \u201cmedicine\u201d, in general.",

            "body": ">What do you think, overall, about psychiatric medicine in general? Do you believe it has the potential to cause great harm?\n\nI started medication to treat ADHD recently. It has been working amazingly so far. Of course, it can be abused and that's why it's a controlled substance, but when taken in therapeutic doses it treats my disorder well. I pinkie promise I won't be getting high off of them!\n\n>I am against it being handed out like candy, some \u201csilver bullet\u201d\n\nCompletely agree with you. it took me 2 months, 3 interviews and a tox screen for me to be allowed to take this. Is there any specific situations you are referring to?\n\n>in the face of a diagnosis based on fundamentally flawed \u201cscience\u201d\n\nAre you talking about any specific diagnosis? Because my ADHD is very real and has proven a major impact on my life.\n\n>I am against damaging children\u2019s development due to the ostensive \u201cauthority\u201d of psychiatric doctors.\n\nThis is a perfectly reasonable take. I too believe that children should be given time for their mind to develop before giving them drugs that could change the way their brains work. Until they are older, therapy and behavioral changes should be the priority imo.\n\ndrug advertisements are annoying AF and i don't want to be seeing HIV ads and oh oh oh ozempic commercials every break. But it is not the right of the government to be stepping in the way of the free market.",

                            "body": ">What specifically did you look for with treatment?\n\nWon't be getting too in-depth to my personal health online, but I find myself incapable of focusing on what needs to be done, despite my best efforts to treat myself. I am no stranger to such procrastination, but last semester it turned from procrastinating and getting assignments in 10 minutes before the due date to 10 minutes after the due date, tanking my grades, which is what initially pushes me to seek diagnosis. While that was my original concern, when the psychiatrist started asking yes/no questions for symptoms, I answered yes to nearly all of them. He said that while it was normal to have a few of those symptoms from time to time, it is common in ADHD to have most of these symptoms all the time. \n\n>I assume you are confident in, and validated by, that diagnosis.\n\nThe diagnosis was mostly meant to be the precursor to some sort of treatment. I was 99% sure I had adhd, and if I sent you one video of me as a kid you would understand immediately. \n\n>Regardless, it seems the criteria to be diagnosed for ADHD is overly broad as to be absurd.\n\nYeah, if you look at any one of the criteria, you might be like \"wtf these are normal things\", but the point is that ADHD people have the majority of them 24/7, non stop, which inhibits our ability to, basically, function well in society. \n\n>Genetic tests, too, seem to be meaningless.\n\nif we are still on the topic of ADHD, then im not sure what you are referring to. as far as i know, there are no genetic tests for ADHD.\n\n>So, I guess you could say, my trust in psychiatry and psychology has greatly withered.\n\nThat's perfectly fair, and if you have a kid then it is up to you whether or not to trust the word of a psychiatrist. As a libertarian, however, stay away from my very justified treatment.",
