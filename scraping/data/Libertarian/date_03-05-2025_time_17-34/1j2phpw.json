    "selftext": "Long time conservative, newer libertarian here. I personally lean conservative but politically I feel more libertarian because I feel like it makes the most sense for Americans. Live and let live. That said, the longer I live, the more I see on social media, the more I wonder, how do we ever reconcile and find unity? Or do we? I feel like we each have such VASTLY different ideas about what makes a great country and government. It feels like the things we value are completely POLAR opposite. While one group of Americans is cheering that Roe v Wade was sent back to the states, another group is reeling, grieving, and furious. While one group is loving all these drastic cuts to the government, another group is devastated and literally asking for more government oversight and taxation. What one side sees as a huge win the other side sees as a huge loss. And then people make broad brush statements like, \"I just can't work with someone that doesn't value \"X\" because this is SO important. It's a moral thing.\"\n\n\n\nAre we just in a perpetual state of fighting? Is this why there was always one big uniparty for years and hardly anything ever got done in government? So that it would appear to the American people that there was some semblance of stability and unity rather than swinging the pendulum violently to one side or the other every 4 years? \n\n  \nHonestly, I'm just confused and frustrated and feel like a child of divorce. Last election, when Biden won, I thought, okay great. I don't like him, but maybe the country will have some peace again. The left got what they wanted and they can stop complaining about Trump and we can move on. But there still wasn't any peace and they still wouldn't shut up about him. \n\n  \nI feel like I personally can work with people with different values from me and understand their concerns because I can empathize and understand why X issue is important to them (but isn't necessarily important to me) but I don't feel like I'm afforded the same empathy/grace/understanding in return. I really try to see both sides of a situation and try to apply the same logical thought process and standards across all arguments (\\*try\\*-- I'm not perfect obviously!). It feels like so many people out there can't understand there's two sides to every situation. There's so much black and white thinking (on both sides). It's hard for me to wrap my head around and I don't know how this country can ever find unity.",

I avoid tv news, I do not use my phone when other people are around, whether that is SO, kids, friends, anyone.  Only use the phone for research when with others.\n\nBasically I only allow myself to go on social media when I am alone and can\u2019t do anything else.\n\nThat helped a lot.  I peruse Reddit still more than I should.  Vast majority are unhinged, but I don\u2019t think they represent a very large swath of the population.  Just look at all the protest posts and then 50 people show up at these protests.  So\u2026\n \nMy final takeaway is that I think the extreme perspectives you see are only online.  Few people in real life are that far apart on issues that it affects their ability to interact with other humans.",

Life is not a zero-sum game, and motives can be fluid. In any scenario, everyone involved has their own motives.\n\nYou seem well on your way to unconventional thinking, and you understand that shoehorning millions of individuals into two 'choices' is very problematic. Yet, I couldn't help noticing that while you rightly decry 'black and white thinking,' your writing is rife with it. All your examples are binary and framed on a left/right axis. To many libertarians, that is a false paradigm. It's a difficult mindset to evolve away from, to be sure. At least you're trying, which is more than most can say!\n\nPut simply, 'wedge' issues aside, Team Blue and Team Red are at their heart both collectivist, authoritarian statists who don't give a damn about the NAP. Both are antithetical to libertarianism and both are destructive to - and often downright contemptuous of - liberty. Never forget that and you'll be miles ahead.\n\nConsider retaking the long-form 'political compass test.' Learn more about yourself, then read libertarian theorists and set out to define your own principles. Internalize them and strive to live by them. BE the change you want to see, and let the NAP be your guiding compass. YOU are the only person YOU can truly control, in other words. \n\nStudying game theory couldn't hurt, either.",

It seems that they saw my desire for freedom/choice/transparency/less censorship as attacks on their own belief systems and my care about theirs (and others?) personal health. They definitely felt they had the moral high ground and just pulled away, unfriended me, and even said some pretty bold things to me. Now that all that has calmed down, it's not like anyone has come back to me saying, \"you know, you were right. There wasn't any evidence behind 'X' policy.\" I have great support systems in my life, so I shouldn't feel sad about losing \"old friends\" but sometimes I still do. I guess since 2020, I don't see the world ever going back to the way it \"was\" (in my perspective anyway) and it feels like the polarization will only continue to worsen.",

In addition, if a hospital says this and it's important to the people living there that they do not, that opens a rift in the market where there is now a service not being provided (healthcare without these kinds of potential issues), so now someone builds a new competing hospital there who doesn't do that and that puts the old one out of business because nobody wants to use that one.\n\nEducation already isn't free. I pay more in taxes every year than many people make, and I'm far from rich. If I wasn't taxed but instead the market provided the services the government currently taxes us for, these services would be better and cheaper. I would be able to pick and choose where my money went, including education. Education would now need to actually compete with one another, further raising the quality.\n\nMedicine would drop in price. Vaccines would likely be free because preventative care saves more money than it costs once you actually obtain the sickness of which the vaccine is meant to prevent.\n\nEverything you're talking about is either provided by the market or the people don't want it. You can't say that people wouldn't pay for roads for instance if they weren't forced to. WHO exactly won't pay for roads? You? I need roads, so I would pay for them. If you wouldn't, that sounds like you projecting. Who are these proverbial \"barbarians\" who wouldn't pay for these things? You and your friends? I don't know a single person who wouldn't pay to have roads.",

In many cases, nope, there\u2019s no profit to be made.",

Ownership simply means having a will to hold exclusive authority over a thing of which was not made manifest by initiating actions against someone who already held such a will. In short, you cannot own something you steal.\n\nSo all roads would be private property, or just property. The people or person who owned the roads would decide, but likely what would happen is they would get together with the owners of other roads and would negotiate a system where they perhaps all agree to use a single device in a car that you would pay a one time annual fee for and once owned, you could drive on all those roads. Imagine owning a road and refusing and trying to set up a huge toll. Other people who own roads or other property are just going to build another road adjacent to yours and not do this and then nobody will use your road.\n\nAnother likely thing is because you were being such a tool, people might even go further and boycott you. Grocery store owners could literally refuse to sell you food because in a free society you actually have freedom of association.\n\nLikely huge regions that might even be so large as to encompass an entire state's worth of land might all get in on this because most people don't need to drive on most roads, so if they all get in on that they can at least get a fraction of the overall payments people are making.\n\nHell, you don't even need to fine people who drive on your roads and don't buy one of these devices. You might just put them on some kind of list so people in those communities can see who use their roads and refuse to pay. Suddenly you go to a store and that shirt that was $14.99 is actually $24.99 because you're on the proverbial \"selfish list.\"\n\nAll of this stuff is done the same kind of way that it's already done today in any other area that the government doesn't control. It's all just done by way of consent.\n\nThink about Netflix or work from home environments. When the first individuals proposed Netflix, people literally laughed at them and said that would NEVER work. Now Netflix dominates and virtually every Blockbuster-like movie rental store has utterly vanished. And with work from home? I was a manager at a call center in the early 2000's talking about how we should get ahead of the curve and start a work from home environment that would solve a large influx of issues, from paying for seats to not enough seats in the call center, and all the other costs and issues that step from having bodies in an office. I was turned down saying it'd never work.\n\nYears later I worked for one of the big retailers in their corporate office and brought up the same thing. I was told it wasn't feasible. Then literally the following year Covid happened and we did in 6 months what we were told was impossible. It became a worldwide phenomenon that still works today. The company I work for now for example doesn't even have a home office. All of our employees work remotely.\n\nRoads are NECESSARY, so people WILL FIND A WAY to have roads. You can't have a system where some roads cost $1,000 to drive on because we still have trade requiring those roads for transport. The big companies alone would find a way to make sure that roads are there, in good condition, and that people can use them. How does Walgreens, Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Home Depot, Kroger, etc., run a business if there are no roads, if roads aren't being properly upkept, or have to pay huge fees to use them? They don't.\n\nHow is it in your best interest to own some road and demand exorbitant costs when you also NEED these companies to function? How do you get food to your home as owner of a massive road if the companies who provide food can't get to you, or refuse to because of the cost?\n\nYou have to remember something here: Think of Jeff Bezos for a minute. Pretty wealthy guy, right? But Jeff Bezos is only as wealthy as we allow him to be. If tomorrow everyone in the world simply refused to trade with Jeff Bezos then it doesn't matter how much money he has, Bezos suddenly becomes the poorest man on earth.",

Many companies own small portions of road and keep them in far better condition than government roads.\n\nWhat you're speculating is predicated on being brought up in a system of government schools who spread government propaganda. You've been raised to be a statist to such a degree that you can't fathom a world where the state doesn't pretend it's your parents.\n\nWhat I was stipulating could be a possibility for roads if the government didn't do roads is just an idea. I don't know what people would do to solve that problem, but it would be solved.\n\nI mean, how do roads work when you drive from the US to Canada, or from the US to Mexico? You don't suddenly pay for roads in Canada either, but your money as an American doesn't go to Canada's roads, so there's already a real-world example of a situation with roads where you can travel on roads owned by \"someone else\".\n\nAgain, there's nothing you can get with authoritarianism that you can't get with consent.\n\nAnd again, you can't just drive across the country wherever you want and not pay for it. Illinois for example has the second-highest property taxes in the country at 2.11%, nearly double the national average. The typical homeowner pays upwards to $7,000 per year just for owning property, and that doesn't even include state income taxes or sales taxes. Have you ever driven through Illinois? They have tons of toll roads. It's not difficult to pay $10 or more for a single trip a few hours through Illinois, depending on which roads you take and what kind of car you drive. Trucks even pay more than cars.\n\nThen if you travel through Illinois and into Wisconsin, Wisconsin has lower taxes and almost no tolls, and if you travel into Canada from Wisconsin you don't have  to pay Canada to continue driving on their roads. Nothing is free though.\n\nThe point of my analogy of what might be done for roads without the government is just one of an infinite number of solutions. I'm not responsible for coming up with a solution here. I didn't come up with the Netflix technology, or the technologies and strategies which allows Amazon to ship products same-day when the United States Postal Service can't deliver a package same week after using tax dollars AND having someone pay for it even though it hemorrhages around 9.5 billion a year and has several monopolies on things like the right to deliver letters and the right to access mailboxes. All this is true ALBEIT the USPS having low interest loans from the US Treasury, Exemptions from state and local taxes, Exemptions from parking tickets and vehicle fees, Government regulatory power, and Power of eminent domain.\n\nThat's how bad government efficiency is. USPS loses 9.5 billion annually while UPS has a revenue of $91.1 billion and FedEx, $87.6 billion.\n\nNot to mention that if I order something from Amazon it arrives at my house often same day for zero cost.\n\nPeople will find solutions. The thing here is that it's very confusing to hear people still buy into the statist propaganda. You're trying to convince me that if someone doesn't put a gun to your head and force you to give up some of your labor then you what, wouldn't pay for things like schools, roads, or security? With respect, are you stupid?\n\nAnd if you would then you're proving part of my overarching point here. You can't say you would but nobody else would. Who are these other people who wouldn't, exactly? Do you think you're just more intelligent, wiser, and more moral than everybody else or something?\n\nNobody has to donate to charity either, but in 2023, the charitable giving in the US was $557.16 billion. That's more than the GDP of 157 countries out of 181. It's greater than the total GDP of Ireland, Thailand, Israel, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Greece, etc.\n\nAnother thing to remember is because the government is so terrible at everything it does, it's hard to even estimate how much money it wastes in its endeavors. According to the General Accounting Office, the fed made $236 billion in improper payments in 2023 alone, including $175 billion in overpayments. The same agency estimates that the fed loses up to $521 billion annual just to fraud.",
