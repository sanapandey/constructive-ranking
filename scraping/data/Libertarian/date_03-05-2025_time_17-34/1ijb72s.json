            "body": "Does anyone have good resources on what the ED does and how the budget is allocated?\n\nThere are certain things that I get called a leftist on, and maybe that is true, but I want to live in a society where all children are given the opportunity for a publicly funded education because I think and educated society is better for those people overall.  And I think all should have equal opportunity to it.  There are already issues with the systems with quality of education already varying significantly by the tax system that supports it.\n\nI think there is justified concern with the wise use of funds.  And maybe the ED really is a complete tax sink with absolutely no good.  What I am fearful of without the ED the curriculum going back to the states and getting perverted with religion.  I am fearful of reverting to special needs being disregarded.  I'm fearful of the vouchers being an excuse to close public schools in favor of for profit schools. I am fearful of areas that are not doing well to get way worse when you start reducing the funding even further.\n\nI think better understanding what the ED does and doesn't do is a good place to start to I can educate myself on the rest.\n\nOnce again, I understand I am in the minority here but I truly want to be better understand why this is the libertarian position.  I am probably also biased because I've always had teachers in my family and have been successful coming from public education, both in primary and higher education.\n\nSo why should the ED be vanished?  And also, why should the public school system be replaced with a for profit model?",

The military, Congress, and foreign affairs,  should be the purview of the federal government. I don't believe in less taxes at all. When you look at the OECD and G7 and so on, we're actually taxed relatively  less when it comes to income taxes. I think the tax structure just needs flipped. The municipality in which you live in should get what you pay into federal instead and provide the amenities that keep citizens and business wanting to stay. Pretty simple. Can I provide a country that's implemented such a structure lol nope, but it's at least refreshing to see someone has a similar take if nothing else.",

At least with Mises stuff I'm not concerned with any ulterior motive or influence, generally speaking very consistent with their approach of limited government and free market solutions.\n\nI think it was interesting and showed a hole in my news that I was not aware of the recent \"scandals\" involving the ED, especially with FAFSA.\n\nI think in general I assumed that the ED was more involved in providing services and funding than they actually are.  It really does appear the exponential growth of the budget in the last 2 decades has been due to the student loan program that has had the opposite effect than intended, by trying to provide affordable higher education they have in fact made it ever more outrageously expensive.  For this reason I think I would support the ED being shuttered, at least that portion. One  thing I wonder though, are the current prices the new baseline or could the free market provide reduce in costs for this product/service that we see in the technology realm through competition?\n\nSo regarding Title I funding, that wasny really addressed fully.  Is this the type of funding that gets held up with the Federal restrictions and are those cumbersome?  I actually am on board supplementing the really poor areas with tax funds from other areas to try and improve outcomes and ensure access to education. But the results don't show improvement from the investment.\n\nI didn't see much written on special needs funding.  When I look at the federal budget for FY 2025 there is a decent chunk for that.  I think there is a large concern that without this funding those services would not be provided. I'm not ok with the libertarian take that they should be paying way more for those services or that we should fully rely on philanthropy to fill that void.  I've heard way too many individualist views that are basically fuck you, give me mine and leave me alone.  This is the type of stuff I'm not ok with that.\n\nSo overall, once again,n thank you for sharing.  Ilafyer reading I think there is solid reasoning for the argument to end the ED.  I would likely be on board if there was a way to guarantee that states still provided the special needs services without an unnecessary burden.  And there has been too much politics involved in the real or perceived ransom of funding for states.  The initiatives should be straight forward enough that an entire state would not ball at them.",

But Uber comes in and provides better paying jobs for drivers, and reduced fees for customers. They gain market share.  They price the competition out. With the monopoly they've gained, they then cut wages and increase costs.  This is a gross simplification , there is also still some competition with Lyft and taxis, but I envision this being the same. They started with a non optimal system, found ways to improve it, and then found ways to exploit it.  I struggle providing that opportunity for exploitation for basic necessary services for things like education.  Right now there is the freedom of choice for the wealthy, with little to no choice for the less fortunate.  But would vouchers just lead to an illusion of choice feom the private sector? Would we also not see the issue with college tuition inflation then with elementary tuition?  Where regardless of operating cost the minimum tuition will at least be the voucher value?\n\nI also see a big risk for cutting out special needs.  Many private schools don't offer this and they are referred back to the public school system. Why? Because it is expensive.  But as a society I think it is prudent to share that burden so all have access to education without it being too steep of a burden for one family.\n\nThat being said, if there are good resources to show or studies I would love to read those.  I've listed my concerns, but maybe those are addressed already in the voucher system and I'm unaware.\n\nEdit to add, your last statement rings true, it is at least worth reevaluating and rethinking the approach.",

I'm a bitter poor person who is tired of blaming the rich and expecting the government to take care of me.\n\nSo, who is to blame? Or what, rather?\n\nHuman nature.\n\nIs it really the guys with guns job to point their guns at people and tell them they have to take care of the poor? Is it really the rich's problem that there are poor people?\n\nI don't think so. Look at human history. Heck, look at apes. ALL inequality, all the way. Apes have social hierarchies, and all humans have and always have and always will. People always pretend apes are super nice, and a good example of how we should be or something, but watch documentaries and read up on them. Assholes, just like us. Some king ape abuses those lower than him and takes more than them, and banishes other apes who he doesn't like or kills them.\n\nSo, since it's human nature to be unfair, how is giving more power to armed people legally allowed to order us around under threat of the law going to fix this? Their human nature is the same as everyone's: Power hungry assholes.\n\nThere are RARE exceptions, but look at almost every group ever and you will see power dynamics that are unsavory. Every communist country, every socialist country. So even when people try to specifically stop inequality by empowering armed people to force equality, it just creates another ruling class again which is unequal to the people they oppress. \n\nGiving tons of power to people with guns is not the answer.\n\nHeck, even small communes without guns and such usually have some creep running them who oppresses people and fucks everyone's wives. People are naturally hierarchal assholes.\n\nPersonally, I say we deregulate the economy and just offer free, voluntary vasectomies to all people who are poor and unhappy. The wealthy would change their tune VERY fast when they start running out of workers. Then they would pay better and take care of their employees. Making their employees happy would be priority number one. Done. And not a single guy with a gun involved. No new regulations or taxes. It would be a self fixing issue if we could just use a nonviolent means to get around the issue of the poor reproducing despite suffering poverty and oppression and perpetually serving the rich.",

Healthcare is the most heavily regulated industry in the U.S.\n\nFurthermore, the government keeps the supply of healthcare workers artificially low by gatekeeping entry to medical schools. This isn't even a \"minimal standards issue\" or an issue where standards are too strict. \n\nThis government intervention is better defined as: *\"the American Medical Association lobbied Congress to limit the number of medical school students to only xx,xxx this year.\"*\n\nDoctors/nurses in the U.S. get paid WAAAAY more than their European counterparts. If you really want to bring down the cost of healthcare, we can stop treating the medical industry as a jobs program for the upper middle class. \n\nOf course... Reducing the salaries of doctors and nurses isn't politically expedient now is it...\n\nIf you want to bring down the cost of medicine, we can start by removing all of the government regulations which make it extremely expensive to begin with.",

It\u2019s almost like adding a large bureaucracy with no accountability or clear mandates to a taxpayer-funded enterprise just redirects the tax dollars towards the bureaucracy and away from their intended purpose. \n\nKind of like if we eliminated the VA but kept their annual budget the same and just divided it among the people leaving the military each year: they\u2019d each receive $2.6 million if divided equally. I wonder what the veterans would say if you asked them if they\u2019d prefer to deal with the VA for the rest of their lives or receive a single 7-figure lump sum? \n\nBureaucracy doesn\u2019t solve problems, it causes them. I don\u2019t think there was a single year the DOE was in operation that a single educational metric ACCIDENTALLY or RANDOMLY improved.",
