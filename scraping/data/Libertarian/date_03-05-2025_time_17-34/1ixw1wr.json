Is it purely based on canceled tangible programs?  Why are they not selling half empty Goverment office?  I want to believe this is for the good but so far Im not convinced.",

The Executive Vesting Clause, in Section 1, Clause 1, provides that the federal executive power is vested in the President. Section 3 of Article II further requires the President to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.1 The executive power thus consists of the authority to enforce laws and to appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement.2 The President also has distinct authority over foreign affairs, and alone has the power to speak or listen as a representative of the nation.3 As a general matter, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution vests the President not only with the authorities expressly delineated therein, but also with certain implied authorities,4 such as the ability to supervise (and generally to remove) executive officials5 and the power to recognize foreign governments.6 At the same time, the Court has said that by granting the President the power of faithfully executing the laws, the Constitution refutes the idea that the President was intended to be a lawmaker.7 Nonetheless, the Court has recognized that officials appointed by the President\u2014even those located within the Executive Branch\u2014may exercise regulatory or adjudicative powers that are quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial.8 Broadly, the Court has recognized that Executive Officers exercise authority to enforce and administer the laws, including rulemaking, administrative determinations, and the filing of lawsuits.9\n\n[Link to quoted site](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/)",

That doesnt mean they aren\u2019t there. I\u2019m a proponent of trusting your senior leaders and instilling a culture of accountability. I really don\u2019t think an agency head and their subordinate leaders are just letting people get away with shit. There needs to be a way to more effectively track daily work though. It\u2019s hard to do this for indirect positions without engineered standards but that goes back to what I said about knowing your standards and priorities and understanding how it adds value. There could be study on how much time is spent actively working towards agency goals and rewarding positive results. Also like I mentioned, the time keeping systems can be used to track not just time but time spent in which path or function. Using this data agency heads can determine where there needs to be cuts or improvements. The problem is the government is like the blind leading the blind. You cannot effect meaningful change without having the data to do so. I just know a single email isn\u2019t it, although I understand the intent.",

Likewise I'm a big believer in needing to be able to measure something in order to improve it. Anything we do needs to have a measured component so we can show the results of the change. However, at this point, we have what are supposed to non-partisan institutions that have a demonstrated pattern of ideological capture and a total failure of their proclaimed goals. \n\nIn such circumstances it is specifically the leadership that are the problem and expecting them to be anything other than a roadblock to change would be a mistake. \n\nIf you need a clear cut example of that look no further than the department of education. They have consistently failed to improve the education outcomes of our students, year over year, for decades. We do have tones of metrics for reporting on education that clearly show this. Instead they have been pushing a non-stop stream of ideological messages to our schools. It appears leadership there is more interested in propaganda and social engineering than actual education results. \n\nIn the pentagon we have a organization that has failed to audit themselves 7 years running. Frankly that means we cannot trust any numbers the leadership hands us. In the private sector if that happened two years in a row I would expect to see members of leadership fired. If it happened 5 years in a row I would expect the shareholders to have the C-Suite executives replaced. But instead we get, 'well we will get it right next time, trust us.' And, 'oh look, the marines did it right this year.' Are you kidding me? In an organization where information reporting and coordination are paramount this comes off as malicious refusal to perform the audit.\n\nAs another poster on this thread pointed out, as a nation, we are in the 'eating Ramen while living out of our car' stage of debt recovery. Some drastic changes are needed. From a business change perspective these institutions need disruption. They appear to be frozen and 'very little' to 'no good' change, cost cutting measures, and positive results seem to be coming out of them.",
