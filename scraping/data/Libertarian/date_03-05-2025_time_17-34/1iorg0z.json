Boeing is a giant government contractor. They can be criminally negligent and have the protection of the government to stay in business. \n\nBut this question is about the TSA. Between the FBI and CIA, the government knows who and where the terrorists are - which is its own issue. Your own government treats you and every other citizen like a terrorist, and makes you prove otherwise. Investigating every single person that walks into the airport (without a warrant) is not only inefficient, it's ineffective. They still couldn't stop the shoe bomber or the underpants bomber before they were on the plane.\n\nStop and frisk in New York is bad, but stop and frisk at the airport is mandatory and celebrated.",
