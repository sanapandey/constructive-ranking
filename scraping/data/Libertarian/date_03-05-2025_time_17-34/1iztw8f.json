It is possible to have humane asylums. \nIn Massie's defense, I assume his position on marijuana is rooted in ignorance. The marijuana on the streets today bears no resemblance to that (5% THC?) which he and his buddies smoked in college. Today, it is a hard, dangerous and addictive drug.",

Even for those with incurable and socially harmful conditions, they would be subjected to a lifetime of study that one could only call inhumane and often torturous. Treatment went out the window once overcrowding became an issue in the mid century, and without treatment there was no chance for ever getting released.\n\nNow, if you don't care about how someone's life is besides your own, then sure, we should open them back up and where we will see the same problems arise again as they slowly lose funding over time, become over burdened with people that should not be there even short term nevertheless long term, and the quality and qualifications of the staff drops off as the conditions within them make them a less than desired place to work.",
