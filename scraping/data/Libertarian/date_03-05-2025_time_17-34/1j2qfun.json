Although the Memorandum is not legally binding, we take these political commitments seriously and do not believe any U.S. sanctions, whether imposed because of human rights or non-proliferation concerns, are inconsistent with our commitments to Belarus under the Memorandum or undermine them. Rather, sanctions are aimed at securing the human rights of Belarusians and combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other illicit activities, not at gaining any advantage for the United States.\n\nthe memorandum \"prohibited Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom from threatening or using military force or economic coercion against Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, \"except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\"  \n\nso it looks like even if the treaty isn't \"legally binding\", they still did everything by the book.  \n\nyou might like this information about international law, unless of course you're a bot.  https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/events/2010/press_kit/fact_sheet_5_english.pdf",

They believed that mere technological superiority and having USA on  a leash was enough to stop Russia in a fight. \n\nTurns out when you destroy your industrial base with 70+ of shitty economic policies there isn't much you can do to actually win a war. \n\nExample: \n\nEngland sent its tanks to Ukraine, but Ukraine couldn't actually use them.  Why? it is not because they are inferior to Russian tanks. They are probably better. \n\nThe problem is that there isn't any parts for them. There are no replacements. \n\nEngland can't make tanks anymore. The ones they sent to Ukraine was it. Ukraine can't use them because without parts and support they are death traps. No matter how good or effective they are otherwise. They have simply lost the ability and it is going to take a decade to get back to the same level they were in the 50s, if it is at all possible. Which is not guaranteed.\n\nThis is the whole of Europe. They can't make anything anymore. They can't build armies. The will, the ability, the knowledge, the experience just doesn't exist. They can produce small amounts of effective forces for small conflicts in foreign countries. There isn't anything they can do to threaten Russia. There is nothing they can do to conscript large numbers of fighting men and arm them and train them. The capability simply doesn't exist. If they push hard they can do it, but it will take decades.\n\nUnless China is willing to do it for them they are screwed.\n\nWhether Putin is evil or the cause or tyrannical or immoral or evil... it doesn't matter. Bullets don't care. Rockets don't care. There is no \"march of history\" were the good guys always win and there was always progress in one direction. It doesn't exist. It never happened. That isn't how any of this works.",

Basically, they are hiding behind private property laws while simultaneously having a very NOT private prayer peepshow.\n\nSince the Christians are not acting very Christian (public performance prayer is a sin according to Jesus) and they are actively trying to suppress the rights of others, then I am less inclined to care about their religious freedoms within the exclusion zone.\n\nHow many people in Scotland even live within 200m of an abortion clinic?
