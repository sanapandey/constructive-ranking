I don't need to support bitcoin, I need to support people's right to do what they want and try new things, including bitcoin AND a bunch of dumb rugpull memecoins. The freedom to do the rugpull is also the freedom to create something newer and better.\n\nIt's your job to choose whether you want to participate in - or abstain from - using bitcoin. And the US Dollar. Or bartering chickens with your neighbor. Or drinking raw milk. Or getting a vaccine.\n\nFull disclosure - I own about $1800 worth of bitcoin and doge as part of an experiment. I made a lot money in the runup to the election and post-election run, so I got that part right. I lost a little bit in the last few months because I, like George W Bush, didn't have a clear exit strategy. Generally, I think the best investment is in the entire American economy through low cost index funds. Don't bet the house on anything - but you are free to do that because that's how progress works. People try new things and either fail or succeed.",

Storing value in BTC should be less profitable in general (the initial profit results from the fact that it spawned a new market). There's no interest on BTC or no positive cashflow like in fiat currency. On the other hand you are not implicitly forced to contribute with your possessions in ruthless capitalistic deals, like exploiting foreign countries resources or investing into military industries. If you keep your money on a bank account, the bank will use it to invest into the most profitable corporations, regardless of ethics.",
