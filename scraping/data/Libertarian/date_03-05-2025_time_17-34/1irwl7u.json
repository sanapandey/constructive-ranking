IMO in the same way as politicians it should be a function (not a profession) awarded to the most sapient, intelligent and experienced people in Society. A judge with expectations of financial rewards is a judge that can be bought and swindled by different directions, and the lack of financial security might make him lose his impartiality to defend the powers that end up lining his pockets",

I had a judge give me a hard stare cuz I replied with \"if it pleases the crown\". But to answer your question... we belive taxes should be voluntary. We all have our different views as to HOW or what that means. But that's the bottom line. And in my experience... the ones that say \"then no one would pay\" are the ones that, in fact, wouldn't pay. But that's fine, as long as you get to keep 100% of your hard earned money. It's up to you how you use it",
