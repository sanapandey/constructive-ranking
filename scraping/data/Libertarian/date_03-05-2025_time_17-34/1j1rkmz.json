Whomever you think is an 'evil' corpration, BlackRock, Google, Lockheed Martin, Tesla, Amazon, Walmart, etc.  Maybe Congressional member who did insider trading.\n2. Let's say we severely slash government spending and power, a 'perfect' libertarian situation. \n3. What next, do we let corporations keep those ill gotten gains?  Why or why not?  If not, how?",

            "body": "How do you show ill gotten gains if the beneficiaries of those gains acted within the law at the time they received them?\n\nI kind of like where you are going here because it recognizes that some business has benefited at the expense of others and as a result has a competitive advantage over their adversaries. This in turn allowed them to maintain or increase market share at the expense of their competition.\n\nMy question would be how a libertarian \u201chands off\u201d approach to markets would handle that situation.\n\nBut I think history helps us here. Before the court case breaking up AT&T, \u201cMa Bell\u201d as it was called, AT&T had a regulatory imposed monopoly on all long distance calls. Many people think AT&T was a natural monopoly. That is radically false. The government heavily regulated the company and in exchange granted it monopoly authority over all long distance service in the nation.\n\nThe court case in the 80s they broke it up into what became known as the Baby Bells also dismantled the regulatory scheme that had been eatables decades prior.\n\nSide note: one might label the situation between the gov\u2019t and AT&T as fascism, or gov\u2019t control over the output of private production. That is just my opinion. Not really the question for this discussion, I do not think. Or maybe it is the hear of it?\n\nAnyway, the point of the AT&T example is to show that after the government grant of monopoly, the telecommunications market is competitive, with more players in the market and now, the modern AT&T is just a rebranded Baby Bell rather than the original corporation.",

I highly doubt we will even be able to end corporate welfare, even reducing probably isn\u2019t going to happen. If we could get to the point of ending corporate welfare and ending tax loopholes (for lack of a better word), that would be enough for me.",
