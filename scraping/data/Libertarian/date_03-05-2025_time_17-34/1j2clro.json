    "selftext": "The American left once stood as the loudest voice against war, most notably during the Vietnam era, when protests erupted across the country in opposition to U.S. military involvement in a foreign conflict. The left framed itself as the movement of peace, arguing that American lives and resources should not be wasted on wars that did not directly defend U.S. soil. Yet today, that same left is actively protesting in favor of continued U.S. funding for the war in Ukraine, demanding that American public money, taken from taxpayers, be used to prolong a war in a foreign country. This represents a glaring paradox: the same political faction that once opposed war now enthusiastically supports U.S. involvement in a foreign conflict, not through direct military intervention, but through unlimited financial support.\n\nThose who oppose supporting foreign wars, by contrast, represent the position of restraint. Their opposition to funding Ukraine stems from a clear principle: the U.S. was not invaded, and therefore, American taxpayers should not be forced to bankroll a war that does not directly threaten them. Their stance is not just about protecting public funds but also about respecting peace. Every dollar sent to Ukraine prolongs the war, leading to more death, destruction, and suffering. By refusing to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort, those who oppose supporting foreign wars are essentially advocating for an end to the conflict rather than fueling it indefinitely. The paradox emerges when left-wing activists, who once championed peace, take to the streets demanding that the U.S. continue funding the war. Their protests are not about ending the violence, but about ensuring it continues through American financial support.\n\nThis shift exposes an uncomfortable truth: today\u2019s left is no longer about opposing war but about supporting the industries that profit from it. The military-industrial complex, once the target of left-wing protests, now benefits from their advocacy. The arms industry thrives on continued U.S. involvement in Ukraine, and the left has aligned itself with those who stand to gain from endless war. This pattern is not new. The same left-wing movement that pushed for mass government intervention during COVID, benefiting the pharmaceutical industry, now pushes for unlimited war funding, benefiting the military industry. In both cases, the justification was framed as a moral imperative, but the real winners were corporations that reaped massive financial rewards.\n\nThe contradiction is undeniable. If the left truly believed in peace, they would be demanding diplomacy, negotiation, and an end to U.S. involvement in foreign wars. Instead, they demand that American taxpayers continue to fund a war that does not directly impact them, proving that their priorities have shifted from principle to profit. What once was an anti-war movement has become a pro-war movement, not for the sake of security, but for the sake of those who stand to gain from endless conflict.",

Their military and civilians both. Their towns are being damaged.\u00a0\n\nSaying \u201cprolonging the war leads to more suffering\u201d is the equivalent of saying \u201cRussia would have won by now without assistance\u201d.\u00a0\n\nWhich is true. But that also is another way of saying \u201cif Ukraine didn\u2019t fight back then they wouldn\u2019t be at war right now. So it\u2019s really their fault\u201d. Which is obviously an unreasonable thing to say. You are allowed to act in self defense. Which is what Ukraine is doing. Nobody would fault you for defending yourself if you got mugged in an alley. Hence my analogy.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlso, I think one of the reasons many of the us public want to support Ukraine is\u00a0\n\n\n1. This is a super clear cut defensive war. Big mean Russia invading small other country. I\u2019m not very educated on international geopolitics so I might be missing it. But I don\u2019t think there has been such a clear cut \u201cthe invading force started it\u201d (that\u2019s not internal) in a bit.\u00a0\n\n2. Russia is Russia. The US has spent decades considering them an enemy. And everything that you hear about them from their corruption, and authoritative government, lack of free elections, etc. have not done anything to change peoples minds.\u00a0\n\n3. Appeasement didn\u2019t work with Germany for world war 2. That\u2019s definitely still strong in people\u2019s minds. That time a big enemy power of the US started taking foreign countries people thought \u201csure they will be reasonable eventually\u201d and that didn\u2019t really happen. So people are worried about Russia again.\u00a0\n\nThe idea of \u201clet\u2019s wait until the issue is directly on US soil\u201d makes sense in many ways. But also the idea of letting your enemy do whatever he wants, pick off allies, take over resources, whatever, until he is ready to take you on isn\u2019t the best. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s some easy automatic \u201cdon\u2019t do anything until it\u2019s on us soil\u201d and vice versa.\u00a0",

                                    "body": "The problem is that Ukraine is in a fight that they cannot win. Is there any world in which Ukraine actually prevails in a way that satisfies Zelinsky? If we're going to be pressured into continuing to pour billions into somebody else's war (as if we're not in serious debt ourselves), how long before these same people argue for the same reasons that we need to send troops there? (Which means WWIII, nuclear war with Russia.) See, all of these people arguing for continuing the war, they have all of these emotional appeals, but nothing in the way of what the end goal is. \n\n  \nRussia is a bad guy in this. We get it. (By the same logic, though, Ukraine isn't exactly spotless in this either.) But at some point, someone needs to come in and realize when continuing the war is not accomplishing anything. If it's saying that \"Russia would have won by now without assistance,\" then that basically concedes that Ukraine is in a war they cannot win. So if the people offering them assistance can use diplomacy to negotiate an outcome in which their civilians and soldiers can STOP DYING, without Russia getting everything it wants? I say that is something that Zelinsky should be weeping tears of joy for. Because as you said, they literally can't do this without us. \"Nobody would fault you if you fought back if you got mugged in an alley.\" What if you were then compelling other people to give you money so that you could go buy weapons to fight back against your attacker but had absolutely no realistic chances of reclaiming what was stolen? The analogy doesn't work because Ukraine isn't gaining anything by fighting back. It's like somebody who was wronged who flushes their entire life savings and their family's livelihood trying to right the wrongs without a real chance at prevailing. Eventually, all that does is take a bad situation and make it worse. Somebody mugs you so you keep sending your family members to get your money back, and the mugger keeps killing them, but you want to keep sending more and more because it was wrong that you were mugged, so even if your friends and family keep dying trying to get your wallet back (that IS rightfully yours, to be fair), you want to keep on fighting. \n\nYes, Russia was in the wrong. But this war continuing is not leading to Ukraine winning. It's just leading to more dead people. And expecting foreign nations to continue bankrolling a futile war that is going nowhere, getting absolutely nothing in return, in perpetuity? It's wrong too. At some point, Zelinsky needs to come down to realville and realize that he was being offered the only way through this that in any way resembles a good outcome, and he turned it down.",

The military industrial complex also relies on a supply and demand system. \n\nSupporting military aid sustains the war, and you can disagree with me on this - but the fact of the matter is further escalation creates fuel to our own war industry here at home. These big defense corporations love it when there\u2019s foreign conflicts because it creates a DEMAND on why they need more weapons, more money and more leverage in our political lobbying corrupt system. \n\n We haven\u2019t learned from the past 50 years of American foreign policy is we love to be involved in foreign conflicts, using taxpayer money to promote an agenda that we want resulting in human and financial loss. \n\nPeople would bring up the offensive vs defensive argument, but why should we be the world police? The idea that we should police the international conflicts around the world because we have the largest military and economy doesn\u2019t make sense. US taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be a relief aid to other countries when we have our problems to deal with domestically. \n\nWar benefits defense contractors and the military-industrial complex, often at the expense of taxpayers and long-term national interests. A neutral stance would limit the MIC\u2019s ability to profit from continued U.S. involvement.\n\nEDIT: Also members of congress doing insider trading are also profiting from the war in Ukraine, a lot of them own defense stocks. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous that they keep pushing this pro-war narrative while they keep profiting from defense stocks. Defense CEOs will keep getting richer because of war, and I\u2019m surprised no one is bringing that up when everyone is anti-CEO.",

            "body": "They were never anti war they were anti Bush. Now  you see the left siding with the Bushes and Cheneys simply because there are against Trump.  They don't have beliefs or ideology they have a side, and no matter where their side goes, they blindly follow even if it is 100t% the opposite of what it was 20 years ago.\n\nThe big question I have for all of these people defending the war is what do you hope to accomplish if they keep fighting? Putin invaded yes was wrong regardless of the part we played. Putin is  not a good guy, I get that. However, do you really believe the Ukraine can push Putin out without US boots on the ground? You know they CAN'T. If we it sent troops on Russias border, it would be guaranteed nuclear war in some capacity. Sorry but Ukraine isn't worth it, and yes, the Biden administration should all be hung for telling Ukraine not to accept the original peace offers.\n\nSo if the Ukraine cannot push Russia out, then all we are doing is prolonging it. I can understand Ukrainians' desire to fight to the end, but from our perspective, we have a responsibility to end the bloodshed. If Ukraine can't win without US troops and US troops mean nuclear war, the it needs to end. The only response I see  to these is stating the fact that Russia invaded and that anyone who wants the war to end is s \"pro Putin puppet\".  They never state What the plan is or talk about Ukraines chance to push Russia out is, because as soon as they do, their argument evaporates.",

Everyone tries to have allies and to ensure they don't  get isolated internationally. If you wait until the Pacific is dominated by China and the Atlantic by the USSR v2, you can be sure that the war will be short and ... not successful. Or more likely the U.S. would simply fold like you proposed the Ukrainians should have done.\n\n  \nAt the end there, with 0 logic behind, you simply suppose that \"the MIC\" is in cahoots with \"the left\"... you'd have to also show some reasoning here if you want any kind of discussion.",
