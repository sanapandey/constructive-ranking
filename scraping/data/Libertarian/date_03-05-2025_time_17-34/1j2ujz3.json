    "selftext": "Quite often we hear from anarchists that anarcho-capitalism isn't \"real\" anarchism. Anarchists even claim that capitalism cannot function without a state. In this post I'd like to delve deeper into this argument by giving 3 examples. Hopefully this presents this argument in meaningful manner.\n\nAll of those example revolve around land ownership: Imagine that you own an unfenced, empty plot of land. You don't live on it, in fact your home is on the other side of the planet.\n\nNow, suppose I step onto this land. Let's pretend you find out I'm currently sleeping on it. You board a plane, fly over to where I am, and pull me out of the grass with a gun to my head. Apparently I am trespassing onto your property, and I can't be there. I am forced to leave.\n\nNow, let\u2019s take a more complex scenario.  Imagine I work alongside 20 others in an office building on your land. We come together in a meeting and decide to sell a product we\u2019ve developed. Then comes you \u2014 you fly over from a another continent, gun in hand, and tell us we aren't allowed to do that. It's your land, and you're entitled to make every decision on it. Also, we have to hand over profits every quarter. If we refuse, we must leave or face violent consequences.\n\nNow, let\u2019s scale this up.  Let's say your land is in a big continuous chunk. I, on the other hand, own nothing and am completely destitute. I ask if I can live on your land. You say alright: that I can tilt your fields, and you promise to let me keep enough produce to survive, but the surplus must be handed over to you.  Also, you come up with a bunch of rules with regards to marriage, fines etc. If I don\u2019t comply? My choices are to leave or, eventually, be killed.\n\nAs can be extrapolated by now, the anarchist argument is that land ownership isn't different to statehood. This fact is crucial as all anarchists hold one thing in common: they don't believe in private ownership of land. Additionally they argue that accepting landowners is just a very short step away from accepting war-waging landowners. Conversely, a society that outright denies the legitimacy of land ownership creates a natural barrier against all feudalistic institutions.\n\nWith this being said, what are anarcho-capitalists and libertarians supposed to feel about anarchism? Especially libertarianism, whose main pursuit is liberty.\n\nP.S. When anarchists say, \"capitalism doesn\u2019t function without a state,\" they are referring to capitalism as an extractive system\u2014one in which surplus value is taken from workers\u2014not simply free markets. This actually differs from the way anarcho-capitalists and libertarians typically define capitalism. I\u2019ve written a post on this distinction [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1ispc9w/capitalism_vs_capitalism/).",

We are so far from achieving either that squabbling over their differences and trying to convince the other side that  \"no in fact you are the wrong one\" is the mental equivalent of two homeless people arguing about the best way to cook a steak when neither has ever actually seen a steak in person and have in fact only read cook books describing how one might best be prepared.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it can be fun at times. I have engaged in plenty of debate on the validity of anarcho capitalist thought and questioning the structure of left leaning anarchism buy ultimately it accomplished absolutely nothing. \n\nIf you hate the state as everyone, especially as much as any self proclaimed anarchist should, then stop debating with the one other group that hates them as much as you. Instead work together to remove and limit the vast swathes of things that government does that we can both agree are heinous.\n\nWork together to end the drug war.\n\nWork together to end incarceration for non-violent crimes\n\nWork together to try and end foreign wars.\n\nIf one day we magically end up with a vastly reduced or completely destroyed state then I and others like me can debate you and others like you about the best way to structure our newly freed society but till then it's completely and utterly pointless.",

Many anarchist enclaves sprung up in the 20th century too, like one during the Spanish civil War with which even George Orwell fought alongside. But they've all been left-anarchist as you call them, I've never heard of an anarcho-capitalist rebellion. I don't think it's a coincidence though, because the lack of land ownership is very central to anarchism\u2014and besides\u2014the world-wide enforcement of property ownership by anarcho-capitalists simply demands a more efficient institution, like a modern state (that's what the plane and gun is in the post). But even then, for left-anarchists, anarcho-capitalism sounds like feudalism\u2014not statelessness (for reasons apparent in the post)\u2014so they don't see eye to eye.",

The goals you mentioned are indeed shared between you and them, but they're not really representative of their aspirations. Yes, their struggle lies strongly in the abolition of land ownership, and therefore\u2014as is shown in the post\u2014their struggle extends to the freedom of movement (1st example), the worker ownership of workplaces (2nd example), and personal liberty (3rd example). You speak of a debate with words after \"the revolution\", but their lives are endangered (and their aspirations unmet) so long as you believe in your ownership of land and are ready to enforce it. Hope this clears up some differences.",

Physical removal is extremely important.\n\nPlus, the whole idea of stealing surplus is stupid. Business owners dont steal surplus they take the risks of owning a business and if you want the benefits of that you could choose to work there or to work for someone else. \n\nLibertarians are capitalists, libertarians are anarchists. Where you\u2019re messing up is the definition of anarchy and state. Those are where anarcho-syndicalism/communism are truly in disagreeance.",

And given that there is no government, anyone has the right to do anything they want on unowned lands. Doesn't it follow then, that this libertarian society only functions when embedded in an anarchist framework, on which all people can fall back to? If that's the case, then how do we justify the presence of ownable land at all? Through what method of selection can land be logically divided into ownable and unownable parts?",

And I\u2019m the hypocrite because I think a person has the right to own a home even if there\u2019s a chance some asshole might abuse his right to dictate what happens on his land? Would a business, without contract, build an office on a persons land and just hope? No of course not but communists assume the worst is the only possible outcome for their competing ideology, wonder why. Is it because we have plenty of examples of what happens when they try communism? If the only way a system can work is if it gets to destroy anything that could compete with it, on principle that\u2019s a no from me. Communists can live in an ancap world, who would care? Can ancaps live in a communist world?",
