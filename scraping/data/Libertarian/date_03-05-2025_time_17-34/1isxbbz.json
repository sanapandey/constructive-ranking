    "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all. So in a new convert to libertarian philosophy and economic theory. Learned through YT liquidzulu, MentisWave, but now started reading Hoppe. think I get the basics; subjective theory of value. NAP. Objective property rights Etc \n\nEDIT 1: note that I\u2019m mentioning no laws, explicitly said normalized. Philosophically speaking here, culturally we can have a certain expectation from others. We are cultural beings. \n\nIt\u2019s not illegal to fuck your brother\u2019s girlfriend. That doesn\u2019t mean we believe is a moral thing to do. And it is right to shame and shun those who do. \n\nI believe that a libertarian society, who believes most of all in the individual (natural law) and competition (free market). Should shame and shun those people that practice nepotism. It is counter to the fundamental principles. \n\nI\u2019m speaking in those grounds. \n\nA society and ultimately an economy is built from these sort of norms. \n\nMaybe abolishment was the wrong word. I should change the title (apparently you can\u2019t).\n\nEDIT 2: note I never said it would go to the government. One can easily give the funds to any business; private organization or charity they please. NO ONE IS MENTIONING GOVERNMENT. I know they are inefficient. \n\n\nORIGINAL POST:  one thing I can no wrap my head around (ideologically) is inheritance. It seems to me that a libertarian society is one where the individual is the most fundamental and important institution. \n\nWe believe that optimizing an economy for individuals to compete with each other on true even footing (without state intervention or cronyism) benefits the whole of society. \n\nSo why do we stop there? Why not get rid of inheritance? \n\nI mean I understand that people may do what they want with their money. Some will blow it on hookers others create wealth for generations. \n\nBut if we believe truly in individual and true competition I think we should strive to at least normalize leaving zero inheritance. Put that money back in the economy\u2014invest it, donate it, spend it on drugs, whatever. \n\nI\u2019m not sure I can justify it philosophically (yet). But I truly believe in competition. Let\u2019s create a society where the most talented (individuals) rise to the top without an unfair advantage\u2014similar how we want to even playing field with firms competitive on even grounds. ",

Taken to the extreme you are saying don't care about anyone that you could care about because that is nepotism, so don't raise and love your kids because that is nepotism to kids who lost their parents.

And if so, why are they any better at spending that wealth than those who would have inherited it? If the tacit threat is to *make sure* people artificially empty their accounts before they die, how is that any better? \n--\nA longer answer is, why is inheritance an inherently bad thing? What difference does it make between spending/giving my wealth away to strangers, and having the self control to store some of it away over time in order to give it to someone I deeply care about when I die, and can no longer use it? Won't they spend it themselves anyways? They can just as easily drive themselves into a hole squandering it, do middling and maintain it to pass it on, or use it as a step up to improve themselves and others, AND pass on an even greater asset to their next generation. To deny the use of inheritance is not only to spit in the face of thousands of years of human tradition at this point, but further, it is to directly argue against a certain point of objective property rights, similar to how left-wing people artificially mince 'personal' and 'private' property. Would you not blink an eye at the legal side steps to inheritance, such as trusts and 'corporate' ownership of what are effectively personal assets one generation inherits from another? To accept that there are unequal outcomes in economics during life is to accept that the consequences of that can and will carry on to the next generation after death.",
