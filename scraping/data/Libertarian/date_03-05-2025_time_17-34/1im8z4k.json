Trump and his henchman aren\u2019t getting rid of agencies because of their inefficiencies, they\u2019re getting rid of the ones that allow his benefactors to operate without oversight under the Executive Branch. \n\nTrump is congealing an unprecedented amount of power under himself. Republicans/ Conservatives Lipublicans would be losing their shit if a democratic president did the same. But because, \u201cliberty for me, none for thee\u201d people are just eating this shit up saying, \u201chAhA cRy HaRdEr lIbErAls \ud83d\ude02.\u201d\n\nHopefully the courts take their oaths seriously and stand up for the Constitution.

The Assembly wanted to tax the Penn Family to fund the defense and the Penn Family just wanted to voluntarily contribute. \n\nFranklin's quote is directed to the assembly telling them to exercise their powers to tax and that the Penn Family was benefiting from the defense without paying taxes on it.  \n\nFranklin was arguing that the Assembly/Government was the one being asked to give up its liberty, specifically, its right to self-governance and taxation because the Penns were trying to override their authority by resisting taxation.\n\nTo further clarify, the Penn Family were proprietors who acted as landlords and rulers of the colony, not the king directly.  Pennsylvania had an elected Assembly, roughly a legislature.  The assembly wanted to tax everyone for defense funds.  The Family didn't want to allow the Assembly the power to tax them since there were landlords per the power of the Crown.  \n\nFranklin is technically arguing for the right to self governance and taxation with representation, but he's still arguing for taxation in the end.  From a minimum government Libertarian perspective, this is probably in line with standard expectations for government and everyone contributing.  From a no government libertarian perspective, this solidifies the idea of government taxation to provide defense which leads to the Military Industrial Complex that we have today.",
