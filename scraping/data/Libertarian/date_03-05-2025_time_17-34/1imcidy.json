                    "body": "The war on drugs makes drugs more dangerous and cartels more profitable. \n\nFrom a policy standpoint it is insane. \n\nThe reason it makes drugs more dangerous is because of logistics.  The physical size matters.  Since, ultimately, you are making money per \"hit\" the more hits you can fit in a smaller space the easier and cheaper it is transport and hide. \n\nExample:\n \nImagine you need to invest $50,000 into smuggling drugs into the country... Morphine and Fentanyl have roughly the same effect on the body in comparable doses.  However fentanyl is 100 times more potent. \n\nWhich means that for every one pound of fentanyl you have to smuggle into the country you'd have to smuggle 100 pounds of morphine to get the equivalent dosages. \n\nThe penalty for either drug is the same. Being caught with 50k of morphine will land you in prison just as long as 50k of fentanyl will. \n\nHowever it is a lot easier and cheaper to smuggle fentanyl due to the much higher concentration. \n\nThis is why, over the years, people have moved into stronger and stronger versions of drugs.  It is not a issue of drug addiction getting worse... it is simply a issue logistical costs and risk when it comes to smuggling. \n\nThe longer this stuff goes on the more dangerous drugs are going to get.",

But when USAID funding was recently blocked, a moral question came to mind.\n\nIf I'm responsible for giving life-saving aid to 10 people but I know 2 of them are cheating, wasting 20% of my budget, I could:\n\n1. Cut off all aid entirely, ensuring no fraud but also harming the 8 who genuinely need it.\n2. Continue funding while working to eliminate waste, knowing some level of inefficiency will always exist.\n\nTo me, cutting USAID funding in the way it was done is fundamentally immoral\u2014it harms those who need aid the most to punish fraudsters. It also seems strategically foolish, as it weakens one of the US\u2019s strongest tools of influence abroad while creating opportunities for China and Russia. (That\u2019s a separate discussion, but worth considering.)   \n\nWouldn\u2019t it be more pragmatic to focus on improving accountability while minimizing harm? Skepticism should apply to all areas of government spending.  IMHO, it should lead to reforms that make the program more effective while minimizing harm.\n\nAt the moment there is 500 million dollars of food at risk of spoilage because it is just sitting waiting to be shipped.

It\u2019s far better and far more humanitarian for you to reach into your own pocket and give to those in need. It does far more good that way, than any foreign government\u2019s so called aid could ever do.",

I\u2019m sure somewhere along the timeline someone got it into their heads USAID was a great way to pilfer tax dollars.
