Statistically, he lost the primary 46% to 54% against Hillary. There were some questionable actions by the DNC though, including a leak or emails where it was clear they disliked Bernie's popularity. \n\nFrom my perspective, it felt like he gave up and left it to Hillary after the primaries. It was off-brand from his usual view of push the envelope and \"unpopular\" opinions. Even during primaries though, local electors were instructed to still show up en mass to potentially accept nominations that Hillary may not have had representatives for.",

Bernie has a YouTube channel where he's been posting videos recently, calling Elon's involvement an \"oligarchy\" etc. But when Trump was recently cited as saying he wants to bring peace to the Ukraine war or reduce military expenditures theough negotiations with China and Russia? Crickets from Bernie. Lots of populist things Bernie campaigned on, the Trump administration is actually accomplishing. And Bernie says nothing except whatever supports the left wing narrative.

But where the privatization falls apart is in the rarer scenarios. I will pose this as a question for you. Let\u2019s say you had a child that was born with spinal muscular atrophy - a very rare genetic disease. SMA is fatal for most infants. However, there does exist a gene therapy that costs $2M per dose today (and that is with government intervention). My question becomes, in these cases, would you let your child die because you can\u2019t afford the gene therapy? Or would you have a different way to handle these cases?",

The price of 2 million per dose means that tens of thousands of man hours are going into the production and research of this treatment.\n\nThe question that socialized healthcare can\u2019t answer is , because there is no price signal to determine production, is that worth it? How many people must die because we prioritize treating these extremely rare illnesses? Could that effort go to reducing negative health outcomes for more common diseases. If using those hours of effort to pay for more doctors treating more common diseases in more locations, how would a socialized healthcare system know which is more productive without prices?\n\nThere is a very real consequence to ignoring prices. And that is paid through wasted man hours that could have gone to feeding and treating more of the world. Only the free market can correct for misallocation of resources that prevents the spoiling of wealth using the profit system. Anything else asks for an inefficient healthcare system, which costs way more lives than these edge cases.",

YOU are the one claiming that public healthcare will provide for the public good. Where is that obvious? Politicians don't respond to the public good they respond to 50.1% of people's political wants; this very regularly ends up  taking from the well-being of the 49.9%. There is no feedback mechanize to provide for the 49.9%. Absolutely none. In a market system, there is feedback to provide for everyone, and that is PRICES. If you think your fellow humans won't try their hardest to pay for those in need without the force of a gun, then why do you think 50.1% of people would vote to take care of them anyway?",

The only true monopoly is the government, as they will violently put down competitors in their territory. In a free market the only monopoly is the ownership of property, which is not a monopoly is the colloquial sense. All the common examples are caused through a few circumstances. \n\n1. They produce an optimal product and other business fail due to competition. Similar to standard oil, which continually reduced its prices while it had majority market share and was down from 90% ish to 60% when it was split up years later. \n\n2. They are given patents that violently protect \u201cintellectual property.\u201d This prevents competitors from the market and is at the behest of the government. Ideas aren\u2019t scarse, therefore cannot be property.\n\n3. They benefit from Regulatory capture/subsidies, it\u2019s been shown that the cost of regulation is cheaper for larger producers, causing a conglomerating force in many industries that might be more efficient as smaller more dynamic companies.\n\nThis is from my recollection, sorry for a lack of sources",

Most of the time, doctors are doing tons of paperwork to not get sued. Removing government oversight would 100% reduce the cost of treatments. The issue with having no government oversight would be what are the repercussions for companies that do not do things correctly. For example, in the 1950s, a drug called Thalidomide came out as a treatment for morning sickness. For the women that took this drug, when they became pregnant, their babies had loads of severe birth defects. A more recent example would be Pfizer who tested a drug called Trovan which was supposed to treat meningitis. They tested it on hundreds of children in Nigeria, illegally, in which 10% of the children died and the others suffered blindness, brain damage, and paralysis. By no means am I for a public healthcare system. But I am also not for a private one as I do not believe there is any accountability for these health companies if they perform any illegal or unethical actions.",

For that reason it could only be successful if we eased our way back towards Libertarianism, rather than a rapid change that would leave people who are living off the welfare state stranded and helpless.",

Bernie's goal to force you to pay for other people's health insurance, to house criminal aliens, college education, etc. is all enforced through violence. If Bernie gets his way and you choose not to do what he wants, *men with guns* will come to your house and take your stuff, incarcerate you, or even shoot you if you resist.\n\nAs was shown to happen in communist countries, Bernieism ultimately is enforced through violence and brutality. This is not a man who deserves praise in any way, except perhaps for his consistency over the years, though his views have been consistently wrong and downright evil.",
