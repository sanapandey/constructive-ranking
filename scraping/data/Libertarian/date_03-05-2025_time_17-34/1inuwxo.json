The citizens should have a recourse that keeps the govt in check. Interestingly the armed us citizens are larger than most armies in the world. Also remember, tyranny in any country starts with the disarming of citizens.\n\nGun control has never been a proper solution, control has always led to larger issues. Also for the idiots that cry about gun violence, all gun violence acts break multiple laws. They don\u2019t care about the law, implementing more regulations will only make it harder for ethical citizens to obtain weapons for self defense and make it easier for criminals to commit crimes. \n\nAlso isn\u2019t freedom the core value of libertarianism? Why does govt care if I own a \u201cautomatic sub machine rifle gun\u201d or an RPG? Mental health is the real issue. Only scenario where one should be denied a firearm is if they have a history of violent crime or it can be determined that they have issues and are not mentally fit to own one.",
