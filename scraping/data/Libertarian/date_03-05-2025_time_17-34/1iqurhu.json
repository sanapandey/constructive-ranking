Public utilities, mailing services.. sure, but what do other agencies do that is a marketable \"product\" that wouldn't somehow create some kind of quid pro quo situation, inhibit fair competition, or make our tax-funded resources less accessible to taxpayers? \n\nLook at all these agencies: https://www.usa.gov/agency-index\n\nIf instead of selling something they did their own fundraising, then you start getting into the territory of \"why can't these just be nonprofit organizations?\"  Which, is what libertarians are generally saying lol. I just don't really see your idea being feasible.",
