No printing necessary.\n\n\nBasically it\u2019s a shell game, where the fed doesn\u2019t \u201cprint money\u201d it buys treasuries with money it doesn\u2019t have and gives it to the banks and banks issue loans against that money in a ratio of 1:9 creating even more money.",

It Nnot just the banks but the fed itself as well. remember the fed is buying some of those treasuries from the banks at a profit to the banks. You lower the reserve ratio to incentivize banks to buy US debt they otherwise wouldn\u2019t and then they just turn right back around and sell it to the fed monetizing some of that debt via OMO However we all know what happens when banks suddenly find themselves holding a bunch of bad debt right? We bail them out. They\u2019ll monetize the entire debt all at once if they need to. Maybe they\u2019ll let a couple of smaller banks fail for show to show they\u2019re \u201cserious\u201d about monetary policy. It\u2019s all a confidence game.\n\nI think it just helps to remember \u201cthe fed and treasury has a lot of levers\u201d they will spin up however many word salad programs that aren\u2019t technically QE or money printing but effectually do the same thing that they need to maintain functioning treasury markets.\n\nIt should be common knowledge but the system is intentionally convoluted to keep you trapped inside it. If they were straight up about how half this shit worked I guarantee you a third of Americans would be selling all their dollars for gold or bitcoin.\n\nit gets even more sinister when you realize the same banks that are allowed to sell treasuries to the fed for a profit in OMO are also most likely shareholders in the fed which by law has to give out a 6% dividend yearly to it\u2019s shareholders. We don\u2019t know who actually owns the fed they don\u2019t disclose that but if I was a betting man it\u2019s all the banks like JP Morgan and BOA. So banks buy treasuries from themselves at a profit then pay themselves 6% for doing it.\n\nIn essence, the Fed is converting the government\u2019s debt (in the form of Treasury bonds) into money, which can then be used to finance government spending and private credit creation. This process is also known as \u201cdebt monetization\u201d or \u201cmonetary financing\u201d.",

The only thing that office is doing is setting up the largest slush fund that's ever existed.  Probably to be repurposed as a sovereign wealth fund, cover the cost of deportations, buy some land we have no business owning or whatever Trump's new shiny object is.  The money is allocated and \"fully funded\". With the consolidation of agencies, the ability for \"saved\" money to become fungible grows significantly. The chance that this spending doesn't somehow get used feels like the wrong side of the bet.  Rubber will only meet the road if Congress manages to pass a budget that reduces funding/spending, and if you think you're going to get Congress to agree to cut all the pork they've built over the years, you are far more an optimist than I am.",
