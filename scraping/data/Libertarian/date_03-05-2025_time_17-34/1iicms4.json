What if someone cuts out your tongue? No freedom of speech anymore! What about when the government tear gases a peaceful protest? No more right to assembly! \n\nOn top of that, your next argument is that property tax is paying a bigger guy to protect you. What happens when an even bigger guy takes on your group? What happens when the government decides it has no duty too protect you (Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales)? The government is also forcibly taking your property (money) via the property tax under threat of the said bigger group taking your property. So, you aren't strong enough to protect your property (money) from this bigger group. Meaning once again we loop back to property rights don't exist.\n\nRights are not things that cant be forcibly taken, as that would mean no rights could ever exist while humans are still mortal.",

This \"right\" is what nature, what wilderness operates under..  everybody else probably doesn't want me to have this right, sure, but still, I think I have that right.  So can I rely on it or will I have a problem when I try to exercise it?  And why is that?  Because it exists (in nature) or because a majority is opposing it?\n\nJust because libertarian (natural) rights more or less look OK to you doesn't mean that they are the will or mindset of everybody.. I mean, your threat of using lethal force to exercise your rights against somebody else who has a different view on the rights that he wants to exercise is a sign that those rights are neither objective NOR natural.  They are arbitrary and have a goal - probably even based on the majorities mindset (and what a soceity is actually about).. but still, without the majority actually confirming this and enforcing them SUCCESSFULLY against orther-minded minorities / individuals you can't rely on them.\n\nYou as a individual libertarian are UNABLE to rely on the set of rights you think are applying to you.  You can wish for them, but without a majority of the populace enforcing them successfully against opposers they will not be rights, but wishes or desires at best.\n\nPS:  *\"What happens when an even bigger guy takes on your group?\"*  Well, guess how the natives lost their right to roam \"their property\".  It's all about strength in numbers and having the bigger stick and enforcing ones will against opposing groups.. libertarian (natural) rights, just like any other rule-set relies on a superior power to be rights, that an individual can count on (or not, if it has different ideas about what is right & wrong).\n\nPPS: *\"What happens when the government* *~~decides it~~* *has no duty too protect you?\"*  Well, obviously the legal experts found that the rules didn't cover this case, which means the assumed right actually didn't exist.  Exactly what I'm trying to tell you.  Rights only exist when they are being enforced by the majority.\n\nPPPS: Look at 'human rights' for example and violations of those rule sets.. can all the humans on the planet count on those right applying to them or not?  What does it actually take for those 'rights' to be reliable for a human who expects they apply to him, no matter what?",

The key difference is that ethics concerns rules from an external source and* ***morals are based on each person\u2019s own principles around right and wrong.***\n\n* ***Ethics*** *\u2013 Rules of conduct in a particular culture or group recognised by an external source or social system. For example, a medical code of ethics that medical professionals must follow.*\n* ***Morals*** *\u2013 Principles or habits relating to right or wrong conduct,* ***based on an individual\u2019s own compass of right and wrong.***\n\n*Source:* [*https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/news/ethics-versus-morals/*](https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/news/ethics-versus-morals/)\n\nI guess you subscribe to the notion of an 'objective morality' there somewhere.. I don't.\n\nAs per above definition (and plenty like it made by philosophers / the social sciences) can individuals morals be different **and more importantly opposites.**  What you think is right and wrong does not need to match what I think is right and wrong and that of anyone else.  \nEthics now (for me) are what all our common / compatible morals become WITHIN a society.  And especially under this scenario can we all have the moral conviction - for example - that other races, ethnicities, genders, etc. than the one we represent are less worth, not equal to us.. and if we are the majority and carry a bigger stick we can then enforce this morale within our society against any minority or individuals that thinks otherwise.\n\nSee how this is going to work?\n\nSee how this applies to libertarian (natural) rights vis a vi groups or individuals who have different rights and wrongs on their mind?\n\nThe absolutist view of your morals for me is a relative thing and not realistic.  For it to become a dominant ethic of a society (for me) relies on a majority with a bigger stick standing behind it, not more, not less.\n\n*PS:  this argument also puts to rest the notion of an 'objective morality'.  There isn't one.  Societies made up of individuals have Ethics based on the common Morals of it's members (like a Venn-diagram) and are organizational constructs whose whole purpose/function is to suppress morals of minorities/individuals that oppose the majorities ethics.  In the case of our human societies their goal is to enable cooperative work sharing specialists to be an evolutionary superior form of existence for a human than the generalist, who is capable of surviving in wilderness, which doesn't enforce common morals (Ethics).*\n\nPPS: this view of things also is consistent with the morals of a thief, or sociopath. Those morals are simply not compatible with the morals of a cooperative work sharing (I assume, but do not declare) MAJORITY who wants to be able to specialize to enjoy the gains of higher efficiency and what that means for the individuals (now easier) acquisition of resources for survival, reproduction and comfort.",

What was 'being represented' actually about?\n\nPPS: this is actually what I'm trying to angle for with my original post, but which is made very complicated by the way (most?) libertarians think about (natural) rights, how they expect them \"to work\".  In a nutshell I'm trying to argue that a 'monopol on force' (biggest group that is successful enforcing their will) is a natural occurrence, esp in a libertarian society and that the problem you have with it (state, government) are actually not its existence, but by the way that society (over time) gets to the rules that this monopol enforces, which leads to non-libertarian ideals being enforced against all odds - reliably over the history of humankind.\n\nThe nut we have to crack is the process by which we get to the rules as it is clear that a monopol will naturally form that enforces it and it obviously will be capable of enforcing rules that benefit a few at the cost of the rest.. so, how does the rule creation and maintenance process look like, which obviously sooner or later deviates from libertarian ideals and serves a few only.  Does libertarianism has got an answer to this problem?",

Them specializing is what takes from their ability to be a good generalist who is capable to exist in a wilderness, to successfully defend himself and his stuff.\n\nAnd here comes the rub.. this specialized work sharing existence requires the enforcing of rules that forbid (natural) opportunistic behavior.. this is what leads to personal freedom and private property to be required concepts individuals can rely on and want to have.

I think because of people who WANT others to provide them with 'things for free' get in charge of that construct and start to enforce rules to that goal..**\n\n**So, how do libertarians want to prevent that structure from being controlled by a few only, if it forms naturally in the first place and whose function is to successfully enforce rules against minorities / individuals against their will? Isn't that the very problem you're facing right now?  Well, how do you avoid it as soon as a libertarian militia has liberated everything and is starting to specialize in 'rule enforcing services for libertarians'?**",

Because if they had, they would have figured out that another \"feature\" that emanates from those rights being a requirement for specialists who OUTSOURCE tasks they are not adept at (which increases their efficiency of turning lifetime into resources for survival, reproduction and comfort in what they are adept at) is strength in numbers, that they HAVE TO team up to enforce those rights (against opposing minorities / individuals) and that this right enforcing construct sooner or later becomes a monopol on force.. and further that it is not the monopol on force itself that is our problem (because that thing actually is a \"natural\" phenomenon for a society) - but the way it creates and maintains the rules that it enforces for all are what is the problem.\n\nYou want to bear arms because not all (or most) humans have those intrinsic values in them.. well, what do you think will be the intrinsic humanity of the humans who are creating and maintaining the rules that this inevitable monopol on force is going to enforce?

Too few are in control of it and are PERSONALLY INCENTIVIZED to create and maintain rules that benefit them at the cost of the rest.\n\nAnd a libertarian society will run into that very same problem IMHO as strength in numbers is inevitable creating a monopol on force whose job it is to enforce libertarian (natrual) rights for specialist  libertarians AGAINST minorities or individuals who oppose those rights.",

If your justification for why I shouldn't steal from you and burn your house down is \"I don't like it, and it's not socially beneficial,\" that's really not persuasive and is just a subjective matter of opinion. It's also, more importantly, just not true. You are created in the imago dei, which is why it's wrong to harm you and violate your property. That fact transcends everything else and is the only objective grounds of personal liberty that exists. Without that fact, then you're right, rights mean nothing and it's not wrong to r\\*pe, kill or steal.\n\nAs for your points about rights enforcement agencies becoming monopolies on force, I disagree. Why is there a greater risk of monopoly in that specific context than in any other business? Natural monopolies rarely form and never actually last long when they do. The only way that enduring monopolies are created is through criminal action that disregards human rights, which is what we refer to as the \"state.\" \n\nIf your biggest critique of libertarian theory is that it could theoretically eventually devolve into what we already have currently, then I'll take it, lol. This is the reason that Jefferson said what he said about the \"tree of liberty.\" It needs to be maintained, and often that maintenance requires force against tyrants. Nobody is claiming that anarchy would be 100% stable and impossible to overturn. As far as I'm aware, nobody has ever claimed such a thing. But it's preferable to what we have right now, even if it's temporary.",

Which means I acknowledge religions evolutionary function, but also realize that it has been surpassed in its efficiency by modern concepts - it's been a long way from natural religions over polytheism to monotheism - which (you won't like this) will also fade and all of it eventually dominated by 'rule-of-law-made-by-men'.

I'm talking several 100.000 years here.\n\nAll that being said - I believe what the natural sciences figured out via reasoning and deduction examining the evidence for what they found around us.  And there it is biology that (based on physics and chemistry) tells us how individual life \"behaves\" which then should become the foundation for the social sciences, esp. political science and economic science.

That is what 'survival instinct' is about and logically will lead to the demise of a living being if it wouldn't have it..  I mean, if it is not up to trying to survive itself (and this includes defending its existence) then it will cease to exist, it will stop being alive.  \nIf you need approval by a god for this feature of life that you represent to feel better / quench your doubts, by all means, go for it.

Strength in numbers can still apply just as easily as under a state, and in fact, without a state, you don't have to worry about a monopoly coming in and prohibiting you from defending yourself and your particular clan. Waco is a good example of this... in a stateless society, for one, nobody would likely be trying to go after Koresh's group in the first place, but if they were, there wouldn't be virtually infinite resources able to be allocated toward going after them (as was the case with the ATF). It would actually be prohibitively dangerous and expensive to wage attacks like that, whereas, $10 million here and there is nothing to a government.\n\nIdk if that clears anything up.",

Libertarianism (parts of it at least) just appear out of that logic - if one assumes that the more efficient life/organism/system prevails (given enough time).

I would say though that anarchistic societies likely wouldn't grow into something the size of a global empire like the US federal government, and that's totally fine. I take a more idealistic view than a practical view about it. I'm less concerned about implementation of hypothetical anarchistic systems than I am about the philosophical underpinnings. I found the most \"just\" and moral theoretical form of society and just use that as a personal \"north star.\" \n\nOn a personal note, I'm not trying to overthrow the state or anything (we have that in common), but I pursue any move away from centralization and toward self-sufficiency, voluntary exchange, loving my neighbor, etc that I can and I celebrate wins that I see in that direction. I just try to use those principles to guide my decision making. As a Christian, I don't think the purpose of Christianity is to \"establish a Christian nation.\" I think that misses the point completely. Jesus didn't come as a political operative to establish an earthly regime, but to save His people from their sins and establish a spiritual kingdom. That transcends nations, governments, tribes, etc. That's fundamentally why I'm an anarchist, because I reject the legitimacy of human authority.",

Does the state have a monopoly on force? \n\nA - Not really. If the people can form their own well-regulated militias, the state does not have a monopoly on force. I'ma subsidiarian minarchist, which is a fancy way of saying I think goverments should be as local as possible (local sovereignty) and do as little as necessary (minarchy, as opposed to anarchy - like governmental minimalism). \n\nThe Declaration of Independence says that governments derive their power from the consent of the governed. This matches the idea that a national government is an entity that has a monopoly on the *legitimate* use of force. \n\nBut if we think about a nation like the US, where the right of people to form their own militias is enshrined in law - we have a nation where the legitimate use of force can belong to the state, or to the people. The right to keep and bear arms (in libertarian constitutional theory) belongs to the people AND the government, and the history of militias is that of self-organized military units, rather than state-controlled military units. \n\nCurrently we don't really have an use of that, but in theory, should the state frustrate the governed, or fail the governed, the people can step in and solve problems for themselves. The state's monopoly on violence is optional. \n\nOf course, we haven't seen a need to resort to home-grown violence and home grown institutions, out of sort of a \"mutually assured destruction\" theory. The federal government knows that its monopoly on force and law and order rest on them not transgressing to far on its constituents wishes. They recognize that there is a FAFO limit on their monopoly, and they don't push certain boundaries. They let the Malheur Wildlife Refuge people avoid an actual confrontation. They didn't push COVID requirements on states from the national level. They don't fire bullets into crowds of protestors who are throwing rocks. They back down when the Governor of Texas has issues with what feds are doing at the border. \n\nThey don't want to pick a fight they can't win, so they prudently avoid big exercises of the state's de facto monopoly on violence.\n\nSo oddly enough, the US doesn't have a monopoly on violence. The people do, through the institution of militias, they just haven't used it in a long long time.",

This is what I mean when I say 'monopol' there.  Any other congregation of - say individuals and their mind-set of how things should be organized - becomes a minority in this picture.  If their mindset, say wants to prevail against the wishes of the current 'ruling' mind-set, they would (to be successful) need to be a bigger force (\\*), a bigger stick, need to be able to overcome (ultimately violently) the part of the populace that wants something else.  \n*\\*) At a 1:1 ratio of \"red vs blue\" the outcome is not given. At a 1:2 ratio it starts to become less of a gamble..  at 1:3 and higher it's very unlikely that the smaller group will be able to force the larger group to dance per their wishes. Another way to say '1:3' is 75%..  which means that what the 75% wish for is what they are going to enforce against others - this can be described as a monopoly-situation IMHO.  What the 25% or less want (if it goes against what the 75% want) doesn't really matter (esp if they want different things).. there is no chance they can enforce it without being severely punished/disciplined for it, so the smart move there is to knuckle under and accept the rule of the majority (and what they commonly want) - the monopol on force that this represents.*\n\nDoes that make any sort of sense for you, or is that 'gibberish'?\n\nMy whole point of the OP and successive replies here aims to establish the argument that:\n\n1. societies are based on a monopol on force (as per above explanation) and\n2. the rules that this monopol enforces - if only a few get to create and maintain them - will guaranteed (sooner or later) benefit a few at the cost of the rest\n\nI'm not knocking the USA, the DoI or it's constitution or the achievement it represents, but for me it's just one example of many all over the planet and in history.  I'm interested - esp as we are in the 'Libertarian-sub' - how a (theoretical?) libertarian society is charting this malaise?  The fall back of organized-militias, that reigning in of a berserk-government for me is the least desirable way to solve this problem when it is apparent WHAT kind of mechanism is responsible and HOW it could be countered way less destructive and more humane.",

Further, the group (the majority(\\*)) will suppress / eliminate morals, wishes and mindsets that actually OPPOSE the common majority view.\n\nThe result now is that you as an individual (with an opposing mindset) will experience this as a monopol that doesn't allow you to deviate.  For a certain moral, wish, mindset there is only one variation allowed - anything else gets you disciplined by the group.\n\nAn example of this could be that you are morally wired to have no qualms about acquiring  what you have the opportunity and means to acquire - even if the object of acquisition could (or even obviously) was somebody else's \"property\" (lets call this stealing).  If you act on this and get found out - your moral view and subsequent action will be disciplined by the majority(\\*), by the monopol.\n\nYou can apply this to any type of moral conviction that you have and how this works out in different groups the world over - all the way from very small groups like model-train-associations up to nation-states and everything between.  Relevant to us now is the upper end of this - the nation-state and where it is about the MOST BASIC and FOUNDATIONAL morals, wishes and mindset of 'a people'.\n\nMy point from the beginning (OP) was and still is that any society - which includes a libertarian society - will wind up with this monopol on what is right & wrong and that libertarian (natural) rights are only reliable valid rights an individual libertarian can COUNT ON if a monopol (on force) stands behind them, **not by wielding arms himself.**\n\nAnd now - the finale - that this construct now (perversely, once established) is able to also enforce morals, wishes and mindsets of minorities **that go against the morals, wishes and mindsets of the majority** \\- IF MINORITIES CAN GET IN CONTROL OF IT.  And in our real exiting societies this happens via the way we transform personal morals, wishes and mindsets into rules, into law, into rights that individuals can depend on.  Because a minority of (elected) lawmakers has the final say, not the majority(\\*).\n\n\\*) 'majority' needs clarification.  I'll do that if you want to.  For simplicity (and I can argue it and provide examples) it means at least 66.7% of the group, at least 2 out of 3, at least 2 against 1 - because it needs to be reliable and obvious to the minority that it is OUTGUNNED and the logical, smart, life-sustaining move is to KNUCKLE UNDER peacefully.  If the inferior minority view carrying individuals or groups don't do that the majority will discipline them, ultimately violently.  \nThis logic is what stands behind RELIABLE rights an individual can count on and which differentiates rights that you wish you had and rights that you actually have.",

Like a computer program or a robot which, once the majority inputs a decision, must be carried out by the majority. It reminds me a physics equation that starts with \"Imagine a frictionless plane\" or \"assume a spherical cow\".  \n\nThis is not how human societies work. Humans are capable of monkey-wrenching political apparatuses by shirking, hiding, or simply making forced compliance too burdensome. Every social structure can be ground to a halt through friction, and compliance can only be enforced on a very small minority, and even then humans are just stubbornly resistant and compliance can never be completely forced. \n\nThis goes back to my original point about the \"consent of the governed\". Mechanisms for enforcing the power of the state are inefficient - there's a lot of friction. Any more than token dissent grinds the entire thing to a halt. \n\nTake the original example. You have a person who owns their own land. Someone comes to take it. That person resists alone. They are killed or imprisoned and the land is seized. \n\nBut let's say that it's a community - like communities that resist policing in inner city America. People are cooperating with each other to conceal identities, run from the cops, re-enter land after it has been seized. \n\nOr it's taken to another level - barricades are set up, police cars are vandalized, precincts are firebombed...\n\nA determined minority can make the nation state back down. It can increase the cost of enforcement to the point where the majority realizes that it's not worth it. \n\nSee - Malheur Wildlife Refuge. CHOB Portland (or Seattle?). The Occupy movement. \n\nSo - you are under-estimating the power of dissent, and over-estimating the power of a majority to actually coerce a minority, even with the power of a state. \n\nObservation 2: I'm still not sure I understand what you're trying to say here: \"My point from the beginning (OP) was and still is that any society - which includes a libertarian society - will wind up with this monopol on what is right & wrong and that libertarian (natural) rights are only reliable valid rights an individual libertarian can COUNT ON if a monopol (on force) stands behind them,\u00a0**not by wielding arms himself.**\"\n\nUnless what you're saying is this: you can't resist the state alone.

Just much better than an individual is able to 'quash' others who got an opposing moral conviction.\n\n*\"Mechanisms for enforcing the power of the state are inefficient - there's a lot of friction.

But this means the rules that govern can only be based on the common moral convictions of the majority of 'the governed'.. which is a mono thing, not a multi or plurality thing.  It's those rules and no other rules, in your case only libertarian rules.  That's mono.  And if the governed outsource the governing to a entity that does that and apply those rules to all it's a monopol(y) that enforces those rules - and this has to happen, so that all that are being governed are exposed to the same rules, so they are equals.\n\nIf you got a group that enforces Libertarian-Anarchism rules and another that enforces Libertarian-Socialist rules.. aso asf.. where is the equalness?  Which rules apply to whom when and where?  You assume 'libertarian natural rights' are it.  I doubt that.  Just look at some threads on this Libertarian sub alone and figure all the different moral convictions (which even change over time by some accounts) regarding this or that.. no unity = no equalness.  \nYou will only get equallness for the common moral convictions for which there is an overwhelming majority..  and my question is - how do you get there?  How do you figure this common set of 'libertarian moral convictions' out among 'a people'?\n\nVia elections?  Via voting?  What?\n\nAnd what I want to say is - our current political systems the world over figure those common sets of moral convictions via a process that puts a few into the position of lawmaker and this is a problem (lacks competition).. as they are a minority who will care for its benefit.  What I learned so far is that libertarianism isn't looking into that. You define some mini-gov or no-gov libertarian situation, but per my above explanation do I not understand how that can be libertarian for all if the rules are not for all equally enforced, if everybody does it himself.. well, there is different (even opposing) moral convictions among 'a people'.\n\nWhat is your political process for that?  All I get so far is - there is none.  Well, hos do you then figure the common moral convictions if not by a political process?\n\n*\"you can't resist the state alone. In which case I agree, that's why you would form a militia with your friends to resist the state\"*  Fine, how do you and your friends figure out what ethics your militia is going to enforce against that 'state' thing?",

You don't form a militia to create a pure ideal state, you form a militia to solve a problem by killing, or threatening to kill, someone. \n\nSocieties (and governments) don't operate like computers or logic machines. You don't \"install\" an ethic at the top and then all actions are taken according to that ethic.\n\nRather, you have lots and lots of individuals, and groups, deciding to do specific things. Sometimes when I go out to eat, I pick a salad. This aligns with my overall intent to eat healthy. But sometimes, in other situations, I chose the cheeseburger. Ethics and principles are attempts to constrain or make our individual decisions predictable, but there's no direct line in any government from \"ethics/principles\" to \"decisions\" and \"actions\".\n\nDecisions are made the way actual humans make them, by talking, and then agreeing, and then doing. We hope that our decisions are good, we try to guide them with principles and ethics, but ultimately we use guesswork and consensus to make decisions and then...we see what happens!\n\nWe do have institutions and laws based on libertarian ethics. Which is IMHO the best way to constrain governments and majorities. The rule of law protects basic liberties from the power of the majority: we don't let people enslave other people. That's against the law. We don't let the government regulate speech. We don't let rights to property be revoked without due process of law. We don't allow taxation without representation. And we have a good legal system to back these things up and enforce them on the majority.\n\nThese laws are the basis of our libertarian society. And should my militia of friends decide to resist the state, we would probably publish a Declaration of Independence or a manifesto so people would know why we are doing what we are doing. Generally, the threat of rebellion is enough to keep the things we want to rebel against from happening. Much like Mutually Assured Destruction, the threat of uprising keeps the state from doing stupid things that would cause an uprising.\n\nFinally: \"You define some mini-gov or no-gov libertarian situation, but per my above explanation do I not understand how that can be libertarian for all if the rules are not for all equally enforced, if everybody does it himself.. well, there is different (even opposing) moral convictions among 'a people'.\"\n\nWho cares? We aren't trying to create a perfect utopia. We are trying to preserve a really good libertarian system that we have (the current US system) and maybe improve it a little bit.\n\nThe best way we have found, so far as a race, to protect individual liberties from the tyranny of the majority, is the current US system. Strong constitutional protection for individual life, liberty and property. Strong, decentralized legal system to rein in tyranny with the Rule of Law.\n\nYou can try and find an abstract perfect system all day long - and argue over the color of the unicorns in that system.\n\nBut we don't live in a world of abstract principles and pure theory. We live in a world with friction and compromise and messiness and \"good enough.\"\n\nAlso, I don't believe in pure individualism - I think that libertarianism isn't an attempt to destroy the individual's dependence on society, I think it's an attempt to create protections for individual liberty so that an individual's necessary, natural dependence on other people doesn't turn into the tyranny of the other people.",

I know how the USA works in this regard and for a lot of other societies on this planet, now and in the past.  So Nature (the process of societal evolution) obviously hasn't yet figured out a \"fool-proof\" way to come up with a construct that does NOT rely on the basic fall-back mechanism that organized-militias represent.\n\nLibertarian ideology is based on PERMANENT cooperative competition among equals. For every citizen to be an equal (no matter man, woman, ethnicity, race, gender, etc.) the rules that 'govern' them necessarily need to be the same everywhere where those citizens exist - which for me is a 'monopol'.  This now means that any change or addition of rules ALSO requires the approval of the majority of the people to be sustainable.\n\nDo we achieve that by electing a few into positions of power (lawmakers) or is that rather an odd move?  I mean, putting (to varying degrees selfish) individuals into such a position - IMHO - asks for trouble.  Especially if the deviation that a rule change brings that benefits a few at the cost of the rest at first is minuscule and most likely not recognized as such - even by experts.\n\nAdam Smith described this \"theoretical problem\" in his Wealth of Nations very clearly (and I could give you real world examples of how this works right now, but first I have to clarify this more to convey the logic of this for you to accept the concept):\n\n*\"The interest of the dealers \\[referring to stock owners, manufacturers, and merchants.. anyone really\\], however, in any particular branch of trade or manufacture, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public.  To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers.  To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens.\"*\n\n*&*\n\n*\"The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.  It comes from an order of men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.\"*  Wealth of Nations, chapter 11, part 3, last paragraph\n\nHow does Libertarian ideology deal with this problem?  A representative democracy (or in your case a constitutional republic) doesn't really deal with it at all either (otherwise we wouldn't be discussing it right now, doh) - it IGNORES it straight out and more or less relies on the basic fall-back mechanism of organized-militias to counter it (with or without a DoI).  That the USA does and did behave and work the way it does is based on the rule enforcing mechanism benefiting a few at the cost of the rest (HOW that exactly works I can/will explain in future) pretty much from the start.",

Evolution doesn't work top-down.  Evolution works bottom-up.  Revolutions (of which the DoI is just 'the program') are blank-sheet reactions to a framework having become unsustainable.\n\nMy goal / approach is to figure out HOW the rules actually benefit a few at the cost of the rest (which I found to be a result of disabling competition, i.e. creating and maintaining rules that are anti-competitive) and see if this can be reverted where it matters (and has the most impact for least effort) - in the niches that are being covered by those anti-competitive rules.  You see, this would REVERSE the effect and REINSTATE competition and by addressing them one by one not require a \"restart\" of the whole operation for it to become sustainable again.\n\nAnd why I think this can work is based on the paradigm of the free market - the most economical / efficient \"commodity\" should prevail.  The clue to realizing that this can work is the simple fact that anti-competitive rules prevent more efficient / economic \"commodities\" to be on offer.. or in other words - if we figure out WHAT kind of competition the currently enforced rules exactly prevent and then (against all odds) provide that commodity more economically / efficiently anyway - we can nudge the whole thing, bit by bit.\n\nI'm 90% convinced that this can work, but I might have blind spots and it's kinda hard to figure those on your own - which is why I discuss stuff like this with other people.  Does that make sense?\n\nPPS: I read the other 2 replies and regard their content as covered within this 3-part reply.",

The purpose of government, as established by the US Dec of Ind. and Constitution, is to protect individual rights and restrain the power of the state. \n\nBut in practice, it took a long time for those rights to be extended to black people and women and gay people. \n\nDr. MLK Jr. quite famously said that the Civil Rights movement was an attempt to \"cash a check that the founders wrote.\" The idea being they were owed rights, but the bank (society) kept refusing to give them what they were owed. \n\nBut he did endorse the foundational idea (the purpose of the state is to protect individual rights, promote peace, and provide a stable and predictable legal system in which people can thrive). \n\nThis goes back to idealism vs. pragmatism: our Justice System is absolutely not just. It favors the wealthy and well lawyered, and it has been used to persecute  minorities and the poor by the rich and majority. *As has every legal system ever invented. all the way back to Hammurabi's code,* which defined different classes of people who got different levels of justice. \n\nWe have a system of justice that violates its own ideals, but does so in a way that provides a lot more justice than the past. In somewhat the same way that Communism aims for equality, but actually creates inequality and poverty - but free market capitalism, acknowledging self-interest and capturing it for the common good, creates more wealth for everyone. \n\nAnd in turn, with more people being wealthy, more people are able to protect themselves from injustice and provide for their own needs, minorities and the poor are actually better off than they are in societies that aim to be utopian. \n\nSo the ideals and the aim of an institution can be opposite its effect - in a weird way, ignoring social programs and improving economic opportunities by getting out of the way can help minorities and the poor secure their own civil rights by self-empowerment through wealth. But attempting to help people through government run programs creates dependency upon a state, which is inevitably seized by people who want to abuse minorities and the poor.",

What might cause those revolutions is the metamorphosis of humanity into a more virtual, digital reality (people living in the cloud, so to speak) - and what lies on the other side of that revolution is un-imagineable to me, and also outside of my lifespan. \n\nI will say that I think what the US is doing now is undergoing a bit of a revolution. My hope is that the Supreme  Court's recent decisions limiting its power (through overturning Roe v Wade and returning that decision to the legislature and the states, and refusing to take part in presidential candidate screening/interfering with Democracy) will force Congress to do its job. \n\nAnd I hope that people terrified by Trump's use of executive power will begin stripping the Executive Branch of power, returning it to Congress and the States. \n\nI hope that abolishing the Department of Education will encourage the states to step in and do that locally. \n\nAnd I hope that abolishing USAID will be part of a move to change the structure of charity from national government based to voluntary social organization based. Everything USAID does as a large organization can be done by the Gates Foundation. or another large private charitable organization, without the political infighting and corruption. \n\nAnd those are fundamentally libertarian positions: private charity, self-governance, local governance preference.",

Individual libertarians are in no position to reliably enforce their (natural) rights against groups that are stronger than them - so they team up (organized militias have been suggested) which sooner or later (economies of scale, specialization, work sharing, markets) will become a service that needs payment..  well, how would you call that payment?",

If protection agencies had to compete for customers instead of extracting payment through force, you wouldn\u2019t see land taken over failure to pay an arbitrary tax. The argument that libertarians would simply recreate the state assumes coercion is necessary for security, but voluntary associations and market competition provide alternative enforcement mechanisms without forced taxation.",

So you think that competing rule enforcers (which enforce different rules or the same?) would not coalesce into a monopol sooner or later simply due to economies of scale?  And once that state has been reached this monopol will be capable of enforcing the rules against resistance by any other - now minority or individual..  **so it's not that government doesn't allow competition, it's simply that it ALREADY quashed any competition in that space and is the monopol.**\n2. *\"you wouldn\u2019t see land taken over failure to pay an arbitrary tax\"* .. if someone doesn't pay that tax and isn't being protected - why should \"passerby's\" (for lack of better word for a market force that correct this freeloader behavior) not take the opportunity and do their thing in seizing control of that property against the will of the current 'occupant'?  I mean.. if I don't pay, does it matter who actually comes for my property?  I don't expect the protection force to do that publicly obviously (though, it surely would incentivize policy closures with clients if they see what happens when they don't pay their tax) - maybe a bad cop arm that is being subsidized by the paying clients.",

Protection agencies in a free market would have incentives to remain competitive because consumers can leave. Unlike the state, they wouldn\u2019t have legal privileges granting them absolute authority or barring new entrants.\n\nGovernments don\u2019t just \u201cnaturally\u201d form through competition. They form through violence and coercion, outlawing competitors, jailing dissenters, and forcing participation. A market for protection would still have competition and checks against centralization because customers wouldn\u2019t tolerate a monopoly that behaves like a state.\n\nAs for property rights, you\u2019re making the argument that if someone stops paying for protection, their property is fair game for anyone to seize. This assumes protection services operate like a mob rather than contractual enforcement agencies. In a market, a provider wouldn\u2019t necessarily \u201ctake\u201d a client\u2019s property but might stop enforcing their claims, just like how unpaid security guards don\u2019t rob the business they once protected.\n\nIf no one upholds property rights, sure, people might seize land, but that\u2019s just anarchy in the chaos sense, not in the libertarian sense. The whole point of private enforcement is to maintain a rights-respecting order without the perverse incentives of a state. The distinction between a government taking your land for nonpayment of taxes and a private agency refusing to protect you is that a private system allows alternative solutions, competition, and voluntary exchange. The state simply dictates and takes.",
