Your area hasn't had a functioning government since the 1920s.\n\nI don't care what you call it; the reason you don't understand this is because you don't like the concept of westphalian Nations.  You think a place like France is just an area of the world no different than any other.  But it is different. It's filled with French people.  French people have a culture, a unified culture even.  They also have a nation.  French people just like Americans want to buy products made by French people.  They want no taxes on those products.  Putting tariffs or taxes or whatever you call them on foreign products made by other countries is not a concern of libertarianism.  A nation cannot rely on foreign products (or foreign workers for that matter).  That's why England is a caliphate now.  They opened their borders and opened up their trade with no consideration of their own citizens, and now you get thrown in prison for questioning any of it.  And unfortunately they cannot defend themselves against their own government.  \n\nWhen you cease to care about your citizens, and especially your citizens ability to engage in capitalism, libertarianism pretty much doesn't even matter at that point because you don't have a country then.  \n\nI don't want cheap plastic shit from China.  I don't care how much it costs because I'm not going to buy it.  I'm going to buy American and I want my government to keep all that cheap Chinese crap out of my country or charge the shit out of people who want to buy it.  That's nationalist libertarianism.

We could have chosen not to pay the tax by not buying tea (and largely, we did). However, the fact that we could avoid it didn't make it not a tax, nor less objectionable.\n\nWhat do you call money that must be paid to the government when a customer buys cigarettes? You don't have to buy cigarettes.\n\nYou can avoid gas taxes by choosing to drive an EV instead of a gas or diesel vehicle.\n\nYou can avoid sales taxes by choosing to be self-sufficient and not buy retail goods.\n\nYou can avoid income taxes by choosing to be self-sufficient and not work a wage job.\n\nYou can avoid property taxes by choosing not to own real estate.\n\nThe only type of taxes that we can't legally avoid are head taxes, a tax paid for the privilege of living. We don't have those anymore.\n\nBut just because we can choose not to engage in activity that can be taxed, doesn't mean those aren't taxes.\n\nSame with tariffs.\n\nWhat do you call it when the government requires payment in order to allow someone to do some economic activity?  A tax.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=tariff+dictionary\n\n\nHowever, you can't really avoid the cost of tariffs by buying domestic.  The whole point of protective tariffs is to allow domestic producers to charge higher prices without having to worry about being undercut by foreign competition.\n\nSo even if you never buy imported goods, you are still likely to experience tariff inflation at the store.\n\nAgain, basic economics.\n\n\nFinally, the whole idea of you and the government telling me that it's unpatriotic to buy imported goods and will therefore be taxed for it, is antithetical to liberty on two fronts.\n\n1. It's a tax\n2. It seeks to coerce us to change our behavior.\n\nIf you want to buy American because of your patriotic values, nothing is stopping you now. I encourage you to do so.\n\nBut telling other Americans that they can't buy imports without heavy taxation is quintessential big government.",

There are, however, silver linings to this, such as the ease of starting a small business...so long as you don't draw unwanted attention.\n\n\nThe US is much, much more legalistic than China. This can be good (such as taking the free speech provision of the constitution mostly seriously, unlike China which also has free speech and press in their constitution as a bad joke), but also leads to a lot of the justice system problems we complain about here a lot.",

A true libertarian society would be so alien to the vast majority of Americans as to present an ontological shock. Americans are accustomed to being told what they can and can\u2019t do and their desire to be governed increases in direct proportion to population density. \n\nThat said, the some of the things that Trump, et.al. are doing now, such as Doge, if not grounded in Libertarian philosophy, are aligned with Libertarian principles. President Trump\u2019s efforts to reduce the federal workforce, deregulate agencies, and dismantle bureaucratic structures exhibit instrumental alignment with libertarian principles advocating limited government intervention and fiscal restraint. His executive orders imposing a \u201cfour-for-one\u201d hiring ratio, aggressive attrition strategies, and elimination of agencies like USAID reflect a derivative application of libertarian ideals, prioritizing downsizing as a tool to curb state overreach and enhance private-sector efficiency. However, these actions diverge from core libertarian tenets in practice\u2014such as Trump\u2019s support for protectionist tariffs, expansive immigration enforcement revealing a superficial consonance with libertarianism rather than a philosophically rooted adherence. While framed as reducing bureaucratic bloat, the administration\u2019s approach emphasizes centralized executive power over decentralized, market-driven solutions, creating a paradoxical blend of anti-statist rhetoric and authoritarian methods.

Every executive order issued is something of an affront to democracy.\n\nTo be clear also, I don't even really blame Trump for this, it's been a growing problem through just about every president in my lifetime; they just keep giving the executive more and more power, and each president has been less and less afraid to wield it. Now we're to a place where the majority of the legislative and judicial branches are basically cheerleaders and yes-men for the executive, and the executive fancies himself as infallible and is willing to act accordingly. If we continue this trend much further, we're going to find ourselves looking an awful lot like Russia within the next decade or so.",

For example we'd have been spending more in the decommissioning of the arms we've been giving to Ukraine than the expense of delivering them there. Those arms are then used to perpetuate a conflict that is obliterating the economy of an opposition world power. We're basically saving money to win a war we don't even have to actually fight, and that in turn has helped the US economy to recover more quickly from COVID relative to much of the rest of the world. If we want the dollar to be strong against the currencies of other nations, that is still important.\n\nSimilarly, there are foreign aid programs in countries like Africa to stifle the spread of disease around the world; surely we would spend far more in insurance premiums and medical expenses to cover the cost of widespread monkey pox, ebola, HIV, etc in this country than we do to fight it there. It's not foolish to spend millions there to save billions here, not to mention lives.\n\nSome of those programs may well need more or different support from the government to function more effectively - that said, I'm sure there are also countless foreign aid programs that exist only to garner good will in vain or where the value proposition has shifted and needs to be reevaluated, or was never really there to begin with. Those sorts of arrangements need to be addressed, by the legislature, in the form of elimination or restructuring.\n\nWe should avoid throwing out the baby with the bath water, and beyond that, I don't think it should be for the president to decide unilaterally, and even less so do I believe that a unelected rich guy should even have a word in the conversation",

The realities of the world are simply more complicated than that though. Politicians from every party pitch to what they feel is the lowest common denominator, so it's very often that you get slogan level insight into existing or proposed arrangements that don't work out logically much deeper than perhaps as a good starting position. From that point you'd then work out the best overall solution with logic and reason, even if that means making compromises or creative workarounds.\n\nYou might say for example illegal immigrants need to be deported with maximum velocity..... But I assume you like to eat fresh fruits and vegetables - you can deport everyone, but it's not like there are thousands of out of work American farm workers willing to work for next to nothing that will immediately swoop in to fill the void that's left. A more rational plan would involve building up farm industry and appeal in the agricultural industry among Americans and gradually executing deportations, whilst slowing/stopping the influx of new illegal immigrants. Or if you prefer a more dystopian future, we could advance AI and robotics to the point where farms can run with next to no actual human involvement (which would likely require huge govt programs btw), and then proceed with the deportations.\n\nWhat you don't actually want to do is round up everyone overnight and hock them over the border or into prisons and hope for the best, even if that's the chant-able version of your position; that'd be entirely asinine given the amount of our hard labor force that they represent and the lack of at-the-ready people or technology that would be necessary to replace them.\n\nSo yes reducing or eliminating foreign aid is a great platform talking point, but if you actually did just cut 100% of every program over night with no actual understanding of how those programs were positioned, you might find yourself creating an even greater burden for America, and you may have also burned bridges or been replaced by world adversaries on the way out making it more difficult to undo.",

There were checks and balances in place for a reason. Trump has had no issue singling out those who go against what he is proposing and then watching as those who were against him fall in line. So it really wouldn\u2019t be hard for him to call out those elected officials who were not properly doing their duties on the national platform to get them to actually act as they are meant to function. He won\u2019t tho because then he would be absolving himself of the power shift given by congress because they don\u2019t seem to want to manage the purse. You think he or anyone in that position is really giving up that power? Which is the congress\u2019s power per the constitution. Putting the money as non earmarked (most is) in the executive branch hands basically leaves \u201cwe the people\u201d without much recourse. Please seen Hein V FFR Supreme Court ruling of 2007.",

In the huge flurry of executive orders, you might have missed that he has mandated that for every new regulation proposed, a regulatory body has to bring him 10 regulations to be deleted. In his first term that number was two.\n\nThough sone here will disagree with me I think the immigration thing is also moving closer to libertarian ideals because the United States happens to shower welfare on poor folks, and is doubling tripling, quadrupling, etc., down on this with the current crop of immigrants.\n\nTo me, his most anti-libertarian actions have to do with the way that he is accomplishing all of this. Over the last 50 years or so the American Congress has concentrated more and more power in the hands of the executive branch. And Trump is using that to his full advantage in accomplishing his agenda. In my mind, a libertarian stance would be to return power to the Congress so as to ensure the separation of powers that the constitution specifies. But this one is complicated because a lot of that executive branch power comes through regulatory agencies, and as I said before Trump is cutting their power by cutting the number of regulations.\n\nI\u2019m sure I have missed some things in here, and I\u2019d love to see other people\u2018s comments. But I think on balance Mr. Trump is moving closer to libertarianism, but using some democratic means to do so.",

Huge cuts in Military budget would be great, with the exception of existing Veteran services, those should be expanded.  No more proxy wars or wars where we are not in obvious direct harm if we don't take action.  \n\nI'm fine with a lot of basic social services too, although not so much for immigrants.  They should be required to be able to provide for themselves via a job or whatever like most people are required if they want to immigrate to a modern first world country.",

Trump wants to abolish the Department of Education, Trump wants to remove income tax (although you can debate the other tax alternatives he is proposing), Trump is finally the first president in a long time to start downsizing the government agencies at a massive scale.\n\nThis is not to say Trump is pro-libertarian, he's not. He's a moderate conservative who still wants to protect some big government spending like entitlement programs, use tariffs as an American protectionist policy, and still have some influence over some areas like Gaza.\n\nDespite all that, Trump is the first president in 100 years to go toe and toe against the corrupt bureaucracy of the federal government. That has to count for something. Even if he can't dismantle the bureaucracy at a large scale, at least he will get the ball rolling because the anti-bureaucracy crowd is getting larger in the Republican party.\n\nMomentum matters. Libertarians can't get everything they want, but they can at least recognize the larger push for less bureaucracy.",
