Florida has a lot of snow birds who only live in the state part-time but many own large homes and certainty benefit from things funded by taxes, like roads, local infrastructure, police and fire. Not to mention that many condos in South Florida are sitting empty and just a place for foreign nationals to park their money. I would say if you want to shift the burden from the average homeowner, increasing the Homestead exemption would provide better relief.\n\n  \nEdit: Also, I would want to ensure taxes generated locally to stay local. This could also be a power grab by the state to funnel more tax revenue for the state instead of local government. Currently, sales tax mostly goes to the state, while property taxes go to the county and municipality.",
