    "selftext": "So basically this could help the government and citizens at same time, government should make it so everyone who reports a crime gets paid, also all money the government gets from drug dealers that they jail, should go to middle class and lower class families,  this would benefit society, by citizens getting paid to report crimes and stop crimes, it would create a low crime society and a safer society, and people who are broke who don't have money, would gain money to get back on their feet by helping the government. And like I said, send a dividend to the middle class and low class workers, as well as the veterans. Tell me what you guys think about this idea, would it work out?",

I'm still questioning the idea, but I think it would heavily benefit society. Basically there would have to be a radio and site where citizens sees dangerous crimes and they assist cops on stopping it, in return they get cash for helping out the law.",
