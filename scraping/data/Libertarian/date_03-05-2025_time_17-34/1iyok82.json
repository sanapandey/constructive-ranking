For example I don't have a very consumerist lifestyle, over the past 2 years my average saving/investment % as compared to my earnings is 56%. That's inclusive of retirement contributions, but exclusive of taxes. A lot of my food is local as well. Tariffs won't impact me as much as thy would someone else. I also have no kids, so the child tax credit being reduced would have no impact on me at all.\n\nThat's why the chart is an oversimplification.",
