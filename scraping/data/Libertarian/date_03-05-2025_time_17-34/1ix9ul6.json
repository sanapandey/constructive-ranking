However, the pain caused is the fault of government bloat that has already done immense and terrible damage. To adjust to reality is going to be painful for many, especially those who have become dependent on the government as new options are developed.\n\nSome here may be a bit sadistic for whatever reason, but most don't hold contempt for the average rank and file government employee. It is the higher ups and their institutions that actually make policy and waste our extorted wealth that gives us the sense of schadenfreud.",
