Neither greed or capitalism in any way involves pushing people down, that particular directional movement of people is purely the effects of communism, progressive taxes, and inflation, but these things are all the creation of the modern state, not capitalism. Capitalism is about getting the things you want at a good price, and there is nothing wrong with that, and it makes everyone better, lifting people up. The main thing pushing people down in the West are wages not keeping up with inflation, but inflation is purely a creation of the state. Money and wages would hold their value, if the state were not creating more monetary units, which is the root cause of PERMANENT raising the prices of everything. Clearly other things move prices up temporarily, but they must inevitably come back down, unless more money is created to hold them up.",

A free market is an illusion of freedom. Maybe there is some framework where it would work, maybe if you are very liberal (there's that word again) with what non-aggression means, but with no limits besides those self imposed? I just don't even get believing that is possible much less utopian.",

Plus now that you left home you have to pick up after yourself.\n\nIf you ask nicely you get to borrow your dad's boat, but you don't like to because some of your friends own their own boats and jet skis and they have permanent slips while you have to tow yours from storage.  It is humiliating when you need to get help backing the trailer down the boat ramp.\n\nAs a kid you were very proud to always have the newest game systems and expensive toys compared to your friends and get to lord it over them, but when you were a teenager you realized that there are people so rich that it makes you look poor and that made you feel very uneasy.\n\nYour parents spent a lot of money on a fancy pre-K school, but then you realized that other kids in your  high school grew up with a in-house nanny and hired tutors to help them with their home work.\n\n Other people's dads got them fancy jobs were they get to have 2 hour lunches and go home after 3pm.  Your girlfriend left you for a guy with a trust fund so he works part time at bars during the summer \"just for fun\" and pretends to have a band. \n\nWhile you have to serve customers to make a living and this is very upsetting. Especially since most of them are poor and dress in old clothes, which makes them seem pathetic to you. And you are resentful that your boss gets to order you around even though he makes less then a third of what your dad does.\n\nYou wanted a Ipad Pro, but your parents can't tell the difference and got you a regular Ipad and this made you angry.\n\nIf these are the sorts of problems and frustrations you faced while growing up and in your early 20's then you are ripe to be a Socialist.",
