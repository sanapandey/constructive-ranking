We don't need an entire federal agency holding a gun to our heads and threatening us with prison if we don't pay what they say.The federal government should be so small they can run efficiently off of tariffs and each state should regulate services internally. What we need to work on is eliminating bureaucrats creating our laws and eliminating bipartisan division. The government is not our friend, ruler, or savior. They are our employee and meant to be so small that we could eliminate them at any time. If you are looking for a recent example of what happens when Libertarian principles are put into place, take a look at Argentina, who currently has a balanced budget.",

I think if our government is going to have any leverage with other countries or be involved in foreign policy (without going to war or spending money to create regime changes) we should fund that with tariffs not tax dollars. I also mentioned funding only the federal governments through tariffs and that the federal government should be small. As for the States, you are correct the problem is the tax code. There should not be a code. It should be a flat tax only because a tax system that allows for us to opt in to specific services would be too complicated...",
