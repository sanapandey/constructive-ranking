The person deemed it shocking that the UK government was demanding Apple\u2019s help to spy on non-British users without their governments\u2019 knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.\u201d (Quote from a different article (emphasis mine) found [here](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/))",
