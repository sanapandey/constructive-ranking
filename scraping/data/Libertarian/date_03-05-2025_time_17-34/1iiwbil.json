Considering It is empirically one of the largest abuses on civil rights and diametrically opposed to personal freedoms. Yes, I understand that drugs have a number of negative consequences, but I\u2019m not talking about the drugs. I\u2019m talking about the effects of the war on drugs and its inability to minimize the flow of drugs into the country, lower abuse rates, and may actually be the cause of higher overdose deaths?",

Conservatives were trying to say Metal was the devil and all that malarkey for a while not too long ago. Then you can look at things like DARE. They\u2019re very much order and law. \n\nI believe this is due to a mixture of religious and financial reasons, but it doesn\u2019t take much looking back. I used to be more hard conservative, but the amount of social restrictions they want to put on the populace doesn\u2019t appeal to me. If someone wants to take drugs at home it\u2019s not my problem. If someone wants to wear a dress, listen to screamo, it is not my problem yanno.",

These drugs are straight up poison.  The equation changes when you are talking about a drug that can kill you dead and cause so much social damage.  Then there is the case where drugs are being used as weapons against US citizens.   That is not good.   There needs to be something like a litmus test where the government proves beyond doubt that a certain drug is fatal consequences and if so it should be reasonably regulated and prohibited.   Cannabis wouldn't pass this test.   There is no reason for cannabis to be prohibited.   As for the war on drugs, it was an abject failure because it was so broad and undefined.   What there needs to be is direct prohibition on dangerous drugs.  The target drug should be well defined and the purpose of prohibition without question or doubt.    Overall, I think this is something libertarians should be able to accept.",
