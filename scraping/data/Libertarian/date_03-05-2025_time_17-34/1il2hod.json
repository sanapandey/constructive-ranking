(Source: [https://www.tiempofueguino.com/mas-de-1-millon-podria-ser-la-multa-por-publicitar-malvinas-con-toponimo-ingles/](https://www.tiempofueguino.com/mas-de-1-millon-podria-ser-la-multa-por-publicitar-malvinas-con-toponimo-ingles/) ), beacuse a company promoted a travel to the islands as \"A travel to the UK\".\n\n I mean, it's not libertarian at all that the government, using its power, laws and judicial actions and coertion, force companies to recognize the state interests, and punish you if you don't agree with them. \n\nI think that the Islands should be argentine, and i consider that what the company did was offensive, but that doesn't justify that the government, using its laws and coaction, punish people for saying something opposite to the state doctrine. Something can't be forbidden just because it's \"offensive\" or \"controversial\", no matter what most of people think or want.\n\nPlease, absent of commenting things like \"But most of islanders want to be british\" or \"But the argentine claim is useless/unlawful because...\".\n\nAlso, if there's any argentine here, i would want to know their opinion.",

In 1982, Argentina's failing regime launched a war of aggression not to retake any sort of rightful territory, but to distract from problems at home.",

The average person is not ready for anything remotely close to an actual libertarian theoretical governance.  They would line you up and shoot you to enable half the theories banded about as true libertarian principals.  Which we couldn\u2019t even agree on amongst ourselves in this sub let alone the wider libertarian movement.  At this point anything that ends any government encroachment on personal decisions is a win worth celebrating.\n\nI hardly know the Argentinian political landscape.  So any speculation on how \u201clibertarian\u201d your guy is would be foolishly off base.  I\u2019m going to try and translate that article to English though and see what it\u2019s about.  In the USA all we are going to hear for a while is people screaming either Nazi or MAGA rules.  Might as well look into milei more as a diversion for a while.\n\nCurious.  Did Argentina do the original colonization of the falklands?  Has it been under different rulers since the 1600\u2019s.  Did it have a native contingent who lived there for 1000 years.  I\u2019m going to go look it up now.  No reason to reply lol.  AFAIK Argentina is effectively like the US.  In the sense that the prevailing culture is transplanted European culture during the age of colonization.  Other then the Falkland\u2019s war and some notion that Germany made a big push there hardly know anything about the country.  Madonna did a musical set there.  Now milei is a headline.",

            "body": "I think it comes down to the actual ideological basis of the government because libertarianism encompasses a diverse collection of ideas. If we assume freedom of enterprise is the ethical imperative of libertarian governments, then one would not anticipate restrictions or interference in the actions of enterprise. However, most ideological libertarians see laws, produced through the judicial process (and possibly the legislative process), as the only rational mechanism of checks and balances on corporate actions. In essence, the legal process replaces the legislative process in most variants of libertarian ideologies. Additionally, a minarchist government still operates as a government and, preferably, in the interest of that government and its people.\n\nSo, if the Argentinian government believes the actions of some corporations are counterintuitive to their interest or the market, they may.... with deep regret.... implement regulations. However, I don't believe this would be considered a regulation in the strictest sense because they are not regulating conduct... they are banning conduct. Another way to observe this is that the libertarian government is acting on the premise that these corporate actions are illegal due to an existing law. An extreme example - if killing people is illegal, then the government preventing a murder is still libertarian albeit restricting the freedom to murder.\n\nSo, whether I call a government conservative, progressive, or libertarian, it's still a government designed to support the interests of those who define it. The libertarian minarchist observes the fundamental value posed by governmental structures although they believe they should be severely limited because they suck at doing things.",

Direct democracy is the only true form of democracy however there are no countries in the world with a direct democracy while plenty of countries call themselves a democracy.  The existence of a government beyond a national military, foreign relations, and a judiciary is not compliant with most variants of libertarianism.  So, in general, a \"libertarian government\" is considered a misnomer.\n\nSo, the point is that you are correct. Limitations on freedom of expression wouldn't be considered libertarian. And, my point, is that no government will truly represent the ideological basis they espouse because reality doesn't conform with idealizations.",
