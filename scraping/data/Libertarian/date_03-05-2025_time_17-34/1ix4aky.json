    "selftext": "A large portion of each ticket goes directly to the TSA as a fee, but there's intangible things that cost money because of the TSA, how much more does each airport cost to build because of the fact that 6000 square feet is dedicated to TSA scanners etc? And then the untold cost of manhours because of the fact you have to go to airport 2 hours prior to flight \"just incase TSA is slow.\"\n\nWould love if some airports were \"TSA FREE\"  where you could buy tickets in advance for less cost, but also could just hop on like a bus and pay at the gate if there were seats. I bet tickets would be much less, and people that want to fly on the airport that you could arrive 15 minutes before departure with a carryon. \n\nThe cost of flying with flight attendants is covered by our tickets as well. Remove that mandate as well, and maybe each ticket would be 5$ cheaper, (salary, extra seats taken up). \n\n\n\n",

If they thought FAs were a waste of money, they would get rid of them. The lower costs would allow cheaper tickets, and everyone in the industry would follow suit. Instead we have FAs. Its because they serve an important purpose - both for customer service and for safety. As a libertarian I would hope that OP would trust the market to work something like whether FAs are beneficial out.",

They'll hop on a flight from a small airport with no security so they can smuggle weapons onto a connection from LA to NYC.\u00a0\n\n\nNormally I'd say, \"fine, just let everyone be armed so they can defend themselves!\" But on a plane that's not a great plan. Shooting on a plane isn't a great idea, if only for how dense of a crowd there is on a plane.
