How come?\n\nThe free people who are so free they can't even choose were to live? The brave Americans who fear some caramel tanned fella is going eat to his dog alive? Or does this only apply if you are actually (by the slimmest of chances) born on US soil? Is the rest of the world not free or not brave?\n\nIt's strange for a non-american to look at the situation. You are only 6-10 generations away from a primarily German ancestry. What does it exactly mean to be \"american\"? You used to be the definition of welcoming and open arms. And not strictly to the \"super important elite workforce\". Look at all the Italians, the Irish, and of course, southern american. How on earth is it possible that Visas are issued based on a fucking LOTERY system? Visas for professional, educated immigrants, by the way.",

However, I still believe there's nuance to the issue. 63% are \"naturalized\" or \"lawful permanent residents\". This means they either have a green card or used to have it and became naturalized afterwards. Now, to my understanding, the only realistic way of getting a green card is if you get married. There are job sponsorships, but the employer must prove that no other American can perform the task the alien is willing to perform. Also, the queues usually last several years for getting one of those.",

What you are seeing from the Right is mostly against the illegal immigration, though their detractors will try to claim it's against all immigration.\n\nAgainst Illegal immigration\n\n1. We have a legal immigration process, so they should follow it.\n2. Criminals (central American gangs, drug smuggling, child exploitation) are tied to the flow of illegal immigration\n3. The belief that many don't integrate into our society (language, local customs, following local laws)\n4. The recent prevalence of giving so much aid/community support to them while American citizens are left hurting (example: taking over community rec centers or kicking elderly out of nursing homes to make it a shelter for the illegal immigrants, the giving them benefits that citizens don't get, etc) has turned many people against them.\n\nAgainst All immigration\n\n1. America has enough people and problems without adding more people\n2. Don't want to see the local culture change\n\n  \nAlso, historically, we used to be a LOT stricter when it came to immigration.\n\nFor example, when my ancestor came from Ireland around 1900 they had to have a sponsor and a job already lined up before they were allowed in. It wasn't just an unregulated flow of people. And this isn't even taking into the account the fact that we wouldn't take in immigrants from some countries (look up how the Chinese were treated for example).",
