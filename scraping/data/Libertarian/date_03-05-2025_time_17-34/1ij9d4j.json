    "selftext": "Hello everyone. As the title suggests, I\u2019m from China. I\u2019m 20 and currently studying at a top university here. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve realized that my political views might align closely with libertarianism. I've always been drawn to ideas like freedom or liberty since I was around 14, but only recently did I fully grasp that what I support is not just liberalism, but something more akin to libertarianism. That said, I might lean slightly to the left compared to the majority of libertarians, while I advocate for nearly all core libertarian values (for example when I take political spectrum tests I tend to get something like left libertarianism).\n\nThat\u2019s my background. I\u2019ve been considering studying abroad after my undergraduate degree for a long time, but I hadn\u2019t made a firm decision before, until recently I grow more and more frustrated about China's lack of political freedom and tendency for authoritarianism and paternalistic ruling. And I have finally decided to pursue graduate studies in the United States to experience what a freer (or more free? not sure) society is like. However I'm now thinking on a big question: What should I do after that? Of course I\u2019ll have more personal insights once I actually live in the US, but I\u2019m already thinking about it, whether I should stay there long-term, or return to China. Although it might seem strange for a libertarian to even consider going back, for me it\u2019s indeed a difficult choice. My family is in China (my parents and grandparents). While I sometimes dislike their discipline and control over me, they genuinely love me, and I indeed love them. My grandparents are nearly illiterate and hold very traditional Chinese values. My parents are well-educated, knowledgeable people, yet they still hold traditional views and strongly support an authoritarian government like the current CCP believing it ensures social stability. They have no interest in moving abroad, which makes this decision harder. Additionally, born and raised in China I sometimes feel that no matter how much I value liberty, my upbringing and cultural background makes it inevitably difficult for me to fully integrate into another society. This might pertain to some innate attribute that in my view cannot be altered by acquired factors.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m still considering moving abroad. So I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, like which country would be the best place for a libertarian to live? (I\u2019d prefer an English-speaking country since that\u2019s the only foreign language I speak) And for those of you in the US, do you feel like the US is the best option for libertarians? If not, would you consider leaving? Or if staying in the US, which state or city is the best for one with libertarian values? From what I understand, while the US has many anti-libertarian policies, it still seems to be the most accepting place for people who prioritize freedom. Europe by comparison, appears to have more government control over people\u2019s lives.\n\nOne of my friends once made a joke, saying that if one truly wanted total freedom, he might as well move to places like the African savanna or the Sahara Desert where there\u2019s no government at all, or perhaps a failed state with weak governance like some impoverished countries in Africa or something like Somali pirates. I personally think it raises an important point, that at this stage of human civilization libertarians might still need some level of government at least. It seems like the US has struck a balance between personal freedom and functional governance.\n\nLastly, if I end up staying in China for the rest of my life, how do you think I reconcile the gap between the ideals and reality? Or, is that just something that, all libertarians around the globe have to deal with wherever they live? So I didn't realize I would write such a long and verbose post and this is the first time I post on reddit. Thanks for reading. And sorry if my English isn't good.",
