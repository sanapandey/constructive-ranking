The (alleged) presence hundreds of bodies in mass graves was reported AS FACT in international news, which resulted in [multiple churches being burned to the ground](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Canadian_church_burnings). For example, this NYT [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/28/world/canada/kamloops-mass-grave-residential-schools.html) states\n\n>Now an\u00a0Indigenous\u00a0community in\u00a0British Columbia\u00a0says it has found evidence of what happened to some of its missing children: a mass grave containing the remains of 215 children on the grounds of a former residential school.\n\n>Chief Rosanne Casimir of the Tk\u2019emlups te Secwepemc First Nation said on Friday that ground-penetrating radar had discovered the remains near the site of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, which operated from 1890 until the late 1970s.\n\n>\u201cIt\u2019s a harsh reality and it\u2019s our truth, it\u2019s our history,\u201d Chief Casimir said at a news conference. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve always had to fight to prove. To me, it\u2019s always been a horrible, horrible history.\u201d\n\n>The remains, which Chief Casimir described as \u201cmany, many years old \u2014 decades,\u201d included those of children as young as 3.\n\nHere are more examples of news outlets reporting the mass graves AS FACT ([1](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57592243), [2](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60395242)).\n\nNow, years later, we have yet to find a single body in any of the so called mass graves. Of course the mainstream media will not report this story, and the Canadian government is considering passing a bill [making it a crime to question the existence of these graves](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2025/2/7/denying-our-truth-fighting-residential-school-denialism-in-canada), and so the mass grave propaganda has gone basically unchallenged.\n\nShame on you.",

Bodies were not returned to their families for burial, and families were not normally informed of the circumstances of their child's death\"\n\nWhy even bother with this when you're talking about the parents of kids who died in the early 20th century? Who is still alive who cares about this? Shall we investigate all the crimes of the Romans? The Normans?",

The Catholic Church was painted as evil here when generally speaking it was nuns and brothers who took vows of poverty running these schools. The government required native children to go to these schools but didn\u2019t offer much money to the schools to run, no one wanted to touch this situation but these religious orders in GREAT charity built schools and ran them living in THE SAME CONDITIONS as their students. Children were forcibly taken but not by the church, the nuns aren\u2019t storming onto the reservation, but by the gov. Children died often back then, especially poor children, but they generally had a better chance at life at these schools surprisingly. And were often buried ALONGSIDE the nuns. Like it\u2019s ridiculous that these people who are dealing with a situation that no one wanted to help with are being villainized. The situation is horrible, the government policy evil, the nuns did the best they could to help. There are tons of valid criticisms of the operation, but wtf was anyone else doing, easy to throw rocks from an ivory tower.",
