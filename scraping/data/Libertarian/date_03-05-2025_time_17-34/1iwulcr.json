Go read our own history from the late 1800s - great depression.  You can watch it happen in real time as well.  As a company accrues wealth, they crush their competition in any way possible, which yes, sometimes comes from them lobbying government, but look at how many businesses have died from private investment buying them out and running them off a cliff.\n\nMoney = power.  As you get more money, you get more power to control the rest of the market.  Without an entity beholden to the people to bust up monopolies (which is what the government often is doing), we ultimately just are run by the rich, which we're not far from at this rate.  And believe me, the ultra wealthy dont give a fuck about competition, rights, or whether you can feed your family.",

Medicaid is negotiating better prices than the market, because the market isn't free.\n\nThe real problem is you have a monopolized middle man called insurance whose sole goal is to make profit without having to suffer market competition.  Most people are covered by their employer and have no choice in the matter, so companies are able to provide a wildly subpar product because there is no free market.\n\nI'll hear the argument against government healthcare programs after the private market has been burned to the ground and built back in a way that actually works.  Until then, the standard libertarian \"blame government\" argument isn't going to hold water.",
