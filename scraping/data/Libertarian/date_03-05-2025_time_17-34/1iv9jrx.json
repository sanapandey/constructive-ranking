In my reading about Cromwell I ended up learning about the story of the Christian abolitionist John Brown, who, like me, was a fundamentalist Neo-Puritan fan of Cromwell. Inspired by Cromwellianism, Brown took up arms to defend black people against cruel slave owners during the conflicts in Bleeding Kansas. I immediately began to admire him for his faith and love of freedom.\n\nHowever, as I read more about him, I realized that his story is even more complex. Many historians say that it was John Brown's fault that the Civil War happened, because his extremism in Kansas frightened the Southerners, convincing them that the only solution to their disputes with the anti-slavery activists was secession from the South.\n\nOthers still say that Brown was an crazy anti-white who hated his own people and planned to exterminate the entire Caucasian population of the South after the conflicts in Kansas.\n\nMany schizophrenic Wokes, Marxists, Black Panther Party supporters and supporters of the lunatic Malcolm X, a disgusting anti-Semitic Kebab who advocated the murder of peaceful white people, use Brown as an example to justify their shitty genocidal Afrocentrist ideologies.\n\nBasically, how should we libertarians view this man?",

IMO, the civil war was always going to happen at some point and Bleeding Kansas and Harper's Ferry just made it happen sooner.\n\nThe anti-white thing is news to me, wth is that about. Sounds like racists coping to me.\n\nIn full disclosure, John Brown is one of my favorite historical figures. Batshit insane, but his heart was in the right place and considering slavery is the antithesis to any Libertarian position, he's based af in my book.",

He basically resorted to really shitty terrorism in an attempt to turn a cold war hot.",

However, after that he was assassinated by his former Nation of Islam comrades, and he never had time to redeem himself from the hateful ideas he propagated for most of his life.\n\n\n\nTo this day, Malcolm X is idolized by Marxists and wokes, not for the change he made after his trip to Mecca, but for his hatred and promotion of violence against peaceful white people. We routinely see people comparing him to Martin Luther King, praising X's virulent stance for being more \"realistic\" compared to \"King's pacificism\". Some idiots even accuse Dr. King of being a \"traitor to black people\" because he never hated white people.\n\n\n\nIn short, Malcolm X's legacy after Mecca is practically nil, and he continues to be exalted precisely for his old Afrocentric supremacist ideas that fuel the radical Left in the US. For this reason I despise him, along with all his Radical Left admirers.",
