Oh, you mean like Elon Musk demanding federal employees tell him what they did last week or they're fired?\n\nSanders is trying to push legislation, he still needs a bill to be written, and requires majority support of Congress AND the president in order to make these kinds of changes. That's just how our government works. The fact it hasn't been passed. The fact we haven't adopted Sanders's policies is a testament to how our system works. Just because he's asking for these things, that doesn't make him an authoritarian.",
