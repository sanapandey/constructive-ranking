Why do I need to get a permit to renovate my own kitchen? Or a waiver to not to get the vaccine? To dismantle government overreach while protecting individual liberty, we must redesign our legal doctrine to make it easier for individuals to seek restitution from those who violate the NAP.\n\nTherefore, we should shift toward a **presumption of guilt** until proven innocent, as long as plaintiffs can successfully prove in court of they have **standing,** that they **suffered injuries** that could be reasonably caused by the defendants, and that **remedy could be available.**\n\n  \nWe will still have jury trials. But under this new legal framework, 99% of the existing federal and state laws could be abolished simply because we will finally have a level-playing field against corporations with much more resources than us, whether it's Pfizer, Tyson Food or the NAACP.",
