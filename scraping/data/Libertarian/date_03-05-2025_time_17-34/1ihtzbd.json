I'm not entirely libertarian or left or right.\n\nThere is some need for price control, while you may not support it being government mandated, the only other option is to boycott the businesses who are underpaying people until they raise their employees wages. The only problem with that is exactly what happened with the Pinkerton riots. They'll hire someone else who will do it for cheaper then they'll call the cops to remove you from the property. All the while people will look at you like you're lazy for not working an underpaid job and striking, driving right past you to pull into the drive through undermining your efforts.\n\nOur bargaining power is as a collective, both customers and employees. If the government genuinely was run by the people then that would be the collectives decision to ensure those businesses must pay an adequate wage for today's economy. No one working full-time should be struggling to make ends meet.\n\nMarket regulations are a good thing, for example, insulin costs $0.02 to manufacture per unit and has sold for $600 here in the US not too long ago, now price caps have been cut and the cost of medicine increases.

It'll be open ended. I can close it when I want and so can you.

If you could provide for a family flipping burgers you'd think the other people in higher positions would be doing what they're doing? They're \"slaves\" too following the same rules. Difference is they realized they couldn't provide for a family unless they became skillful. So the workforce grows.\n\nYou need that in society",

At least that would be what the liberal criticism is, not that all businesses can get away with it at all times to all extents. This is the entire idea behind collective bargaining. If you let business take away all your money by paying you minimum wage they would in a heartbeat. Or better yet, lobby our bought and sold government to eliminate what little wage protection people have then pay you in company dollars.

This doesn\u2019t require any form of regulation or guaranteed minimum wage, it\u2019s just negotiating. Businesses have to compete for labor amongst one another, and employees for businesses against one another. This is what sets the fair market value. You could say the same thing in reverse, \u201cif employees could, they would make the businesses pay everything they had until they had nothing left. Therefore, regulation is needed to protect the businesses from employee exploitation\u201d.

All that regulation does is get in the way and increase costs for the businesses and interfere with the free market.\n\nThe federal minimum wage has been the same for many years, yet, barely anyone is being paid the federal minimum wage or even the lowest state minimum wages. This is because businesses have to provide sufficient incentive to workers, I.e. decent pay enough that they will accept a job.",
