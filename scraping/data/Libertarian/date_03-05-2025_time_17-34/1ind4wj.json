They don\u2019t go very far. An independent accounting firm conducts a GAAP-based audit annually, producing reports on aggregate reserves and investments, as well as top line balance sheets. Then, too, Congress allows the GAO to perform a very circumscribed review, but anything substantial is off limits.\n\n>It\u2019s like submitting to an IRS audit but telling the revenue agents they can\u2019t look at the details of your primary business expenses or revenue. Massie\u2019s bill would remove those restrictions.\n\nhttps://www.maciverinstitute.com/perspectives/audit-the-fed\n\n>Meanwhile, without shining a light into the Fed\u2019s inner workings, these actors continue to do God-knows-what with the economy. Only certain data has emerged from the darkness over the years, but what has been exposed is terrifying. After the 2008-09 financial crisis, for example, the Federal Reserve amassed a $4.5-trillion balance sheet. For what economic purpose and how did that help or hinder the American people?\n\n>We don\u2019t know because the GAO is not permitted to find out.\n\n>Another example: The Federal Reserve\u2019s total reserve bank assets as of this writing is $6.8 trillion, including mortgage-backed securities, federal agency debt, and U.S. treasuries. That\u2019s down from $7.6 trillion a year ago, but still way up from $4.2 trillion at the end of 2018. Many of these securities were acquired through open-market operations, which can\u2019t be audited.\n\n>What does the Fed do with all these assets? For one thing, they are used to manipulate long-term interest rates, either to stimulate the economy by growing them, or to restrict growth by selling them off. The bigger the balance sheet, the more leverage the Fed has, and, while it manipulates interest rates to unleash growth binges followed by the fiscal equivalent of sugar lows, it effectively and without any transparency transfers trillions of dollars to the federal government, to globalist financiers, and to both crony capitalists and nonprofit special interests.\n\n>It\u2019s no coincidence that after the Fed created at least $3.3 trillion with the wave of its wand in 2020, \u201c650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion,\u201d as Forbes reported. The ensuing inflation has ravaged the middle class. That\u2019s not an isolated instance. Pumping money into the economy helped fuel the dot com bust in the early 2000s and the housing bubble in the late 2000s.",

Audits in any context do not look at every receipt or parse through every single detail of the GL. It isn\u2019t practical to do that\u2026you\u2019d be auditing the entity for 100 years. It is why you have things like materiality and sampling\u2026and various tests applied to those samples to flag irregularities to investigate. The balance sheet is a big focus because if it\u2019s right\u2026everything else kind of has to be. Auditing is a science when it comes to financial statements and big entities. Those accounting firms auditing the Fed apply those standards and methods. Comparing it to an IRS tax audit of some business is a terrible analogy. Has zero comparison to this type of audit. \n\nI\u2019m always all for more scrutiny though and am all for increasing it to the extent it is actually needed in some specific area. So I don\u2019t want to like shoot stuff like this down either. But I think you\u2019d be surprised to learn that is already being heavily considered and looked at more than you think outside these proposals from politicians. The auditing profession in general talks about stuff like this all the time in terms of how things can be improved in various ways. And auditors DO FAIL at times (see Enron)",

Congress isn\u2019t elected because they are scientists, or economists, my point being they neither should be making specific technical decisions related to our money supply. \n\nAn expert, and people who have dedicated their lives to the study of economics, should make these decisions, and they must be able to act without fear of political prosecution, while still being periodically replaced (to avoid the inevitable duds of humans that occur - it\u2019s fucking human to make mistakes.

Hyperinflation. Argentina . Zimbabwe. Don\u2019t act like the US would somehow have more fortitude in a tough situation- trumps gonna feel the heat from some of his own supporters come a year from now when the price of eggs hasn\u2019t gone down, and housing is even more unreachable for more and more Americans , and in that scenario im sure trump and co would love a quick economic stimulant to save face. And trump certainly has been starting to think he\u2019s above all level of authority and judicial justice we\u2019ve spent centuries building in our beautiful country (see: JD Vance\u2019s judicial authority tweet from last night). \n\nLet me know where you agree and disagree. \n\nIf we idolize our politicians and let our media become polarized and leas critical of our central government based on who\u2019s in power, we\u2019ve lost as a society.
