Have we not been arguing for decades that the government approval process is to onerous, too costly, too complex, and needlessly complicates the release of new medicines at a much higher cost?\n\nLibertarians support the \"Right to try\". It's your body, your choice. Why do you need to governments permission to try a medication that you want to try?\n\nThere's so many better arguments than \"But the government did the thing you've been saying they should do for years!\"\n\nIf the \"expedited process\" was good enough for the covid vaccine then let's make the \"expedited\" process the standard process. It'll spur innovation and reduce regulatory burden costs.\n\n\nI did not, and do not, support the vaccine mandates. But I think the \"argument\" that it didn't go through the needlessly complicated and lengthy bureaucratic red tape roller coaster, is a terrible argument for libertarians who support de-regulation. It was literally an instance of deregulation, and you're mad about it? Weird.",

My only argument is that fast tracking the vaccine and having it go through a more efficient and expedient approval process is not a bad thing. That is what libertarians want. Less regulatory burden. Let's take the COVID vaccine approval process, and make that the new default.\n\nIf it was safe enough for the COVID vaccine, it's safe enough for everything else. Deregulation is needed.",
