This was a scheduled weighting change (last one was January 2023). I haven\u2019t seen the underlying data so I can\u2019t comment on the changes beyond that. The way that it\u2019s supposed to work (to my understanding) is that two years ago the consumption of these products decreased, so the CPI lowers the weight of them in the CPI.\n\nBut then you have to dig in to *why* the consumption changed (did these products get way more expensive so people stopped buying them?).",

Egg producers report the number of hens, the number of tabled eggs, cull numbers are reported not only by the egg farmer but in the local news.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019ll get really mad about spin, but they always have granular data that they show that disproved their spin.  Also, there are objectives they have that they can\u2019t do with poor data, so corrupting it at the granular level means they can\u2019t corrupt and manipulate the way they desire.\n\nYou also require that the people reporting the data collude with you if you disrupt granular data.  A farm producer knows how many eggs he shipped.  People can see their portion of the numbers but also can\u2019t object to analysis because they don\u2019t understand it.\n\nExample: \nI got super pissed during the Iraq war because the DOD said we were awesome and on x date we restored the power grid to pre war levels.  On public records at the UN and US, both experts said if we bombed the grid and it failed it would take years to restore.  They also named all the power plants and parts they needed and resources they were lacking.  \n\nThe graphs beneath the DOD statement showed meticulous gathering of total power in Iraq, surging up and down, and on X date it met the power output higher than the day before the grid collapsed, then it promptly collapsed downward a day later.  The graphs showed, truthfully, we surged capacity for a brief moment and had a technically true propaganda statement.  This graph remained published in the supporting documentation along with the details on every power plant.  \n\nThey could try and say the Baghdad power plant was up to full capacity but there was local news continually talking about blackouts, and there were literal Job ads on monster.com looking to hire for that Baghdad plant.\n\nInside the Baghdad area, you know nothing is working, the workers know their output, but they don\u2019t pay attention to how well others cities are doing so even they could think maybe the propaganda analysis is \u201ctrue.\u201d\n\nMost things have their own type of peer review in some way.

Whether it indicates money in economy is 'deflating' or 'inflating' it really devoid of meaning by itself.  You can have good inflation or bad inflation and you can have good deflation and bad deflation.  You can have to combine it with other information to give it context and meaning. \n\nHowever the Fed, most modern economists, and the government contend that Inflation doesn't have much do to with actual money supply.  Instead it is  a reflection of consumer choices, market forces, and what people anticipate, how they feel about the economy, etc etc. \n\nYet they contend that you can manage and control inflation through government/central banking monetary policy. \n\nMeaning you have this lovely cognitive dissonance going on that on one hand price inflation is largely a result of sentiment, not money supply.  But you can control inflation and have targeted inflation through money supply and tweaking interest rates and taxes and thus control velocity of money and so on and so forth.  And this is how central banking 'stabilizes' the economy. \n\nObviously this is all more then a bit weird and means they have a very difficult time controlling prices through these indirect measures that they themselves contend don't really mean a whole lot; it only has a meaning to consumers and businesses that assign it a meaning. \n\nBut you know what is easy to control? \n\nHow CPI is measured, calculated, and reported. \n\nSo that is what they do.  It is very obvious what they do and why they do it. \n\nif you go back and look at how they calculated CPI prior to 1983 and apply it to today's markets it is obviously that the old way was far more accurate then it is today.  And actually more closely reflects what is actually going when real people try to do real things in the real world.  Rather then in the adjusted world were people substitute beef for chick and eggs for soy by-products (or whatever the hell those idiots think is going on).\n\nhttps://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data\n\nhttps://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/inflation-charts\n\nThis is the same sort of thing that happens in Soviet Russia with steel production quotas and other things.  They knew that a healthy economy produced lots of steel. So if they threatened people and enslaved the population to produce lots of steel then the economy would be good, right?  \n\nSo the measure of production turned from a indicator into a goal.  And thus it lost all meaning. It didn't reflect the cost of production, or demand, or quality.  Because those things were impossible to really know in a command economy.  All those things were subject to the same manipulation and game playing that the steel quotas were.  \n\nIt is very difficult to keep producing more steel then the month before. And your job (and your life) often dependent on it.  It was much easier to be creative with the paper work and manipulate things to make it look like you are producing more. \n\nThe very act of trying to centrally control things leads directly to the blindness of the people in the center trying to do the controlling. \n\nIt is like trying to fly a airplane in the dark, in the clouds, above the mountains where the altitude and attitude controls are all twist dials you set based on best guesses.",

It's getting ridiculous listening to economic commentators wonder about why consumers are so down in the dumps about inflation when the numbers \"aren't that bad.\" Switch to the pre-1983 measures and consumer sentiment and inflation line up perfectly.",
