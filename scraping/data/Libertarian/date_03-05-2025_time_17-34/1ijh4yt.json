    "selftext": "Also Chelsea Clinton being worth $30 million is the biggest joke ever. She didn\u2019t start a business, invent anything, or grind her way up. She just existed as a Clinton and somehow money poured in.\n\nShe lands a six-figure job at McKinsey & Co. straight out of college. No real experience, no special skills\u2014just the magic of having two ex-presidents as parents. Then, she magically gets a board seat at Avenue Capital Group, a hedge fund that donates tons of money to political campaigns. Totally normal for a 20-something with no finance background to be advising a hedge fund, right?\n\nBut it gets even worse. NBC News randomly decides she\u2019s a \u201cspecial correspondent\u201d and pays her $600K a year\u2014for what, exactly? She barely did any reporting. It was just a media company greasing the Clintons, plain and simple. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she somehow lands a cushy board seat at IAC (InterActiveCorp), raking in $250K a year in stock options for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the Clinton Foundation, which has been accused of being one giant pay-for-play operation. Foreign governments and billionaires dump money into it, and Chelsea gets to be a big player in the whole shady empire. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all technically legal!\n\nThis is political money laundering in real-time. No real skills, no actual work\u2014just a never-ending supply of fake jobs, corporate board seats, and media payoffs to keep the Clinton name rolling in cash. Meanwhile, regular people are told to \u201cwork harder\u201d and \u201cpull themselves up by their bootstraps.\u201d The system is rigged, and Chelsea Clinton is living proof.",

            "body": "Thats not what it says at all. This is Clinton Foundation, a 501 charity. They gave away(spent) $84 million. Took in $24M in donations. Got 1.5M worh of grants(all sources) of which $20k came from taxpayers (gov grants). So big nothing burger. Here is their rating and what they spend on. Some dude on twitter isn't a good source to use. You dont think this would be all over the news if it were true.Also notice how it does not have a high taxpayer alert like the other ones\n\n:https://www.charitywatch.org/charities/clinton-foundation\n\nThe arrows are other charities that gave to them. If it got millions from 4 red charities somewhere down the chain it would be suspicious but not uncommon. There are charities built around grants.\n\nUSAID gives money to other countries so if its doing anything shady it would be abroad.\n\nIf you want to find corruption just look at DOD where they have trillions missing and have failed last 7 audits.\n\nSpace X and Tesla gets more money than US Aid.\n\nAll 501 charities have to post their financials. best source to use is a gov site. all non profits file 990 \n\n[https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/311580204/202413209349302126/IRS990](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/311580204/202413209349302126/IRS990)",

Note regulatory tax credits received by Tesla are paid by other car makers and thus shouldn't be included in the math.  This would go back 10+ years.\n\nI'm not sure your argument against SpaceX makes sense anyhow.  The US effectively had no space program in the years before Falcon and other rockets launched sucessfully.  US taxpayers now have a VASTLY more affordable launch program for putting payload into space which was certainly the point of the credits.  Are you against this outcome?  Do you think NASA was doing better work in this regards?  Do you think NASA could have done it cheaper?  If no, then money well spent.",

If the diagram is the scandal, speak on it.\n\nFirst of all your diagram doesn't show any embezzlement. They're a charity giving away tens of millions of dollars. This is just literally a normal diagram depicting how charities work. \n\nSecond of all, yeah famous people get jobs through nepotism. That isn't good but this is literally how it works for every single kid of famous rich people. All of them. Conservative, Republican, Democrat, whatever. The parents get the kid into an elite college, and those connections get them consulting jobs or whatever else. \n\nDo you think George Dubya Bush got into *fucking Yale* on his own merit? Of course not. He got in because his daddy. \n\nIs that fantastic? No. Is it somehow evil unique to the Clintons? No.\n\nThere is so much actual corruption unfolding literally right now day by day as someone like Elon Musk is given carte blanche by a near infinitely-powerful executive monarch to \"police his own self interests\" as he shuts down agencies mostly based on who was investigating him or his companies. \n\nHe takes hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for his companies. His companies subsist on tax dollar funds at this point. \n\nOh and he broke into the treasury the other day and seized read and right access to the Treasury. \n\nAnd guess what he didn't do? *Give it back to you*.",

Gross receipts include everything an org takes in, like grants, donations, and taxpayer money, while contributions are just private donations.\n\nExample: USAID gives millions to Tides Foundation, which then \u201cgrants\u201d money to another nonprofit, which then funnels it to the Clinton Foundation. By the time it reaches them, it looks like a private donation instead of your tax dollars funding their political empire.\n\nThis is how money laundering works in politics\u2014pass it through enough layers, and nobody asks questions.

            "body": "Context: This chart is basically a money laundering roadmap for how taxpayer dollars get funneled through \u201cnonprofits\u201d and ultimately land in the hands of politically connected elites like the Clinton family. What we\u2019re looking at here is a network of organizations that receive millions from USAID and other government sources, only to redistribute that money to friendly groups, consulting firms, and political allies\u2014all while pretending it\u2019s for charity or social good.\n\nAt the center of this mess, you\u2019ve got the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation pulling in $83.6 million in gross receipts and $23.5 million in direct contributions, with at least $17,500 coming straight from taxpayer funds. Now, while that public money contribution looks small, the real scandal is in the web of organizations connected to them, all moving massive amounts of government cash around under the guise of philanthropy.\n\nLook at Tides Foundation, Windward Fund, and The Community Foundation of Middle America\u2014these are dark money giants that take in tens of millions in taxpayer money and then funnel it out as \u201cgrants.\u201d Tides Center alone handled $252 million, with $35 million coming straight from taxpayers. These aren\u2019t independent charities; they\u2019re pass-through entities used to wash money and make it look like \u201cdonations\u201d instead of government-funded political influence.\n\nThen there\u2019s McKinsey-style consulting grifts, where orgs pay themselves, their friends, and their political allies huge salaries and fees under the label of \u201cgrants\u201d or \u201cservices.\u201d This is how these elites extract millions from public funds without ever delivering actual value.\n\nThe government is bankrolling political corruption, hiding it under layers of nonprofit shell games. They take taxpayer money, push it through a chain of organizations, and it ultimately ends up funding the same elite circles\u2014whether through Clinton-connected charities, consulting payouts, or outright campaign contributions. It\u2019s just one massive slush fund disguised as philanthropy.\n\n\nEDIT: I said two ex presidents in the post, didn\u2019t mean that LMAO",
