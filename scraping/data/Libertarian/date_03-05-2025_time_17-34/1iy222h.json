            "body": "If I may, as a fed worker\u2026. My issue with the 5 bullet points request is not about my resistance to providing transparency about my productivity. I\u2019m a beast at work, I make your tax dollars stretch to the max extent and am often doing other people\u2019s jobs because I run circles around a lot of these clowns. Which is why I\u2019m actually in support of cutting the fat, and getting rid of useless pricks that treat fed employment like it\u2019s a welfare program. But I digress\u2026\n\nThe issue myself and others have is that we don\u2019t actually know the purpose or end use of the info we provide, nor trust it to be properly handled. I don\u2019t answer to that douchey tiny crooked dick spaceman nor do I trust in his motives or end game. It is suspected that the purpose for the email responses is to help them build an org chart of all fed employees. Ok, no big deal. But if it were you, would you trust that he won\u2019t also display on that org chart personal information? Or even character assassinate at his whim. For instance, when a certain redditor calls him douchey tiny crooked dick spaceman, then said Redditor is fired illegally because he\u2019s an insecure c@N+, he won\u2019t stamp \u201closer\u201d across my name? And then the ignorant masses will cheer \u201cyea, fuck the beaurocracy!\u201d while turning a blind eye to the total abuse of power, lies and smoke and mirrors used to pander?\n\nEarly on in the administration, agencies were directed to provide a list of all probationary employees. HR was like, wait, you don\u2019t mean the folks who are permanent but on probation because they got a promotion or transferred between agencies? Yup, send them all don\u2019t worry about it. Are you sure though, this isn\u2019t right. YES send it. Weeks later, mass terminations of everyone on that list. And guess who they blamed? HR for \u201cscrewing up the data on the probationy list.\u201d Before you get hyped up about then end result of reducing govt and waste, keep reading\u2026..\n\nI was in the wave of people fired that shouldn\u2019t have been. The action was blatantly illegal. All the termination letters cited \u201cperformance\u201d as the cause. While it may have been true in some cases, it was not for at least 10 colleagues in my circle. Why does this matter? Well, we sat at home for a week filing appeals, searching for jobs, filed for unemployment, etc only to be reinstated because of the error. So now you have a stupid amount of admin burden, cost and loss of productivity for HR to undo things (and this happened to A LOT of people), cost of back paying us (a week loss of productivity from each individual), and for all of our leadership who didn\u2019t even know the terminations were sent out and who spent a week trying to figure out what the hell happened and how to fix it, etc. \n\nSo, we\u2019re reinstated on a Thursday at 8pm, sent to our work email which nobody can even receive because most are still locked out of their computers. I wasn\u2019t. I was told to report to work the following Monday. I chose to return to work the next day to bust my ass and catch up and lend a hand to my team who\u2019s had to pickup the slack for the last week. \n\nMonday morning rolls around, I open my email, and I\u2019m told to report my \u201c5 accomplishments\u201d for last week. No problem, I did more in my one day than most do in a week I can give you 10 bullets. But do you think doge\u2019s AI that will screen my response cares that I lost 4 days productivity through no fault of my own, that I worked the one day when not even required to, or even understands the complexity of my work to measure by whatever evaluation factors some 19 year old has devised? \n\nI\u2019m all for reducing govt, spending, and waste. But y\u2019all need to understand that what\u2019s going on now is causing spending and waste that won\u2019t come to light (if at all) for some time. \n\nOk, rant over for now. But if anyone wants me to expand on the bullshit lies about money saved with these government contracts let me know. I\u2019m a contract specialist and doge is flat out lying to the public about what he\u2019s \u201csaving\u201d and is in fact causing more waste.",

Most of my coworkers and I haven\u2019t logged into our government e-mail in months or even years. As a result, it was a giant pain to sit on hold with IT to get our passwords reset. But hey, if Elon in his infinite wisdom thinks that having me sit on the phone for an hour and a half on overtime to send a stupid email is the best use of taxpayer dollars, who am I to argue\u2026",
