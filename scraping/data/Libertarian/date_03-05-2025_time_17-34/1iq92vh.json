Recent numbers are showing even lower ones like this 33%,  although I'd wait for it to be confirmed by more sources\n\nSo the poverty rate did increase as a result of his austerity measures, but as those measures started to work, inflation was reduced and salaries started to catch up people were able to move above the poverty rate.\n\nMind you, in recent history 38% is still high, although obviously trending in the right direction. It wasn't that long ago when poverty was in the 20s. That should be achievable under his government.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jdlq3bn6rdje1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f7c56d8e16f51e19c8a4af47dc6ff1593811825",

The correlation with inflation is much stronger than the correlation with Milei's austerity measures.\n\nI'm calling it their measurement of poverty rather than their poverty rate because I find it fairly likely that their measurement is very flawed as well.

The people going on and on about that had an agenda and didn\u2019t understand the full picture. The whole point of Milei\u2019s actions is to stimulate the economy and investment in Argentina so people can make money from jobs, not the government.\n\nThe thing is, he warned the voters this would happen in the short-term once they went under austerity. The Argentinian people knew there would be short-term pain for longterm gains.

It's actually among the ones with less poverty in the region by other statistics. Basically what we do is select a \"basket\" of basic goods and calculate how much a person needs to afford them. If you are under that price then you are considered poor. The problem is with the selection of those products, it's not always accurate to the needs of the population and it can make poverty seem like less or more depending on the relative value of those products to the actual goods people consume.
