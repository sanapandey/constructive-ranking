Your explanation here is approaching AI levels of WTF between misunderstanding how an icepack is most likely used at daycare to how freezer controls work.",

When the liquid is in inside the unit it absorbs heat, and when it flows outside of the unit it releases heat. \n\nBecause propylene glycol lowers the freezing point of the ice pack, it requires that magic liquid to remove *less heat* in order to freeze and remain frozen. A water bottle requires *more heat* to be removed in order to freeze and remain frozen. This means, by volume, you can store more frozen ice packs than frozen water bottles within a given unit.",

You're all over the map and still failing to make a coherent point, which goes well with my AI hypothesis. What makes you think these ice packs are even going into a freezer at daycare? Perhaps they are being used to keep food cold outside a freezer like every other icepack I've seen sent in by parents to daycare.",
