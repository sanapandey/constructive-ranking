Great advocates, and I admire both of them greatly\u2026 except for the fact that BPD runs a pyramid scheme scam, but that\u2019s beside his politics.",

I like PBD and actually believe he has done a lot to help push things in the right direction by utilizing his channel and wide audience. But PBD is not libertarian in the way that John Stossel can be considered libertarian.",

Like a lot of people in finance and insurance who echo Greenspan's former position that even fraud shouldn't be regulated, his embrace of libertarianism comes off as transactional and disingenuous.  \n\nThe reason Ron Paul made so much headway in the mainstream was because he was genuine. There's too many in the conservative movement who cloak themselves in libertarianism merely to justify their actions.",
