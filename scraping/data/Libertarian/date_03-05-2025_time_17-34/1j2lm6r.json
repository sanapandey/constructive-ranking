Soooo this is beyond stupidity and honestly a bad investment even if you're an interventionist. Remember how much they sneered at our political leaders a year ago for being slightly reprimanded for extreme conduct.\u00a0\n\n\nBut hey this is going to serve as great recruitment material and further exemplify us as being the evil empire in alot of peoples mind. I sometimes wonder how much headway we could make if we offered the carrot of stopping funding Israel and pulling back our involvement in the region, with terms and conditions that if violated meets the stick of that we will be back.\u00a0\n\n\nI mean diplomacy 101 tie their interests to yours. But hey we can burn money for a new war on terror for another couple decades and bleed the treasure, liberties, and likely at some point the blood of our citizenry to continue the same Cold War era foreign policies.\u00a0\n\n\nSeems smart. I mean ya never want to rebalance your stocks so why on Earth would you wanna rebalance your foreign policy that is as old as black and white tvs and segregation /s\n\n\nFull disclosure not a libertarian but libertarian-ish, and anti entangling alliances, which I believe most people in the U.S. are, given that a full of shit politician made alot of headway with that message and won the Presidency on a message of not being forever global cop.\u00a0\n\n\nI mean really though how do most empires crumble, economic instability and overreach are usually two very big factors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0",

At Ukraine's current pace, war analysts are saying it would take them 83 yrs to win back their former territory. They don't have enough troops to last 83 yrs. So the question for the American taxpayer is: do we want to continue to invest 114 billion Euros per annum to back Ukraine for the next 80 yrs until they win? And possibly need to provide boots on the ground? Or do we call a spade and spade and try to negotiate a peace deal? I prefer the latter option because I don't think Ukraine can win--Russia will outlast them unless the EU steps up in a big way and provides EU troops on the ground. I'm personally against sending any American troops there. I also think Europe is all talk and no action. Promises of EU troops on the ground are only IF the USA provides a security guarantee--meaning the American military would have to back them up.",

It\u2019s Ukraines choice to defend their country, it\u2019s something they want to do. Just like the Vietnamese fight against French and American aggression. \n\nIt is a win for us as it exposes Russia military as being the paper tiger it is. Russia has lost over 100k troops and maybe 100s of thousands, lost good chunk of its Navy, lost presence in the Black Sea, lost its stocks of Soviet era weapons, lost their best and brightest due to immigration, and weakened their economy to the point that when this war does end it may collapse. Economically for us it\u2019s cheaper than putting boots on the ground. It\u2019s been a R&D wet dream, and prior to electing the Russian asset who Trump we had immense soft power in Europe.",
