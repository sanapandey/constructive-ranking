US forces are not there to protect Germany.  They are there to project power in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nIf a Russian plane encroaches on German airspace, it is a German Typhoon that responds, not a US plane.\n\nNow, we can disagree with the need to be involved in those regions, but Vance is presenting this dishonestly.",

There is a reason why people call the fall of the USSR the fall of communism. \n\nRussia is barely even in the top 10 GDP countries now compared to being number 2 in the soviet era. Numerous countries in the EU have a higher GDP by themselves than Russia, let alone the EU as a whole. All they need to do is start actually pulling their weight, and Russia is no threat at all to them outside of nukes.",
