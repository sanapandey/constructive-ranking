Doge is focused on something broader: dismantling administrative state, in theory based on an index of elected decisions to unelected decisions. Two separate issues:\n\nGAO wants to make sure dollars are not being given to fraudsters and to a lesser extent a specific kind of waste (mispayment I think is the term they used). This is accountability at the financial level on one issue. \n\nDOGE wants accountability on the democratic level (elected decisioning), and is also interested in removing undemocratic decisioning based on where dollars are most impacted by that decisioning. \n\nThere should be overlaps, but it\u2019s a Venn Diagram, not a circle",

Elon Musk, who\u2019s running DOGE, literally tweeted on Feb. 4 that it's trying to \u201cSTOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD.\u201d And the executive order that created DOGE specifically mentions modernizing government tech and software to improve efficiency and accountability. So while GAO and DOGE have different scopes, they\u2019re not totally separate lanes. DOGE is tackling fraud and mispayment too, just with a broader approach. Think of it more as a heavily overlapping Venn diagram.",
