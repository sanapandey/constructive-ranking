But that doesn\u2019t fit to their narrative. If they say we are doing the opposite of making terrorist and instead spending a small amount of money to produce a large amount of good in a part of the world where people hate the United States so that they might view us better and not become terrorist. Well, you probably wouldn\u2019t be so against them spending .1% of 1% of 1% of the national budget on that. \n\nAnd yes, I know it\u2019s not actually that small of an amount that\u2019s just a hyperbolic term. It is a very small amount though.",

I'm like 2.5 for 7 (verified ~$100m of the ~$260m purported savings) on the items listed in the OP (been at this for at least 30m).\n\nI was able to find [this](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72051422CA00001_7200) just using the keyword \"indigenous peoples and afro-colombian empowerment\" for the first one, but the savings are overestimated by ~4x (OP says $60m, but the obligation is only ~$40m to start with, and $25m of that has already been outlaid, so potential savings is only ~$15m, not $60m) so I'm counting that as half correct.\n\nSecond one I used \"inclusive justice\" as the keyword and Colombia for the country and got 0 hits.\n\nThird one I found [this](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_72061524F00003_7200_72062323D00010_7200) which matches OP pretty well.\n\nFourth one I used \"female empowerment\" as the keyword and Colombia for the country and got 0 hits.\n\nFifth one I set the country to Lesotho and tried all of \"reduce stigma\", \"LGBTQI\", or \"LGBTQI+\" as keyword and got 0 hits.\n\nSixth one I got [this](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_25K75IL000016_1605) which matches the OP well enough to count(although it seems to have a much larger geographic range than the OP implies).\n\nLast one I searched \"vegan local climate action\" and got nothing. Also tried just searching \"vegan\" with country set to Zambia and got nothing.\n\nSince you said you were able to verify 20, and there's obviously fewer than that in OP, are you grabbing info from some DOGE website that has information that's easier to search on USASpending than what's in the OP?\n\nAlso worth noting that only $20m of the $100m I was able to verify is for DEI stuff, the other $80m is for literacy in West Africa, which is obviously still foreign aid that many libertarians would oppose, but it's not exactly \"woke\" spending, which seems like what the OP wants to imply these cuts are mainly targeting.",

I grant that it may be ultimately performative, we need a ton more cuts to get us out of this budget mess.\n\nRegarding isolationism, what isolationist moves do you see being made? I've seen plenty of sabre rattling over fentanyl, moves to buy Greenland (which is a pretty crazy dream), offers to help Ukraine in exchange for mineral rights, and that suggestion that we build in Gaza.

Are their cuts doing some good? Undoubtedly. The other issue I have here is that with all of that, we're still ending up with a deficit. Either the tax cuts need to be reduced to provide enough income to overcome the gap or, better yet, spending needs to be cut in other areas (hello, military-industrial complex). Ideally, those tax cuts would also be more evenly split across income brackets.",
