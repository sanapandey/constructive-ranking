A market with easier access to capital is more attractive to someone trying to raise capital and the is a reason why companies who list on the Dow are more valuable than wherever pink slip penny stocks are listed.\n\nOf course I think these market makers should make the rules and be 100% transparent about it not any government.\n\nAlso anyone who participates in a pump and dump is skum just like any other scammer.

I also hold zero empathy for people who throw life savings or money they can't afford to lose at these coins and then complain when the dump occurs. They were probably planning to do the same. They just dumped before the buyer could.\n\nSo I think it should be legal. Making it illegal isn't going to stop stupid people from making dumb financial decisions. They'll just opt to do other stupid things like options trading or yolo'ing nana's inheritance into a failing company. \n\n\"A fool and his money are easily parted\"",

The more informed person just buys or sells based on information not available to the public. \n\nI haven't fully formed my mind on insider trading, but I lean that it should be legal.
