MRIs cost more to run than amount Medicare is willing to reimburse; as a result, they charge under 65 insurance more for MRIs to make up the loss. This artificially affects the rate at which they are prescribed based off age as well as need.\n\n\nSo ironically, when it comes to Medicare reimbursement, the government is perceived to have strong bargaining power, however the size leaves it open to localized exploitation, such as medical devices advertised on TV.",

It eliminates risk on the side of the lender, heavily benefits the universities financially, while placing all the burden on the students (and often their parents). \n\nAnd since the students have gone to public schools so are lousy at math, have no understanding of personal finance, and have been propagandized their entire lives about the value of higher education... they don't realize how badly they are getting screwed over by the whole deal. \n\nNormally in loans there is natural self-regulation both in terms of lender and borrower. The borrower is taking risk by borrowing, the lender it taking risk by lending.  If you, the borrower, runs into bad luck and can't get a job and can't pay it off then the lender is shit out of luck. \n\nBy eliminating risk on the lender then it is effectively free money as far as they are concerned. Which is exactly what is going on with government-ran student loan program in the USA.  Since the borrower is not allowed to bankrupt out of a student loan then piling up fines and interest rates through missed and deferred payments just means more profits.  \n\nThey are pretty much guaranteed to make money regardless of the fortunes of the student borrower. Even if they end up bombing out and not getting a degree at all the lender still profits.  And so does the university. \n\nThe end result is effectively a \"college attendance tax\".  \n\nThe effect on prices is going to be the same as if the government simply taxed the crap out of anybody who has graduated from college with a 4 year degree and just used the money to pay for the next generation of students, and the next few decades of Universities profits.",

I pay absolutely nothing.\nBut even that I don't enjoy my degree and it teaches me almost nothing practical for my job I still study for it. This is because I would struggle to get a good paying corporate job without it.\nNobody would want to employ me.\nThe employers must pay me a minimum wage or above for internship. Which means that I my marginal productivity needs to be worth at least minimum wage plus training cost.  So employers don't want to take risks with someone who doesn't have a bachelor's degree. \nAnd let me tell something, I will probably study for a pointless master's degree abroad, because I want to immigrate and in many countries students get visa. If Joe wants to move to England let's say, he can't just accept a job that pays 80,000 pounds a year, but his friend Tom who studies a trashy master's can get a visa for his 40,000 pounds job.\nThat means that Britain gave up on a high tax payer with no degree for a low tax payer with a degree.\nMost students are like me. People like to lie that they enjoy college, but most people hate college, the same way that most people hate school. It's boring and pointless. \nThis is pure waste of time and money.\nWe need to eliminate minimum wage for internships (or always) and stop subsidizing higher education. And then cheap and efficient alternatives to academia will arise, and a very small number of people who are very suited for academia would go to university and pay for it.\nThe state should stop its pointless and destructive interventions in the market.",
