The Treasury just keeps borrowing more Federal Reserve Notes which the Fed keeps printing, which is why inflation exists, after Republican Nixon took the US off the gold standard. That\u2019s why the national debt is $36T (and Trump\u2019s first term added $8T to that. Four years of Trump amounts to 22% of America\u2019s national debt.)\n\nTrump wants to raise the debt limit by $4T. And too many people are cheering on minuscule cuts, while Trump plans on giving a $4.5T taxcut to the rich (3x bigger than his first term).",

Like everybody that actually works a honest a job for a living. \n\nWhich means that the Feds are dead weight. Getting rid of dead weight in a economy is one of the major ways you can make it better. \n\n> On the back of the largest transfer of wealth to the top 1% in the history of the world.\n\nHow do you think that that \"largest wealth transfer\" actually happened? \n\nLike describe the actual mechanics.\n\nWhen the government \"printed\" trillions of dollars in 2008 and again in 2020... were do you think that money actually went? Who was on the receiving end of that? \n\nIt certainly as hell wasn't you.  It wasn't me either. \n\nNone of that \"largest transfer of wealth\" would of been possible without the Federal government conspiring with largest banking cartel in the world. \n\nIn 2008 the ones at the top... the banking cartels, the regulators, the federal government. They are the ones that collapsed the economy and caused the housing crisis. It was their fault. It happened under their watch.  It wouldn't of been possible if it wasn't for them. \n\nAnd it would of drove them out of business.  But guess what?  \n\nit was decided \"They were too big to fail\". \n\nWho decided that?  \n\nThemselves, of course!!\n\nAnd again in 2020. (And Trump is part of it here as well).  They again collapsed the economy.  The shortages, the \"supply line crisis\" and the rest of it... It was caused by the Feds, the state governments, the banking cartels, and the rest of them.   It was their policy. Their fault.  They threatened to fine and throw people in prison. \n\nAnd, again, to save themselves they printed trillions of dollars.  To save the stock market.  To keep the tech industry high valued. To make people like Elon Musk even rich. \n\nThat is where the money went. That was what it was for. \n\nSo how long do you want this shit to continue?  How long are you going to defend the parasite classes and the banking cartels and the government that causes all this chaos and wealth destruction and self-enrichment? \n\nThese people don't exist to protect you or server you.  They don't exist to protect the american public from the greed of massive public corporations. \n\nThey helped to _CREATE_ these massive public corporations. It is their policies and regulations that make them possible in the first place.  They are not the result of market forces or free market capitalism or any of that. It was all the result of a long series of deliberate policy decisions that created the modern mega corporation. \n\nIt is beyond just \"letting it happen\".  They _made it happen_.   They don't exist to protect Americans from evil corporate greed.  They are the ones that protect the evil corporate greed from Americans. \n\nAll the while they got Americans so fucked in the head from Left vs Right political circuses and flimflam shows on television, radio, newspapers and now on social media that they got Americans blaming each other for the stupid shit the government does... instead of blaming the government for the stupid shit the government does.",
