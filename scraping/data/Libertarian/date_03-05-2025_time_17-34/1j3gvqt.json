Tons of economists at the time predicted that a general European war would never happen because it would be a disaster for the economies of the region. Goods were crossing borders like crazy, nations like Great Britain, France, etc... were at their economic height.\u00a0\n\n\nYet as we all know it didn't prevent anything, and led to the economic capital of the world being moved from London to New York, and drained the British treasury into the strong industrialized manufacturing economy of the U.S. which then supercharged us from being a regional power on the rise to a colossal\u00a0 super power on the world stage after WW2.\u00a0",

This phrase is not absolute and should not be used to assume that resources, trade and goods are the only justification for war.\n\nBitter old men who hold onto defensive alliances can also be the cause for war. Expansionism for reasons beyond resources can also be the cause. Cultural issues literally caused the first world war.\n\nThe idea here is that free trade is necessary to *help prevent* a world where nations feel the need to forcefully take from others.",

Uk had a a freer trade policy in the period while Germany had a proteccionist policies.\n\nAnyways, it seems that the British empire was a free trade zone by its own. Some data of british export markets in 1908:\n\n\"At the beginning of the 20th century, Britain, including southern Ireland, was one of the world's principal trading nations.\n\nThe main markets for British goods were those with which it had preferential trade arrangements: the Empire and former colonies. In 1908, exports of goods to the Commonwealth countries of Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa accounted for around a quarter of the total, and British India was the UK's largest single market. The US accounted for almost a tenth of all exports; while estimates of exports to the current EU countries suggest they accounted for a further four tenths, not dissimilar from the figure today (UK exports to the EU were 53% of the total in 2011).\"\n\nSource: https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/olympic-britain/the-economy/from-empire-to-eu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com",

The other European powers were nervous because Germany had recently gone from a bunch of small independent states to one large, powerful nation capable of disrupting the existing paradigm. Whether Germany had any plans to do that is irrelevant. It resulted in tensions running high between Germany and the rest of Europe.\n\nGermany is closed in by other nations on three sides and has a limited coastline in the north. They were afraid that England, France and others might convince those neighbouring countries to stop trading with Germany and also stop allowing them to move goods *through* their nations.\n\nThe assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was just a match put to an existing powder keg. One filled with powder by trade tensions.",
