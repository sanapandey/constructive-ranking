The remaining 3.5% that refused remains to be an indeterminant amount. The end point for these individuals is hard to determine, many may have been terminated or faced disciplinary actions. Additionally, many federal courts actually sided with federal employees who were terminated for vaccine refusal which they did citing religious grounds when their cases were brought to court.",

It depended on the company and when contracts were expiring, but people were fired for not being vaccinated. Civilian employees were also under real threat of being fired and the reason you didn\u2019t see more about it was because the judicial branch put a stop to the vaccine mandate. Checks and balances work, but they do take time. Hopefully, they still work.\u00a0",

So you might as well just get vaccinated.\"\n\nThe Navy made a strong effort to deny any and all religious exemptions. They also kept their members on covid restrictions longer than any other organization, locking them down to their ships and denying anyone any quality of life. People were denied the ability to go home to their families. Dual mil parents were ordered to stay on the ship for extended periods, leaving them no options in regards to childcare. Base facilities were restricted or outright shut down, to include medical and dental facilities. The medical facility I was required to use shut down all non-emergency dental services for nearly 2 years. Medical was by appointment only, and appointments were extremely limited due to reduced manning. \n\nThen they wonder why recruitment rates took a nosedive.",

Threatening to destroy someone's future despite how honorable their service was because they don't want to comply with a medical mandate is evil. It doesn't matter if they are in the military.

Trying to equate that with some congressmen trying to get waiting periods to buy a gun or the occasional misuse of the commerce clause, is tiresome and clownish.

RFK Jr., the heroin addict kook non-doctor tapped by Trump to lead the CDC, thinks vaccines are bad because he thinks vaccines cause autism (which is false, old men\u2019s sperm is linked to autism).
