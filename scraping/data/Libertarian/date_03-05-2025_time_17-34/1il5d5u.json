I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll find much to support the argument that isn\u2019t biased since almost all these ideas are newly created with the intent of attacking and undermining the legitimacy of the 2nd.\n\n[I believe this guy is probably the chief architect of the \u20182nd amendment was to control slaves\u2019 argument and was published as a law review article.  He later expanded it to book length.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1465114)\n\nTo be completely honest, while I\u2019ve heard of this reasoning I\u2019ve not read the paper or book.  On the surface, I don\u2019t find the argument very compelling.  Militias in the northern states were fighting the French, native Americans, and then the earliest battles of the revolution.  While slavery existed in the northern colonies/states, it was less prevalent and was ended much earlier.  It\u2019s hard to see the control of slaves as a \u2018big\u2019 or primary reason for the second given these facts.\n\nI also don\u2019t think commentary from the founders supports this argument.  While they had plenty to say about militias and arms, bearing arms to control slaves is absent from the discussion.\n\n[Even Madison\u2019s early drafts of the second fail to say anything directly about slavery.  I suppose controlling slave populations could be included in his meaning of a secure state though.](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt2-2/ALDE_00013262/)\n\nStill, many of the constitutions of the various states contain similar provisions and wordings for the right to bear arms, but don\u2019t mention slavery.  Even the southern states, who would be most likely to consider slave control a compelling reason to ensure a constitutionally enumerated and protected right to bear arms.\n\nLastly, I think it\u2019s useful to look at the earliest gun control laws.  [Those were absolutely meant to keep newly freed slaves disarmed and were decidedly racist.](https://harvardlawreview.org/forum/vol-135/racist-gun-laws-and-the-second-amendment/)\n\nSorry I didn\u2019t include more links to support my own feelings and beliefs, but I think a lot of the information from both sides is actually pretty biased (I say that as a strong 2A supporter).  It\u2019s also an issue that most folks are pretty dug in on.  Either way, I hope it helps.  Molon labe!",

Not even in Madison\u2019s earlier drafts.  Nor is it discussed in the debates surrounding ratification or in any of the state constitutions.\n\nLike I said above, maybe control of slaves was understood to be part and parcel of a \u201csecure state\u201d.  The bill of rights can also be viewed as kind of a compromise between federalists and anti-federalists and maybe they left out discussions of slavery to make sure they didn\u2019t piss of northern states while trying to appease southern states.",

The problem is the 14th ammendment didn't exist yet therefore it isn't a logical argue unless you go with \"freed men\".  But the fact they were chattel means the title holder would be able to make their own law in those regards unless a state or local law some how superceded it.\n\nI heard the other day it had something to with Georgia and their militia alone.  Idk what because the host was a tool and cut the person making the point.  Interesting idea..",
