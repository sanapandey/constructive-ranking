What caused the Civil War was the southern democrats thought that republicans were going to end slavery (they weren\u2019t, and Lincoln did not promise to or advocate for it) and so states decided to secede rather than be in the US under a republican. That would be like the equivalent of a republican today believing a democrat would be president and immediately ban all guns and turn the US into a communist country. Maybe there are some hyper-fringe extremists saying that, but no one running is advocating anything close to that. South Carolina seceded three months before Lincoln took office and then attacked Fort Sumter. That is what started the Civil War. The impotent Presidencies of Polk, Taylor, Fillmore, Pierce and Buchanan contributed WAY more than Lincoln.",

In September 1861, Howard was arrested without a warrant for criticizing Lincoln\u2019s suspension of habeas corpus and the declaration of martial law in Baltimore.

Not sure why you think Lincoln \"got\" them killed as though he went on a war path as soon as the south seceded.  He literally only acted after Fort Sumter.\n\nAnd finally:  you have the gift of hindsight.  Lincoln did not.  There was no clear evidence that slavery would \"die out,\"  after all, the south's slave population was actually growing.

                                    "body": "So in reference to the \"Border States\" you are referring to, which were among the last to liberate slaves; consider that Washington DC is surrounded on all sides by slave States and that the Maryland State House was going to vote for secession. In thr event they did so, DC would have fallen and the Confederacy would have EASILY won the war, at which point slavery would have become the default for the entire US.  \n\nNext, consider that the Confederate slaves were liberated first under the emancipation proclamation which was a an emergency measure to undermine the Confederate War effort and discourage international entanglement, as France and Britain were considering providing aid to the Confederacy until the war was framed as having an abolitionist angle.  Lincoln did not have the constitutional authority to end slavery as a point of federal law as that was in the purview of Congress and the amendment process, which was signed and ratified in 1865.  \n\nAnd finally, consider that without conscription (of which the Confederacy was MUCH more apt to do) Lincoln feared a loss of the war, which would, again, spread slavery across the states.  \n\nSo the libertarian discussion over Lincoln centers on his expansion of Executive authority and disregard for civil liberties-which I totally get- but the alternative to that disregard is expanded and preserved slavery. So libertarians have to ask themselves: What is less Libertarian: Secuestering constitutional rights or allowing for permanent and multi generational bondage to persist?\n\nI would be EXTREMELY interested to hear how slavery would be solved using Libertarian principles.",

There were, in fact, four states in the Union that had slavery til *after* Lincoln's death. He was a white supremacist who also stated in a letter that he'd keep every slave if it meant preserving the Union. On that note, the biggest advantage that I can see in preserving the Union really didn't show up til WWII with the US having to fight a war on two fronts and keeping those states allowed us the power and resources to do so, but it is utterly beyond the scope of reason to think that idea ever entered Lincoln's head. He also expanded the power of the federal government, turning the many states from essentially being separate countries United under a common cause, vision, and pledge to protect each other, but still largely governing themselves to simply different places to live in one country. Nope, Lincoln was a shitbag, nothing else.",
