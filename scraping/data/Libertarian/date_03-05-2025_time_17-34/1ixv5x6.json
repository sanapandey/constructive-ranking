            "body": "It is financial regulatory body that is supposed to advocate for consumers. It has a funding structure that is supposed to keep it out of partisan budget discussions. However it is uniquely positioned to target financial companies with shifting rules that don't require congress to change the law to make changes to said rules. I think it was set up as a response to the housing crash but I don't pretend to be an expert on it in any way.\n\nIt is has been claimed by multiple sides of being being partisan in various ways. More recently the white house has said it is a captured agency (that is working for the interest of establishment powers) and it is in the crosshairs of DOGE. Given its funding structure and broad reach there could be truth to that claim. \n\nOn the other side I've heard good things about it limiting predatory financial practices, though personally I've seen plenty of predatory practices still in action so I'm not really sure just how effective it is. Buyer beware is still the best policy.\n\nI like govenment to have a smaller footprint on daily life so I lean hard into the 'smaller government is better' end of things, so without fully understanding all sides my reaction would be to cut it, though I too would like to see more discussion about how it operates and what it does. \n\nThe summation of the arguments I've hear on the left is 'this helps you leave it alone'. Personally that does not ring true for me. I'm one of those people that believe \"The nine most terrifying words in the English language are 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help'\". The left says that CFPB us the only thing standing between me and high late fees on credit cards and outrageous interest rates on payday loans. I don't use those products so they aren't really helping me. I highly recommend that other people not use those products as well, I think we would be better off without them. I lived at poverty level for a decade in my life and didn't touch the stuff, saw it as the trap it was. \n\nThe summation of the argument I've hard on the right is that CFPB has been targeting specific companies in the market, trying to pick winners and losers based on ideology. I'm inclined to believe it as I've seen simular behaviors from other agencies and corporations that were supposed to be non-partisan. The right says that CFPB has been intentionally hamstringing American businesses and making it difficult for them to compete abroad with other foriegn companies that don't have to deal with onerous regulations of CFPB. Not sure about the second part, mainly because I don't know what regulations are holding our companies back, but I'm certainly familiar with the US having to deal with unfair trade tariffs and terrible comparative advantage (that is trying to compete with countries that use straight up slave labor for manufacturing or off load tones of externalities by dumping pollution into the air and water).",

Landlords left their properties vacant rather than lose money,  this further shrank the supply, which increased prices in areas without controls.  By removing the rent caps, this increased supply, decreasing demand in the areas everyone was forced to move, thus decreasing price in those areas as well.
