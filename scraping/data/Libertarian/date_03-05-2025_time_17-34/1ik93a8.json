    "selftext": "I think the US government is inefficient for three main reasons: 1) because billionaires don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes to help make the government work for the little guy, 2) because billionaires and corporations on both sides actively work against any policy and regulation efforts that would benefit the working class at their own expense, and 3) because every 4-8 years government employees are often either fired or redirected, so they can\u2019t actually accomplish anything beneficial since real reform takes time and consistent strategy. I argue that the majority of government employees are working-class citizens who put themselves and their families\u2019 lives at risk trying to make the world a bit less shitty.\n\nBillionaires and corporations on both sides of the political aisle know this, and most of them exploit it by doing everything they can (mainly by bribing politicians) to avoid/cut their own taxes and kill any policies/regulations that are supposed to hold them accountable vs the working man whenever their chosen party is in power. Their other great con has been convincing so many working class people that our biggest problems stem from government agencies and workers rather than from the ultra-rich who actively work to corrupt politicians and sabotage government for their own gains.\n\nWhat the ultra-rich fear most is a class war, so billionaires on both sides have found ways to fuel the culture wars to divide and distract us from thinking and talking about the real problems facing our nation, most of which stem from the billionaire-owned two-party system and the ever-widening wealth gap between the ultra wealthy and the rest of us. This is especially true for all the owners of these social media companies who control the algorithms to actively distract and to divide us and gain even more money and power.\n\nBut I think one of the billionaires\u2019 most recent and effective cons has been convincing people that by reducing the federal workforce or shutting down government agencies, the resulting monetary savings will actually go toward services for the working class, or to reducing national debt. I believe it\u2019s much more likely any of the \u201csaved\u201d funds will be redirected to even more government contracts for large corporations where the billionaires get to keep most of the profits. The ultra-rich would love to see government agencies fall apart so they can privatize the services, buy up whatever is left, and charge us even more while paying their employees lower wages. They also then wouldn\u2019t have to spend so much money and effort on lobbying, avoiding taxes, maintaining safe working environments for employees, and paying for livable wages and benefits.\n\nRegretfully, I\u2019m sure this viewpoint will trigger some working class people who defend billionaires at all costs. But I promise that no matter what, the ultra-rich won\u2019t suddenly start caring about any of us.",

I posted this on several subs across the political spectrum as a social experiment to try and better understand how working class people from all different political ideologies feel about the ultra-rich, government efficiency, and the wealth gap. Thanks for your reply!\n\nI\u2019m just a regular person who does not subscribe to any political ideology. I personally think ideologies such as Liberal, Conservative, Libertarian, Communist, etc. are all constructs created by the ultra-rich of the past to keep us peasants busy working and fighting with each other while they continue to stay in the top 1%.",

The way you throw around terms like \"blue collar\" and \"rich\" shows that. \n2. You've done little to no research on Libertarianism. It's likely because you see this ideology as far right (see statement 1). It would do you a bit of good to actually dive into some reading, educate yourself beyond what you think you know, and then experiment when you have firm footing upon how/ why these ideologies exist.",

It works for the benefit of those who are politically connected, like the military-industrial complex.\n\nNobody should pay any taxes b/c 99% of what the U.S. govt wants to do is immoral, like its Forever Wars. The federal government is not about providing social services. Healthcare and education are expensive b/c of government intervention into those markets. If it really cared about keeping inflation and costs down, it would stop printing money and spending. \n\nThe government is inefficient with respect to the common man b/c the Constitution and representative democracy were never meant to operate at this scale. It's ludicrous to act as if a Congress of 535 people can meaningfully represent 330m+.",

            "body": "1) Billionares do pay their share of taxes. The average tax rate is higher the higher the wealth. The Tax Foundation does yearly summaries on this and you can see that in 2022 the top 1% pay about 22% average tax rate (561000$) and 40% of total income taxes paid, while bottom 50% pays 11% (800$) and 3% of total income taxes. Still, the amount of money the government gets is not that relevant, we want it to be efficient with less (that's the definition of efficiency), if the problem is solved by throwing money at it then we are not making ut nore efficient we are making it bigger\n\n2) You would need to support that claim with something, be it data or logic. You can't just state \"government inefficiency is caused by billionares\". Even if the government is so influenced by billionaires, that doesn't have to manifest as inefficience. If you can manipulate the State you would make it efficient so that it means you pay less, aside from changing which rules pass or not to benefit you. Inefficiency doesn't benefit anyone, be it rich or poor, just benefits the employees that are not vital.\n\n3) If you see any graph of total government employees (source: BLS), there are no significant changes when changing presidents. Crisis are the only sudden changes in employment, not every 4-8 years as you claim. If any problem in that graph that may be related to inefficiency is that it always goes up. Also the life expectancy of government employees is higher than the average by about 6 years(source: SOA Pub 2010 retirement plans mortality tabled), so I don't see how they are risking their lives.\n\nThe rest of your post is just a narrative that borders on the conspiracy that is supported by nothing that I just don't have the time to dissect, it is just one cliche statement after the other with nothing to support it.\n\nOverall, your claim that government inefficiency is the result of billionaires doesn't hold itself. The government is inefficient because it has no real incentives to be efficient but it does have incentives to expand its bureaucratic machinery as an easy way to create more jobs.\n\nAlso, I saw in a comment you considered yourself as with no ideology, but it is very clear in your post that you have a leftist bias, as the use of ultra-rich or class-war suggest. May I say your ideology is pretty much the mainstream.\n\nFeel free to ask for any of the documents I got my data from and I will send them to you.",
