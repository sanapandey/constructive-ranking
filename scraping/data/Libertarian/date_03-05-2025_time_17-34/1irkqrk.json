    "selftext": "I see a lot more freedom in Brazil than in Europe or the U.S. Here, we have laws, but the police are forgiving, and people generally don\u2019t care too much about telling others what to do.\n\nI find it interesting how, at night, some drivers will stop their cars at a red light even when there\u2019s no one around. Here, when it's late and there\u2019s no one on the street, we just go through red lights. It\u2019s not about breaking the law, it\u2019s just common sense. The police and the people know that waiting at a red light in an empty street is as pointless as cows standing still.\n\nTax laws are complicated, but the government doesn\u2019t bother small or medium-sized businesses much. We just don\u2019t follow the tax laws, and no one really cares.\n\nAnd of course, we can drink whatever we want, whenever we want, 24 hours a day. Drinking and driving is a bit harder now, but 70% of people still drive anyway.\n\nWould I rather live longer with no freedom, or risk a shorter life but with freedom? I prefer a short life with freedom over a long one where the state tells me when and where I can drink. Hahahaha.",

Other countries have the resources and state power to enforce the laws they pass so state control is felt much more keenly. That applies for the many, many domains where the state isn't legitimate, and the handful where it is (protecting people's ability to exercise their freedom).\n\nAnyone is free to live a short life, the second it causes others to live a short life too against their will it isn't freedom, it's a violation of it.",
