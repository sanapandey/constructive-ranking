How could I even imagine that someone that bases his political ideology from a youtube video that puts in huge bold in the caption \"HITLER WAS SOCIALIST\" dishonest? Certainly my bad. /s",

The \"socialist\" part of the Nazi party name was just marketing to win over working class people during tough economic times. \n\nHis actual policies were the complete opposite of socialism - he worked hand in hand with big business owners, crushed labor unions, and banned anything that gave workers more power. Real socialists want workers to control the economy and share wealth more evenly. Hitler wanted a nationalist, far-right state run by the \"master race.\"\n\nYou can pick and choose stuff to fit your narrative. I don't need to watch the video to know hitler wasn't a socialist.
