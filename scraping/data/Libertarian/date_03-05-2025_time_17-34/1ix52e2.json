Supply for minimum wage workers will increase driving wages down? Then drop minimum wage, and achieve market equilibrium?\n\nWow, did this just lower the market price of goods too?",

It means that the private sector job market, which is already tough right now, will get much much worse, with the influx of thousands of new job seekers. So yeah, it's not good for us.",

Assuming Trump/doge are successful at cutting regulations as well, we should expect a similar result as when the soldiers came home from WW2, i.e. a big improvement in the economy as these workers transition from unproductive, destructive, or centrally planned jobs, to actual productive jobs in the private sector. I\u2019m not insulting the WW2 soldiers, I\u2019m just saying that getting blown up on another continent is a lot less productive than working a job at home. \n\nOf course before the end of WW2 all the Keynesian central planners were similarly freaking out about all the employment that would result from the soldiers coming home, but because they believe the driver of the economy is consumption and the point of the economy is to create jobs (rather than production), they got it entirely wrong and what happened was essentially the opposite of what they predicted.",
