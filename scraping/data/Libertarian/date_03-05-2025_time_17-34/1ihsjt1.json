Shows the payment errors for the last 20- years.  \nFrom 2023, the pandemic unemployment was 43.6b, and the payment protection program was 18.7b - a total of 62.3b related to the pandemic. Subtract this from the 236b total from 2023, which gets us 173.7b. This puts us close to the payment errors from 2019.  \nThis still isn't good, but overall, a lot is still related to the pandemic.",

Trump has ended whole departments that will seriously cripple the current way our government prefroms regime changes. Remove Security clearance for a bunch of retired so and so's. That ended any potential security concerns from that camp. and their ability to make clandestine deals that serve the Deep State. If Trump could be convinced to stop supporting the Terrorist state of Israel that would be a wonderful. If this is all he does has brought into the light how our CIA operates and penetrates a country...any move the limits the power of the Deep State to keep making endless banker wars to serve the Ruling class is a great step in the right direction.",
