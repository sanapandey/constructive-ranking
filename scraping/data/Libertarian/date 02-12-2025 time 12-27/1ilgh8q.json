    "selftext": "I swear Reddit just calls every conservative people a litterally Nazi, and I think that's an terrible insult. I've seen those so many times. And Twitter is owned by Elon Musk so it's a lost cause now. They're both news apps aren't they? Then why is the liberal people silencing the right people in Reddit and the Right people are mocking the liberal people in Twitter? I feel like this app has a very great potential, but it's overflowing with one side of the political thingies and it just feels like a lefts' excusive app and vice versa for Twitter. Is there a similar app with a fair amount of both sides? Not trying to get you guys riled up or anything. Just a question.",

Which is not reflective of actual reality.\n- The upvoting and downvoting feature causes a lot of people to avoid rocking the status quo. So you will see very few different opinions. \n- Subs like AITA allow people to create a new reality. Most stories posted are fake, and you see quite a few rage bait stories (AITA because my Republican husband has a secret shrine to Hitler). But people who spend too much time on Reddit start to believe this false reality is, in fact, reality. And truly the majority of republicans secretly worship Hitler. \n- There are so many bots, and people paid to spread a specific point of view. This engagement creates a fake reality and heavily weights a very specific position. \n\nAnd finally, people are just nuts. Recent example, I asked on a Travel sub about an upcoming trip to Florida, very benign question and nothing political at all. My message inbox was flooded with people harassing me about spending money in a \u201cred state\u201d. It was like a copy/paste of the same verbiage. I did not even engage. Then I noticed by karma went down a lot. I think these people just went in and sporadically downvoted a ton of my posts simply because I asked a question about what the best activities are in Orlando. That\u2019s Reddit in a nutshell.",

I figured what\u2019s the point if no one sees it and if I start to accumulate so much negative karma I either won\u2019t be able to participate in many subs or have my comments dismissed as some radical or hateful troll.

Someone was trying to trash a woman because she said that there should be female-sized crash dummies to make cars safer for women. The person was saying she was a stupid lib or something, so I interjected that she was right. Car safety features have been historically designed for a male body and they should start designing with women in mind as well. Guess that made me a big nazi or something, haha",

They've gotten worse about that, but it's not nearly as bad as Facebook who show me more content I'm not subscribed to than they do content I am subscribed to. I also wouldn't call reddit a news site. It's a social media platform. There is news bc people have decided to set up different subreddits for news and there's enough interest from others.

Here on Reddit it seems like everything is stated like a hard fact and I think that makes people super reactive. Injecting a little bit of self-doubt into our statements, goes a very long way in presenting things as ideas rather than facts. There\u2019s an arrogant to the factual presentation of ideas here That is just unpleasant and lack self reflection.\n\nI also think that the longer people spend in an unhealthy environment with unhealthy communication the more they become like that system. When everybody is treating each other poorly, it just doesn\u2019t seem like people respond to that by being more polite they just double down on being even more unkind. \n\nSocial pressure plays a huge role in how people communicate and if everybody that\u2019s on \u201cone\u2019s team\u201d is calling people Nazis and you get praised for that and you get up voted for that then you\u2019re gonna do it. And if you get down vote for being honest or coming forward with good faith, communication you\u2019re not going to do that and right now Reddit is so heavily biased that even good faith, communication, meaning someone is doing their best to be honest and kind will still get attacked and mobbed and treated cruelly. Those people then leave and all your left with is the people who are willing to sustain this toxic communication patterns\n\nEven in your main statement, you stated it almost like it\u2019s a fact that Elon Musk is bad. I\u2019m not saying he isn\u2019t or that he is but that\u2019s a statement of fact and I think that\u2019s debatable. Almost everything is debatable when approached with a good faith argument. I think we have a long way to go as human beings in learning how to communicate in a system where we don\u2019t see each other\u2018s faces and have no personal accountability, and where every single person has the same weight of communication, meaning a published author or accomplish scientist can make commentsin the exact same room as someone without that experience. I do think it\u2019s good, but I think we have a lot to learn mostly about how to treat each other in a way that\u2019s respectful while also challenging difficult topics that are already difficult and hard to discuss let alone difficult to find factual evidence around.",

I read a lot and I really try to understand what is actually going on. \n\nFor the last couple years, I\u2019ve been trying a new experiment as a reaction to so many people telling me who I\u2019m supposed to hate and who I\u2019m supposed to like. I find this really distasteful. I feel like it\u2019s completely OK to make up my own mind about people firsthand.\n\nSo what I\u2019ve been doing is making a list of people I\u2019m told to dislike and then I find one on one interviews with them and I just listen. And I try to get a sense of who they are and what they\u2019re trying to say and what their ideas are myself. I\u2019ll either read their book or listen to their interviews or watch their show. And I\u2019m also avoiding mainstream media hot take gotcha type situations where their responses are being edited.\n\nWhat I\u2019m finding is that the public representations of who they are is almost always absolutely completely wrong. And what I think is that people are scared of their ideas because they\u2019re nuanced or controversial and so instead of taking the time to try to figure out the nuance they just say they\u2019re bad. Some people have great ideas, but they\u2019re an unkind person. Some people have bad ideas, but they\u2019re incredibly charismatic. Some people have some incredible good to offer, but also are tragically flawed. There\u2019s this dichotomy of good and bad and everyone that I think is just part of human nature, but we want perfect all the time.\n\nOften, I\u2019ll find this person isn\u2019t someone that I\u2019m interested in continuing to follow, but that my impression of them was very different than what I was told. Tucker Carlson is an example of this. I\u2019m glad I listened to the interviews and I\u2019m glad I listened to the show cause I think I have a good sense of who he is now but I\u2019m not a fan. But I\u2019m not a fan not because I\u2019m being told not to be a fan but because there\u2019s something that he does that I don\u2019t like and then I\u2019ve decided on my own Why.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like about Tucker is that in an interview he takes advantage of his interviewee\u2019s politeness. He takes something they say, and then he responds with a comment that their interviewee is too polite to counter, and I can tell that he\u2019s signaling to his audience by stating something as a fact, when really it\u2019s highly debatable and to me this breaks good faith, discussion and I\u2019m only interested in people who are operating in good faith. \n\nNow Scott Horton on the other hand, I read a lot of bad things about online and I\u2019m blown away by that guy\u2018s authenticity and the depth of his knowledge specifically on the topic of for-profit war. His book enough already really really saddened me and kind of just blew me away. I hope that people get a chance to hear what he\u2019s saying because I know that this guy only wants to try to end the suffering that comes from the widespread wars that we can\u2019t seem to shake.\n\nI\u2019m relieved my post didn\u2019t get attacked. I was kind of feeling shy and expecting that it would embracing myself. When people attack me on Reddit, it really does hurt my feelings, I hope I don\u2019t come across as sounding sensitive, but it\u2019s a real bummer when people make you feel like shit over something that doesn\u2019t seem fair. It just feels like bullying and I haven\u2019t felt those feelings since I was really young and in grade school.",

Hey I'm not the person you replied to, but your comment hit a chord with me in a really nice way!\u00a0\n\n\nI like Tucker Carlson, honestly I truly do respect him as a journalist and I'm happy he talks more about faith nowadays (I say this as a freedom-of-speecher but also as a budding person of faith) and I wonder if you saw his interview with Mark Hyman.\n\n\nI like Mark Hyman, too, actually. And in an interview with him, Tucker said \"we're not going to mention the T word,\" actually I completely forget what letter it was while I'm typing this now, let me tell you that u/Direct_Tomorrow5921, but it had something to do with \"I'll get demonetized if we say it out loud,\" and then Mark Hyman stopped dancing around the subject and said \"look I can't do this I'm just going to flat out say it\" and he said the full word from there and continued to say it.\u00a0\n\n\nI forgot what word it was, but if I go back I can find it. I'll link the interview. But I wonder if Tucker thought he was going to get away with it because of his interviewees' politeness usually?\u00a0\n\n\nOh now I remember. It was vaccinations. It was \"the V word,\" lol.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd Mark said an opinion that rubbed against the grain of Tucker Carlson's usual narrative and I really truly appreciated hearing both perspectives respectfully.\n\n\nHere's the interview in question:\u00a0\nhttps://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1861832522402861454?t=O7MYh0G2G-aYw3Gg66RMxw&s=19\n\n\nI don't know if the video got demonetized or not, but I'm glad Mark didn't comply with his narrative lol.\n\n\n*edited Hymen \u27a1\ufe0f Hyman because I can't spell names sometimes.*",

Because it leans politically left and has a strong groupthink bias it's essentially a downward spiral.\n\nReddit's groupthink phenomenon arises from a combination of platform design features, social dynamics, and psychological factors that collectively suppress dissent and amplify conformity.\n\nDownvote-as-disagreement: Despite Reddit's official guidelines suggesting downvotes should only hide irrelevant content, users routinely employ them to punish unpopular opinions. This creates a visibility bias where minority perspectives get buried, creating an illusion of consensus.\n\nKarma reinforcement: The public scoring system triggers dopamine-driven behavior, with users self-censoring to protect their \"social credit\" score. One study found comments at -1 karma get 67% more downvotes than identical neutral comments, demonstrating bandwagon effects.\n\nEcho chamber architecture: By design, subreddits isolate communities around shared interests or ideologies. This structural homogeneity reduces exposure to dissenting views.\n\nModeration practices: Many subreddits enforce strict content rules that eliminate nuance. \n\nIn-group language: Communities develop jargon and inside jokes that act as loyalty tests. As observed in political subreddits, outsiders who misunderstand these cues face immediate rejection.\n\nSocial identity theory: Users derive self-worth from subreddit membership, prioritizing group approval over truth-seeking. This manifests in meme warfare between rival communities (e.g., PC vs console gaming subreddits)\n\nSpiral of silence: A 2023 analysis found 68% of Redditors withhold controversial opinions due to anticipated backlash. The voting system quantifies social disapproval, making conformity measurable.\n\nDeindividuation: Anonymity enables harsh group enforcement of norms.\n\nAttention economy: Provocative conformist posts gain more visibility, training users to replicate extreme positions.\n\nAlgorithmic amplification: Reddit's recommendation system surfaces content similar to users' existing preferences. A 2024 study showed 73% of recommended posts came from communities users already engaged with, narrowing perspectives.\n\nThis type of suppressive groupthink systematically disadvantage nuanced discourse. Given the current political leaning of the platform, it would take systemic change or an overall cultural shift to change this issue.",

Unless you actively sought out the WSJ editorial page or Fox News, you never even heard voices on the right.  You never had to defend any positions - everyone you interacted with from your teachers and professors to late night \u201ccomedians\u201d just assumed that they possessed objective metaphysical truth and there was no need to consider alternatives.\n\nThere was a time, still, when those on the left knew how to do more than hurl epithets.  And even a time when there were serious people on the left - men like Christopher Hitchens who made it a point to maintain his heterodoxy.  No longer.\n\nJust for fun, try having a serious discussion of the deleterious effects of mass illegal immigration with a leftist.  \n\n\u201cIt depresses the wages of citizens on the low end of the wage scale.\u201d\n\u201cXENOPHOBE!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt drains resources of government at all levels.\u201d\n\u201cRACIST!\u201d\n\n\u201cA nation that doesn\u2019t enforce its borders isn\u2019t a sovereign country.\u201d\n\u201cBIGOT!\u201d\n\nThe brain is like a muscle.
