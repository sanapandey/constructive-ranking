I'll add my reasonable take for you discerning individuals. \n\nYes, it seems the Republicrats feel very self righteous in their abuse of power and constitutionally questionable policies during covid, but are overreacting and exaggerating when it comes to legal action the executive branch has a right to wield.\n\nI'm no legal scholar but I bet most of us here do want the majority of federal institutions dismantled. Much of this work that's actually legitimate can be delegated to the states. I don't know how much of that trump can actually do and if there's any glimmer of truth to this bandwagon trotting on about how what musk is doing isn't legal. But im ready to see how much they can manage to do before the republicrat opposition gets too great",
