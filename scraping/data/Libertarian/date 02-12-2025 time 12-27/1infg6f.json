Its just costs with no revenues, and type of program typically funded with taxes.\n\nTo privatize it, it requires a funding source.\n\nI think you have to look at the factors that cause poverty and root out those issues. To not have welfare or a need for it means everyone is self supported and independant.",

In 2022 Walmart took in about 25% of all SNAP benefits.   That\u2019s big business.   It would be really difficult to substitute SNAP with voluntary contributions to charity.  The government forces everyone to contribute because it\u2019s good for the overall growth of the economy.  Even the 6% of fed spending that pays for the admin of the system makes it way back into the economy.  Nearly every dollar poor people receive gets spent.  The less fortunate, regardless of why they\u2019re less fortunate, are a huge part of the growth engine.   If that engine stalls, jobs will be lost and we will experience the \u201cdegrowth\u201d we so desperately need on this planet\u2026it won\u2019t be voluntary.  It will suck for the majority.  Not just the poor people.  The only way out of this is to accept the suffering even if it\u2019s your own suffering.  Humans really struggle with that.  So, no. We cannot privatize welfare. There wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep the engine running.",
