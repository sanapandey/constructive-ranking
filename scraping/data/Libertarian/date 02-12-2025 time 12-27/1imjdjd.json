Is it the same as it was 10, 20 years ago? Have your views evolved?\n\nWould love to hear different perspectives, especially from those who\u2019ve been involved in libertarian movements or have seen changes in how the philosophy is applied.\n\nHonest question, and asking outside, of the current political climate. Hopefully it would be ok asking questions more involved with the climate further in discussion but that's not the agenda of the question.\n\nIf it matters, I'm from Massachusetts, and I am rather center of the current red and blue system. I do support social democratic policies specifically in Massachusetts because I see how they effect my family, myself and my friends who are ultimately the most important thing to me.",

It should not be a sin to have some conservative views, or some liberal views or some libertarian views (on various issues: immigration, abortion, taxes, foreign policy etc)\n\nI\u2019ll add that if a government policy is moved toward a more libertarian policy that can be celebrated.\n\nFor example: a libertarian may argue for 0% income tax. But it\u2019s ok to celebrate income taxes going from 39.8% down to 37% or whatever.\n\nAnyway - that\u2019s my two cents!",

Pure capitalism would be a great way to live, but that doesn\u2019t exist in reality either.  The same goes for libertarian.  Any of these forms of government in their purest form would be great.  But humanity has to fuck them all up.  Greed, jealousy the pursuit of women.  All reasons why any government breaks.\n\nThe real question, similar to op, which government can best exist slightly modified to get the most out of humanity while minimizing our weaknesses?\n\nI think you need a blend of capitalism, libertarianism and some socialism to best govern a society.  You need a government with individual liberty and freedom where the vast majority of what you work for is yours and protected by government.  You also need a society with enough social support to keep the most despondent from becoming desperate.  Plus it\u2019s just the right moral thing to do.\n\nI believe most of those core values live in libertarian views within a mostly capitalistic state.",

Most of us agree to some extent on the limited government, some more limited than others, and that\u2019s OK! Political landscapes have really only shifted with the big 2, I feel like our party leaders have been pretty solid on their policy, within discretion, and we\u2019ve consistently gained percentage points over the last couple of elections. I don\u2019t feel like we as a party need to do anything other than be ourselves and share our thoughts and ideas with others and let them know that there are still choices. Some will say I\u2019m a little too deliberate with this approach and want to make some big push, but big pushes come with big falls, just keep plugging away and we will get there.

Two things that don't help are some of these leaders trying to pretend to be libertarians (like when Trump claimed he was a libertarian, there's also some people in this sub who are actually just conservative) and Milei, a libertarian leader, positioning himself more closely with this group.\n\nIt is true that libertarianism, if it really had to be placed in one of these current political blocks (current left and right wing) would arguably be better placed in the right, but it doesn't have to and it is really its own thing.",
