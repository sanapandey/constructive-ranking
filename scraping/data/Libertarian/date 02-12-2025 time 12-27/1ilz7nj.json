Congress doesn\u2019t decide what happens with my tax dollars anymore. The President cannot be held accountable for official actions and had removed anyone in the FBI that has investigated him. Inspector generals were fired without notice. I could go on but honestly I\u2019m very surprised at how many Liberty minded people are okay with the blurring of corporate interests and the government. This is literally the State consolidating further. A tech and communications mogul given authority over congress by an executive that ignores the courts? Courts that preemptively excused him from official actions? No one saying \u201cuhoh\u201d from the side of liberty?",

I watched a uniform, ubiquitous narrative pushed by conservative media repeat itself so many times that even more traditional media accepted the framing and the assumption that nothing was found.  What\u2019s worse, while anecdotal, basically every person I know believes it was a witch-hunt while being unable to articulate the predicate for opening the investigation in the first place and why Trump was targeted after the fact.  No one reads indictments.  No one reads special counsel reports.  No one reads inspector general reports, if they even know what an IG is.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty spooky how much of a stranglehold conservative punditry has on popular narratives, despite their rhetoric claiming to be the embattled underdogs.  People just don\u2019t seem interested in doing the work necessary to have an informed opinion.",

I\u2019m not sure how much to attribute to AG Barr preemptively publishing a statement claiming Mueller exonerated Trump or the stranglehold conservatives have on political narratives, but people just don\u2019t read anything.\n\nThe sad part is that a person hearing that George Popadopolous drunk bragging to an FFG (Australian diplomat) about Russia hacking the DNC and Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, using Wikileaks to push what\u2019s found (with a twist), before it was public was a reasonable justification to open the investigation and Trump\u2019s repeated attempts to meddle, ultimately culminating in firing Comey, was also a reasonable justification to include him.  People just aren\u2019t given the information and a citizen without the necessary information to conceptualize these issues is the goal.",
