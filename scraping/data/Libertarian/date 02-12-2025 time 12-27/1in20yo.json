If the timing is not speedy enough guess what the legislature and president could do together? That is right they could make more courts until they reach the desired speed.\n\n\nThe president is not exercising a constitutional function, the legislative branch controls the purse, that is one control congress has that it could use to prevent presidential control is to completely defund something, say the army so the president can\u2019t wage a war. The president can\u2019t redirect funding that was given to other sources to the war around the legislature. The inverse is also true, once congress applies money to a stated purpose the president can\u2019t rescind that money unilaterally. He also can\u2019t create a new department unilaterally. He also needs to use the court to further his position, when Biden attempted to pass student loan forgiveness he was challenged in the court, the court ruled against him and they fought all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe president shouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, and didn\u2019t, say they can ignore the court and forgave those loans.",

Also due to competition, private actors are much more likely to be smaller than a typical government. The government has no such constraints. They profit under the threat of violence. While a private actor can charge me a ridiculous fee, I have the option to discontinue any dealings with that business. I do not have any such discourse with the government.\n\nIf they run out of money, they tax me or print more (which is just another tax). If they bomb or invade another country in an unjust war, I can't refuse to give them money on moral grounds. Where I can boycott a private business on moral grounds, I have no choice but to give the government my money through taxation under threat of imprisonment.\n\n>Hence treaties and governments attempting to regulate such behavior on more and more occasion.\n\nTreaties mean nothing to powerful governments who have a monopoly on violence. The Molotov Ribbentrop agreement didn't stop Hitler from invading the Soviet Union. Ukraine agreeing to give up their nuclear weapons didn't stop Russia from invading them a few decades later. Regulations only restrain the smaller party who can't afford the risk of breaking them.\n\nEdit: ayo mods, yeah the dude is wrong but yall didn't need to ban him",

Hell he tried to sue top gear just because they didn't like his tesla. He frequently violates contracts and agreements he and his companies have made, such as not paying out severances to employees he has fired without cause. He regularly criticizes government contracts and subsidies while tesla and SpaceX regularly use and benefit from them.\n\nMusk cannot be trusted to be honest or to operate in good faith or respect freedom of speech, or to even follow the constitution, all of which are necessary to preserve freedom (a government that does not follow its own foundational documents is anti libertarian, as that removes the checks that prevent authoritarianism). If he cuts spending to NASA and then continues to allow government spending towards spaceX that will definitively prove that Musk is only using DOGE to just benefit himself",

It's true, but many standards existed before there was a government body enforcing them. Pressure vessels were built to a safe standard before ASME was being referenced as a way to enforce these codes. I'm a licensed engineer (we can argue about professional licensing another time), but I'm pretty familiar with how often companies develop their own internal standards and specifications that go above and beyond what is legally required. These are both in safety during construction as well as the design of equipment and facilities. So yeah, I agree with you, even without a government enforcement arm for safety or building standards, there would/could still be a private entity ensuring that buildings were built to the standard that the owner wanted. They'd essentially be the hired expert to represent the owner and verify construction is completed per previously agreed upon specs. You don't NEED the government for this. \n\nI don't think these agencies draw a big target on themselves as being huge black holes of waste and abuse, but given that every rock that's gotten overturned has shown a huge amount of waste and abuse, I'd be happy to see them all investigated/audited.",

First off, the idea that eliminating OSHA would automatically lead to a return to 'The Jungle' era is ridiculous (especially when you literally just said that the creation of it \"wasn't the watershed moment.\" Pick a lane, my guy). Workplace safety was already improving *before* OSHA, driven by technological advancements, economic incentives, and yes, even labor unions *before* they were formally legalized. The reality is that businesses have every reason to ensure safe working conditions\u2014worker retention, PR, lawsuits, insurance costs, and productivity all depend on it.\n\nYou claim that OSHA was necessary to 'continue the trajectory' of safety improvements, but this ignores that trends in workplace safety were already moving in that direction *without* federal oversight. OSHA just codified what was already happening and took credit for it, which is exactly what I originally said. Government agencies have a history of showing up late, adding bureaucracy, and then claiming they were responsible for progress.\n\nAnd your take on labor unions being the sole driver of workplace safety is an oversimplification. Plenty of industries improved working conditions on their own, either because market forces encouraged it or because industrialists saw the benefit of treating workers well. Henry Ford famously raised wages and improved conditions\u2014not because of unions, but because it was *good business*. Likewise, today\u2019s tech sector, which has some of the highest-paid workers in the world, is not heavily unionized.\n\nThe claim that removing OSHA and weakening unions would cause a regression assumes that **workers today have no power**, which is absurd. We live in an era where people can switch jobs, companies compete for skilled labor, and public awareness of workplace safety is at an all-time high. If a company created truly dangerous conditions, they'd struggle to retain workers, face lawsuits, and get destroyed by bad PR.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014your \u2018trillionaire monopolies controlling your life\u2019 narrative is just fear-mongering. The *actual* trend has been **greater worker mobility, more job options, and a wealthier working class compared to the early 20th century**. The free market has done far more to improve worker conditions than any government agency ever could.",

Do I think this will happen overnight, nope, it\u2019s a trendline, slowly overtime the trend will increase for more and more injuries at work as safety practices and equipment are changed for cheaper unsafe rules.\n\nRight I said it wasn\u2019t the watershed moment that\u2019s the NLRA, it is a continuation, like NASA is a continuation of a space race built upon earlier work from other agencies/boards in aeronautics. \n\nWe already established that no capitalists were not improving worker safety of their own accord, the NLRA and its NLRB did, then OSHA was built to continue that mission. If what you were saying is true the zenith of workers injuries would have been in the decades earlier rather than after labor rights movements which focused heavily on workers safety.\n\nYour next point that some industries improved, while the majority did not, is fallacious reasoning. Listing ford is hilarious but sure post the numbers of pre ford workplace injuries as a baseline and how ford improved workplace injuries. I\u2019m willing to look at your data if you have any.\n\nWorkers today have very little power, they can be fired for any reason, sued to prevent them speaking out or forced to leave their industry due to Non-compete clauses, and are too financially insecure to protect themselves. Oh yeah we can compete for jobs? That\u2019s your protection? How would a worker know which auto plant is the worst and which are the safest if there is no mechanism by which plants must disclose workplace injuries and they are accessible to statisticians? If OSHA is gone who complies the information to keep people informed?\n\nIt isn\u2019t fear mongering it\u2019s based on the villains of the guided age, the robber barons who created monopolies which subverted the free market and lead to market breakdowns which were corrected during the anti trust acts which broke them up and have since been hindered by Bork. \n\nThose greater changes and empowerment came after government broke up the trusts, allowed labor unions, and move to protect worker safety. There are many countries who don\u2019t have those protections and you can view their worker safety record and compare them to ours.",

Let\u2019s break this down.\n\nYou keep contradicting yourself. You said OSHA wasn\u2019t the watershed moment but then claim that eliminating it would cause a massive decline in workplace safety. If OSHA was just a continuation, then by your own logic, it wasn\u2019t the fundamental driver of safety improvements\u2014so why act like getting rid of it would send us straight back to 1910?\n\nYou completely ignore the historical trend. You claim that no capitalists were improving worker safety of their own accord, but that\u2019s just false. Workplace safety was already improving before the NLRA in 1935, and certainly before OSHA in 1971. The biggest drivers of safety improvements have been technological advancements, economic incentives, and changing cultural attitudes\u2014all of which existed before these laws.\n\nThe Ford example isn\u2019t fallacious; it\u2019s a counterexample. You demanded evidence of companies improving safety voluntarily, and Ford did exactly that. The fact that some industries lagged behind doesn\u2019t negate the fact that improvements did happen in the absence of regulation. The same thing happens in every industry\u2014some companies innovate first, and others follow when it becomes the norm.\n\nWorkers today have more power, not less. You act like workers are completely helpless, but they have more job mobility, legal recourse, and information than at any other point in history. If a company is unsafe, workers can leave, sue, expose them through social media, or take their skills elsewhere. Your argument assumes workers are clueless and unable to make decisions for themselves, which is both incorrect and condescending.\n\nYou\u2019re relying on monopolist boogeymen instead of dealing with the real argument. The fact that monopolies existed over a hundred years ago does not mean they are the inevitable default without OSHA. The economic landscape is completely different. We have more industries, more competition, more transparency, and more access to information than ever before. If you think the only thing standing between modern workers and robber baron levels of abuse is OSHA, then you fundamentally misunderstand both history and economics.\n\nOSHA isn\u2019t the only way to get safety data. You act like OSHA is the sole entity capable of tracking workplace safety, but industries themselves have massive incentives to compile and report safety records\u2014especially in a world where transparency matters for PR, hiring, and legal liability. Third-party watchdogs, independent investigations, and even journalists already track these things without government involvement.\n\nAt the end of the day, your entire argument is based on the assumption that without heavy-handed government intervention, everything will inevitably collapse into an industrial hellscape.

A government job can\u2019t exist without destroying the private sector. It\u2019s simple economics. Maybe you should read \u201ceconomics in one lesson\u201d. your Google search failed. The federal government clearly shows that fed employees with high school and undergraduate degrees (which is 80% of federal workforce) make more then private sector. That doesn\u2019t include benefits which dramatically increases the average even more. P.s. I don\u2019t support libertarian party, they are not libertarian.",

The government will send armed men to enforce them, and if I refuse to pay the fine I will inevitably end up imprisoned or dead.",
