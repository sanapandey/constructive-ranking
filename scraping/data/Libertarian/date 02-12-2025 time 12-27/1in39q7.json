That being said, libertarianism is a large umbrella and it is mainly ancaps who tend to be anti democracy as they believe the state is not really even needed as market forces act as a structure of sorts. I like ancap philosophy a lot but I consider myself more of a minarchist in practice (much like Javier Milei). So I tend to lean more toward a representative democracy like what we have in the US, despite its flaws. Because I do agree that a direct democracy can be very dangerous and allows the majority too much oppressive authority.\n\n\"Democracy is just two wolves and a sheep deciding on what to have for dinner\" Ben Franklin",

People vote according to self-interest, and representatives also act according to self-interest, which is more often than not, at odds with the self-interest of those who voted for them. Also, with term-limits and no real stake in the long-term prosperity of the nation/region that they represent, there's no incentive at all to do things that benefit the nation, the incentive is 100% to extract as much as possible from it before your term is up. This short-term, \"consequences be damned\" mentality is called \"high time preference\" behavior in economic terms, and leads to destructive tendencies and the breakdown of social fabric. Democracy is the primary reason for almost all of the social ills that you see today.",

We can keep the representative democracy that was in place prior to 1913, as it seemed to work for the most part. \n\nYou'd probably need to strengthen the judicial branch though, since there will always be disputes between states and there has to be some power that steps in to settle the disputes without war.",

If anything, I would like to see us broken much smaller than states. The smaller, the better. I want 1000 county-states. The idea of having many states is that it greatly lowers the friction of changing states, which makes governments function kinda like sellers in a market -- they're selling law to citizens. Don't like your local laws, your tax rate, whatever? I want you to have 4 different options, 20 or 30 miles, in any cardinal direction. Now imagine one of these city states get aggressive. Wouldn't be hard for the surrounding 4+ to handle them. Think Germany or Italy or Greece pre-unification. All of those city state eras became historical advancements in human society. Greece gave us the foundation of philosophy and math. Italy gave us the Renaissance. Germany gave us art, modern philosophy, modern math, Aus Econ, etc etc. They were all also almost untouchable from outside aggression.",

Sometimes the federal government wants to deny individual rights, and then states have to fight to protect individual rights. Most often, rights start at the state level, then make its way up to the federal level, but at least in that direction the federal government does step in to acknowledge those rights.\n\n(to be clear, when I say rights, I mean constitutional rights, of course, but I also mean civil rights and liberties.. Too many people think \"rights\" only pertains to constitutional rights. There are more rights than just that. The constitution, itself, acknowledges that, but so many people don't.

Why do you think we have a bill of rights? Is it not to protect certain specified and unspecified rights from being infringed upon by the will of a democratic majority?\n\nThe Bill of Rights is therefore a recognition that democracy can lead to an infringement on rights and liberties and therefore, it must be curtailed.\n\nThe two are not necessarily at odds with one another at all times but if given the opportunity do you want it decided whether you can say and speak what you wish by others? Do you want it decided by others what means you use to protect your life? Do you want it decided by others when you should be afforded a trial by jury? I merely pulled these examples to illustrate the point.\n\nBecause I think we all know that there are for example strong indications that certain speech would be made illegal if various groups or political parties had their way on the question of speech.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bill of Rights did not extend itself to the protections of economic liberty and as a result, I contend the property and thus the individual rights of people are threatened by the will of the majority which would seek to engage in plunder and redistribute property.\n\nYou already get that to a limited degree but the only restriction against that is political rather than constitutional. Do you think it is a good idea to allow that to be the only dam holding back the proverbial river?\n\nA couple of shorter articles worth reading:\n\nhttps://jimbovard.com/blog/2013/03/26/democracy-vs-liberty-2006/\n\nhttps://fee.org/articles/democracy-is-war-by-other-means/\n\nAnd of course, Hans-Hermann Hoppe\u2019s Democracy: The God that Failed\n\nAddendum: you ask for alternatives.\n\nThe libertarian movement is a broad spectrum that includes alternative ideas that include anarchism, voluntaryism, minarchism and even monarchism.

The best comparison I've ever heard is \"democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner\". But I think all libertarians believe in democracy to some degree.

It is absurd that other countries have official representation in DC through their ambassadors,  while state legislatures have no official representation. This took away one of the key pillars of our way of government. This made it so that senators had a big reason to want to curb the scope and power of the federal govt. The 17th amendment took away all incentive to do so.",
