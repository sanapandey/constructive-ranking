By executing a person, you are killing someone. \n\nBy killing someone you are a murderer. \n\nBy your logic, executions are murder and a violation of the fundamental right to life. \n\n3. This is because your logic is reductive and sucks. \n\nIf there are special circumstances where taking a life is not murder. \n\nThen there are special circumstances where taking money is not theft. \n\n4. Your logic also sucks because slavery involves more than takng someone's labor. Otherwise we would use the same words for theft as slavery. \n\nSlavery is ownership of people AND their labor, and control over their lives and decisions. \n\n5. We have words for a reason. Taxation is taxation. It sucks. It should be minimized, but for the same reason we don't call \"execution\" \"murder,\" we don't call \"taxation\" \"slavery\" or \"theft\". \n\n6. The thing that makes a government different from a criminal organization is \"legitimacy\". People believe a government should execute criminals, so it's not murder. \n\n7. Whether you think the government should be legitimately allowed to tax, it's the legitimacy that makes different from plain old street corner mugging. \n\n8. I'm perfectly fine with you saying governments shouldn't be able to legitimately tax - that's a logical position that you can take without resorting to re-defining words in torturous ways.",
