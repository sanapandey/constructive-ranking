How did you misunderstand so much about 2 sentences?\n\nSome things work great to be tried out 50 different ways or handled more locally. Some things work great to have a more universal or centralized system. Do you want to have to do all your DMV shit in DC? It's not hard to think about for a few seconds and consider different things are done certain ways for certain reasons",

You accuse me of not understanding, but you really don't get me point either.  \n  \nAs other comments have already said, \"DMV\" is just a fun way of referring to government in general, so if you are claiming that someone actually was too stupid to understand that there **is** a difference between State/Federal, your point is bad.  \n  \nSecond, my point is that the problem is the incentives of government itself, not the size or the execution. It isn't as though local governments solve these problems and federal doesn't. Vice versa isn't true, either. The root problem of the DMV is the same root problem of the Feds: the organization doesn't have a feedback mechanism that allows the satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) of customers to affect the bottom line of the organization or the decisions it makes. In a world where there isn't competition and where the funding continues via tax dollars *in spite* of people actually feel about the service, your only recourse is political action. And if you try and defund the government organization or reform it, then you just get Turd Sandwich vs. Giant Douche, who both vote exactly the same anyway.  \n  \nThird, you misunderstand why I asked about \"doing it better?\" Your comment about moving the DMV to D.C., doesn't rebut (or even represent) what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that as far as problems go, the DMV is a relatively \"small* challenge. They take something that should be simple and easy, and they make it hard. My point is: if government (and the incentive structure it relies on) is so woefully inadequate for simple problems, why would I expect a similar incentive structure to suddenly be excellent at handling, large, complex, and nuanced problems?",

The Mises Institute and Cato Institute both serve important, different purposes. The former is far more principled and libertarian with respect to the Fed, Surveillance state (FBI, CIA, etc), and take libertarianism to its logical conclusion on programs such as Social Security (abolition)\n\n\nBut the Cato Institute shows far more moderate and realistic proposals for several issues and provides a depth of knowledge often about the intricacies of government\n\n\nThe healthcare issue is a good example. The Mises Institute is (rightfully) radical with healthcare, advocating for full stop abolition of Medicare and Medicaid. But Cato will instead advocate for things like ending the tax exclusion for health insurance, CON laws, and the non-voucher structure of Medicare. Catos proposals would fix most of the healthcare issue in a way that more Americans would agree with\n\n\nThat's important because someone has to introduce people to libertarianism. People are more likely to initially to subscribe to Cato type libertarianism before the minarchist/anarchist style of the Mises Institute.\n\n\nMost Cato affiliated authors I've seen have been against vaccine mandates and are certainly not neocons, opposing pretty much all foreign intervention.",

We are past the point of small tweaks doing anything significant.\n\n\\> People are more likely to initially to subscribe to Cato type libertarianism before the minarchist/anarchist style of the Mises Institute.\n\nNo. There was no gradual establishment path to libertarianism in Argentina, was there?

While abolition would be great, I have no issue with such reforms\n\n\nArgentina is still moderate in its reforms. Milei has not abolished the central bank, public schools still exist, and millions of Argentines have not lost their socialized healthcare. It is impossible to do such things legislatively, hence Milei has only done things like removing price caps and removing excessive welfare plans\n\n\nAlso, he has done this while expanding the money supply 123% (M3) and the national debt by $72 billion. When working with leftists, you only have so much control.\n\n\nhttps://x.com/saifedean/status/1877717156420341885\n\n\nThe point is most people are not libertarians. 50% are leftists and 50% are also leftists who just love police breaking the 4th amendment. The idea of removing occupational licensing laws is radical to them, let alone the abolition of 95% of government\n\n\nIt is more realistic to abolish/reform 80% of government like Cato advocates for, instead of the abolition of 100% like Mises does.\u00a0",
