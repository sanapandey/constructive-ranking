    "selftext": "As per the title.  I've been angering a few of you here it seems with my questions and opinions - apologies - but I was wondering if this is because I - an atheist - have to rationalize my moral convictions differently to some of you, who seem satisfied with having acquired libertarian natural rights at birth from a deity or other higher power you believe in.  I am not satisfied with such a statement for where my moral convictions come from, why I have them, because of my nature, of how I tick.  Which is why I ask all those 'silly' questions repeatedly.\n\nSo.. any atheists around who have a thought to share?  Or anyone else who likes?\n\n*In my world - for libertarian moral convictions to prevail - they need to compete with all the other possible moral convictions that you can possibly think of and then be superior.  There is no authority that decides.. there is only competition.  I'm asking how that competition works, by what (natural) \"rules\".*  \n*The theists among you do not have this question / problem apparently, which is why in a lot of the interactions we seem to talk past each other.. IMHO.*\n\n*Cheers, Joan*",

The answer I found for myself is - via (violent) competition - just by how 'nature does things'.  This means a lot of the moral convictions I (might) have will not turn into rights, as I will not be able to successfully exercise them.  I can only exercise rights that are compatible with the moral convictions of the people around me as my freedom ends where theirs starts.\n\nWhich means, libertarian natural rights are not really rights, but moral convictions only.  \nThis then leads to the question - how atheist libertarians acquire those rights rationally.\n\nI don't believe in those rights per se.  I observe nature and expect some of those morals to prevail as rights, but that is it.",

For example, a medical code of ethics that medical professionals must follow.\"*\n* ***\"Morals*** *\u2013 Principles or habits relating to right or wrong conduct, based on an individual\u2019s own compass of right and wrong.\"*\n\n(src: [https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/news/ethics-versus-morals/](https://www.oxfordcollege.ac/news/ethics-versus-morals/) )\n\nThis means morals are personal and can be ANYTHING and especially compared among two people they can have OPPOSING morals.

In the case of the US it's 1:600k, for GER it's 1:100k, EU is 1:600k again.  This creates a goal conflict, based on the evolutionary drive of individuals to get ahead of the pack (introducing/sustaining inequality by lawmakers), while the goal of society would need to be that everyone is treated equally (for society to keep existing). If it takes decades or even centuries for the fallout to manifest within the population while the feedback loop will contain that the benefactors of such rules will have the means and power (and incentives) to influence the selection of the lawmakers..  it's a wonder it works for as long as it does tbh.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_legislatures\\_by\\_number\\_of\\_members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_number_of_members)\n\nFor Pitcain Islands the ratio seems to be 1:5, the lowest overall.

A tribe that has stories about how socially damaging behavior is disciplined by some omnipotent authority will most likely work better together compared to a tribe that doesn't have this..  that's how I explain why religion exists and prevailed.

You'd get as close to liberty based on the common wants as possible IMHO, while retaining maximum efficiency that specialization brings..*\n\n*And no, I can't see how competing frameworks solve this - humans tried that IMHO - kingdoms in Antiquity for example..  they all 'joined or got joined' one way or another.*\n\n*PS: sorry for the long reply.. but what exists exists because of the (social) evolutionary process that is there, always active.

However, this cannot mean that you acquired the right to be born posteriori, only apriori. This is because if there were no laws that allowed you to be born, you would not be born. Now, even from an atheist position, it is clear that objective phenomena occur, whether one has the capacity to understand and accept their metaphysical source or not.\n\nFinally, acquiring morality from nature is impossible. What we have as humans isn't morality, but conviction. We only have one perspective. So, what you are asking is not possible as a finite (subjective) being, no matter if you are an atheist or a theist (or anything else).",

Evolutionary this starts with natural religion over polytheism and ends in monotheism (so far).  \nThe same function can be provided by a political system.  \nThe crux with either system is that individual beings (for the sake of species adaptability and survival) compete with each other and that either framework - which is about the rules that 'govern the whole' - can be controlled by a few who might put their own good ahead of the rest, dooming the whole.",
