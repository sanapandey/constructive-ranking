    "selftext": "Hey y'all,\n\nWith all this hoopla over USAID being audited, I've become very curious as to what the US taxpayers have been funding, and where that money is going. With all these budget minded Libertarians in here, I was looking for some help in my investigations\n\nI wanted to compile a list of these funding projects along with credible sources as to where that money has gone. For example, if $1.2 billion went to Haiti, I want to know how much was misused in salaries and bonuses, marketing etc.\n\nWhile I've been real inspired by user [Illustrious-Mud-7996](https://old.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Mud-7996) and his app, I'm probably not going to create such a feature (*for now*). For those who haven't yet, please check out his cool app: [suchtaxesmuchwaste](https://suchtaxesmuchwaste.com)\n\nWhere should I start? Apologies if this is a dumb question, but this is the first real government action/scandal that fascinated me enough to learn. Should I start at some government funding website and follow the threads there? Or maybe a nonprofit/NGO site?\n\nMy final goal would be a blog form page of all the different catastrophic projects that have sucked the money from taxpayers, and how those dollars were distributed and used (or as best I can)\n\nCheers!",

If you aren\u2019t familiar with interpreting data sets it will be helpful to take some online classes on it.\n\nEdited to add: definitely not a dumb question and it\u2019s exciting to see more people interested in breaking all of this down. So many people have never looked at this stuff.",
