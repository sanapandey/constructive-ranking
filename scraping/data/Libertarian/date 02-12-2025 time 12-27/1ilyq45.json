When College coaches began recruiting from black schools in the south it changed sports forever. Today sports scouts still recruit from the poorest neighborhoods and even from abroad (like rugby players being recruited for the NFL). \n\nGreat example of DEI improving organizations for the better.",

The first put a diversity score on every department and would strongly discourage hires of white men if that department score was too low.  (interestingly enough Indians didn't count as diversity.  Sorry IT all those Indian dudes don't count)  White women were fine as they counted as diversity.  HR had a 100% diversity score because they were almost all women even though they were the least actual diverse department in the entire org.  IT's score was below target mostly because of all the Indians.  This implementation of DEI is complete horse shit.  This slowed promotions for white men, slowed hiring for white men, and encouraged RIF's of white men.  This is 100% racism.\n\nThe second company makes you go to training but has no formal DEI team or department, not hiring targets, no quotas, no bullshit.  This is how it should be implemented.  Educate people on biases and treat them like adults and let them do their jobs.",

If implemented correctly, it can be a good thing that helps everyone have a fair chance and a better work experience - for example, one goal of DEI at the company I work at is making sure that when new company policies are considered, that they have processes in place to recognize and consider the impact on minority groups. It doesn't mean they tailor everything to minorities, but they don't just get ignored.  \n  \nIf implemented incorrectly, it can range anywhere from a waste of resources (which if it's a private company is 100% their choice, in a government agency is a waste of taxpayer money) or go the direction of discriminatory, which can be actively harmful. But a lot of the uproar right now is coming from people that think all DEI is only about hiring quotas.",

Consider your resources and timeframes when setting targets\n\nRelevant: Ensure your goals align with your overall DEI strategy and business objectives\nTime-bound: Set a specific timeframe for achieving your goals\u201d\n\nEncouraging the setting of these goals on top of the tax incentives creates, not only the temptation to engage in reverse discrimination but also gives those against DEI legitimate grounds to argue discrimination. \n\nThe goals framework were found on the click-up management website.",

To someone who understands what it is, and is unaware of the misconceptions, being anti-DEI certainly sounds very racist.\n\nThat's because most DEI policies are mostly pretty common sense stuff. Make sure recruiting efforts make an attempt to reach out to populations that don't normally apply for the role, make sure interviews are designed to focus on job qualifications and that any \"culture-fit\" elements aren't ones which put a given race or gender at an unfair advantage/disadvantage. But ultimately, landing the job still requires meeting the same standards no matter who you are. It's just about making sure those standards are fair. \n\nOne example I heard from an HR specialist was that there was a hiring manager who would ask candidates about their weekends, especially asking them what they do on Sundays. It turns out that he was trying to find out whether they went to church because he had the belief that people who are religious are less likely to be fully committed to the job since they have something more important in their life. HR ended up making a rule against asking questions that could be used to indirectly gauge whether someone is religious, as it doesn't actually have anything to do with the job itself \u2013 that's an example of a DEI policy. \n\nA lot of anti-DEI folks seem to think there are strict quotas involved, but those are largely unheard of and actually go AGAINST good DEI practices (example:If a company set a quota of 30% minority races and 70% white, then as soon as they go above that 30% threshold, qualified minority candidates would suddenly be at a disadvantage, even if this just happens to be a niche where qualified minority candidates are more common)\n\nBut to anyone else, Anti-DEI sounds like it means pro-discrimination.",

Hell, in my last roll, I would give given headcount and specifically told I could *only* use it for a DEI candidate.

Business rarely continue programs that don't show any type of \"ROI\" or progress.

C-Suites have to show something that validates why they are putting so much effort into DEI. \n\nDEI programs, will almost always, overtime evolve to have quotas.  Also, to be fair.  Initially, I thought the way my company targeted DEI roles was completely fair. They were jr level training roles and the talk track was \"if we have to train these folks anyhow, let's focus on DEI for these areas\"   Which honestly, worked well enough and didn't have too much impact on the overall business.  However, when leadership level DEI quotas starting getting rolled out... that's where the problem started as folks were thrust into roles that they just were not ready for in order for the upper level folks to hit their DEI targets.  It also started to hit morale in spots as it was pretty obvious when these folks would get the roles that they weren't qualified and a \"driving\" reason they were selected was for a DEI tick box.  The most frustrating part about this, was that they were setting folks up for failure, that 100% had the ability to eventually succeed in the role but because of the accelerated promotion track to hit targets, they would flame out early and have a terrible experience (because, they also knew deep down, that they weren't ready).",

DEI programs were created because that was not the case, many places tend to hire predominantly people who look like them and come from a similar background.\n\nThis is not usually due to overt racism, it's mostly unconscious biases and our natural instinct to lean towards a tribal mindset. And this doesn't just apply to \"not hiring brown people\", it affects anyone from outside the country, especially if you have an accent. It can be people from the south being less likely to be hired at a northern company and vice versa. We know that without some sort of guidelines for diversity, companies tend to end up with a workforce that looks mostly the same.\n\nWhat this does in a practical sense is avoid conflict. People are scared of conflict in the workplace, they don't want people shaking things up. If everyone you hire thinks like you and has a history like yours, you're less likely to have anyone strongly disagree. From another perspective, you're less likely to get the ideas and perspective that you're incapable of getting simply because you come from a different culture in some way. Many of my MBA classes talked about the importance of conflict in generating new ideas and creating an efficient workspace without an echo-chamber, diversity brings conflict which can be very productive for a business.\n\nEquity is quite literally making sure the right person gets hired for the job based on merit and what they can bring to the company. If two people are exactly qualified and one has a background that the company lacks in, it's a smart idea to choose that person, however the opposite usually happens. Even worse so, you often see underqualified individuals getting the position over more qualified ones because people opt for comfort by default.  \n  \n Inclusion is simply making everyone feel welcome and a part of the team regardless of their background, culture, race, etc. and teaching everyone that we should celebrate our differences and get along despite them. Being exposed to different ideas and mindsets is beneficial, even if you don't recognize it in the moment.\n\n[How Investing in DEI Helps Companies Become More Adaptable](https://hbr.org/2023/05/how-investing-in-dei-helps-companies-become-more-adaptable)",

Its not really an either/or, but more of a gradient. Tech companies, at least while they are growing, tend to hire for skill and ability, not looking a certain color, so they are really the merit part of the economy, but there is probably room for a second Disney, since the first one is going off a creative cliff so dramatically on this particular issue, see the Acolyte and the Snow White live action, for examples of strange story choices based on diversity and not quality.

It's easily seen in stats on poverty, incarceration etc.\n\nThere is a super subtle misunderstanding about statistics that is deliberately exploited here by people tying to convince you how unfair things are.\n\nStatistics can describe a lot of things, but lets look at rolling 2 dice. Over an infinite or even large number of rolls, there is a 16-2/3% chance you will roll sevens. \n\nHere's another one, if you fly, your chances of dying in an aviation disaster are 1 in 100,000,000 or some sufficiently huge number that we really don't give it much thought until there's an airplane crash. Then we are concerned for a week or two while it's on the news. So that's like 0.000000001% chance of dying. (if I counted my zeros right)\n\nThen comes along 37% of green people are poor and 17% of magenta people are in prison.\n\nAnd you think, it must be true because it's statistics.\n\nBut here's the thing, the dice have NO CHOICE in coming up 1s and 6s or 2s and 5s, it just happens.\n\nYou have choice whether to fly or not, but once you're on the plane, you have no control over the situation, you trust the pilots and mechanics and ATC people to get you where you're wanting to go. This is different than your chances of having an accident driving your car, you can drive safely and have a much lower chance of being in an accident than the person who drives like bat out of hell. But, there is always the chance you can be in an accident that is unavoidable on your part, so no matter how safe you are, your chances are not zero. You have significant, but not absolute control over this.\n\nBut the difference with that 3rd statistic is that it represents absolute personal choices, especially for crime. These are things that people HAVE control over. They can pay attention in school or not. They can stand outside that convenience store and decide to walk away, or go in and rob the store at gunpoint.\n\nAn individual magenta person can decide she's not going to commit a crime. An individual green person can decide not to spend their paycheck on gambling away their paycheck on FanDuel.\n\nSome will argue that some people are born poor. But for everyone that is born poor and stays poor, you can point to a brother, sister or next door neighbor that ends up successful with a business or profession.",

A die that comes up with 1's twice as often as 6's after a thousand trials *could* still be random chance but also begins, but increasingly appears to be evidence of a rigged die, even if there are some 6's",

Everyone loves to point to the textbook definition of \u201cexclusion/judgement based on race.\u201d However, somewhere along the line, racism in America has evolved into \u201cAmerican systems and institutions are inherently racist due to who/how we developed as a nation.

There's been threats of separation over this.\n\nShe sounds fanatical.  Parts of DEI are helpful but the most overlooked issues with imbalanced or inequitable hiring is due to nepotism/cronyism.  Parts of DEI are racist as they discriminate based on identity rather than on merit.  You'll find highly achieving people don't want to be handed things or be part of a system where it can be assumed they've been handed things.  That is part of the failure of DEI.\n\nThe primary issue with racism is racists exists.  The less of them there are in the world, the road to equality will become better.  Now everyone with a slightly right leaning opinion is classified as a racist so you're getting much further from that reality rather than closer to it.",

Diversity: in the broadest sense diversity can definitely be good in certain situations but merit and skill needs to be at the forefront. Hiring somebody based on their skin color or their culture when it has nothing to do with the work that needs to be done and they don't meet the minimum standards you are actively being prejudiced as well as hurting your own goals. \n\nE. Equity: I have a lot of issues with equity. Equality of opportunities and the end result of what you will see from individuals of your workforce is a lot more positive for your end goal then if you were to go the route of equity. I've seen this far too many times but equity given to those who have not earned it Will not motivate them to work harder. By the way most of times I've witnessed this happen is in a group of people who all were the same race and relative background. So you can't just say I'm racist. (I've been accused of that too many times by people who assume the experiences I've had so I need to preamble that)\n\nI. Inclusion: Again Merit and skill needs to come first. If Merit and skill are there however that person is not being included, your productivity/motivation out of that individual is likely going to go down. However if you are solely looking for inclusion You're not going to get the best outcome. \n\nI think DEI is too preferential to certain groups and races over others thus causing it to be racist. (which is ironic.) And I mean racist by the very definition. I get the idea of the initial direction however they fucked up extra early and just stayed on that fucked up path. I think it literally stems from the idea of \"fake it to you make it\" but I think that's a dumb idea in the first place.\n\nMaybe chop it up to get rid of the E and only use it in organizations that strictly deal with social communities consisting of multiple cultures races and backgrounds. Past that it's trash.",

But equity, as DEI preaches it, is a short, slippery slope to some form a radical egalitarianism through authoritarianism because they demand equal outcomes not equal opportunity because they often misunderstand the idea of opportunity. To them, everyone with a hammer and saw can build a house. It's as if someone can't build a house because they don't have the tools to do it so if you provide them with the tools, at the expense of others, then they have an equal opportunity. But when the house isn't built they then say that the tools include the training, so now there's a whole department set on training these individuals, at the expense of others. Now this all costs money and since we don't want to waste peoples money, we demand these departments survive on as little funding as possible, so they turn out sub-par trainees and then they say well it's because the department was underfunded so we give it more money and more money and more money, all at the expense of others.
