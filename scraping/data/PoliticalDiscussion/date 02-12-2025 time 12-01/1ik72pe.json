Ik some things are confidential for security but there should be a way to see where all of our tax dollars go\n\n\nThis is all hypothetical but as technology gets better and as more people are more technologically inclined. This only makes sense to bring back the power to the people. As government officials are becoming less trustworthy",

If you can't articulate even for 5 seconds on why someone or some policy does or doesn't deserve a vote then you shouldn't vote on that matter. \n\nAnd I'm not saying that to be exclusionary, I'm saying that to tell you to stop listening to what your friend or family member or favorite political pundit says and just voting the way they tell you to vote. Do some research and figure it out. That's not to say you can't or shouldn't ask those above mentioned people their opinion, but if all you can say for why you voted for someone is \"well at least it's not the other person\" then you flat out shouldn't vote. \n\nDirect democracy will never have long term success for any country that tries to run on it.

Then abruptly: silence. (Fascinating, right?) \n\nPerhaps a compromise could be a kind of direct democracy where only those directly affected by a law can vote (fishermen vote on fish tarriffs, teachers vote on school curriculums etc) - or perhaps greater value placed on their votes adding up to 50% or 51% weighting.\nPerhaps mandatory direct voting for the relevant groups but optional for everyone else. Lots of possibilities are out there. \n\nAs an aside: There is a compromise between representatives and direct democracy called ***participatory democracy*** that was fairly popular among student activists in the mid-20th century (think: Vietnam war, civil rights etc protestors).

I thought of a compromise; effectively, some sort of government ran \u201csocial media\u201d platform that allows the general public to make petitions that everyone else in their jurisdiction could vote on, and a mechanism for the elected representative to poll their constituents on certain topics.\u00a0\n\nThis has several benefits:\n1) limits the required knowledge of members of the general public by maintaining a \u201csober second thought\u201d in the form of an elected representative (which also, at least in the context of the Canadian system, eliminates the need for a senate)\n2) allows the public to have their voices heard and debate political topics\n3) helps hold elected representatives responsible to their constituents (90% of your constituents were in favour of X and yet you voted against it) rather than allowing the elected represented to misrepresent the will of their constituents",

Flux originated in and was most active in Australia, but also had groups existing in the United States[3] and Brazil.[4]\n\nIBDD is similar to liquid democracy, though there are differences. In IBDD, voters would still have the right to vote directly on every issue or delegate their vote to someone else, but unlike in liquid democracy, voters can choose to forgo votes on one issue to use on another issue. This creates opportunity cost between issues and allows voters to specialise their votes on the issues that are more important to them.[5] This specialisation of votes aims to allow citizens to participate effectively in issue-based direct democracy without having to focus on every issue as they would in a regular direct democracy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(political_party)",
