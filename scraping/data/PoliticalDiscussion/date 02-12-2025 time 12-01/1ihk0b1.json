    "selftext": "First thing's first- I'm far from an economist, so the entire tariff discussion is out of my wheelhouse. But from my understanding, [a \"tariff\" is a tax on imports](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-tariffs-trump-canada-mexico-what-to-know/#:~:text=At%20the%20simplest,focused%20think%20tank) that's paid for by the buyer (like Walmart) when imported into the US. By that logic, [tariffs increase the price of goods](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-tariffs-work-rcna190336#:~:text=President%20Donald%20Trump,of%20higher%20prices) and buyers *usually* pass that price increase onto the consumer? This entire topic raises a lot of unknowns, [rising inflation](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/03/wall-street-economists-react-trumps-tariffs-to-raise-inflation-and-lower-economic-growth.html) being one of them. \n\nWith that context I'm curious about the retaliatory tariffs. [Canada](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-01/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china), [Mexico](https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/mexico-president-orders-retaliatory-tariffs-on-us-blasts-us-suggestion-of-criminal-alliances-in-her/article_7f34e80a-e109-11ef-9e61-4fb88313156b.html), and [China](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jgk4760y9o) have all announced retaliatory tariffs on US goods. If my understanding of tariffs is correct (from my admittedly biased sources), this impacts foreign consumers more than the US exporters? \n\nWhat do these countries stand to gain by imposing tariffs on US goods? And how does it affect the US?",

            "body": "Economist here.\n\nTo understand the impact of tariffs and who pays them, you need to understand two key concepts: elastic and inelastic demand. If demand is elastic, consumers are price sensitive, and producers (in this case the producing country) has to decrease their prices in response to the tariff in order not to lose costumers. In this case, the country hit by the tariff loses and pays for the tariffs through lowering their prices. Demand can also be inelastic, with consumers wanting to buy a good for almost any price. In this case, producers (the producing country) doesn't have to lower their prices, so consumers pay the tariff.\n\nThis logic works for supply as well. And overall, the country who pays most of the tarriff is the country that is the least price-sensitive, ie. the country that is the least \"picky\". The country that is most \"picky\", ie. the most price-sensitive, pays the least.\n\nLets say that the US imposes a tariff on country Mexico. Lets say, for arguments sake, that Mexico is the only country in the world that can make good X, and US consumers really want to buy good X. Lets also say Mexico can sell this good to the rest of the world. Then the result of the tariff is the following: Mexico is indifferent between selling to the US and Canada, so they want the same after-tariff tax price. US consumers really need the good. So US consumers must pay the whole tariff through higher prices.\n\nLets then say Mexico has another product, product Y, which is also produced in an equally effective factory in Michigan. US consumers are indifferent between buying from Mexico and Michigan, so they want the same after-tax price. In this case, Mexico needs to lower their prices, and thus pays the tariff.\n\nSo to answer your question: retaliatory taxes, such as those from the EU, are designed to specifically hit goods where EU citizens have very elastic demand, ie. where the US producers end up paying the tariff, while avoiding goods where europeans have inelastic demand. So they are designed to hurt the US economy and businesses as much as possible, while inflicting the least amount of damage to EU consumers.\n\nTariffs are, in general, bad for everyone (in general is key here - it might make sense to tariff sometimes to protect infant industries or to make sure vital infrastructure production stays in the country). In this sense, it is like war. They hurt everyone. The question is, who gets hurt the most, and who gives up first.",

                            "body": "That depends on the particular market you are analyzing. But if we assume that there is limited supply in the short run, and increased short-run demand due to the threat of future tarriffs, then you are absolutely right that prices could increase before the tariff is implemented, due to a shortage caused by the temporary increase in demand.\n\nHowever, I would imagine this specific effect to be short-term only. If the tariff never comes, it will fizzle out (in the medium run, prices might even be temporarily lower than before, due to a reduction in demand after people bought in bulk). In the long run, we would be back to equillibrium. And if the tariff is implemented as planned, then it would likely not hit as hard in the medium run (again, due to a temporary decrease in the demand from the bulk buying), but would then slowly converge to the new equillibrium in the long run.\n\nSo a realistic scenario is that anticipatory effects will have an inflationary effect in the short run, perhaps a deflationary \"re-bound\" effect in the medium run, and no effect in the long run.\n\nBut as a mentioned: every market is unique. The above analysis is likely to occur with certain assumptions, but the real world is always complex.",

                            "body": "If we impose a tariff it hurts their producers and our consumers. The price of the foreign product goes up in the US so it encourages the US customers to buy US made products. That\u2019s good for US producers and workers because the US companies can sell more of their products at higher profits and hire US workers to make the products. It\u2019s bad for US customers because they pay more for the products. The thing is that the US consumers are also US workers so it helps us in some ways and hurts in others. \n\nWhen a foreign country imposes a tariff on us it\u2019s the opposite. It hurts our producers and their consumers, but is good for their businesses and workers if they can produce the product themselves. \n\nThe thing about the tariffs is they make the whole world less efficient. A government is artificially propping up a class of business that can\u2019t compete on its own merits. What Trump is been saying, not without some truth, is that China has be artificially supporting their businesses to the point where nobody else can compete and eventually China controls all the production in some industries and it causes US businesses to shut down and puts a lot of US workers (and Trump supporters) out of work. \n\nBut the way Trump is going about the whole thing makes no sense, except as a threat to extract some concession. Imposing a 25% blanket tariff on Canada for example, would only help our businesses and workers if there are US companies ready to jump in and replace the products that the Canadians have been selling. If there aren\u2019t any all we do is drive up the price of the products for US consumers and harm Canadian businesses but we aren\u2019t actually helping any US businesses and workers.\n\nProtectionist tariffs are supposed to target particular industries that the country is in the process of growing or established industries the country is tying to protect. For example China is making an EV that costs $10,000. If they flood the US market it would put US automakers out of business, so Biden set up a protectionist tariff on Chinese EV imports. Trump thrashing around putting high tariffs on everything will just raise prices here and cause recessions in the target countries. We\u2019ll all pay more and other countries will hate us for wreaking their economies.",

Maybe it\u2019ll take years to increase production to replace the Canadian products. Then maybe people here just buy less of the product because it\u2019s too expensive. We cause a recession in Canada, Americans pay more for stuff or do without and the only people who benefit are the shareholders for the companies that can raise prices for no effort.\n\nThe administration has to be smart and careful on how they do this stuff.

            "body": "There's a LOT of bad analysis on tariffs of the type you're highlighting - our tariffs are bad for us, and their tariffs? Also bad for us! The real answer is that they're bad for different groups of people.\n\nUS tariffs on Canadian goods are bad for the US consumer (which would like to buy certain Canadian goods but now has to spend more, or pick some other alternative). But they're also bad for Canadian firms, which may find their goods to have trouble competing in the US market at the higher price point. The effect on the consumers will be diffuse (how much of the increase is due to the tariff, especially on goods that were already inflating in price?) But the effect on the firms will be heavy and particularized. If your factory is making widgets for export to the US, and there's a tariff on those widgets, your business is going to be in bad shape.\n\nLikewise, Canadian tariffs on US goods are bad for the Canadian consumer, and bad for US exporters, by the same logic.\n\nThe idea is that the affect on your consumers won't ding you politically for a while, but the other side's firms will scream bloody murder right away. Take Colombia - the threat of a heavy tariff on their exports was enough to get them to make a (quite minor) concession on repatriation of their citizens essentially immediately. The firms that would be hurt by the tariff represent a powerful and motivated interest group that will push for action right away on whatever might get the tariff removed.\n\nBeyond that, international politics is absolutely a tit-for-tat environment; \"you do thing I don't like, I do thing you don't like\" is the order of the day. Under more ordinary circumstances, it's an incentive for everyone to keep playing ball. These are, alas, not ordinary circumstances, and Trump has little patience for traditional diplomacy.",

The tariff makes the foreign product more expensive, which makes the local product cheaper and more attractive to buy. \n\nBut US corporations have moved nearly ALL manufacturing overseas, so there is NO DOMESTIC VERSION available for most products we buy (eg. smartphones), therefore tariffs on foreign products do not encourage us to buy domestic products because THERE ARE NONE...so instead it just raises the cost of most goods for consumers.\n\nKnowing this, WHY are tariffs being pushed as a solution?    BECAUSE IT IS ANOTHER WAY TO GENERATE TAX REVENUE FROM CONSUMERS WHILE LOWERING CORPORATE TAXES.\n\nTaxes are necessary, the government needs money to run... So if corporations and the rich pay less, the money needs to come from somewhere, preferably from consumers (aka \"the poors\").\n\nThe push for tariffs is simply a way to offload the tax burden from the rich onto the middle class and poor consumers.",
