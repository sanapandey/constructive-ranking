    "selftext": "Last year, Canada agreed to purchase $14B of  US F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, with acquisition of 88 jets from 2026 to 2034. \n\nOne aspect of this question is the tariffs and apparent trade war; Canada had previously been evaluating the SAAB Gripen as well, so there is an industry-respected alternative.\n\nAnother aspect of this is reliability in the event of actual conflict between the two nations, which previously seemed impossible to contemplate. This calls to mind the intelligence information that France provides the UK during the Falklands War on means to defeat the Exocet anti-ship missile that France had previously sold to Argentina, and also that France had a kill switch that they reportedly did not share with UK. \n\nDoes Canada want to buy $14B of national defense technology from a nation that is an unreliable partner at best, with whom you now have a trade war, has made statements that intimate future aggression, and who could disable the technology in a conflict?\n\n\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2020/07/31/these-three-companies-submitted-bids-for-canadas-fighter-competition/\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2023/01/10/americas/canada-f-35-fighter-purchase-intl-hnk-ml/index.html",

It's a swiss army knife of a plane, and a pretty good one at that, with a couple revisions. It's popular in at least some part because it's the engineering equivalent of a shrug. It does everything pretty well, but excels at nothing but outclassing older aircraft.\n\nWhich is reasonable, considering that the idea of setting up drone swarms in grids as low altitude anti-aircraft traps could be orders of magnitude cheaper than a surface to air missile, or the plane it destroys. Pivoting in a rapidly changing environment is at least in theory easier when your tools are more flexible.",

We don't need to acquire a system that can be potentially tampered with in order to render our air defense systems inoperative.    \n  \n\"the US military does have the capability to effectively disable F-35s sold to foreign partners through complex software and logistical controls, which is often referred to as a \"kill switch\" due to its ability to render the aircraft non-functional; however, the *exact details of this system are classified and not publicly disclosed*.\"\n\nCanada's self-defense, not just from foreign hostile entities, but former friendly neighbours turned hostile enemies (you can rank the US in that category) comes first.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is naive.  Sweden's Gripen is the next best choice and immune to US Defense Department tampering.",

Soft power is part of the equation and Trump wants nothing to do with it. So is trade, and trust. It\u2019s literally proven by game theory that one of the rules of the great game in all simulations played is \u201cbe nice\u201d. Trump is not nice. And America will suffer along with the world for his supporters ignorance. You would have to be an idiot to not see the many reasons Canada would not want to join Trump\u2019s America.\n\nAmerica was born on easy mode because it has arable land, interconnected waterways and distance between enemies than any other country on Earth. Your ignorance has nothing to do with that and annexed territory would not help that.\n\nSo no, internet stranger. Canada does not want to join the US.",
