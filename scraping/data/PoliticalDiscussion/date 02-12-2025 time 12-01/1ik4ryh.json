    "selftext": "Over the past few weeks, Elon Musk and his team at the **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)** have taken actions that some argue resemble historical authoritarian power grabs. Reports indicate that Musk\u2019s team has **gained access to Treasury payment systems** and has begun dismantling agencies like **USAID without congressional approval**. The ability of a private citizen to consolidate power in this way raises serious concerns about **democratic oversight, separation of powers, and national security risks**.\n\nHistorically, authoritarian figures have used legal mechanisms to **sidestep traditional checks and balances**, and critics argue that we\u2019re seeing a similar pattern here. However, others believe that **government agencies have become bloated and inefficient**, and Musk\u2019s involvement may be necessary to \u201cstreamline\u201d operations.\n\nHow do you see this situation playing out? **Is Musk\u2019s role a dangerous overreach, or is it a justified move toward government efficiency?** What safeguards should be in place to prevent **unelected individuals from gaining unchecked control over government operations?**\n\n(For those interested in a deeper dive, I recently wrote an article on this topic: [\\[Medium Link\\]](https://medium.com/@TrendsToday/musk-trump-and-the-consolidation-of-government-a-historical-parallel-to-authoritarianism-437da316dc1f))",

Which is a nice ideal, but it can't confront the hellscape of our current politics. You bring an out of control dog to heel by dominating it, not by trying to find common ground.",

It should take *ages* for Trump's confirmations to go through. \n\nThis is important because time is important. The courts can only act so fast and communications need time to build outrage.

My point is big orgs have waste. It's not unique to the government. \n\n> I'm sure we haven't even uncovered the bulk of wasteful spending in the big agencies yet but I welcome it.\n\nSame here. I have 0 faith trump and musk want to do this too. Sure, they say they want to. But the only reason they are going after USAID is because they were investigating starlink in Ukraine. Same is true with the FAA.\n\n> Congress will never do that fast enough, they are hindered by hundreds of legislative opinions and bureaucracy, they are the reason we are here.\n\nOk, you're not wrong. But there's stuff you can do within Congress to fix this. Why hasn't Trump pushed to get rid of the filibuster? It's like trump is saying we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas so let's just ignore the laws and constitution.\n\nIf Trump was serious about rooting out waste, he'd go after the heavy hitters first like DoD. But, he's going after programs that he and musk have personal issues with. It has nothing to do with waste. \n\nWhat are you going to do when Trump or musk have a vendetta against something you care about?\n\n> If people really want to save democracy we gotta get this done. If Trump was really a threat to democracy he would have dismantled the USAID instead of restructuring it.\n\nTo save democracy we have to destroy it?? I don't see how breaking the law to root out waste helps save democracy. I should take trump at his word that they're getting rid of waste without evidence? He's restructuring it to the point of dismantling it.\n\nTrump is a threat to democracy because he IS trying to destroy them. He's just not going to do it right away.",

You understand that by being appointed the first friend, he has avoided all vetting by congress. This again is problematic. The president cannot just grant someone this authority. \n\n>Who else do you think determines this? The bureaucracy is not a co-equal branch of government, it's under the Executive.\n\nCongress determines this. \n\n\n>Same as if any Executive Branch employee did the same.\n\nIs he an employee of the executive branch? what's his title? Did he go thru the vetting process as a staffer? \n\n>He can be prosecuted.\n\nHe can be? Or he will be? Who is going to prosecute him? Who is even going to know until it's too late.\n\n>It depends on what Trump told him to do. If Trump said \"go do something illegal,\" then he's liable.

The slush fund of USAID has been a very long arm for big government to be a bad actor in foreign governments - without proper oversight or transparency.  The fact that these programs have been brought to light - and the visceral response of the democrats - should open all of our eyes!  These politicians treat the common people as sheep, and setup schemes to price gouge the government and pocket the difference\u2026on the backs of tax payers \u2026.\n\nTo anyone who doesn\u2019t see this, then you\u2019re still believing the narrative that the mainstream media has been spoon feeding us the last decade \u2026\n\nFear of losing these programs ?

Less taxpayer money leaving the US \n2.  Less meddling in other countries affairs in subtle ways\u2026which should give us more respect and also more authenticity \n\nOverall, in my opinion, this cleanup is really aimed at removing all the programs that have been draining financial resources and not promoting the health of Americans lives and business climate.\n\nThis is from someone who voted democrat their whole life and has lived in Europe for 20+ years \u2026",

State Bodies, Local Boards, etc. The Federal Government, as we know, has two major bodies we can elect: the Legislature, and the Executive. The House of Representatives and the Senate, and the Presidency. To make this work, we also have checks to power and coequal power between our branches of Government: this means that, no matter who is elected to the Presidency, they\u2019re checked by the House and Senate; and vice versa. We do this by putting in a separation of powers, where the Legislature (as an example) decides what money is spent on, while the executive manages the day to day. I describe it as: the Legislation does Law, the Executive executes the law.\n\nHowever, Elon Musk\u2019s informal and illegal powers (he was not confirmed by the senate, wasn\u2019t hired by the department he says he is a part of) threatens this separation of powers. Congress cannot, legally, give up those powers. That Elon (and by extension, Trump) are ignoring the powers of the Legislature, is a threat to the separation of powers. Because the Legislature is democratically elected, that threatens democracy.",

Not because rich people handed members of congress bags of money, but by saying \"we know you have this factory in your district and I'm sure your constituents would *love* to see it get a huge contract\".\n\nYes, executives benefit from that too, but as do the people in the district.  Pull that spending and you'll leave them high and dry.  Even the *most* corrupt, *most* egregious examples of government spending are still far from \"hand a bag of money from the treasury directly to rich people\".\n\nUntil we got to Elon Musk being granted access to the treasury payment system along with his child interns.  The *only* reason why I don't think they've injected code to wire money directly to their bank accounts is that a 25 year old SpaceX intern is not going to have any COBOL experience, and the treasury payment system would involve a lot of legacy code.\n\nAlso, how is an indefinite surplus possible?  Wouldn't that just be removing US dollars from circulation?  As long as the number of dollars is finite, wouldn't that cause an eventual run on federal reserve notes?",

But what was most concerning for democracy is not DOGE\u2014a task force with disproportionate powers for only two years\u2014but USAID. Indeed, since its creation under Kennedy, the agency has been operating without any oversight from either the government or Congress. As a result, they could spend the 50 billion dollars as they pleased, without any control over its usefulness for the USA. For example, I do not see how funding the Taliban with 20 million dollars is useful, just as funding the BBC with 8 million dollars is questionable.",
