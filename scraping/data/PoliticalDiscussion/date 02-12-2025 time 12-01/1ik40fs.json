    "selftext": "I labeled this as US politics but I think this applies more broadly.\n\nWe have seen immense misinformation and conspiracy. It's to the point that there are two world views to literally everything that happens. Somehow, objectivity has been pushed to the side. I won't even talk about the most basic news events with anyone but close friends and family for fear that somehow it will be politicized. The conspiratorial thinking has been injected into everything. It's as if certain groups live in entirely different worlds.\n\n But can we be reeled back from all this? It only seems to be accelerating. I am trying to be optimistic. I want to see a path forward for regular discourse and objective truth. I am finding it very hard to see the light.\n\nHas this ever been experienced in the past? On such a large scale? History repeats itself. So what has happened? The internet and connectivity and manipulation of our minds seems a bit unprecedented. But maybe there's a path out of this that has been paved before.\n\nWhat do you think?",

It took a lost war and the complete destruction of the country for reality to break through the web of lies and misinformation in the third Reich. Reality needs to be forced on people in a way that is inescapable. I fear that a similarly earth shattering event will be necessary to snap people out of this propaganda haze.",

Trump\u2019s tactics include repetition, reversal (accusing the accusers), and the \u201cfirehouse of falsehoods\u201d (confusing people with a blizzard of lies). As Steve Bannon put it, \u201cthe real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.\u201d\n\nThese untruths have not only harmed individuals and firms. They have also damaged public confidence in the integrity of our method of selecting the President: the electoral system itself.\n\nOne way to prove is in court ( e.g. Trump's false claims of election interference lost in court because there was no evidence for them. And yet he continues to claim it it so.) For scientific claims, the test is verifiability/replication. In scholarship, it's peer review. In the public square, the traditional claim is that the marketplace of ideas will winnow out truth from falsehood. But if people can't distinguish between the two, then by definition the marketplace doesn't work. We hardly have a free market where ideas compete; instead we have boutique niches that only specialize in certain kinds of information.",

What is disinformation/misinformation to you, may not be to the person you are sitting next to. It's not a universal \"this is this and that is that\" or \"you are wrong and I am right\" kind of thing.\n\nThere are always going to be the in between folks who question it all, there will be people who 100% disagree, people who 100% agree, and then those who analyze everything and form their very own opinion.\n\nAnd as for the Trump claiming election interference, I, as a non trump supporting conservative (voted RFK, btw,) am embarrassed and annoyed that he kept that up for as long as he did.\n\nBUT, he was trying to claim there was MASS interference. Which there was not and proven as such. Was there election interference on a smaller scale? Yeah, there actually was and there is a lot of proof and articles about it. Just not enough to have made any difference in the outcome, though. Either way, he is just an egotistical billionaire who can't accept defeat, and it crushed his ego lol.\n\nBut look at it this way too... Where are most people spending a lot of time - or at least enough of their time - on? It's facebook, instagram and twitter, right? Social media has a MASSIVE impact on how people vote and how/what people believe to be true/not true. Doesn't matter if it is or isn't.\n\nPre 2022, every single **major** social media platform was 100% owned, operated, and run by liberals. This includes Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The 3 most widly used SM platforms in the world. Run by liberals. \n\nLike I said in a different comment, Zuck even admitted he was pressured into censoring conservative posts/memes/opinions leading up to the 2020 election by the Biden Admin. And yes, this is actual facts and the videos are on youtube and elsewhere.\n\nDorsey (Former Twitter CEO) was a hardcore liberal anyways and was likely also confronted by the Biden admin as well, and told to censor conservatives.\n\nElon bought Twitter in 2022 and for whatever reason, that caused a huge ordeal. My only assumption is because Elon was a Republican and much of Twitter was similar to Reddit... Overwhelmingly democrat/liberal.\n\nNow, Zuck - a liberal - is changing his views on censorship all of a sudden. He admitted he censored conservatives and is now saying he was wrong in doing so. Zuck owns FB and IG, and Elon owns X/Twitter. \n\nSo pretend for a moment that Zuck was a conservative and never censored conservatives on FB or IG, and pretend Elon - or a Republican owned Twitter pre 2020, I'd bet money that the election *may* have played out a bit differently. Not saying Trump would have won but, just saying it could have played out very differently.",

(Or if the government were to require them to, which they obviously aren't going to do.) And the platforms have made it clear that they aren't interested in getting into that business, so it won't stop.\n\nCombatting misinformation effectively requires a centralized way to control the flow of mainstream information. In the 1900s, when people tended to get their information from the same handful of TV news channels/their local paper or maybe one of a handful of major national ones, it was fairly easy to keep fringe views (which often require misinformation to sustain) out of most people's line of sight. Maybe your neighbor's brother is a flat earther, maybe somebody down the street subscribes to the John Birch Society newsletter--but it would be tough for *most* people to stumble across that information even once, let alone enough times to be converted to it. \n\nNowadays most people get their \"news\" from decentralized places like TikTok or Twitter. Not only does this make it easy for misinformation to spread, but the algorithmic structure of these sites ensures it's very easy for people to fill their feeds with people who already agree with them, which means they overestimate how mainstream their views are *and* it's very unlikely for them to ever see anything that debunks what they believe. That's a recipe for disaster in terms in terms of misinformation spread. And there is no easy way to fix it. People need to accept that this is the way things will work for the foreseeable future.",

We didn't realize how valuable gatekeepers were until we lost them. \n\nI think the way to attack this is from a regulatory perspective where there's agreement. The goal can never be to censor speech. Instead, the goal is to protect our children and ultimately consumers from predatory algorithms.\n\nConsumers recognize that social media is addictive. We realize it's unhealthy for our kids. But the incentives on the social media side is to optimize for engagement. That means optimizing for things that make people emotional. Thus the algorithms are prioritized to enable all the bad stuff.\n\nIf we start from a \"protect our children\" angle and make it illegal for anything except dirt simple, publicly shared and regulator approved algos for anyone under 18, I think that's a good start.\n\nWe need a sort of social rebellion against what social media is doing to our lives and society. Start with things there's common ground on and don't die on hills that hurt the larger effort. \n\nFor example, I think the pragmatic left and center needs to align with red states who are requiring strict age verification for porn sites. It's impossible to argue that the 1st Amendment trade-offs of protecting grown adults from misinformation are worthwhile, but the trade offs of protecting 13-year-olds from porn isn't. \n\nDon't protect adults from misinformation on social media, regulate the algorithms to protect consumers from predatory addictive influences.",

Whether or not Thor is in the sky fighting ice giants or there is static buildup in the clouds doesn't make a lot of difference in understanding lightning from a simple practical position.  It starts to matter if you want other things, like not to get hit by lightning, or avoid forest fires, or if you're piloting an aircraft with 100 passengers (who themselves may care.)\n\nThe entirety of science is empirical in nature - repeatable, demonstrable phenomenon.  The claims of science are only true if they can be demonstrated consistently to be true.  There would be no science or need for science if people didn't have practical problems that mysticism and religion couldn't or wouldn't solve.  But advancements in science have made a world where almost all the problems of the previous thousands of years of humanity's experience are solved.  The day-to-day for most humans on Earth today is remarkably  free of those problems (biological needs met, environmental dangers mitigated) due to these advancements, so we're left with more esoteric problems (emotional challenges, social challenges, ethical challenges) and science is much less helpful (so far) with these problems.  \n\nWe've conflated one set with the other, so science has been undervalued for a long time and now we take it for granted, or worse, believe that it's more than it is.  In either case, that undervaluing has led millions of people to believe they don't need it, and that's made them vulnerable to not just exposure to non-empirical information, but also belief that the information is \"true.\"  In essence, they do not believe there is a need to validate information with demonstrable, repeatable phenomenon any more.  This has dramatically eroded the value of expertise, experience, and authority - replacing it instead with so-called \"common sense\" and gut feeling.\n\nThe inevitable destination of this is a return to what was before science and empirical thinking.  Disease will return, society will descend into chaotic feuding of emotional outbursts, industrial collapse, starvation, and war.  Essentially the status quo for most of human's history.  Perhaps after enough of that, the survivors will re-discover what has already been known and appreciate the value of what was lost (for a time), and we'll see the cycle begin again.",

It seems, to me, that everyone takes offense about everything, about everyone, all the time. If you can\u2019t have a deep conversation about views, perspectives, ideas, goals, values in your own home, its very hard to reel back from the current state of things. But it can be done, that\u2019s one thing that is constant is change. It has to start at home because that is where you are comfortable to be your \u201cauthentic\u201d self. I place the quotes, because not everyone has that ideal home life. But as people and as a society that now has access to a lot of technology, basing your ideas, preconceptions, confirmation bias, abuse, etc. and not taking a moment to reflect is dumb. I am a conservative, but I also understand there a lot of things I don\u2019t agree to or subscribe to certain policies. I listen to my democratic friends when they have something to discuss about the republic party and even my independent ones. Why, because my own view is not only way to be and it\u2019s not the way the world works. Do I hold on to my beliefs, yes, but I have to give room to other people to live their lives that way and they want to live with just as much autonomy as I do. They have a right to speak and have their own beliefs and thought process too.",

Confusion and inaction, which is by design. \n\nSo the first step is to understand that you are being duped into believing its Joe Rogans fault or Alex Jones and that to solve it, we need to have conversations about freedom of speech and sensoring misinformation. Those are consequences. Those are not the problems. \n\nThat's why I call on everyone, dumb, smart, rich, or poor to rebel by making a real concerted effort to learn about the World in as many facets as possible by examining the source of that knowledge (academia).

Those three platforms alone were and still are the most widely used social media platforms on the planet. \n\nZuck even admitted he was pressured by the Biden Admin to censor conservatives and censor whatever they told him to. So that included both Facebook AND Instagram. Dorsey is a hardcore liberal and I'm sure was told to do the same. \n\nSo, because those platforms are/were owned and run by very liberal people, do you honestly believe that the \"fact checkers\" were not bias towards democrats? Of course they were. \n\nNow that Elon owns \"Twitter\" or X, it's somehow now a huge issue because he is a Republican and isn't censoring or \"fact checking\" anything. Apparently he is but, not to the extent as it was before. So now people have an issue with a REPUBLICAN censoring democrats but, it wasn't ever an issue the other way around. \n\nMy point is that, missinformation is not a real thing. It's nothing more than trying to say that your opinion is \"invalid.\" Missinformation is only missinformation to the one claiming that it is missinformation, basically.",

                            "body": "First off, this isn't \"misinformation.\" At all.\n\nBeing misinformed versus believing something are very different things, though... People can and will believe what they choose to believe, regardless of where it came from, where they read/saw it or who said it.\n\nI'm assuming that you don't think it came from a Chinese lab, and if so, that's fine! I personally think it did but I also have no GD idea, either. There is no proof that says it did, or didn't. So how can it be misinformation if there are quite literally no factual backing as to where it came from? You can't label something as missinformation if nobody can show facts of \"right or wrong\" or \"yes, or no.\" \n\nBut what if in the next few weeks, months, years, or even a decade we find out that it 100% did come from a Chinese lab? That misinformation was nothing more/less than one's own opinion at the time as there was zero proof of where it came from. \n\nMy point is that, it's not misinformation to have an opinion or hell, even spout conspiricay theories for that matter.. Even conspiracy theories are still just an individuals opinion/thoughts.  It's an opinion and one that a lot of people happen to have but whether or not they are right, turn out to be right, or turn out to be wrong, is entirely irrelevant. \n\nYes, if someone is telling others that \"i know someone who said covid came from a lab\" or xyz... then of course that is misinformation. Or if someone says \"You can cure AIDS by just taking xyz\" then obviously that is misinformation. \n\nOPinions, thoughts, and yes, even consipiricy theories are not \"misinformation\" though.",

People do knowingly spread lies in order to manipulate people, and that would be disinformation. Something could even be partially true and be disinformation at the same time. For example, before we knew how rainbows worked, someone could say \u201ca flood is coming because god is gonna punish you\u201d. And\u2026 a big flood comes and wipes out the crops. Maybe that person says god spoke to them. And they\u2019re lying. To try to get you to behave or believe a certain thing. But they were right about the flood. Doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t disinformation.\n\nAlso more things than you seem to imply can be either objectively shown or should be assumed to be true based on solid reasoning. For example, I don\u2019t believe covid was produced intentionally or came from a lab because I have seen no evidence of that, and so via Occam\u2019s razor it\u2019s safe to just assume it happened in the way experts in the field say is most likely.  It due to appeal to authority but rather if the greater community says \u201cthis is how viruses work and how this happens 99% of the time\u201d there\u2019s no reason to assume otherwise unless there\u2019s more significant evidence to suggest otherwise. Unfortunately folks will fall prey to confirmation bias and weigh other stuff more heavily especially things that are scary or things that blame entities they dislike. (e.g. someone who dislikes china might be more likely to accept a claim about China producing the virus even without supporting evidence)",

Misinformation is a problem especially deliberate but for a person to not see blatant bias like that is an issue on another level that I don't think can be fixed\n\nthe other issue is the hivemind. twitter hashtags when trump goes viral are my favorite example to show that twitter and tiktok are obviously dominated by people who could be categorized as democrats in their beliefs. they hate trump and you'll see that pop viewing any twitter hashtag or viral tiktok video, you'll hardly see defending trump which is odd considering most people voted trump, which is why I want to make it a point that these apps are democrat dominated. Now the main issue with this is the hivemind thing, if you at all are against your peers on those apps you  are attacked and branded a racist homophobe transphobe nazi, we have all seen this it almost feels a joke typing this by how stupid it is, but it happens literally all the time even on here with subreddits banning twitter links because of their own beliefs and spite",
