    "selftext": "In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution protects free speech almost absolutely, allowing white supremacist groups, neo-Nazis and other far-right organizations to demonstrate publicly without government intervention, as long as they do not directly incite violence. Why has this legal protection allowed events such as the Right-wing Unity March in Charlottesville in 2017, where neo-Nazis and white nationalists paraded with torches chanting slogans such as 'Jews will not replace us,' to take place without prior restrictions? How is it possible that in multiple U.S. cities, demonstrations by groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi militia Patriot Front are allowed, while in countries like Germany, where Nazism had its origins, hate speech, including the swastika and the Nazi salute, has been banned?\n\nThroughout history, the U.S. has protected these expressions even when they generate social tension and violence, as happened in the 1970s with the Nazi Party of America case in Skokie, Illinois, where the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the right of neo-Nazis to march in a community of Holocaust survivors. Why does U.S. law not prevent the display of symbols such as the swastika, the Confederate flag, or the Nazi-inspired 'Sonnenrad' (sun wheel), despite being linked to hate crimes? What role do factors such as lobbying by far-right groups, the influence of political sectors that minimize the problem of white supremacism, and inconsistent enforcement of hate crime laws play in this permissiveness?\n\nIn addition, FBI ([2022](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics-2022)) ([2023](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-violent-crime-decreased-2023-hate-crimes-rose-fbi-reports-2024-09-23/)) studies have pointed to an increase in white supremacist group activity and an increase in hate crimes in recent years. Why, despite intelligence agencies warning that right-wing extremism represents one of the main threats of domestic terrorism, do these groups continue to operate with relative impunity? What responsibility do digital platforms have in spreading supremacist ideologies and radicalizing new members? To what extent does the First Amendment protect speech that advocates racial discrimination and violence, and where should the line be drawn between free speech and hate speech?\n\nI ask all this with respect, with no intention to offend or attack any society. The question is based on news that have reached me and different people around the world. Here are some of these news items:\n\n* [Charlottesville, Virginia, Reels From Deadly White Nationalist Rally](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2017-08-14/ty-article-live/charlottesville-virginia-reels-from-deadly-white-nationalist-rally/0000017f-e3c8-d38f-a57f-e7da10180000)\n* [Unity rally in Howell pushes back on recent white supremacy demonstrations](https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/25/unity-rally-in-howell-pushes-back-on-recent-white-supremacy-demonstrations/)\n* [Neo-Nazis are on the March across America](https://www.wired.com/story/neo-nazi-demonstrations-trump/)\n* [White Nationalist Group Proud Boys March in DC to Celebrate Trump\u2019s Inauguration](https://truthout.org/articles/we-are-back-proud-boys-march-in-dc-celebrating-trumps-inauguration/)\n\nAnd so there are a lot of other news... Why does this phenomenon happen?",

Many Americans take pride in our freedom of speech.\n\nBut there's also a technical problem. If you have the time, read Leo Katz's Why The Law is So Perverse. These types of laws are incredibly difficult to write well, perhaps to the point of actually being impossible.\n\nTo demonstrate just how hard it is to do, try this: Propose an anti-hate speech law which (1) actually addresses hate speech that isn't already illegal under for some other reason (such as inciting violence), and (2) *as written* would not apply to speech you believe should be protected. You can have as many do-overs as you want to rewrite the rule, but I'm confident that with only a minimal amount of effort I can find a serious flaw in it.",

[Edit: The page listed 3 categories, but only 2 turned out to be relevant. The third is an anti-incitement law which is very close to the rule in the US, which I don't object to.]\n\nFirst we have the prohibition on advocating genocide:\n\n>Advocating genocide\n\n>318 (1) Every person who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years.\n\n>Definition of genocide\n\n>(2) In this section, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part any identifiable group, namely,\n\n>(a) killing members of the group; or\n\n>(b) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction.\n\n>Consent\n\n>(3) No proceeding for an offence under this section shall be instituted without the consent of the Attorney General.\n\n>Definition of identifiable group\n\n>(4) In this section, identifiable group means any section of the public distinguished by colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or mental or physical disability.\n\nAt first glance, this seemed like a very high bar to clear, largely because of genocide being more narrowly defined than in most places, having to be killing or \"physical destruction,\" though I'm not sure what the latter is if it's not killing.\n\nBut the \"in whole *or in part*\" language is a problem.\n\n\"I think Ukraine should wipe the Russian army off the map.\" -- Advocates for the destruction in part of an group identifiable by national origin.\n\nOr take a discussion about proportionality in war when it comes to collateral civilian causalities. \"Using military strikes to destroy the Iranian nuclear weapons program will probably result in tens of thousands of innocent civilians dying, but the risk of an Iranian bomb is too great, so I think it's horrible, but a necessary evil.\" That runs afoul of the law *as it is written* as well.",

This is the lowest possible bar, and most definitely not protect your right to express vilely bigoted ideas. \"Dude, Klingons are just the worst.\" That's a clear violation of the law.\n\nThere are defenses, so let's make sure to include them.\n\n>Defences\n\n>(3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under subsection (2)\n\n>(a) if he establishes that the statements communicated were true;\n\n>(b) if, in good faith, the person expressed or attempted to establish by an argument an opinion on a religious subject or an opinion based on a belief in a religious text;\n\n>(c) if the statements were relevant to any subject of public interest, the discussion of which was for the public benefit, and if on reasonable grounds he believed them to be true; or\n\n>(d) if, in good faith, he intended to point out, for the purpose of removal, matters producing or tending to produce feelings of hatred toward an identifiable group in Canada.\n\n(c) is where things get very tricky. Is it in the public interest to inform people that Klingons (substitute your favorite real world ethnic minority) are just the worst? The bigot obviously thinks so.\n\nI don't know how Canadian law has handled this, but if (c) protected pure hate speech like in my example, then that entire section is rendered meaningless. Assuming the law is meant to prohibit *something* (because we don't interpret laws to have zero effect), it would prohibit \"Klingons are just the worst.\"\n\nThat's definitely an overbroad speech law, and if people aren't being prosecuted, it's due only to selective prosecution.",

A lot of these decisions defined American history and set back civil rights for generations. I would not really view the Supreme Court as a progressive institutions, and the era of the Warren Court was more of an aberration than anything else. Going back to Marbury vs. Madison, the Court has always been, in some way or another, legislating from the bench. I think the Warren Court was a golden age of liberal idealism for SCOTUS that was followed by a reactionary backlash. Now we have the Roberts Court that has given us such wonderful rulings as Bush v. Gore, Heller, Citizens United, Shelby County, Dobbs, and of course, Trump v. US.",

Sure. However it might be ignorant of rather important details. Namely that this person not only did the shocking thing, but that they did it in a way which highlights the fact that they did their research before doing so. \n\nIt\u2019s unusual, it\u2019s shocking, it\u2019s a refutation of the idea what we\u2019re living in the end of history and everything will return to normal at the end of tonight episode.

Yeah, maybe. But I don't think people are necessarily being insincere when they say they think it was similar to a Nazi salute, but that it's an unfortunate coincidence by someone who is routinely physically awkward.\n\nAs for Shapiro, maybe he saw it as a Nazi salute but wants to stay in the administration's good graces. That's certainly plausible. He's actually criticized Trump a lot over the years though. It's sort of a mixed bag with him. Though it does seem like he's been more deferential to Trump in the last couple months, possibly because Daily Wire now has a White House correspondent.

Your rights don't trump everyone else's rights.\n\nFor example, the police recently banned a protest because the group organising it wanted to march past a mosque in central London on a Jewish holiday. The group were offered a different route but refused it because they were attempting to use the route of the protest to cause disruption to the Jewish community.\n\nUltimately, they chose a static protest in Whitehall, even though all they had to do was take a different route, or choose another BBC building to target. Of course, they confirmed everyone's well-founded suspicions by behaving appallingly.\n\n>It's not an asshole move to speak out against hate. Sorry.

This makes it an offence to send messages by whatever means that are, indecent or grossly offensive, threats, discrimination, or false information, if the purpose of the sender is to cause harassment, alarm, or distress to an individual.

This is a stand-alone offense.\n\nThis is the basic one size fits all law that stops harassment and stalking. A longer sentence can be applied if the charge incudes hate or was hate motivated.\n\nYou can read the Crown Prosecution Service's charging standards [here](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/public-order-offences-incorporating-charging-standard), needless to say they involve no Klingons. The part you're trying to satirise is called Section 4A (prison) and Section 5 (fine), it requires the intention to cause harassment, alarm or distress to a *specific victim*, and evidence of causation of *actual* harassment, alarm or distress. The basic standard is the effect on the victim.\n\n*In short \"Fuck Klingons\" isn't going to get you in trouble, \"I despise you Worf son of Mogh, and I will kill you where you stand\" would be cause for concern, particularly if it's part of an escalating patten of behaviour.*\n\nIf there is a racially, religiously, gender based, hate based element to the offence, it's considered an aggravated offence under Section 28(1) of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and additional charges would apply resulting in a longer sentence.\n\n*Therefore, if the sign said \"I despise you Worf son of Mogh, because you are a stinking Klingon petaQ and I want all of your kind eliminated from the planet\" that would be an aggravating hate factor.*\n\nIf the person holding the sign also displayed a mek'leth, carrying it in their hand after concealing it about their person, that would be two further aggravated charges (concealing and carrying), and if they actually stabbed Worf that would be a further charge of wounding with intent, or attempted murder.\n\nThe process of aggravating offences is helpful because it can distinguish degrees of severity. While rape is absolutely rape, raping someone with an object is an aggravating factor, as is use of a weapon, anal rape is another aggravating factor and so on. This avoids the need for tons of legislation outlining specific individual offences, leaving Parliament to deal with base legislation that can be amended to deal with public concern.\n\nIt also offers juries and judges more options, they could find a person guilty of harassment, without finding them guilty of the hate charge.\n\nWorf would not care, he's used to it, therefore no charge. That said, if the perpetrator's actions caused Deanna, Dax, or Alexander alarm or distress, the perpetrator could still be charged.",

That is to say, everything is legal unless specifically outlawed, the judiciary decides how to enforce the law by creating precedent, and the Crown Prosecution Service codify that into guidelines.\n\nFor example, as a result of the preachers case the courts have now decided that a Community Protection Order under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 can't be used in this way and the national guidelines can be updated without the need for new legislation.\n\nParliament *chooses* to legislate in a manner which provides judicial discretion about how the law is used in practice.\n\n>I don't see that anywhere in the actual text, but again for the sake of argument, let's assume that's there.\n\nIt's in the charging guidelines.\n\n>\"Deport Elon Musk.\"\n\nDeport Elon Musk is a political slogan, and no protester would be charged under this law because *intent* is a factor (which I mentioned already). The people carrying the signs are not threatening Elon Musk directly. \n\nIf one or a group of them strapped on their mek'leth's and invaded Elon Musk's house, threatening his family, that would be chargable. Bombarding Elon Musk's house with personally directed death threats would be chargable. Joining an organised protest with a placard is protected speech under your HRA 1998 Article 10 rights.",

In that book there are designated classes of people who are supposed to be inherently superior or inferior.  In 1984 there was no such thing as hate speech. There was thought crime. Thought crime was simply thinking for oneself in a critical manner that showed any independence.  There is a wide, wide difference between what I suggested may qualify for such prosecutable forms of speech and 1984.",

The JFK quote about peaceful protest vs violent revolution.\n\nWhat speech isn't being allowed?\n\nBlack supremacists (which, yes, do exist) are just as allowed as brown supremacists (groups like La Raza) are just as allowed as white supremacists. The first two aren't even condemned.\n\nIn terms of free speech, everyone has the same free speech rights. Like tell me what you aren't allowed to say. The only things I can think of offhand are calls to violence (and often there it has to be IMMINENT violence, not some vague future idea of war or revolution or the like), calls to imminent lawbreaking, conspiracy to commit a crime (note in both of these cases, it's \"serious crime\" - conspiracy to break the speed limit on a local road is probably not going to be  policed by anyone), libel/slander (which you ARE allowed to do against famous people/politicians with less restrictions), and...that's kind of it.\n\nYou can espouse any ideology, from the extreme far left to the extreme far right, equally.

It\u2019s distributed unequally and it is not just in the form of money (capital) but social consensus (reputation, social standing, connections, class status, sense of belonging to a class or social group, etc), cultural capital (e.g. being from the Anglo Saxon group).  The old systems of hierarchy are breaking down.  There is anxiety among white people that they will become minorities.  Racism is starting to be renewed as a motivating factor in a new and disturbing way.  Sexism is certainly a very potent aspect of power.  And so on.\n\nWe are seeing accelerating inequality.  Those who are beneficiaries of this trend, a very small minority of the population, want to continue to justify their position.  Thus, notions of the social contract, freedom, and power need to be reassessed, analyzed, and argued about.  There\u2019s a group of people with the apparent objective of \u201cdeconstructing the administrative state\u201d which is a fancy way of saying that there should be a bloody revolution, if necessary, and there will be winners and losers in this new period. It is like a declaration of war. \n\nSo in the context of this, debates of free speech may be kind of quaint, and I guess this may be somewhat of a red herring, freedom of speech really isn\u2019t a significant aspect of power in this situation. It\u2019s an abstract concept that can be used for or against anything.  \n\nHowever, insofar as speech can affect some of those aspects of power and are influenced by those aspects of power (financial capital, social capital, cultural capital) it can be used as a means to use that power against other people with less power.  Most genocides that have happened in history start with speech, and in order to prevent genocidal violence at some time there ought to be restrictions on speech that advocates hate.\n\nThe great replacement theory is a great example of something that could have been eliminated from YouTube. Now we are seeing a great risk of it becoming the actual ideology of the Republican Party.  We also see a lot of bots just making up speech. That should also be outlawed.  AI participation in the public sphere shouldn\u2019t be protected speech.",

Non-whites have had a lot of advantages for quite some time now. You can\u2019t just ignore those. For example, there is a Congressional black caucus and black, Asian, Hispanic, etc student clubs on college  campuses, but no space for just white people. Even proposing one (which would be equality) gets one branded as a racist or white supremacist.\n\nYou have lost me there.  These clubs at college and groups like the Congressional Black Caucus are not at all attempts to \u201creplace\u201d whites.  \n\nThere is no need for an official white only space.  We already know that at times people invite people over privately for dinner and/or informally talk to their colleagues without inviting those that they don\u2019t want to invite.  So naturally, anyone who wants to make a white only, black only, or Asian only, etc., space is free to do so.\n\nActually breaking down the logic of what you\u2019re saying, we do have white events.  E.g. St Patrick\u2019s Day which is about Irish Americans. Im sure that English Americans can have a similar event if they so wish.  No one is stopping them.  There are plenty of \u201cItalian American\u201d or \u201cPolish American\u201d, etc, cultural centers where I live.  I went to Hunter College in NYC where they had a Hillel for Jewish students.  I used to go to a \u201cSwedish American\u201d cultural center for breakfast sometimes, where they served Swedish pancakes.  But for white Americans who have a mix of different ancestry, they have to find their own ways to celebrate and honor their own cultures.   Black Americans often don\u2019t have cultural centers.  But if a white person walked into a place where they felt that they were the minority, that is fine.  Cultures can coexist.\n\n\n\n\u2014A lot of the backlash happening now isn\u2019t whites being \u201cscared\u201d, its that they\u2019ve seen others get special privileges their entire lives while being told THEY (the whites) are the privileged ones, which isn\u2019t at all true for white people from the lower economic brackets. People my age have never been alive without non-whites getting preferential treatment vs whites.\n\nSo, yes, I agree with you there.  It\u2019s a bit irritating to see people from the city claim that they have no privilege vis a vis whites who perceive themselves as having very little power in choosing how to react to forces going on in their lives.  For example, rural white Texans have no relationship to urban New York black people.  So the opportunities can be varied, and yet it is still not true that \u201cnon whites get preferential treatment over whites\u201d because in the aggregate, whites statistically hold 10 times the wealth as blacks.  \n\nI don\u2019t believe that the changes that are going on in our country are as significant in reality as it seems to be, just because people consume so much more media via social media than they used to.  It used to be when I was growing up that you get your news from the TV one hour a day. Now it\u2019s diffuse and it\u2019s from a wide variety of sources, some of them accurate and some not.  So you hear all kinds of exaggeration about how the blacks are taking over, for example.  Simply because Obama became president people thought \u201cOK I hope I never hear another person complain about racism.\u201d  But it turns out Obama was just another way for systemic racism to elude visibility.  And when Di Angelo and others write about white privilege I think they\u2019re calling to attention that racism is not just an individually psychological process but that it is a societal issue.  \n\nBut I also think that the concept of white privilege and identity politics has totally been negative for the left.  I agree that it\u2019s an intense backlash and I think that the left should get back to fighting for the working class. The challenge is that prior working class movements were also quite racist and anti immigrant at some times.  If it\u2019s going to succeed, it will benefit everyone in the working class. We can\u2019t have unlimited immigration, but those immigrants who are legally here should be equally valuable citizens.",

I didn't say those things...were...attempts to \"replace whites\". I was contesting you saying whites have had advantages and non-whites have not. Notice I didn't mention replacement in any of that section you quoted. So why did you quote that and say it's about replacement when...it wasn't and didn't even broach the topic?\n\n\\>\"There is no need for an official white only space.\"\n\nAnd there's no need for official non-white only spaces, yet those are allowed to exist. This isn't equality and isn't fairness.\n\n\\>\"E.g. St Patrick\u2019s Day which is about Irish Americans.\"\n\nNow you're conflating holidays. We've been having such a good conversation, not sure why you're going all weird here. I'm unaware of any white Americans - or non-white Americans - that treat Patty's Day as a white people event. We also have no \"white history month\", and no, don't give me \"herp derp every other month is white history month\", that's stupid, as no month is explicitly white history. I'm with Mogran Freement that no one should have a \"history month\" as it leads to more racism.\n\n\\>\"because in the aggregate, whites statistically hold 10 times the wealth as blacks.\"\n\nThis isn't an out, though. Asians hold more wealth than whites on average, and that \"statistic\" is filled with massive outliers, and you seem a rational enough person to know it. Does it matter if statistically your race has 10x the wealth if you personally are destitute and homeless? No, it does not. And it's not white people are statistically 10x wealthier on average than black people. You're talking about overall aggregates, which lump the insanely wealthy in with normal people, and there aren't as many insanely wealthy blacks. Also, if you're talking overall share of wealth in existence/society, that's also skewed by white people being 7x the population that black people are.\n\n\\>\"And when Di Angelo and others write about white privilege I think they\u2019re calling to attention that racism is not just an individually psychological process but that it is a societal issue.\"\n\nI think the problem with this, and why it's such a toxic ideology, is it encourages people to BE racist. \"White people are statistically more likely to be wealthy, so if you're a white person and homeless/destitute, you're actually wealthy\" isn't a good argument. Nor is \"If you're white and homeless/destitute, there's something wrong with you/you're lazy, but non-white people are reasonably expected to be\", which is also not true AND racist. Most of the \"white privilege\" stuff is actually referring to \"wealth privilege\", not white privilege, and they conflate the statistic above (again, ignoring outliers) to present all whites as equally privileged. People can go all the way back to the nation's founding and talk about only white males could vote...but leave off the fact that wasn't true. It was white males *who owned land*. While that was a lot of them, it was wealth privilege, not white/male privilege, even then. Just as it is now. And at the worst, it's HIGHLY alienating to poor white people to be told that if THEY are poor, it's their own fault and they're still \"privileged\" over other people who are poor at no fault of their own because of skin color. Moreover, it insists on institutions supporting white people, when the opposite is true - Affirmative Action has been in effect for 40+ years and privileged NON-white people.\n\n\\>\"But I also think that the concept of white privilege and identity politics has totally been negative for the left.\"\n\nI agree, for the reasons I said above. To your last point - note that no one was against LEGAL immigration (even on the right) until the illegal immigration and open borders got this out of hand. NOW people on the right are against it all, but that's a balcklash to the left, not an inherent position they used to hold. It's a response to the left pushing too far and being too racist and anti-Americans/anti-working class.\n\nEven now, the Democrats are anti-working class TO THE WORKING CLASS'S perspective. The Democrats insist this isn't true, but the working class are the people telling them \"You aren't speaking for me\".",

I mean, a dystopian hellscape.\n\nSeems a bit extreme but I think the main difference is how well protected some freedoms in the US are.\n\nI would argue that while people don't like the US for privacy, it actually has pretty strong freedoms in that companies ARE allowed to run zero knowledge encryption systems and no log VPNs. Private Internet Access has been brought to court multiple times and they proved they had no logs to release about a specific user.\n\nIn the EU this would almost be a certain case where countries have laws that force companies to comply with certain requests--not just disclosure requests but actual forced logging. For instance, ProtonMail, which is one of the most private services supposedly, then gave up identifying info of a CLIMATE PROTESTER to French authorities. ProtonMail defenders on their sub immediately rushed in saying \"well you have to comply with the laws in the country you are in\" which is true but then to forcibly log an IP when logging was turned off and then to comply with the requests of another country over a climate protester? Seriously? It's one thing if this was a wanted hard criminal like serial killer/rapist or national security threat, but another for this person to be just a mere protester.\n\nSo in that sense I actually often tell people that US services aren't that bad. The NSA gets a bad rep but honestly the NSA's reach is limitless. You think Swiss authorities won't just gladly hand over info if they already did with a mere climate protester? I mean Ross Ulbricht was basically caught because Iceland allowed the FBI to look at their servers.\n\nUS freedoms are honestly pretty strong, and it's not just free speech.",

Religions that have commonly been associated with the right would be banned first, then ones less associated. Banning speech opposing immigration/open borders would come petty early as well, as that's already accused of being racist and xenophobic and \"like the Nazis\" by people advocating for speech controls. Banning speech discussing biological sex or its immutability would come next. Arresting/fining people for saying that men cannot have babies would be in that same ballpark as well.\n\nThere's not a big gap between these things. The same people who think white supremacy is hate speech also hold that transphobia is saying people do not have a right \"to exist\" (despite no one every talking about their right \"to exist\" other than the people making that argument), and border control/immigration is also seen as an attack on the right of immigrants to exist.\n\nSo I suspect those would be the next things attacked.\n\nThat's the problem with a slippery slope and why I asked if you've heard of \"First they came...\" - you didn't answer the question, but by your non-answer and pointed question/repeating your earlier question, I suspect you have heard of it and understand the danger I was pointing out, you just want to pretend your ideology would be different.",

For example, that blacks commit more crimes on average than whites, and therefore it makes sense to want to live as far away from blacks and their communities as possible. Scott Adams was destroyed for saying something similar, his cartoon was cancelled in every newspaper in the world, all his books were removed from every virtual store etc. Because he said white people should live far away from black people, for the reason that black people have been taught by democrats that white people are the cause of their problems, which puts white people in danger when surrounded by black people, some of which could be expected to believe it. That's not a controversial opinion, that's a basic description of such widespread social tendencies as \"white flight\", \"gentrification\" etc. Millions of Americans make major decisions in their lives based on this basic principle, and yet the left would destroy someone who has had a non-controversial public life for decades just for saying it out loud.\n\nSo you don't have to wonder what speech the left would ban if they could, other than \"white supremacy\". The answer is: everyday things that millions of Americans say all the time, to friends, to family, or to themselves, as they quietly make such decisions as where to live, which school to send their children to, whether to approve of their daughter's boyfriend etc.",

Libraries always make decisions about what books to carry and what not to carry. The government deciding it doesn't want to provide the public with a particular book isn't a ban on that book. You can still buy it on Amazon or from Barnes and Noble, you can read it, you can read it in public. Hell, you can take it into a library that stopped carrying it and read it. That's a weird thing to call a \"ban.\"\n\n>Demonstrations have resulted in the expulsion of students from universities.

For instance, if you look at the 3 Vanderbilt students who were expelled for \"protesting,\" they were actually expelled because they broke into a building and assaulted a security guard in the process.",

            "body": "To all the people in the comments simply boiling it down to free speech protection, I think it is very important to look at this issue in the context of all the other types of speech the government and other law enforcement agencies do not in fact, officially or otherwise, care for and actively, sometimes violently, shut down. McCarthyism is one example, though leftist ideology in general is often treated very differently than the right-wing white supremacy OP is referring to. Even the civil rights movement (and in fact most movements involving POC activism in fact) received a lot of hostility and antagonism from the state, despite the eventual victories that were made on that front. I think these disparities speak more to the heart of OP\u2019s question. Even though we enshrine the value of free speech officially, certain ideologies and speech are given preferential treatment while others are the explicit target of those in power. The FBI infiltrated BLM protests for god\u2019s sake, and yet it\u2019s journalists who seem to have to do the same for the right wing militias all over the country. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure the answer to OP\u2019s question, but given the history of speech suppression in this country, it\u2019s hard not to think that the power struggles of the ruling class tend to involve or at least find useful certain ideologies over others. We have a few explicit examples of this type of thing during Nixon\u2019s administration, in which a variety of decisions were made regarding education and drug policies specifically to undermine certain minorities. These were covert efforts, but after the fact, advisors of his admitted to their true intentions. As far as I understand, this is a big part of the reason college is no longer free or at least heavily subsidized in did country. All this to say, if those with power sympathize with white supremacist ideology or goals, naturally they will give that type of speech more space than others. \n\nI should also say that it\u2019s sadly the case that most of us are also more tolerant of whites supremacist rhetoric, at least in its more covert forms, than we might be to other types of speech that gets consistently propagandized against by the state or media. This country and its culture is simply steeped in white supremacy. Tolerance to these types of groups might partially stem from that fact.",

There is a narrow range of speech that is tolerated. It is not simply that free speech failed to be protected in certain instances, but that there were active attempts to shut it down on the part of law enforcement and the government. How can you really say that we as a nation allow white supremacist speech as a consequence of our commitment to free speech when there are decades of federal campaigns in the CIA and otherwise to infiltrate, sabotage and subvert communist ideas for example? Those with decision making power find one of those things threatening and the other sympathetic, and then they sell the trope of free speech to people like yourself to shut down dialogue about this disparity when it is convenient. \n\nAlso comparing black supremacists to white supremacy in the US as being equally tolerated is ridiculous.

When I refer to speech being tolerated or not, I\u2019m mostly referring to within media, political organizations, and the government, right? Like, speech that has power behind it which may or may not affect the public discourse around policy. Colloquial speech, including insults, that people throw around online or even in person are not speech in this context. It is speech literally, but not politically relevant speech, if that makes sense. Like, freedom of speech has nothing to do with protecting people\u2019s right to insult one another, right? It\u2019s about ideas. Ideas that might affect power relations for instance, hence their need for protection in the first place. Consequently, tolerated isn\u2019t referring to social appraisal, it\u2019s also a political act. I cannot tolerate or not tolerate speech, at least in the sense I mean, because I\u2019m not in a position of power to do so. Therefore, when I say a narrow band of speech is tolerated, I\u2019m referring to practices within media such as lists of topics and words journalists are not allowed to use or write about. I\u2019m referring to the priorities of law enforcement as to which organizations to infiltrate and subvert and which to leave to their own devices. I\u2019m referring to bills such as the one that passed through congress not that long ago criminalizing criticism of Israel. If it were merely the ideal of free speech being held up, these situations would not occur. \n\nIronically, to your point about MAMBLA, I would argue that their \u201cspeech\u201d wasn\u2019t tolerated, though I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t. Their organizations repeatedly got infiltrated by law enforcement to the point that they had to go underground and stop meeting up I publicly visible local chapters. \n\nNo, that comparison is ridiculous because you\u2019re comparing a few small, politically powerless groups of marginalized and oppressed minorities, who, granted, are being reactionary, to large, well-funded, politically active and powerful organizations. If the former gained any sort of power, they would be shut down. And yet, we see white supremacy organizations openly draft policy for the current administration. \n\nAlso, ironically, BLM and antifa (as far as antifa can be called an organized movement) were infiltrated by law enforcement and the FBI, and consistently condemned by politicians and media alike. I\u2019m not really sure what would have to be done to qualify as not tolerating speech to you. In fairness, however, there are many examples of politicians condemn right-wing, white supremacist orgs as well, but I don\u2019t see as much actual action against them as I do with the others, hence my original point.",

I'm pretty sure Facebook would as well, and Reddit will. And that's ignoring left-wing mods/subs which will ban users for it well before \"Big Reddit\" does.\n\nEven with Musk in charge of Twitter, he doesn't give it special privileges, he just treats it the same as other forms of ideological speech.\n\nConsider how long it's been since you could say the N-word in polite conversation. Now realize you can use Redneck (a word recognized as a racial slur by global agencies that do that sort of thing) with impunity.\n\nYes, one side of this coin has received special treatment and privileges...but it's not the white supremacy side.\n\nEven now, openly white supremacist rhetoric (that whites are superior, that non-whites are inferior, etc) is condemned pretty roundly by society and not given an equal play in media or social media. At its BEST, it's been given equal play on X, but equal, no more.\n\nMAMBLA has not been banned as an organization by the government, and their speech is tolerated in general. It's not ACCEPTED or supported, no, but that's not what toleration means. It is absolutely tolerated.\n\nBLM and Antifa were condemned by the right. I've yet to hear a Democrat outright criticize either. Joe Biden famously dodged by saying Antifa was an idea, not an organization (had one asked him if he would condemn white supremacy, surely he wouldn't have said \"white supremacy is an idea, not an organization\" and sidestepped the question, right?). I don't think that counts since that's just normal ideological/party decrying the opposition, not a concentrated condemnation by society in general. The J6ers and the tiki torch brigade were both condemned by both sides. Antifa/BLM have not been condemned by the left.\n\nAnd note those right wing groups were also infiltrated by law enforcement and the FBI. The plot to kidnap the Democrat Governor of Michigan was hatched and carried out by a group where the majority of members were either FBI or FBI assets, and most of the indicted men were acquitted by juries when the evidence went to trial that the FBI assets were goading them into doing it. When people have to be goaded by government to be white supremacists, it begs the question of if white supremacy is actually prevalent, or if the government is inventing it to help the political left with talking points.\n\nAnd before you handwave that latter point: 51 intelligence officials letter with the Hunter Biden laptop, which had already been verified by the FBI, being produced for and used by Joe Biden in the second debate in 2020 AND the FBI not only refusing to comment, but no one in the agency saying it wasn't Russian propaganda comes to mind. Clearly they aren't above doing this to help the political left win elections and face with the American public.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHeck, \"Patriot Front\" is very likely an FBI organization, but if not, it's been HEAVILY infiltrated by them. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were also heavily infiltrated by FBI assets.",

It's not absolute, but it's something our people want a lot and are very iffy about changing. Where a lot of even liberal democracies say they support individual liberty, they often have a lot of constraints and prefer the government have oversight or a lot of regulations on things like speech, gun rights, etc. In the US, those things are anathema to large portions of our citizenry.\n\n2) In the US, this is seen as universal, not a respecter of person and not used to silence some views or ideologies and not others. In other words: In addition to freedom, our society prizes EQUALITY very highly. Part of equality means that if you have freedom to express your beliefs, other people have that same freedom to express theirs, even if you dislike it or find it uncomfortable. There are limits (for example, obscenity laws, sexual material involving minors, etc), but they are pretty few and often still lenient compared to other nations.\n\n.\n\nYour question isn't asking why white supremacists have freedom.\n\nYour question is why Americans want and demand freedom, are resistant to constraints on freedom, and share that freedom even with people you (or even they) may disagree with.\n\nUnderstand the question you're actually asking:\n\nWhy won't Americans censor/arrest/prohibit ideologies that you personally dislike.\n\nBecause if you word it that way, it should be pretty obvious most Americans would see that as authoritarian.",

People with almost no power \"wield racism\" all the time. What you're arguing is the scale of the consequences.\n\nBut even there, we've seen white people NOT do this. White people don't act as a racial block. Starting in around 2020, they're starting to vote as one, but even there, not really. A majority of every non-white group has voted Democrat for ages now, and no one had some major problem with it. White people just don't operate that way because they haven't needed to in the US. Instead, they share and give up power.\n\nLook at all these massive companies with DEI initiatives. They aren't promoting WHITE people with that, they're promoting non-white people into positions of power - where they can \"wield racism\", as you put it. 2016 Trump's cabinet was the most diverse (read: non-white male) in history to that point.

The difference, at least in Canada, is that fundamental freedoms (Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which in turn forms part of the Canadian Constitution) are limited by Section 1 of the Charter.  Here is Section 1:\n\n> The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.\n\nIt is up to the government to \"demonstrably justify\" those limitations, and the Canadian Supreme Court (which is much less political than SCOTUS) has in various rulings described the form of those limitations.  Look up the \"Oakes test\" for one of the first big tests of this justification, and which is still used today.\n\nThe case in the Canadian Supreme Court which to me most closely matches and demonstrates the differences between Canada and the US with regards to hatred is *R v Keegstra* (R stands for the Rex, latin for King, representing the Crown, which is the source of non-partisan sovereign authority).   Keegstra, a high school teacher, taught anti-semitic teachings. The Supreme Court found that violating Keegstra's freedom of expression (\u00a72) was justified under \u00a71 as the law against extreme hate speech that convicted Keegstra as a reasonable limit for his particular expressions and that this could be demonstrably demonstrated.\n\nI'll finish this discussion with the definition of hatred that came out of the Keegstra deliberations by the Supreme Court\n\n> Hatred is predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society. Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation.\n\nSo in Canada, at least, the greater good of the society can limit freedom of expression, and I suspect many of the activities of recent months in the US would not occur here.",

If we give some organization the power to ban Nazi speech or white supremacist speech, we are also giving them the power to ban socialist speech or BLM speech. \n\nThe power to prohibit anti-Islam speech is also the power to prohibit pro-Islam speech. \n\nThat's why we take a neutral approach. \n\n>while in countries like Germany, where Nazism had its origins, hate speech, including the swastika and the Nazi salute, has been banned?\n\nThese things were banned because at the time they were banned, Nazi Germany had just been defeated and were potentially still a powerful political force.

The purpose of law is to draw a line *somewhere*, even if it may seem arbitrary.\n\nAs it is, there are already numerous exceptions to the First Amendment, including defamation, obscenity, and copyright infringement, yet these are far less controversial than hate speech laws, even among people who consider themselves free speech absolutists. Why is it so important that people have the right to publicly advocate for genocide, but it's okay for the government to [fine or imprison people](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1852-copyright-infringement-penalties-17-usc-506a-and-18-usc-2319) simply for creating art that looks like other art?",

You can't use heroin because it's a drug that kills people and funds criminal organizations who sometimes kill people over the money from controlling those trades. Caffeine could certainly be outlawed someday for being addictive or causing health issues.\n\nFree speech restrictions are dangerous though because it can lead to all other restrictions. Banning caffeine doesn't do anything except make it illegal. People can still protest and call for the policy to be revoked. But if free speech is limited, the government could do anything else it wants without citizens having a way to tell them to stop. And the press could be restricted too, limiting access to information. We don't need a fundamental right to addictive or brain altering substances, but we do need a fundamental right to speak our minds, because it's the only real tool citizens have in our world.",

The problem is in crafting a rule that doesn't ban speech worth protecting.\n\nIt's similar to the principle that it's better to let 10 (or 100, or whatever) guilty people go free rather than to convict 1 innocent person.\n\nThe promoting genocide speech you have in mind is the guilty person, but the law that would punish it, would also punish innocent speech.\n\nSuppose we did have a law that banned promoting genocide with genocide defined as \"the destruction, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"\n\nThat what you have in mind for a ban on speech promoting genocide?\n\nWell, what happens when someone says \"I hope the Ukrainian military kills every last Russian soldier who remains on their soil\"?\n\nWhat about the people who celebrated October 7th?

And this is almost entirely recent. There are virtually no first amendment cases prior to the 20th century, yet absolute free speech is treated as an ancestral creed.\n\nFunny how we didn't need to absolutely protect speech before the advent of Lost Cause ideology, segregation, and other repugnancy entered our discourse.\n\nOne of the first of these was *United States v. Cruikshank* in 1872. In this case, anti-Reconstruction racists murdered dozens of black people and 3 white people (Colfax massacre) over the contested Louisiana gubernatorial election. The charges to the murders included hindering the Freed men's first and second amendment rights to assemble to bear arms.\n\nThe convictions were overturned, so that Black Americans would be left at the mercy of the increasingly hostile state governments and allowing white supremacist groups including the KKK to engage in paramilitary activities to restrict Black voting.\n\nOnly when those groups lost power did we turn around and declare an absolute right protecting their speech, after previously ruling in the exact opposite manner to protect white supremacists when they literally murdered Black people in efforts to restrict Black first amendment rights.\n\nAnd this is conservatism in a nutshell. Power that protects but doesn't bind. While outgroups face power that binds but doesn't protect. \n\nThis isn't actually that hard. Countries throughout the world manage to restrict harmful speech without spiraling to autocracy. In fact, autocracies usually exploit unmoderated speech laws right up till they sweep the rug out, and well regulated speech is one factor that helps to prevent the risk of autocracy. \n\nThe idea that this is a slippery slope that absolutely must not be approached is both modern (most such cases are within the last 100 years in the US, or even the last 50) and generally the result of conservatives losing power rather than being applied consistently to all groups and at all times.\n\nSo why is white supremacy protected? Because it had power. And judicial power tends to last longer than legislative or executive. It is no coincidence that 'free speech' rulings were invented to protect white supremacists, it is a consequence of their power reverberating. At the same time white supremacists were protected, the communist party was investigated. It might be treated as equal, but it is anything but.",

Muslims should not be able to scare TV shows like South Park into censoring, and they should have 0 say over legal free speech protests like that Swedish Iraqi Atheist who burned the Quran in Sweden, who Sweden failed to protect and is now dead thanks to Islamists.

I see the authoritarian/libertarian axis and recognize it but that's not what I'm referring to.\n\nFirst I was more casually talking about conservative forces in Western history vs liberal forces as being more culturally censorious and generally liking to put 'fig leaves' on things in the name of morality, or using institutions like religion to censor and control people's expression. If you look at the last two thousand years--again, even older than the terms 'right' and 'left'--there's been a lot more of that than there has been \"political correctness\".\n\nI should have been clearer about my scope than just saying 'historically'.\n\nYou're saying whoever on top picks their view of free speech and I agree, but it's a different view. I think libertarians prize free speech in intellectual discourse but seem less concerned by cultural encroachment. They seem fine to be in a political coalition with hardcore bible beaters longing to regulate who will be able to express themselves comfortably in public spaces or in media.\n\nAs someone on the left (I don't know that I'd say 'progressive') I strongly believe it's a secular country, and if the government gets drowned in a bathtub and things are privatized by rich yahoos that would not be libertarian, but it would be libertarians who let it happen. Libertarian governance at the federal level wouldn't lead to freedom, but economic might makes right and in the end could allow the richest to control what the poorest get to say.\n\nDo libertarians believe in freedom of speech, or do they believe in drowning the government in a bathtub and handing the mediation of speech and culture to private entities? Because that's not the same thing.\n\nSo in this new order I not end up working for say Hobby Lobby and they tell me I have to wear a cross to work or I get fired? I want to appeal to the govt but oops--drowned in a bathtub! What's the libertarian refrain? \"Vote with my feet!\" But suppose every business has started making cultural requirements that I find appalling? Is it not the same destination by a different road? I'm just under a private thumb now instead of a public one.\n\nWhen everything is libertarian, you might not have a bunch of wonderful, clean, competitive, customer-serving states to 'choose' from, you might just have a bunch of discriminating, regressive, authoritarian nightmare states to chose from. Beyond a point, libertarian policies would lead to a sort of 'freedom' that houses capitalist authoritarianism within itself where censorship could thrive in a religious or corporate way.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that I respect some of the ideas if Libertarians a lot and they're the folks on the right you can actually have discourse with. The problem is right now, despite all the talk of freedom of speech and expression, many of them are all too comfortable voting in coalition with Evangelical bible beaters to try and get what they want, and these people are obviously backwards looking scolds who not  only want to restrict expression, arts, and culture they want to remove whole types of people from the public square. If you do consider yourself an educated 21st century advocate of freedom of speech and expression I don't see how handing the keys to the Anita Bryants and Jerry Falwells of the world is a coherant or defensible position.",

Did you not notice that tens of thousands of people marched in BLM  marches? Freedom of speech applies to everyone in the USA and thankfully it does because otherwise we would be like Britain where constables show up at your door when you try to mention online that Muslim refugees are violent rapists who should be deported.\n\nJust  a note, I disagree with some of your argument. The proud boys marches that you refer to seem to be not much more than a band of federal agents that go around to ensnare people or make it look like there racisim involved in whatever they are marching for. These guys show up at MAGA rallies and end up getting beat down because MAGA have learned not to let them near their rallies.\n\nSecond, you are about to learn that the Jan 6 \"Mob\" contained about 26 active FBI agents/informants who were actively waiving that crowd into the building.....and BTW, they were let into the building (literally, the doors were unlocked by staff on the inside and they were allowed in). The whole thing was a set-up because of the shady shady stuff surrounding the election vote counting.\n\nAnd lastly, your mention of Charlottesville I believe was media spin. If you have seen any videos of those marches you will see how drivers are treated when they turn the corner and get caught up in the middle of those marches. I believe that the guy who was arrested had that happen to him and he drove to get away from the crowd but ended up hitting people in the panic. The media spun it as a violent racist inicident.\n\nNever trust the media. Never trust the govnerment.",

It's like the \"fire in a crowded theater\" thing; not only was that never ruled on by the Supreme Court, they later partially, and then later COMPLETELY reversed the decision where it was said. The Justice who wrote it in the original decision (the case was about whether it was legal to hand out pamphlets encouraging people to oppose the draft in WW1, btw) said the fire in a crowded theater line was one of his biggest regrets in life, and later was still on the bench when he voted/ruled on the majority for the partial repeal.\n\nToday, it is 100% legal to yell fire in a crowded theater, you can just be liable for damages (civil), but it isn't an offense punished by the government by fines or jail time (criminal).\n\nAn old ruling from decades ago that doesn't apply today can't really be used as a rebuttal. Especially since most of those laws have been evolving in the direction of more freedom. For example, something like Flotsom Street Fair would have been absolutely illegal 100 years ago, but it's more or less legal today, and people aren't prosecuted for it, despite it being something a majority of the public/\"a reasonable person\" would find obscene.\n\nSo clearly your \"But what about...?\" isn't as valid today as you may think it is.",
