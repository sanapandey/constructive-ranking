    "selftext": "Saudi Arabia appears to be reclaiming its regional influence with the recent political shift in Syria. Newly appointed Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the uprising against Iran-backed Bashar al-Assad, made Riyadh his first foreign visit, signaling a potential shift in alliances.  \n  \nIs Saudi Arabia on the path to reestablishing itself as the dominant force in the Middle East?  \n  \nMore here:  \n[https://caracal.website/saudi-arabia-middle-east-influence-syria/](https://caracal.website/saudi-arabia-middle-east-influence-syria/)\n\n  \n",

The fall of Syria just gave the Saudis a massive win, in that they have now geographically shut off a major connector between Iran and its proxies in Lebanon and around Israel.",

Ahmed Al-Sharaa has a direct connection to Turkey, and Turkey is the one who controls him, and here the contradiction occurs. I want everyone to know that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are fighting for influence in the Middle East, and they are like hidden enemies.",

The tunnel network across Gaza is still functioning, as are arms manufacturing capabilities. \n\nYemen is a lost cause for the Saudis. It was already a lost cause before October 7, but in the last year or so of Houthi actions in support of Palestine, they've seen a marked increase in popularity and a concurrent fracturing of the anti-Houthi coalition.",

They always suffered from political instability and were mostly kept afloat by foreign backers.\n\nThe Saudis do seem to like the new government more. A big chunk of the rebel coalition were religious extremists (ex: HTS are former al-Qaeda) so they may respect Saudi Arabia as a fellow conservative government and as the home of Mecca. However, the rebels' biggest financial and political backer was Turkey, so they probably benefit more from this.",
