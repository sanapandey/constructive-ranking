The goal isn\u2019t just to make noise; it\u2019s to win and actually govern effectively.\n\n**Conservatives came to the table ready to rock in 2025.**  \nThat level of organization and preparedness is something progressives must learn from. Having the right ideas isn\u2019t enough, they need leaders who can execute, communicate, and work together. **They need a Project 2027.**\n\n----  \n\nSo, who are the candidates, local, state, and federal, that strike the right balance? Young, energetic, forward-thinking, and capable of working in unison rather than being fragmented.  \n\n----\n\nAside from the candidates themselves, how do they actually make this happen? What\u2019s the best strategy for:\n\n- Identifying and supporting the right candidates early?  \n- Building a coalition that can work in unison instead of being divided?  \n- Creating a messaging strategy that resonates with the majority, not just the base?  \n- Ensuring grassroots efforts translate into real electoral success?  \n- Learning from past mistakes and building an infrastructure that lasts?  \n\n----\n\nWho are the rising stars that actually get it? Who has the vision, the fire, and the ability to win and govern effectively, without falling into the same divisions of the past?  \n\n**Drop names, key races, and reasons progressives should get behind them!**  \n\n----\n\n**Prompts**: (because I'm not going to lie, I had chatgtp help me put this together due to being dumb)  \n\n- new reddit post, political discussion. the prompt / title something like which candidates should progressives be pushing to the front page, lifting up or just overall supporting for 2026 and the future that are likely to advance progressive (like truly star trek progressive) policies in unison and quickly\n\n- we may need to rethink our post. we want drastic change, young and eager candidates, but we also want candidates that are appealing to the majority\n\n- add a neutral mention that the current party has been, if nothing else, extremely efficient or prepared to implement their policy\n\n- These candidates must also be able to work in unison, not as divided as they have been in the past. softer on 'progressive'\n\n- we need to change the policies into more of a discussion topic, something else to plan\n\n- scrap the policies, replace with a discussion on how to actually implement our plan",

I\u2019d love to see him run in 2028; he\u2019s coming up on year 6 of his gubernatorial tenure and he doesn\u2019t seem to have any intention on running for a senate seat, so we likely won\u2019t see him on the national stage for a bit. \n\nHe has the potential to legitimately bring a sense of unity to our country; checks just about all boxes.

Why would half the country want to hold any of their politicians accountable when they are fighting the demons in charge aka Democrats.

Okay, but if you take that argument to its natural conclusion then there\u2019s no cut off. \n\nI am a one issue voter. Gun control. I won\u2019t ever vote for the GOP because of their position on this. But even gun control (to my dismay) favors the right at the moment.",

                    "body": "> The most momentum the Dems have had since Obama was Bernie but they shut him down\n\nThe reality of Bernie's loss must be confronted: he didn't have the votes. He kind of came out of nowhere in 2010 or 2011, when he did that grandstanding filibuster. That's the first time anyone had really heard of him outside of Vermont. Now, if you're Obama, this once in a generation political talent, that's enough time to build a coalition. But what did Bernie do? He wrote a book and went back to being a curmudgeon in the corner of the Senate. Voters still didn't know who the hell he was five years later when he ran in 2016. \n\nThe reason Bernie lost to Hillary, is actually the same reason why Hillary lost to Obama in 2008: he got absolutely obliterated in the black vote. It is the most loyal Democratic constituency, they are a crucial part of the coalition, and they're well organized when it comes to primaries. When Bernie first started running, none of them knew who he was. But Hillary? They all knew who the fuck Hillary was. They love the shit out of the Clintons, and had done so for decades at that point.\n\nA lot of younger voters won't remember this, but [Bill Clinton was described as the first black president](https://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/5004618-bill-clinton-first-black-president/) He and Hillary's tenure in Southern politics goes back to the '70s, they've been fighting hard on their behalf for a very long time. When Bill Clinton ran for the presidency in the early '90s, they already knew him pretty well, and he was actively speaking out on issues they cared about. Younger voters today point to those strict crime laws, but black voters actually wanted those laws back in the day (though obviously not the unintended consequences that absolutely demand reform today). Their communities were being ravaged by violence and they wanted more policing. Younger voters gave Hillary shit for using the word super predator back in the '90s, but that's the word communities used back then. They were being shot up, and they wanted help. Bill Clinton promised to deliver on that help, and for a time, it seemed like he did, as crime collapsed over the decade. (Though again, they overshot by incarcerating way too many people, and we are still in need of dire criminal justice reform).\n\nYounger voters like that one photo of Bernie protesting in the name of civil rights back in the '60s in Chicago. However, in the communities of black voters, he had been absent ever since. They didn't know him, they weren't impressed by just the one photo. But what did Hillary do when she got out of law school? [She went down to South Carolina and did pro bono work to help black kids get fair treatment in the juvenile Justice system.](https://www.heraldonline.com/news/state/south-carolina/article92848387.html).  She was there, when Bernie was in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the country. So when The 2016 South Carolina primary came, where most of the Democratic electorate is black, and they had to choose between Hillary, who had a history in that state of helping their communities, and Bernie, who they had never fucking heard of, of course she fucking blew him out by nearly 50 points. Why the hell would you expect a different outcome? \n\nThe only way Hillary was ever losing is if a once in a generation political talent in the form of an equally well-educated black man also ran for president. Incidentally, all the states Bernie lost in the South that have a majority primary electorate? Hillary lost to Obama. But in 2016, she won them. That's the difference.\n\nSo if you want to know why Bernie lost, it's not some grand conspiracy by the DNC. It's because the Clinton machine had been organizing in key Democratic constituencies for decades by the time the year 2016 rolled around. Where was Bernie? He hadn't organized jack shit. Come 2020, Biden beat Bernie even harder than Hillary did. Hillary had an early sign of weakness in Michigan in 2016, where Bernie carried almost every single county. But in 2020, he lost every single county to Biden. In the 4 years between 2016 and 2020, Bernie's organization had only gotten weaker, and despite the overall primary turnout being much higher, he finished almost 4 million votes behind his 2016 total. The only momentum there was going in reverse.\n\nSo when we're arguing over who should be the progressive candidate for 2028, it's not going to be the person whose soundbites  you most often agree with, it's going to be the person's best able to build a winning coalition. Bernie couldn't do it. Here's hoping someone like AOC can - and thus far, in her young career, she has spent far more time doing so than Bernie ever did when he was a younger man in the House. She's got a wide national profile, and she does consistent outreach with great communication. She even won her first election by going door-to-door, wearing out the soles of her shoes multiple times. That's real organizing. That's how you win a goddamn campaign. She's also currently trying to work her way up the ladder in the House leadership, vying for ranked positions on committees. By the time she's 50, she's going to be much better positioned than Bernie has ever been his entire political career. \n\nI am a progressive myself. I voted for Bernie in 2016. But we're not going to win elections if we keep putting our heads in the sand. We only win if we look honestly at why we lose, and blaming the DNC establishment as the sole cause ain't it. Bernie lost by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton. That's a substantial margin. And Biden beat him even harder: 10 million votes! He was never going to be the hero we needed. He just didn't have the political skill, even as he was saying things we otherwise agree with.\n\nOur future leaders won't just be people who have an occasional viral moment. It's going to be the people who actually organize voters, and get them to show up en masse. And when we talk about the Democratic establishment, we have to understand that it isn't just the elites in the party. It's a large segment of the voter coalition. We live in a center-right Nation, and so part of the essential task of progressivism is to persuade these voters that our policies are in their best interest. We have a lot of work to do. We got a lot of doors to knock on. It's possible, but not with finger pointing.",

I'd love to give you a visual comparison of Sanders/Biden/Harris/Trump but it seems there isn't one at the moment for us to go over. My point is not to relitigate  Sanders' presidential run but more to say his message is popular in the entire country, including states Democrats barely campaign in and don't care about, and including states that Trump has won in. I reject the notion that at it's core America is a center-right nation, as I think it's a bit more complex than that, and I think these wild swings of the pendulum are indicative of that. People are looking for big changes, anywhere they can get them. Americans might be center-right on cultural issues, but I think there's a core set of economic and labor interests that are much more universal, which people like Bernie have successfully spoken to. I do agree with you that AOC has been speaking on it and doing a better job coalition building though, but the GOP has identified her as a threat for a while now and I has put a lot of effort into making her out to be the next Hillary bogeywoman.",
