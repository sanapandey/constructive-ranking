    "selftext": "Trump's voter base in 2024 was more diverse than many people expected, with many key groups like Black Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Jews shifting to the right politically. College educated people and young men have also shifted to the right. They didn\u2019t all go for Trump overall but they still shifted to the right compared to previous years. \n\nCities and their suburbs, traditionally Democratic strongholds, have begun voting more Republican too. This could be important as rural America is shrinking quickly and more people are flocking to urban and suburban areas. By 2050, 89% of the American population is projected to live in urban/suburban areas, up from 83% right now. I think these are things that could shape what the Republican Party becomes in the future and what their priorities are.\n\nThe archetype of a Republican voter has traditionally been an older white person from a rural area. But as time goes on, this could change.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if these changes are only for 2024 or if it\u2019s a broader trend that will be more permanent. Since these groups may become a bigger part of the Republican electorate, how do you think this will affect the future of conservative politics in the United States if it kept going this direction? Would this curb the influence of far right extremist groups like White nationalists?\n\nAlso, despite the increased racial diversity, two groups that shifted further away from Republicans were women and the LGBTQ community, so it will be interesting to see how that develops. I wonder if the divide will shift from race to more about sexuality \n\nI'd like to hear views from both sides if possible \n\nAnd the sources are here: \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/trump-america-red-shift-victory.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/trump-america-red-shift-victory.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html)",

He went back to this line of attack a few times. \n\nBannon and a few other MAGA people all noticed they managed to put together an admittedly broad coalition before and after the election. They are probably thinking of how to shape the whole thing to make it a lasting coalition built around masculine values and shit like that. \n\nI suspect Musk will manage to ruin it or it will ruin Musk. His behavior is extreme in shape and substance. He will get all of the blame for the most obnoxious insults and then Steve's faction will be seen as heroes for pushing him out.",

Trump enthusiastically supported the \"lock her up\" chants in 2016, but of course the question was \"lock her up\" ... for what?\n\nSo now the question becomes, why would Elon be going to jail \"very very soon\" let alone at all? He's proven himself to be a deplorable human being, but that's not illegal. Certainly his fake \"oversight\" department is operating outside of the authorizations required for private-citizen commissions to operate in the federal government, but I'm not aware that's an actual crime. Wishcasting the bad guys into jail doesn't solve problems. In fact, it probably causes more of them, as Trump World was very adamant during the 2024 campaign they would like all of their political enemies (e.g., every member of the January 6 committee) to be prosecuted for the apparently indefensible crime of holding their god-emperor to account. And despite Biden's pardons, Trump World is still trying to come up with ways to punish them for their heresy.",

They have picked up more skin tnes, but it's almost impossible to find a college graduate in the party anymore. The last time I looked, the biggest statistical predictor of if you're a Trump supporter anymore is level of education - the less you have, the more likely you are to support him (and it really is his party now). Anyone who knows anything about science, or medicine, or economics, or history, or really anything has run screaming from the party. They have opposed education on pretty much every level for decades, and they are reaping the \"rewards\". Sure, it's destroying the nation, but whatever. This is pretty much always the go-to move for any authoritarian movement because the less you know, the more easily you are played. And now they've finally reached the point where they can openly move to completely eliminate the Dept of Education. Now the red states, which already generally have terrible schools, in large part because they also tend to be the poor states, would now not get any federal money, thus making their population even more poorly educated, and consequently even more easily manipulated. \n\nThis is going to be horrific. \n\nSo, again, I think the whole \"diversity\" thing is overplayed. Things come down to policies. The less knowledge you have, the more likely you are to be convinced to vote for policies which tend to be bad for the common man. Red states already tend to have the worst stats on pretty much every level and it's going to get worse.",

When companies start diversity programs, you almost never hear that it means they're hiring some people with bachelor's degrees, some with masters, and some high school graduates. It's almost always about \"skin tones\" with the same qualifications. So why are we changing the common usage here?",

With the potential criminal prosecutions for private businesses who are seen to have DEI policies will see businesses reluctant to hire minorities for fear of prosecution.   \nThe cuts to the department of education  and the overall longterm future of the department will definitely impact minorities.\n\nI think Trump\u2019s vision of taking over Gaza and moving the population into neighbouring Egypt and Jordan will certainly cost the Republicans votes particularly in Dearborn, Michigan. \n\nIn conclusion should the Republican Party remain to be the party of MAGA in Trump\u2019s vision going forward  I doubt it will gain or retain the increase of minority votes.",
