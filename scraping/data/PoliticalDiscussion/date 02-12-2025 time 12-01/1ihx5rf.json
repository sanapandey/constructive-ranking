    "selftext": "Trump just announced that the U.S. will take control of Gaza to redevelop it, and he wants the Palestinians to be relocated. What potential ripple effects could this have on the Middle East? Do you all think the U.S. will relinquish control of Gaza after it is redeveloped, or could this region become an official U.S. territory or state? If the region becomes part of the U.S., could this lead to U.S. imperialism in the Middle East? What are our enemies\u2019 likely responses, such as Iran\u2019s; could we likely see another war against terrorism or the collapse of Iran?",

Previous administrations have been \"how can we win this war\", Trump's attitude is \"lets make our military so scary, no one will want to fight us\". Which, IMO is the correct take, it not only gets the message across, but also ends up saving lives on both sides. \n\nAn example, there's a story told by Byron Daniels (FL-R) during Trumps first term, he was meeting with Taliban leadership. The conversation was coming to a close, Trump says he wants to start slowly pulling out of Afghanistan, but there needs to be conditions. He tells the head of the Taliban, \"if a single American is harmed in any way, I'll kill you\". He gets up, hands the guy a satellite picture of his house and walks out of the room. For 18 months, until Trump left office, there was not a single incident with the Taliban.",

He just spent the last two weeks publicly threatening to cause massive harm to the economy of all of North America, only to back down the moment Mexico and Canada agreed to keep doing what they're already doing. \n\nThe Taliban has been going toe to toe with the United States for 20 years, and you think one sentence from Donald Trump stopped that?\n\nAnybody who takes the word of a Trump fluffer like Byron Daniels is a fool.",

You could have very easily said 'I didn't understand what Trump was proposing', but instead you chose to double down on ignorance. \n\nDonald Trump has *explicitly* conditioned his plan for redeveloping the Gaza Strip on ejecting the Palestinians there into Egypt and Jordan. This is an objective fact. Either you admit you support that plan, or you admit you didn't understand what he was proposing. There is no middle ground in play here. \n\nThis is not me \"dominat(ing) and castigat(ing) everyone who disgarees with you\", this is not me jumping to the \"worst possible conclusion\".

Back in 2004 or so, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was popular among Republicans, the idea of dispensing with this requirement so that he could be President enjoyed a decent level of support.\n\nThat is before even considering the possibility of simply ignoring the Constitution, or even simply declaring the government overthrown and replacing it with a new one of their choosing.",

Putting aside the moral and ethical implications of an ethnic cleaning, this is an incredibly expensive venture to move ~1million people for a sliver of land that would be *the* terrorist target for the next half century. It's not worth it, and even Trump knows that. It's big talk that makes people nervous because that's what he does.\n\nBut if somehow the US did act on it (and they'd have to be directly involved because Israel doesn't actually have the manpower or desire to take the strip), it would be a US territory.  Others might live there, but no one else would lay claim to it. Even if the administration changes there's no backsies, like a lot of land the US has expropriated over the centuries\n\nIF they did do it, it would be a huge impact on the region. Not really because of the land being taken over, but because where are the million people going to go? For a long list of reasons, no one else in the region wants to take in those refugees. \n\nSo why is Trump saying this stuff?  Part of what's going on with this weeks visit is the US continuing to broker the peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. This was a policy Trump had last time. It saw enough success at normalizing relations in the ME that it was part of why Hamas struck on Oct7. The US wants to finish those talks, which will admittedly help stabilize the region even if that's just a side effect for Trump. Particularly since with Iran's losses with their pseudo-armies in Lebanon and Gaza, SA is in a stronger position relatively.\n\n Trump is kicking the hornets nest and making everyone worried and talk about his bombastic nonsense so that when he goes to the Saudi talks he can walk back these comments and say he got a win in exchange for something from them.",

Any pretence from the U.S. to any kind of moral leadership of the free world would be dead in the water for the next few decades.\n\nSecond, the only country in the world who would benefit from this policy would be Israel (and I think the only reason they did not do it themselves a long time ago is their lack of manpower, so this might be Netanyahoo attempt to get the U.S. to do it for him). The ensuing refugee and diplomatic crisis would have a negative impact on a lot of U.S. allies both in the Middle East and in Europe, so the U.S. would have made a lot of enemies and lost a lot of allies, and would probably lose its current dominant position in the Middle East. Not that I think even Israel should rejoice, because I believe that if this policy is successful, the next logical step would be the U.S. taking control of the whole of Israel and Palestine to turn it into a puppet state and U.S. colony. No reason why they should not.\n\nAs for Iran, I expect they would just sit tight and send weapons to whoever wants to fight the U.S. while denying that they are doing so. They are not the kind to get their hands dirty by figthing the U.S. directly, but would be glad to weaken the U.S. through whatever proxies they can find. That is what they are already doing after all. But I doubt that the U.S. could at the same time successfully take control of Gaza and wage a successful war of invasion against Iran (which would be another reason for Iran to send weapons to the Palestinians to fight the U.S.). Both would be incredibly expensive to do in both money and manpower, even for a military superpower like the U.S. \n\nThat is of course assuming any of this would happen and that Trump will not forget it in next month after he had his next harebrainedly stupid idea.",

Will we treat it like a territory with the eventual option for statehood? Or will it somehow become Trump\u2019s personal fiefdom? If any of these does come to pass, how will Isreal react? The Israeli far right wants that territory for Isreal, not America. At a minimum this will scramble Israeli politics and could deal a severe body blow to the Israeli right.\n\nHowever, I'm getting ahead of myself a little. Recent estimates show that Hamas has recruited as many people as they lost in recent fighting. They lack the training and equipment of the old Hamas, but their people have even less to lose and are more bitter. They're not giving up Gaza without a fight. Even with total disregard to human rights, this operation will be expensive in lives and money. \n\nLastly, the mere attempt to force the people of Gaza into Egypt and Jordan will force an existential crisis. These countries already have trouble balancing internal security with friendly relations with Isreal. That dilemma will only get worse as they're forced to choose between repressing the new arrivals (which will be really unpopular domestically), or severing relations with Isreal. At a minimum, this will open the door to Russian and Chinese influence. Worst case, there could be another Isreal- Arab war.\n\nOf course, we also cannot treat this as a fully formed policy proposal. Trump even said as much in the press briefing. The policy which gets implemented is likely to be different then the one proposed.",

This revelation also casts new light on Hamas' desperate decision on October 7th, viewing it as a now or never scenario.\n\nWith Trump's recent actions, i.e. signing comprehensive new sanctions against Iran, advocating for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, and fully supporting Netanyahu; it seems reasonable to expect continuation of his first term policies and outcomes similar to, if not worse than, what they resulted to.\n\nThis time, it might also include war with Iran and efforts to coerce Egypt and Jordan's leaders to support his plans, potentially threatening their stability and seeking replacements. \n\nIf Trump aligns fully with Netanyahu, it would be a significant victory for the Israeli Prime Minister. Netanyahu realizes that Israel cannot single-handedly eliminate Hamas, and by extension, certainly cannot neutralize Iran alone. He needs to involve the US in this conflict, and it appears he's succeeding. After all, Trump owes much of his presidency and his avoidance of legal troubles to Netanyahu's actions! It is not a coincidence that he is the very first foreign official that Trump is meeting!",

He is RESUMING his \"maximum pressure\" campaign he stated. That was the campaign that was going to cause war with Iran.\n\nWe are going to team up with Saudi Arabia to finally fix Yemen in a very boots on the ground way. Most likely at the same time as being at war with Iran. Israel already has casus belli and so does the United States. Israel for obvious reasons(financing Hezbollah, Hamas, and Houthis while launching missiles from mainland Iran) and the United States because Iran has a hit or bounty on Trump's head from when he killed Soleimani(widely regarded as the second most important person in all of Iran) in Iraq. Iran also has a hit on Bolton and Pompeo.\n\nWhat will be interesting to watch is what happens in Syria but I see this playing out very well for the United States in the long run if Trump can get Palestinians to gracefully relocate from Gaza for their own well being. I hope Trump didn't take away useful soft power in the region by blocking USAID funding that could have gotten us a more advantageous position. The best thing for Palestinians in Gaza is to relocate, all of Gaza is basically in ruins with no electricity or water. Nobody wants to take them in though. Trump is going to have to twist some arms because the entire world is opposed to the idea of relocating Palestinians from Gaza. \n\nAs long as China or Russia don't announce some iron clad military defensive alliance with Iran then we should be able swiftly control the region. We have been selling the Saudis our f35s for this exact inevitability. I always like to highlight this proxy war that is happening between Saudia Arabia and Iran. There are a bunch of civil wars happening across the world, usually split between sunni and Shia, they both arm and finance them. Ugly stuff.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_proxy_conflict\n\nI don't know how Trump is going to do this(own and redevelop) without taxpayers paying(we would undeniably have a MAJOR military base there). It is possible these tech and crypto bros may produce some type of city that produces revenue of sorts in Gaza with Saudi Arabia. We'll see, war was always inevitable, now it really really is. \n\nI never thought I would say this, but Rubio being Secretary of State brings me tremendous comfort. Rubio is the best Secretary of State Trump has ever picked. Rubio knows his foreign policy and the way the world works from the committees he has served on.",

That's going to take multiple generations and depending on how we were to run the region I could also see arms rebellion. I maybe could see it happening in this limits of chances.",

Let me join you in fantasy land, it seems nice there.\n\nAlso, even if Palestinians hate Israel, and by extension the Jewish people, I wouldn't call them Nazis lol. ***Everyone*** in Gaza has been touched personally by the murder of someone they know. Their hate has a lot more in common with Jewish people hating Nazis, than Nazis hating Jews. And I'm a Jewish person.",
