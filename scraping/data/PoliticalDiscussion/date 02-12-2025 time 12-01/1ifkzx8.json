    "selftext": "There are many factors that influence a person's vote when choosing a candidate, whether at the local, state or federal level. But I would like to focus on the economic aspect because there are some examples of the economic situation at that time giving different winners in the elections.\n\nAlthough it is too early to say what the economic situation will be like under this administration, I would like to know the level of influence they have on voters. In addition, how can the economic situation affect the 2026 and 2028 elections?",

The economy could collapse and Trump would blame this on Obama causing his supporters to cheer and run back to the polls in support of him again. That is if we even have elections in 2028.",

With his tariffs alone we could see inflation hitting numbers higher than we saw during the Carter administration.  The only thing that could change everything is if the GOP sees the numbers going south on them at the polls, they could finally put on their big boy pants and start an impeachment inquiry and do what they should have done the last time and that is impeach,convict  and remove Trump permanently from the political landscape.  He's already committed acts that could be considered high crimes and misdemeanors.",

However, in the context of the modern U.S., they do more harm than good, and Trump\u2019s tariff proposals will only lead to increased prices. Stores will either import products from other countries instead of Canada and Mexico that produce goods at a higher cost or buy U.S. products, which will likely be sold at a higher price depending on the item. Certain types of produce cannot be grown year-round in the U.S., so their prices will increase. For example, a local grocery store\u2019s watermelons have become more expensive because they are now sourced from Guatemala instead of Mexico, and the production cost of a watermelon is higher in Guatemala than in Mexico due to lower supply. Fortunately, the CAFTA deal is still in effect, so there is no tariff on items exported from Guatemala; however, that could soon change given Trump\u2019s policies.",

Even four years is not enough. Long-term business restructuring of this scale will take well over a decade. And such a plan, even if it works out in the end, always hurts at the beginning. Even under the *best* scenario, the economy will get worse before it gets better.\n\nGiven the hamfisted, ultra-partisan way this plan is being pushed through, there's no way the Democrats won't exploit the \"get worse\" phase at the Midterms and next General Election, get power back, and overturn all of Trump's agenda, leaving us worse-off than before it started.\n\nEven if you agree with the vision of reindustrialization, such a massive economic reform *must* happen with bipartisan support, in order to ensure it has enough backing to last through several election cycles, until it starts bearing fruit. This cannot and will not happen with the way it's being implemented. We're in for both a political and economic disaster.\n\nThe ironic thing is that if the GOP came to the Dems and asked them for support in reversing Reagan's reforms and bring jobs back to America, they'd probably get it (with the condition that Reagan's tax cuts should also be reversed as part of it.) The desire to rebuild the shattered American middle class has strong support on both sides of the aisle. But that would require stopping treating Reagan as an infallible God with \"thou shall cut all taxes\" being his first Commandment, which the GOP will rather ruin our country than agree to do. \n\nUnless their \"solution\" to ensure the plan's longevity involves simply not holding free and fair elections anymore, which... I'd rather not consider just yet.",

The monthly budget of the Average American. \n\nA single person household spends an average of $4,641 on monthly expenses. Married couples without kids spend an average of $7,390 on monthly expenses. A family of four spends an average of\u00a0$8,450\u20139,817\u00a0on monthly expenses (depending on kids' ages). So lets say that on average we'll see the average cost of goods rise anywhere from 10-25% if we just include the Trump tariffs and assume that all costs will be passed to the consumer (because no corporation is going to take that hit). That would mean for a single person household you're seeing an increase of $464-$1,160 a month and for a family of four, that would increase $913-$2,283 a month.\n\nCouple this with the fact that the average American household can't afford a $1,000 emergency, and around 37% can't even afford a $400 emergency last time I checked. Savings rates are at all time lows, credit use and credit card debt at are all time highs. \n\nAre you getting it yet?\n\nWhat we are going to see is anyone making under six figures, and probably a few making six figures, be absolutely wiped out. Mass unemployment as demand plummets, huge increases in crime, etc.\n\nReally bad stuff, but also remember, we haven't even accounted for how the other countries from around the world are going to respond to our tariffs in kind. \n\nIf we even have elections in two years, and Trump continues down this path.

I would like to point out that i have seen patterns on social media highlighting only the social aspects of Trump's campaign such as gender and sexuality creating this narrative that caters to traditional ideologies while ignoring the economic policies and immigration policies causing them to vote for trump as it fits their own biases. This showcases how the general public will go with trends and snippets of a campaign rather than the whole scope of their political parties campaign. We need to bring back and teach these generations how to actively research and fully comprehend an idea or an approach someone proposes to form an opinion not just blindly follow like sheeps. \n\nAs for economically I did research and throughout his campaign he said he would not back down from these tariffs so I believe our economy is going to be shit such as higher rates of inflation or trading with other countries become a stand still and we suffer as a result or until either they realize that these policies are stunting their pockets growth before they do some clean up policy to retroact trumps tariffs.

Our elections will now mirror Russia and Turkey, where it\u2019s all a show and the outcome will be decided before any one votes. \n\nSeriously. We just put people in charge of every agency and position that tried to overturn the previous election. We are never having free and fair elections again. Trump literally told us if he gets back into office we will never vote again.",

I was asking them if any of them were concerned, depending on how this current administration plays out, that Vance might suffer from the same issue Kamala had during this election, basically a \"You were in charge. Why didn't you fix more stuff?\" kind of attack.\n\nA lot of things can happen in four years economically and politically, and people's stars can rise and fall, but I personally don't see a strong shoe-in candidate for Republicans right now. And yes, I hope we have free and fair elections. Do you all see Vance as being able to beat a decent Democrat candidate, especially if this administration keeps the course it set these first two weeks?",

It\u2019s literally just a new spin on the \u201cthere\u2019s no way he can win\u201d nonsense that got us into this mess in the first place back in 2016. \n\nTake a look at what\u2019s happening and ask yourself how we benefit from this sort of resignation. I\u2019m not someone who expects mass protests, and if they did happen I don\u2019t think they\u2019d change a thing, but the political process will continue to play out, and while I wouldn\u2019t put anything past Trump and his cronies, it\u2019s infinitely more productive to idly hope for the democrats to get their shit together at some point and find a way to communicate effectively with the American people than it is to announce that democracy is dead.\n\nPeople think that Russian troll farms work by spreading disinformation, and that\u2019s largely true\u2014but at this point their most effective tactic is to plant this seed of defeat in such a way that it seems to come from our peers. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what this comment is, but it does speak to the insidious effect that these kinds of comments can have on people in the long run. If you give a shit about this country then focus on the midterms so that we can at least put some checks in place by rendering Trump a lame duck.",
