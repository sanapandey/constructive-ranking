    "selftext": "Trump has also talked about a pause in the war as negotiations are initiated and eventual resolution. He has spoken of rare earth minerals from Ukraine for continued support, \\[except most of that land is presently occupied by the Russians.\\]  \n\nMany think that it is possible Trump would be willing to resolve the conflict for concession of land by the Ukrainians. This option may not be acceptable to Ukraine, however, unless they get something significant in return.   \n\nNonetheless, unlike Biden Trump is open to talks with Putin and has promised to do so. Putin recently noted in an interview that he is open to talks with Trump.\n\n\u201cWe always had a business-like, pragmatic but also trusting relationship with the current U.S. president,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree with him that if he had been president, if they hadn\u2019t stolen victory from him in 2020, the crisis that emerged in Ukraine in 2022 could have been avoided.\u201d\n\nIs Trump more likely to escalate the war with more support for Ukraine?\n\n  \n[https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ldpnyewx1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ldpnyewx1o)\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4q7v7ez1o](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4q7v7ez1o)",

(Except maybe selling them out to the Russians). So no, each problem he \"solves\" is either because he is profiting directly or he's following Putin's orders. \"No new wars\" under Trump is a fucking laughable standard by which to measure this because, and you're probably already aware of this because of how smart you are, isn't the only foreign relations issue that exists in the world.

Kyiv falling to Russia would also probably make Trump look weak which he isn't a fan of.

Another big aid package would be hell for Russia especially if it included JASSMs and things like it. The Russian stockpiles are pretty close to empty and Russian production is a tiny fraction of weapons usage but if Trump is unwilling to pass an aid package then there's not a ton that could be done.\n\nPutin may believe he can put enough pressure on Ukraine to the point where American support is rendered irrelevant but the current state of the Russian military makes that extremely difficult. A majority of Russia's artillery shells now come from North Korea, Russian tanks are a rarity on the battlefield and they are trying to advance with civilian vehicles rather than armored vehicles due to the shortages. Russia still might be able to hold out longer than Ukraine but it's not a given.",

The pace of Russian advances has been extremely slow and very costly. The ATACMS were also limited in where they could strike and so they weren't able to hit the most important targets.\n\nBig wars are never just about one type of weapon. If Ukraine has more weapons then it becomes even harder for Russia to advance and Ukrainian advances become easier. The cost of the war rises for Russia and Ukraine can better protect their troops which means manpower is less of an issue. Some if it may be \"more of the same\" but ultimately we're talking about a war of attrition. If Ukraine can get levels of support in 2025 that are as high as they had in 2024 but Russia's ability to support their forces is significantly lower than 2024 then 2025 would be a much better year for Ukraine than Russia and Ukraine would subsequently have significant leverage in any negotiations.",

            "body": "More support for Ukraine isn't an \"escalation.\" Russia is already going all out in a conventional war and so is Ukraine. The point of Minsk II was to avoid further escalation and the point of Biden slow walking aid to Ukraine was also largely to avoid \"escalation\" but the problem with these approaches is that it shows Russia violence works and if they push harder on the west then western leaders will cave. Western weakness has given time for Russia to rebuild their military, build heavy fortifications in Ukraine and has demonstrated that Russian aggression works. Ironically the attempt to \"deescalate\" was in fact a very escalatory move and has made peace harder in Ukraine and more wars involving Russia more likely.\n\nI'm not going to try to predict what Trump will do although I would be surprised if he passes a big new aid package for Ukraine. That said at this point Russia still has maximalist goals in Ukraine and when they talk about \"negotiations\" really what they're saying is that they are willing to accept a full Ukrainian surrender and demilitarization without giving anything up in return. The problem with this approach from Russia is that they just don't have the military strength to make these demands. Maybe if Ukraine was a month away from total collapse those demands would make sense but that's just not the reality. Given the new Danish model of boosting Ukrainian manufacturing, expanded European support, Trump still allowing Biden's aid to Ukraine to flow and the transfer of Russian financial assets to Ukraine it's very likely Ukraine can more or less hold on for at least a year. Russia can probably hold on for about the same amount of time. In other words both sides still have a reasonable shot at winning so major concessions are unlikely.\n\nTLDR: More support to Ukraine isn't an escalation but cowardice and appeasement do have very real escalation risks. Putin's goals for any negotiated settlement are disconnected from the reality on the ground so any peace talks will likely fail in the short term. Trump is unpredictable.",

It's a bit too late for wunderwaffe, and the US probably couldn't produce enough ammo for any wunderwaffe they could supply. Sanctions have been done and aren't enough. With Trump threatening the US's closest and most loyal allies, no one trusts him, so it is unlikely that any other countries can be rallied to squeeze Russia harder. Plus, BRICS is working on a new international settlement mechanism that will undermine dollar hegemony, and he's threatening them too, which will only speed-run the process. He is also gutting the CIA, so he can't even conduct covert operations. With all of that, Trump does not have much to bargain with. Like I said: for all his bluster and tough talk, he has a tiny stick.\n\nThe only threat to Russia at this point is maybe, possibly Europe, if they can get their shit together and are willing to send troops to help reinforce the Ukrainians.",

Ukraine will not achieve its military objectives of reclaiming all lands without additional support by the U.S. or EU, and Russia is too pot committed to pull back with nothing.\n\n(2) Trump seems to believe NATO has outlived its usefulness or at a bare minimum any sense of equity as it\u2019s basically 2/3 U.S. contribution with Europe obliging the U.S. to step up in regional European conflicts while the U.S. wants to pivot more of its energy toward Asia. Trump also seems to think NATO is a contributing factor to making Russia more hostile, whereas the solution might be to pull them in rather than box out.\n\nLike I think above all else Trump wants Europe to step up and to be less adversarial with Russia.\n\nWith that context, these things all seem equally possible to me:\n\n* Trump declares Ukraine Europe\u2019s problem and dares Europe to step up, pulling most support.\n* Trump works to a negotiated deal with some land concessions.\n* Trump offers Putin something else - and likely something Trump doesn\u2019t much about care about - instead to wind down. This might be a clear end and border to NATO & EU expansion, or maybe even changing something about NATO. \n* Putin irks Trump, and so Trump doubles down in support of Ukraine - which also help him dodge his pro Russia critique of his first term.\n* Trump does something else that\u2019s unpredictable",

I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that Ukraine could lose the ability to hold their defensive lines and we could see sudden massive Russian gains including places previously largely untouched like Kharkiv, Odesa or even Kyiv. At the same time if inflation renders Russian money worthless and their Soviet stockpiles are largely depleted then the Russian lines that have held so well in Ukraine could come crashing down if western support to Ukraine continues. Ukraine does have manpower shortages but the more important factor is firepower. If Ukraine has the firepower they need then they can inflict very heavy losses on Russia while sustaining few of their own and the reverse is of course also true. If Ukraine doesn't have the firepower but Russia does then Ukrainian bravery means very little.\n\nComments like \"at this pace it would take Russia 50 years to take Ukraine\" or \"Ukraine just doesn't have the manpower to retake their territory\" essentially assume that change is impossible in war and that the current future will inevitably be an exact continuation of what we're seeing. It's a frequent mistake people make when the reality is that the future is very uncertain and depends a lot on the decisions both sides make and how each side responds to emerging events.",

Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) \u2013 Historically Controlled by the Kremlin\n\t\u2022\tLeader: Metropolitan Onufriy (Onufriy Berezovsky).\n\t\u2022\tAffiliation: Until 2022, this church was officially under the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\t\u2022\tStatus: After Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the UOC (MP) declared it was \u201cindependent\u201d from Moscow but did not receive formal autocephaly.\n\t\u2022\tReality: While it claims independence, it remains spiritually and structurally linked to Moscow, and some of its clergy still express loyalty to Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, who is a strong supporter of the Kremlin and its war policies.\n\t\u2022\tPosition on Russia: Some bishops and clergy support Russia, while others oppose it, leading to internal divisions.\n\t\u2022\tGovernment Action: Ukrainian authorities have investigated the church for pro-Russian activities, with some clergy arrested for collaborating with Russian forces.\n\n3. Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) \u2013 Directly Controlled by the Kremlin\n\t\u2022\tLeader: Patriarch Kirill of Moscow.\n\t\u2022\tStatus: The Russian Orthodox Church is a key institution in Putin\u2019s soft power strategy and closely aligned with the Kremlin.\n\t\u2022\tPresence in Ukraine: The ROC officially does not recognize the OCU and continues to claim Ukraine as part of its \u201ccanonical territory.\u201d\n\t\u2022\tSupport for War: Patriarch Kirill has openly supported Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, calling it a \u201cspiritual struggle\u201d against the West.\n\nSummary of Kremlin Influence\n\t\u2022\tDirect Kremlin Control: Russian Orthodox Church (ROC)\n\t\u2022\tHistorically Kremlin-Aligned, but Claims Independence: Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)\n\t\u2022\tFully Independent & Pro-Ukrainian: Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU)",

A May 2009 poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology indicated that 96% of Ukrainians had a favorable view of Russians as an ethnic group, and 93% respected the Russian Federation. However, by October 2010, positive attitudes had begun to decline, especially in Western and Central Ukraine, while remaining relatively higher in the Eastern regions, including Donbas.  \ufffc\n\nPost-2014 Invasion Sentiments:\n\nThe 2014 annexation of Crimea and the subsequent conflict in Eastern Ukraine led to a shift in public opinion in the Donbas. A survey conducted by the Donetsk Institute for Social Research and Political Analysis in 2014 found that in the Donetsk region:\n\t\u2022\t18.6% opposed any changes to the government structure.\n\t\u2022\t47% favored federalization or greater economic independence from Kyiv.\n\t\u2022\t27% desired to join Russia in some capacity.\n\t\u2022\t5% wished to become an independent state.\n\n\ufffc\n\nBy 2019, a survey by the Centre for East European and International Studies indicated that 55% of residents in areas controlled by the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People\u2019s Republics favored reintegration with Ukraine. Within this group, 24% supported a return to the pre-war administrative system, while 33% preferred special status for the region.  \ufffc",

Putin considers Ukraine's current government illegitimate due to the refusal to lift marshall law and hold new elections when the last term ended. Any agreement could then be thrown out by a new government. The Western greentreers and Proshinko have already acknowledged that Minsk was agreed to in bad faith, and Ukraine never implemented it. Currently Ukraine is suffering a severe manpower shortage. Weapons don't win wars, you need warm hands to hold them. \n\nAs it stands Trump has no real leverage as Russia continues advancing, so the most lucky outcome is the war being fought to its conclusion at the expense of many more lives.",

            "body": "Regardless of what the media or people say what Trump is actually doing is very significant and good. Trump actually immediately gave Ukraine a waiver when halting foreign aid, Trump has also escalated the war significantly providing Ukraine permission to use US made weapons and missiles on any reachable Russian targets inside Russia, removing the heavy restrictions under Biden. Trump had also made a deal with Zelenskyy to continue even expand US support for Ukraine in exchange for access to Ukraines rare earth and so going forward the US will have access and be able to extract a vast amount of rare earth once again dominating the worlds resources. \nOn the other hand Putin is furious and is going to escalate to the very brink of nuclear war to try and scare concessions. He\u2019s even preparing a huge amount of manpower and resources for a potential invasion of NATO Baltic countries which is likely and Putin may do so to try and scare the west and het concessions. Unfortunately Russia appears to be a joke and with another one of its most advanced modern nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles exploding in a test yesterday, it\u2019s a 50% fail rate and not looking good for Russia. Ukraine is taking out Russias vast oil production and refining capacity very effectively day by day Russias economy is on the brink of collapse and getting worse every day. Russia can\u2019t just print trillions of dollars like the US because their dollar doesn\u2019t have the value to absorb the inflation, it would cause a collapse. Russia interest rates are already like 20% or something to try to combat stagflation which is already happening. \n\nThe mainstream medias do not cover news and are deceitful. If you want to pay attention to what is happening around the world these guys do an incredible job and they are 100% independent well educated journalists and nonpartisan. https://youtu.be/hdnmMX-e-To\n\n Not to sound to stoked but the only fear now in all reality is that the Ukraine war escalates to nuclear war. The US is not backing down and neither is NATO or Europe. In fact just yesterday Ukraine received another supply of F-16s and British fighter jets.\n\nEdit: also another bit of good advice, if you use a  internet search engine I highly suggest using Brave. If you watch YouTube through brave you\u2019ll have no adds, no need to pay for a garbage streaming service like Spotify. The Free American way is the best.",

As far as I can tell, what China wants is for the Ukrainian war to grind Russia into the dirt like the Afghan war ground down the Soviet Union so that they can take over Russia as a client State. \n\nSo I expect Trump to give just enough support to drag this war out until the The Russian government faults.",
