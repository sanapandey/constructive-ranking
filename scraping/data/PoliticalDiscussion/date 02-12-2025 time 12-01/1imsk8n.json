    "selftext": "[Trump declines to endorse Vance as 2028 successor](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-declines-endorse-jd-vance-2028-successor-2029106), which lead me to think how he would run for a third term and he has spoke about it before.  \n\nThe [Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states that:\n\n>Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this Article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this Article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this Article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.\n\n>Section 2. This Article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.\n\nThen the [Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) states:\n\n>But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\n\nIt seems rather clear that a President cannot *run* for POTUS after two terms and they are not eligible for being vice president.  I think this sets three scenarios for Trump becoming President a third time.  \n\n**Option 1:** He still runs as President a third time and this may be considered an \"official act.\"  Yes, it's technically against the US Constitution, Amendment 22, but who would be able to stop him if he's legally protected? \n\n**Option 2:** Trump runs for Speaker of the House in 2028, supporting the two others for President and Vice President on the Republican ticket.  They resign after being sworn in and Trump becomes President again.\n\n**Option 3:**  The SCOTUS could look into the ratification since you need 75% of states to agree to the amendment.  We could see that some states \"pull\" their submissions, enough to put it under the threshold or challenge the legality of the original submission.  The SCOTUS takes the case and makes it legal for them to pull their requests, the amendment gets dissolved.  \n\nWhich option do you think Trump would take?  Are there any more possibilities that Trump could try for a third term?",

The election didn't go his way in 2020 so he tried to fucking hire people that would only give him the votes. After the election. Fucking fuck me.",

He is striking out at everything that moves and dares to get in his way. His successor be it Vance or any of the other republican probably younger, will be more like an archer in hitting the target. They will have more of a precisioned strike. \n\nI can back this up by what I have seen in core maga. They are planning something big, something that will shape things for decades to come. They are using trump to recreate the city on the hill. They are trying to change Willsons dream into something different behind the scenes. It is working with the republican party. \n\nWhile we will not see a third term for trump make no mistake we will however see a third maga term and a maga president, a younger person, one that can take the mantal of maga and carry it. Maga will succeed where the tea party failed, where the heritage foundation failed. If what I am seeing from core maga is true look for a few small political non profits coming into being.",

Well that and old age of course.\n\nAnd while many, many people will tell you that you are crazy for even suggesting that he would ever try to do something so plainly in violation of the constitution, I think it\u2019s the one final standard by which we must measure Trump as a person and vis-a-vis the state of US democracy! \n\nThere are good reasons to have this conversation and to take this issue seriously!\n\n1) His continued unwillingness to accept the outcome of the 2020 election and the events on January 6th are clearly the biggest red flag that Trump is absolutely willing to suspend the US constitution if required!\n2) In his usual manner of dealing in language of political ambiguity, he has touched on the subject several times and left unanswered any questions about his true intentions. Thus he has opened Overton window to at least allow for the possibility for this to gain traction. \n3) While a third or fourth term is clearly unconstitutional, we must recognize that it is not automatically undemocratic, nor does talking about cross any red lines philosophically at least. Many functional democracies, arguably more functional than the US, do not have term limits for their executive leader. \n4) Last but not least, there are undoubtedly elements to MAGA that can be described as cultist. In other words, among some Trump supporters, there is an implicit expectation that the 2024 election wasn\u2019t just for 1 presidential cycle. In fact only incumbents have ever run with the voter expectation of serving out only 4 years. And as we all know with Trump, there is no clear succession plan. Will MAGA just shift to Vance?",

The executive branch controlling things like student loans or SSA is silly. Those things should be agencies within and run by congress. It\u2019s like if we divide the power/purview of each branch it\u2019d be 20/10/70 judiciary/legislature/executive, when it should be even. That\u2019s a whole other discussion though.\u00a0",
