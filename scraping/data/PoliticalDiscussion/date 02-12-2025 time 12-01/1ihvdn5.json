But what is missing from this is the power dynamics at play. Our government has been under a sort of plutocratic rule for decades prior to Trump. The Ivy League elites ownership class, if you will. Trump always wanted to be in their club, but at every turn he was denied because... well, because he's Trump. The WHCD may have been the tipping point. Where as before he was allowed on the fringes of the party with connections like the Clintons, Obama made it clear neo liberals didn't want him in their club.\n\nThat's my theory anyway.",

Trump was a major force in the Obama birther conspiracy theory stuff.\n\nIf you don't remember, Obama was accused of being a secret Muslim and that he wasn't a US citizen in 2008.  There were lawsuits that about this issue and Obama was forced to provide his birth certificate publicly to try to stop the drama.  It didn't fully work but by 2011 it had mostly died down.\n\nExcept Donald Trump got involved in 2011 saying that he had \"real doubts\" that the birth certificate was valid.  He held a press conference claiming he had sent private investigators to Hawaii and offered $5m to anyone that could convince Trump that Obama was born on US soil.  Trump claimed at one point that he point the Obama birther accusations to rest here.\n\nBut was that true?  [2012](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/232572505238433794?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw&mx=2) [2013](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/411247268763676673?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [2014](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/508194635270062080?ref\\_src=twsrc%5Etfw).   In 2016, when compaigning he dropped it and took credit for Obama releasing his birth certificate and blamed Hilary Clinton for the accusations.  But in [2017](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/28/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-birth-certificate-nyt/index.html) he was back to peddling the conspiracy.\n\nIn retrospect, he either developed the biggest vendetta against Obama or he was trying to use Obama as a pawn to get attention for his own campaign.",

Something like that.\n\nThe look of absolute shock on both his and Melania's face when they won in 2016, I think speaks volumes.

At some point he has spoken *against* nearly everything he now speaks \"for\". As just one example, he noted how the whole anti-trans thing seemed to really fire people up - and what do you know, after having never once mentioned in, suddenly started one-upping everyone else on the anti-trans rhetoric.\n\nHe's a psychopath, plain and simple, who just wanted to be a respected and successful reality TV show star, IMO.
