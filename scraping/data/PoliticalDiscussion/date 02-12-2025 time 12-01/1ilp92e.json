Given that the Trump administration has made both economic and territorial threats against both Canada and Greenland, I am wondering what sort of political obstacles might need to be overcome to facilitate entry of a non-European country into the EU.",

If a country like Canada (or also Ukraine for example), who are major producers of agricultural goods would become an EU member this would absolutely blow up the EU market for agricultural goods and possibly destroy local producers.\n\nSo it's not only about principles of democracy or whatever, it's policies that have been worked on and balanced based on the characteristics and needs of the EU countries for years. Canada as a major player in the western world could really affect this balance. The process of acquiring EU membership takes many years for a reason.",
