If trump\u2019s tariffs do take effect and prices rise, are they ever likely to come back down?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen before prices increase during periods of inflation and rarely ever do they come back down, but rather stabilize. Does this indicate that if we go through another dramatic period of inflation due to tariffs those higher prices will be the new norm going forward? ",

Generally this is by competition stepping in and undercutting the current bosses. Think Walmart undercutting Sears or the swarm of isps offering unlimited internet to take down AOL and similar models.\u00a0 Disruption and competition.\u00a0\n\n\nThis,\u00a0 sadly,\u00a0 is where you need more cool economic Conservative heads that looks into what stops new businesses from growing along with a more Liberal head to snipe at monopolistic practices.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWe are kind of short on both at the moment.\u00a0\n\n\nBut in any case,\u00a0 you can deflate food and the housing market without trying to push the rest down.\u00a0 That will create a lot of relief without toppling the entire system. Meanwhile incomes going up can help soften the rest of inflation pain,\u00a0 at least to a new normal.\u00a0",

That has another name: economic suicide. It doesn't help protect jobs or industries because any major good is used in high enough demand that it creates domestic jobs: factory workers using it to make parts, logistics employees shipping it, administration, etc.\n\nThat loses the market and job arguments for a targeted tariff and just becomes a lose-lose-lose.

Look at the US stance towards the WTO; it's an international institution that's now been hollowed out because the US refused any nominations to it's appeals court. The rest of the world has basically now moved on to form their own trade arbitration organization leaving the US behind. \n\nFeel free to also look up Biden's chip export controls, on our allies. Still trying to understand that one.\n\nThen there's the blocking of the US steel acquisition on national security grounds, when the acquiring party was Japanese. Last I checked, Japan was an ally. \n\nHad any of these things been enacted been trump, democrats would have torn him a new one. But Biden gets a pass from a lot of Democrats for his policy failures.

Additionally gas prices have become a massive political argument in America, so politicians try to drive the prices down before elections.\n\nYou won't find many goods with a price that falls at the rate gas does because of this very public information and reasonably high rate of competition along with outright government intervention. Even so I'm sure that you notice gas prices shoot up quickly and drop far more slowly. With goods that do not have the same level of competition, where the prices aren't literally the only selling point and posted on giant signs outside the store, where the politicians aren't going to pressure businesses to keep prices lower, price drops will occur at a glacial speed because of corporate greed.",

Much like the prices shooting up and drifting down we discussed earlier, the theoretical market adjustment tends to be very one sided in favor of the party with power if they ever actually happen. The net result of cutting government subsidies to individuals will just be to make them more dependent on their employer, giving the employer more bargaining power. You're assuming that there will be an upward wage pressure from people leaving their jobs, but right now there is already too much competition for bad jobs and rampant employer exploitation because of it.\n\nAlso, people have to work if they want to survive.

Not a great choice.\n\n\nI'm not saying that people aren't ultimately responsible for their own lives, but there is only so much within an average person's control. Only someone who is already economically stable enough to not be a check away from eviction can quit a job on a whim, and anyone with employee provided health insurance and a chronic illness is fucked if they try to do so. Economically stable people are not the ones working at low paying jobs.\u00a0\n\n\nGDP is not a measure of economic opportunity. Are you going to move to China for better wages and less exploitative labor? Their GDP is bigger than ours depending on how you measure (PPP vs nominal), and bigger than any country except the US regardless. Yet I doubt you're advocating for Chinese labor practices.\u00a0",

            "body": "What tariffs will effect: Companies will have to pay more to export to the US, so they will increase the price. It may even be that they increase it too much, because the consumers expect the prices to increase (greedflation).\n\nThere are two options: The consumer would pay the price, or he would not. In case he paid the price everything will be nice, nobody cares about that. But this is not going to happen as long as the salaries stay the same, because when everything goes up in price by x% you can buy y% less, which means that the second one will happen: Consumers will not pay the price:\n\nLets imagine the company is from Europe. It is dependent in the US maket and wont be able to produce more without the money from the exports. They have two options: Lower production for EU markets and anywhere or producing in the US, which would be a major invest and thus not that likely, because the european economy was and is struggling and the companies have to get back on their feet before they will be able to run to another continent. It is likely that these companies might be dependent on subsidies from the EU or the home country, or they will break down their production, which would mean higher unemployment and an even worse economical situation in europe.\n\nThis way US companys could just infiltrate the EU market later due to economical breakdown in Europe (you call it neocolonialism). To avoid this the EU will launch tariffs as well, so the companies, that used to export to europe, wont export anymore, or produce in europe themselves. This means that the companies from europe will profit from it in their own market, just like the US companies will make more profit in the US market, but it will be less than before, because on both sides the production would go down at first. Thus the prices will be higher and there could be unemployment (just imagine europe would start tariffs on US software and social media and would build their own software and media companies, amazon, google, meta, microsoft, twitter s.o. would lose all of their profit in Europe, so they would have to think smaller in the US).\n\nSo to break it down: First the production will be lower, unemployment will be higher, just like prices. Only the big companies that already produce in the other marlets will profit. We will see that rich people get even richer and spread themselves to produce the things that are high in price due to the tariffs. This is step 2:\n\nBuilding new companies in Europe and the US. The people who dont have jobs anymore have to do something, and the high prices call for high profits for investors in the own country. Manufacturing would go up in the US. This is when things should become better, but there are two major problems:\n\n\\- social inequality would be higher than before (the people who invested in Trump and the republican party will like that)\n\n\\- What if the workers are not qualified for the new jobs?\n\nI dont want to discuss the first point, only the second one. Economical change needs time. Workers on farmland are not qualified for building machines, installing electrical infrastructure; They have to learn it for at least 3-5, maybe even 10 years. What if this worker was old? Too bad, there is no income and you wont be able to increase your income the years after you learned something new, not to mention that older people might learn less fast. In conclusion you need new young qualified workers. Not possible in the US right now, with relatively bad education and companies that lost many workers (you have to imagine that the tariffs are already reality) and wont be able to educate new workers.\n\nTo come to a final conclusion: It is highly likely that tariffs will harm the economy irreversibly, and it is far too unlikely that it will build up a better economy with this low education standards and this low fertile rate (at least without highly qualified workers from abroad, well, this does not work in the american society). A bad economy is always way too dependent on governmental subsidies or billionaires who could invest. This in combination with tariffs is way too risky, espacially when you take into account that China could invest in production in the US, because the unemployed workers need to work for any price and China has the know how. Tariffs are not a rational conclusion from the actual problems that a highly developed country has. Your products are not as good as products from the EU? Go ahead, improve the products, like China did with AI. Go ahead, adapt regulations like they exist in the EU. Because this is the actual problem: Bad products and way too less industry.",

I can tell you what happened there: \n- In general, and first of all, prices go up. \n- When local industry can provide the same good, usually they won't do so at previous prices, they will also be higher, cheaper than the imported ones enough as to take their market, but more expensive that they'd be on a tariff-less market as they have less competition on the same playing field. \n- Goods that are not locally produced, might start being locally produced to take some market from the imported goods by doing the same as above. Those will usually be lower quality as they're brought to market in a relative rush and without proper competition. \n- For end consumer goods at least, contraband might start popping up a lot more, with items with high tariffs being brought into the country and sold through grey or black markets for cheaper than they would with full tariffs, but still more expensive than they would without tariffs. \n\nAfter tariffs disappear, it's hard to predict what will happen as it'll depend on the good and how much competition there is on that market, some prices might drop, though unlikely it'll go back to previous prices, and most will most likely remain the same as companies kinda collude to not lower their prices, they might get levelled and you might have more choice on the same price point, but not have one as low as it was prior. \n\nOf course theres more to it but these are some of the main scenarios that came to mind first.",

Maybe it will make it profitable for people to start producing those items but even if that is the case, it does not help the prices that are going to go up. Billy had an apple orchard but with the higher cost of everything he had to sell his apples for $40 a bushel to make ends meet. The wholesalers can buy imported apples for $20 a bushel So Billy clears the orchard and grows something else. Boom tariffs make the imported apples $50 a bushel. Billy would love to sell apples but it takes 10 years to get an orchard to production. So we are stuck with imports. Even if Billy still has his orchard he is going to sell at $45 so there is zero chance of the prices coming down to pre tariff levels.

The only real purpose of tariffs is to increase revenue for the government, but it's at the expense of consumers. Using tariffs to promote local job growth works, but at an insane cost. I hope you're right that this blows up in two weeks and ends.",

That isn't what a trade deficit is - that's a fundamental misunderstanding of the term. We are not giving them any extra money. We're buying more products from them than they're buying from us - that's only because of the size and composition of our respective economies. You have a trade deficit with your grocery store. Having a trade deficit isn't \"costing\" us any extra money, and tariffs won't fix the situation because we can't replace what we're buying in the short term, probably not even in the long term.\n\n>You guys want slave labor in Mexico\n\nHmm, so Republicans are the ones booting out honest Mexican workers wanting to come to America for better economic prospects under the guise of mass crime that isn't happening, but it's liberals that want to subject them to \"slave labor\" in Mexico? These workers come here for better pay, they're not facing great conditions in America but it seems like many have decided their best bet is working here. Migrant workers aren't compelled to come here - quite the contrary - but they still do it. What does that tell you?

We should grant every single hard working immigrants here citizenship, pay them an actual living wage, and ensure they are treated with respect.
