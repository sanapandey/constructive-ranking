Australia is often known as a country with more rational politics yet with this culture war around the Indigenous People happening, do you think the GOP and the Conservative media will take note and begin to start attacking Indigenous Policies?",

What's left of Indian rights in the US are firmly in the reservations or just accepted as a fact of life at this point. Land Back and other similar movements are entirely dead in the water and have no chance of becoming mainstream. Native Americans make up less than 3% of the US population, and almost all of them are in western states that are already low population and mostly Trump voting (aka not adopting any conciliatory measures anytime soon).\n\nIt has happened in the past and could theoretically come up again, I'll admit, and in ways that might be odd for outsiders. One of the ironic situations considering stereotypes is that Native Americans clash with the US environmental protection laws as their treaty rights permit them to go outside of US law for things like fishing and whaling, which has caused problems in the past. \n\nIn Wisconsin where I live, we're taught in college about a political crisis in which the Ojibwe tried to practice their treaty rights to fishing even beyond the state DNR's seasons and at risk of depleting fish populations, which was so vitriolic that you can still find 1970s papers referring to Indians as \"Timber N\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s\".\n\nNowadays, the closest I can think of is a feud between a local tribe and their small city neighbors about the use of one road that cuts through reservation land that was built without tribe permission and they want compensation for that.",

More and more, indigenous reconciliation is justice, and land acknowledgements and funds that end up just in chiefs\u2019 trucks and house extension and not the roads and hospitals isn\u2019t nearly enough, to say nothing of boil water advisorie still at centre stage when it comes to First Nations, M\u00e9tis, and Inuit reconciliation in Canada.\n\nIssue is, these things have all cost the government and taxpayers billions, and it\u2019s at a point where no one knows where the money is going, because it absolutely is not ending up in the communities they need to. Or at least that is all most media except our state broadcaster cares about. Shout out your ABC, they do awesome work. Mostly funds are going to meeting needs like prescription drugs and childcare.\n\nThe political side is that voters across the spectrum, barring the far left in Canada, care only about reconciliation only as far that there aren\u2019t moneys being put in that aren\u2019t staying in these communities, reservations, or in the northern territories.\n\nFrom a geopolitical standpoint, these are lands that need to be developed for a whole host of reasons, from resource development to military security, but a lack of vision and unity by all parties, and a resistance by all to have the Canadian government roll in do what it\u2019s always done: let private companies bid on taking care of public interests and services, holds back any real generational progress.\n\nAs a white dude aligned with indigenous people though, it\u2019s easy for me to see it and say \u2018all nations aren\u2019t the same and don\u2019t all want the same thing\u2019 while also acknowledging that even though we\u2019re on stolen land, we also don\u2019t know what indigenous stewardship of reclaimed lands look like. That also being said, land back, as it\u2019s known here, is a movement that has neither the capital nor influence to affect politics as it might have here in Canada 10+ years ago when Canada\u2019s left was more ascendant and the right in power, but it could be wielded as an answer to anti-reconciliation. How though, I don\u2019t know.\n\nOur Conservative Party has been attacking indigenous people for forever. The current leader has a terrible record on a variety of issues, chiefly playing up the culture war and that reservations are a waste of money and government resources.\n\nI don\u2019t know ultimately if America is even there. They have far fewer indigenous people by every metric, and their colonial and genocidal history hasn\u2019t entered the political and cultural lexicon; which means that it could be the perfect wedge issue to get loads of people on board, or at least keep the MAGA train moving. But since most Americans don\u2019t even think about indigenous people, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible.",

A huge part of that was owing to their status as defeated hostiles during the settlement of the American West, as well as their mass de-culturalization via efforts of the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the first half of the 20th century (a kind of forced Christianization ethnic cleansing). Americans don't have this kind of collective guilt or burden for the extermination & desecration of Native ppl that Australians have. Moreover in the past 30 yrs we've partially remediated these wrongs by allowing tribes to build & operate casinos on their reservations, with all members of these tribes sharing in the profits & lifting their communities to upper-middle-class status.\n\nIs it possible that the Alt Right will turn their furor towards these Indian casinos? Maybe, if MAGA thinks they can strong arm these tribes into a deal which gives state governments a cut of the profits. But the Alt Right is very reactionary & isn't strategic about deal-making.",

That's present harm. They were confined to the worst land in the country and given no viable path to economic success, save for gambling.\n\nFurthermore, the Indian child welfare act, passed in 1978, which allowed, essentially, for the straight up abduction of Native American children, and who's displacement rates from their family continue to be the highest of any group in the country, was only redrafted for the first time in 2016. \n\nI could go on.

I'm sure you won't try to defend a third of native children being removed from their family, culture, and nation.\n\nEither way, either you believe that indigenous people are sovereign powers, or you believe that they're essentially vassals of the US, and we should be able to decide what to do with the kids of a foreign government.
