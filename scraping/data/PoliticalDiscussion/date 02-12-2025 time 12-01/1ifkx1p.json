    "selftext": "I've been thinking about this topic lately and was curious as to other's thoughts. Once bad information became a noticeable issue online platforms went to third party fact checkers, and it seemed to work okay but during covid there ended up being a lot of tensions surrounding exactly when it was alright to remove something for being \"misinformation\", and who's to way what constitutes misinformation, etc. \n\nEventually Twitter/X had the idea to move to the community notes system, which has a good record in terms of accuracy but a debatable track record in actually stopping bad information from propagating. Now with the announcement that Meta is moving towards a community notes approach, a lot of people seem upset that they'd do this, and Zuck announcing this change has a lot of people associating the change with a move to being right wing?\n\nWhat do we think is the best way to counter misinformation then? A community based fact checking system seems good in spirit, it makes it so that people can't accuse the platform of having partisan skews with regards to what's \"true\", but people don't seem happy with the solution. Thoughts?",

Conservative Christians in the US had a *much* larger reason to be willing to adopt it than, say, random Buddhists in Japan.  There's a reason it 'evolved' in the 1960s as a reaction to waning church influence the scientific and information revolution taking place over the 20th century.\n\nAn [article like this](https://web.archive.org/web/20180215003538/https://www.infowars.com/report-florida-shooter-inspired-by-isis-allahu-akbar/) will find an audience despite anyone with a somewhat critical mind being able to read it and go \"Kit Daniels, are you a complete and utter moron?\" (Fyi, yes)\n\nAll the things needed to \"debunk\" the article are contained *within the article itself*, and so it wouldn't get much traction beyond the *least* critical *most* obsessed infowars fans.\n\nOther misinformation can prove more resilient.  Sometimes it's innocuous, like [citogenesis feedback loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_citogenesis_incidents) ([Here's the xkcd comic on it](https://xkcd.com/978/))\n\nSometimes it becomes part of [national myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_myth) to where the veracity is no longer relevant, it doesn't *need* to be 'true'.  \n\nAnd other times it can be incredibly harmful, like \"vaccines cause Autism\" which found refuge in people who *really* wanted something to blame for autism and were quick to latch onto something making the claim.\n\nThere is no \"one size fits all\" catch to inoculate all populations from all forms of misinformation.  Even teaching \"critical thinking\" does not prevent sophisticated bullshit from having legs.\n\nBut in face of all misinformation I think it's helpful to take a moment and recognize that *information* has spread to far more people than ever before.  Yes, there is a *lot* of misinformation.  But even the *most* misinformed individuals are better off than their counterparts from the past.\n\nBelief systems that began crumbling over the 20th century now seem incredibly antiquated today.  Reality does have a way of demonstrating itself.",

Who really cares if a portion of the population thinks the world is 6,000 years old? That belief system isn't undermining the fabric of our culture or the political stability of our country. \n\nThe real problem is with *disinformation*, intentionally manufactured dishonest narratives produced and spread with malign intent.  Today either 30% of Americans think the 2020 election was rigged, or find that divisive narrative useful enough to lie about it when polled. \n\nIt has become very clear that a great many people either believe the lies they have been told, in support of their sociopolitical views, or choose to support those lies, even knowing they're dishonest.",

In fact they are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories that contradict other firmly held beliefs. Heck even within Young Earth Creationism there's contradictory beliefs. Like the idea that the Ark only 1000 animals, then the other 1.5 million species hyper evolved from them in a couple hundred years,  but they'll simultaneously say that \"macro\" evolution is impossible. \n\nTo be clear I'm not labeling everyone of them a conspiracy theorist. I'm sure most have never really looked at it, or have and decided that they'll just believe in anyways despite the scientific evidence. I'm referring to YEC that not only believe the Earth is 6000 years old, but that all the scientific evidence supports that theory.",

                            "body": ">That belief system isn't undermining the fabric of our culture or the political stability of our country. \n\nI think that's a bit too linear a thought pattern, and feeds into the \"disinformation\"/\"misinformation\" distinction you're conjuring.\n\nTo begin with, it's not that \"the fabric of our country\" relies on the age of the earth, but *why* people believe that is a very different matter, and why people are *susceptible* to that belief is very important for politics.\n\nFor instance, the current speaker of the house, Mike Johnson, [was interviewed by Ken Ham on Tony Perkin's podcast](https://bottradionetwork.com/ministry/washington-watch/2021-06-07-ken-ham-brad-jurkovich-burgess-owens-ray-comfort-2/).\n\nTheir *politics* is informed by the belief that the bible is \"the word of god\", literally, and that any dissent from the bible *questions their politics*.  They believe that if the bible is treated as \"metaphor\" then suddenly it becomes a lot less viable from a political standpoint.\n\nThat's motivated reasoning, and I'm unclear how much it really matters if their belief is \"sincere\" or not, I'm not sure Ken Ham himself understands he's constantly *lying* about everything.\n\nIn the same way that I'm not sure how much Kit Daniels was *lying* in that insipidly stupid article.  It is dishonest, without question, but it's dishonest because as a human being Kit Daniels is not capable of intellectual honesty.  He doesn't understand how to do it.\n\nTake his [deposition](https://youtu.be/1fQEXKgT-1M?t=2667) as a case study.  In the article he posts a picture of Nikolas Cruz saying \"well at least now we know what a sand d-rka means when he says Allahu Akbar\" and Kit Daniels admits to not knowing what that means.\n\nI believe him.  I believe that as he says those words it doesn't occur to him to think about the phrase, that part of his brain might recognize \"oh that's a derogatory slur\" but another part is going \"yeah but maybe it isn't\".\n\nThat when he says he has no idea what the phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" means, he's honest, he really has no clue what it means, and has *never* bothered to ask the question.\n\nSo when he writes an article accusing Nikolas Cruz of being a \"communist\" and \"supported ISIS\", he both believes it, and doesn't *care* if it's not true, because he *can't* care.  He can't be bothered to elicit the kind of critical thinking needed to question it.\n\nIf he could, he wouldn't write that article.  Because anyone with that degree of critical thinking would at least stop and say \"maybe lets not post an image of a derogatory slur in the article I'm using to say he's supporting ISIS in Syria\".\n\nThat's beyond \"dishonesty\" and goes straight to \"idiocy\".  He isn't clever enough to be *purposefully* dishonest, he's *naturally* dishonest.\n\nI find Trump operates on the same type of principle.  Trump does not give a shit about \"truth\".  He doesn't care if lies are transparent.  He is an intellectual mayfly whose concept of \"information\" extends to immediate expediency and is abandoned shortly after.  There is no ontology attached to his words.\n\nThe reason people *believe* it though, is that they're *susceptible*, in the same way Mike Johnson is *susceptible* to young earth creationism.  Because taking it as true supports a wide variety of other beliefs that establish their worldview and abandoning that would challenge a lot of other fundamental assumptions that they *do not* want to question.\n\nSophisticated bullshit, or trivial bullshit, misinformation or disinformation, any type of \"wrong\" set of information passed around to an audience needs an audience who is *susceptible* to believe it to begin with.  Same with *information*.\n\nThey are evolutionary systems, open to selection, and there's never a single type of solution to deal with all sorts of bullshit, purposefully malignant, or accidentally.",

Yet the people doing all the things you're talking about, don't seem to be more than about 1/3 of the country. \n\nYour failure is in not understanding that people are perfectly capable of accepting as true, entirely contradictory ideas. People can believe in God and creationism, and still accept the fact that this planet is billions of years old and that evolution is a reality. People can believe in angels and ghosts and still understand physics and thermodynamics, respect education and dismiss conspiracy thinking. And they can do this without any mental discomfort or cognitive dissonance. \n\nIt's likely you hold multiple contradictions like this in your own head, but remain largely unaware of them. I know I have stumbled on a few of those contradictions in my understanding of existence. It doesn't worry me.",

This is what went wrong and what needs to be fixed if the country is to have any chance of being fixed.\n\nIn the past we had laws that limited corporate interference in elections.  Campaign contribution limits, registration and rules as a PAC, etc.  During a few months leading up to an election, networks used to be very concerned about giving each candidate equal time so they wouldn't be characterized as a PAC.  \n\nBut Citizens United threw all that out the window.  Now Twitter can change its algorithm to push right wing content up until election day with impunity.\n\nThe only answer is to reverse those Supreme Court cases and strip Corporations of the ability to interfere with US elections.  Give Congress the ability to pass laws that limit what they can say during election season.  \n\nWhat they come up with won't be perfect, but it doesn't have to be.  They will fight over spending limits and what is and whether algorithms are political speech, and it will all change depending on who has control and that's fine.  Maybe they will even have an exception for legitimate news organizations and then fight over what qualifies as legitimate news.  \n\nThe point is corporations should walk on eggshells when it comes to election interference. If you are not a flesh and blood person, you don't have a Constitutional right to talk about politics.  \n\nLet Elon own Twitter directly like it's a lemonade stand if he wants it to push political ideas.
