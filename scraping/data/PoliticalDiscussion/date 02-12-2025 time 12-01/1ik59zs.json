    "selftext": "In recent weeks since Trump came back into the presidency, much of the political commentary, especially angst on the part of the left, is directed toward Elon Musk's DOGE team of young engineers accessing various governmental agencies with the approval of Trump. The goal is supposedly to root out inefficiencies and eliminated programs and policies that are contrary to Trump's executive orders. A lot of the attention has been focused on how young and inexperienced these techies are and how they might not understand what they are doing to the inner workings of the departments they are reviewing.\n\nBack in 2009, after Barack Obama came into office, a much different media environment existed where the flock of young staffers, policy gurus and even techies from what was then a mostly Democratic Silicon Valley, were praised and given supportive backing by many of the same journalist outlets. The profiles were largely about how these eager college grads would transform government and bring it into the 21st century while also repudiating anything under the then despised outgoing president George W. Bush.\n\nWhy do you think the attention on the young cohort of government whiz kids is so different from today under Trump than it was under Obama? Is it just partisan bias? What similarities and differences are there between the two? How have Republicans and Democrats reacted in both cases? Is the media treatment fair or just shaped by different environments (social media now v. traditional media with a hint of social then)?",

That money was appointed by Congress for that purpose and went unspent.

[Here's an article](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/can-a-president-refuse-to-spend-funds-approved-by-congress) that details some of the history of that law - including how very early presidents use impoundment, and the Constitutional arguments over it.\n\nThere's a long, long centuries-long history of presidents spending money that they *didn't* want to spend, with occasional impoundments like Jefferson's, often in smaller or more localized situations, often under friendly circumstances (as in the case of Jefferson basically saying, \"hey, Congress, you sure you want quite this many boats? lemme know\"). Until Nixon, there wasn't really a president who tried to claim that he could basically just ignore Congress and spend or not spend as he preferred - *that's* where it gets pretty hard to argue that impoundment could be Constitutional.\n\nIn response to Nixon, the ICA helped to resolve that conflict:\n\n>Congress passed the\u00a0[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/house-bill/7130)\u00a0in response to the controversy. Title X in the act is commonly referred to as the Impoundment Control Act (or ICA), and it requires the president to report to Congress when he impounds funds as a deferment (or a temporary delay) or a recission (a permanent cancellation) of spending. Under the ICA, spending deferrals must not extend beyond the current fiscal year, and Congress can override deferrals using an expedited process. For recissions, the president must propose such actions to Congress for approval, and he\u00a0[can delay spending](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/683)\\-related to recissions for 45 days. Unless Congress approves the recission request, the funds must be released for spending.",
