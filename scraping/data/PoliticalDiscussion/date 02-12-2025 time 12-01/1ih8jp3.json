    "selftext": "Elon Musk with the blessing of President Trump is focusing on shutting down or derailing USAID, which has been the primary American funding source for many international NGOs. These NGOs, which lean-left, are alarmed that Musk will dismantle their initiatives and thus prevent the NGOs from being funded in the future.\n\nDemocrats have raised concerns that not only is Musk not qualified to examine USAID despite his mandate as DOGE chairman, but that he will freeze funding permanently, whether or not a court enjoins the funding pause. Moreover, many progressives have voiced a call to action to save USAID. However, such actions may be moot given that the Republicans will likely use the reconciliation bill that doesn't require any Democratic votes to defund USAID as well as enacting the GOP's other priorities such as tax cuts. That will make any court order inoperable as without funding USAID would be dead either way.\n\nWhat do you think about Musk and the USAID brouhaha? Who do you think will win ultimately? How will Democrats respond? How will Republicans respond?",

I'm looking at the Capitol to see what happens if they get tired and wary of being a river stamp for Trump. If the US is making a turn towards authoritarianism of the fascist kind, I would think he has to nullify Congress and the Senate. I'm not talking executions or imprisonment, but something less violent. If he did choose violence though, and had to show his cards in order to be violent towards his own, I wonder if his support would drop off.\n\nMy hope is that at some point he hits some moderate Republican elected officials where it hurts (e.g. their constituencies) and they refuse to ratify/endorse something. It is possible, it has happened, and I think it's more likely as time goes on.",

Didn't really even involve myself too much in politics before Career Criminal Trump started getting involved in shit circa 2000.  A lot of younger people or less-read people don't realize exactly how much Trump was generally referred to as a \"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\" WRT crime and corruption back then, before he had a political party behind him and/or was electable in any way.  His own state NY has been trying to take his criminal ass down since I was a kid and I'm approaching middle-age now.\n\n> Open your eyes and use your common sense. \n\nI've got a lot of that, and it all informs the above.  As does my own research - not just listening to party lines despite the fact I'm sorta supportive of the DNC of late.\n\n> Anyone with half a brain could see the truth\n\nClearly almost nobody with a college degree has \"half a brain\" by your accounting. It's kinda sad to judge someone's intelligence based on whether they agree with your contentious issues.\n\n> The Democrats are anti-American\n\nWhat is \"anti-American\" to you?  Because in 2016 Trump enlisted the help of *an actual enemy nation* and his own party patted him on the back for it.  \n\n> They speak about our Democracy. Our CONSTITUTIONAL Republic.  Look up the definition of both and see what you come up with. \n\nYou seem to be making the common mistake of thinking that a Democracy and a Constitutional Republic are mutually exclusive concepts.  Democracy is the term of a family of government types where leadership is ultimately determined by votes.  Constitutional Republic is a form of representative government (yes, a Republic) that *can* (and in our case IS) be a Democracy.  \n\nBut more importantly, the heart of American philosophy is twofold.  \"We the people\" is meant to preface a country that is BY the people and FOR the people, and exists to serve the people.  Representatives are largely meant to prevent something called Tyranny of the majority.  We as a country are used to being run over by evil despots, and that is the very heart of what we oppose, sitting otherwise on a foundation of Common Law.  \n\nWhat Trump is doing is the DEFINITION of un-American.  He is severing the checks and balances that prevent him from becoming a King, specifically making changes that fall SOLIDLY in the realm of \"Tyranny of the Majority\" even when sometimes it's not even the majority that agrees with tyrannizing the people in question.\n\nNot only am I not wrong, but I think you need to go back to High School history class.  Preferably not in a Southern state that rewrites history to fit their own narrative.",

And unlike the president (until SCOTUS ass-pulls a redefinition of immunity to include everyone who works for the president), these workers are not protected from civil contempt proceedings. If a judge orders the administration to do something and they don't comply, the judge may order the people directly responsible for performing those actions (like the teenage nerds running the Treasury payment system right now) to be fined or jailed until they comply. Of course, Trump could fire those people to prevent them from doing it and then replace them with new, more steadfast loyalists, thus restarting the cycle and ultimately accomplishing the goal of paralyzing the government. At some point though things will reach a breaking point and it's anyone's guess what happens after that.",

Both parties are lustful for it and, no matter what politicians say, it is the controlling factor. Obvious but true. Ironically, since it mostly comes from corporate entities and is no doubt built into the prices and fees charged their customers (that is, us), one might say it's our own money being used against us in a way. It provides great wealth to many politicians during their active career, and that oh so important \"pot of gold\" when leaving office. So we shouldn't wonder why the Democrats have been so cautious and careful for many decades now not to offend too much the monied elites with such matters as working class economics (for all Americans and not just minorities), and (horrors) tax fairness policies.

It's the underlying trait behind it all.\n\n>His government was constantly in chaos, with officials having no idea what he wanted them to do, and nobody was entirely clear who was actually in charge of what. He procrastinated wildly when asked to make difficult decisions, and would often end up relying on gut feeling, leaving even close allies in the dark about his plans. His \"unreliability had those who worked with him pulling out their hair,\" as his confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl later wrote in his memoir Zwischen Wei\u00dfem und Braunem Haus. This meant that rather than carrying out the duties of state, they spent most of their time in-fighting and back-stabbing each other in an attempt to either win his approval or avoid his attention altogether, depending on what mood he was in that day.\n\n>There's a bit of an argument among historians about whether this was a deliberate ploy on Hitler's part to get his own way, or whether he was just really, really bad at being in charge of stuff. Dietrich himself came down on the side of it being a cunning tactic to sow division and chaos\u2014and it's undeniable that he was very effective at that. But when you look at Hitler's personal habits, it's hard to shake the feeling that it was just a natural result of putting a workshy narcissist in charge of a country.\n\n>Hitler was incredibly lazy. According to his aide Fritz Wiedemann, even when he was in Berlin he wouldn't get out of bed until after 11 a.m., and wouldn't do much before lunch other than read what the newspapers had to say about him, the press cuttings being dutifully delivered to him by Dietrich.\n\n>He was obsessed with the media and celebrity, and often seems to have viewed himself through that lens. He once described himself as \"the greatest actor in Europe,\" and wrote to a friend, \"I believe my life is the greatest novel in world history.\" In many of his personal habits he came across as strange or even childish\u2014he would have regular naps during the day, he would bite his fingernails at the dinner table, and he had a remarkably sweet tooth that led him to eat \"prodigious amounts of cake\" and \"put so many lumps of sugar in his cup that there was hardly any room for the tea.\"\n\n>He was deeply insecure about his own lack of knowledge, preferring to either ignore information that contradicted his preconceptions, or to lash out at the expertise of others. He hated being laughed at, but enjoyed it when other people were the butt of the joke (he would perform mocking impressions of people he disliked). But he also craved the approval of those he disdained, and his mood would quickly improve if a newspaper wrote something complimentary about him.\n\n>Little of this was especially secret or unknown at the time. It's why so many people failed to take Hitler seriously until it was too late, dismissing him as merely a \"half-mad rascal\" or a \"man with a beery vocal organ.\" In a sense, they weren't wrong. In another, much more important sense, they were as wrong as it's possible to get.\n\n>Hitler's personal failings didn't stop him having an uncanny instinct for political rhetoric that would gain mass appeal, and it turns out you don't actually need to have a particularly competent or functional government to do terrible things.\n\n- from Humans by Tom Phillips",

Technically, the way Musk used proxy leaders to let him walk in when he couldn't have been authorized legally to do what he's doing is a form of advanced Social Engineering.\n\n> it\u2019s common for some to lose access to a system when being audited\n\nNot in my fucking line of work, which is IT and computer systems.  I have worked in companies and government contracts between 2 and 20,000 people and have never ONCE seen a single person locked out for an audit.\n\n> no one is being held hostage\n\nThe TREASURY is, by Musk's own admission.  He has made clear he intends to prevent congressionally approved funds from transferring, in direct opposition to the law of the land.\n\n> if the president is ordering something it\u2019s the president making the call\n\nThe president does not have these rights.  When he tried to do it the legal way in writing, the injunctions were immediate and he had no case.  So he dumped the order and now Musk is doing the same things he legally couldn't have done directly.\n\n> he isn\u2019t making felonious actions, who told you he was?  Reddit?\n\nMy own history in IT.  Criminal lawyers that I know (and others who publish) whose opinions I trust.  Who told you it wasn't? An alt-right subreddit?\n\n> government hasn\u2019t been stolen and democracy hasn\u2019t ended.  The president is auditing a gov agency \n\nConsidering from your reply you know fucking shit about shit, I think I'm going to believe the experts over you.  Not that you give a fuck.  *But of note, there is a court injunction on Musk's crimes, and the DOJ is actively ignoring it.*  The DOJ ignoring the law because the president ordered them to is what we call \"the government has been stolen and democracy is dying\" in most countries.\n\nIf congress started considering impeachment and members got \"detained indefinitely in case they might have commit a crime at some point\", would you continue to defend this horse-shit?  At what point do you START caring about what's true?",

The bill is signed into law and the treasury prints $100 million to be spent to comply with this bill. Now, it\u2019s up to the executive branch to determine how it\u2019s spent. Perhaps they interview some private contractors and award contracts to cleaning companies and construction companies. Perhaps they spend some of the money internally to pay FEMA employees overtime work, who knows. Point being, the president has some leeway on how it\u2019s spent and who the money goes to, but he can\u2019t really just refuse to spend it. If Congress passes a law that appropriates funds and charges the executive with spending those funds, the executive has to comply and actually spend them. Congress has made it illegal for the executive to \u201cimpound\u201d funds.",

China now has a major counterpart to USAID and uses it to grow its influence, so shuttering USAID is a great way to completely cede the 21st century to China.\n\nIf you want to go cancel one LGBT grant, fine.

Just that it needs to happen (no argument from me there).\n\nI said it elsewhere in this post, but I'll say it here too. The audit *needs* to happen, and it needs to happen in a way that is unfettered by outside sources that could interfere with the findings. A surprise 'attack' *is* probably necessary to make sure it's legit.\n\nBut... it should have been handled by someone appointed by Trump who is currently in the gov, has experience with operating inside established security guidelines to ensure proper handling and dissemination of classified material, overseen by a Trump appointed team of delegates from the Office of the Inspector General, or \"acceptable\" FBI agents approved by Trump.

Just take a second and realize that at this very moment, if he had the inclination to do so, Elon has *every* capability to hold the United States government hostage. He can fully bypass Trump, or any other individual who would contain him. All the safeguards are down.\n\nAs it currently stands, **the fate of this nation's government is dangerously close to being completely in the hands of an eccentric billionaire from South Africa**.

And that's just ONE of the agencies he controls...the Treasury Dept. Even more hilariously, his **THIRD** citizenship was the United States. \n\nDoes any of that seem right to you?",

                    "body": "I appreciate your apology but will respectfully disagree with your opinions on your 4th paragraph and your last one, otherwise you have some legitimate points that I agree with. \n\nRegarding the 4th paragraph, until It\u2019s proven otherwise I would actually rather have the crew of 6 engineers auditing the data than somebody that been in politics for years. \n\nHere\u2019s why: IMO the US political machine seems tends to swallow up novice politicians and spits them out years later almost unrecognizable. It could be contributed simply growing up and/or changing opinions, as most people don\u2019t carry the same beliefs from their 20\u2019s into their 60s. The more cynical side of me believes this change can also happen due to a variety of reasons: power, money, respect etc. \n\nIMO, By having this group of young but ambitious engineers audit the data, they are less likely to act out of line or under the influence of the political establishment. I believe this due to the fact they haven\u2019t been chewed up by the political machine. To date there has been no evidence or proof of misconduct that the engineers are stepping out of line of security protocols or mishandling classified data. \n\nAnother point to bring up but I won\u2019t expand on in this comment is the rampant over-classification of documents is a process being abused as a means to hide from FOIA requests and transparency laws. I bring this up because the politicians claiming the USAID audits puts classified information at risk are fear mongering. If what they claimed is true and USAID exists in its current form to purely provide humanitarian assistance, what would possibly need to be classified? \n\nIt\u2019s because the truth is a CIA front and the AID in USAID doesn\u2019t even stand for AID, it stands for Agency for International Development with is ironically on par for how the government\u2019s naming convention is used to provide cover. Its name in itself is no different than the Patriot Act, where anyone who questioned its contents we called traitors and unpatriotic. Same song, different dance - if you\u2019re against USAID they will call you heartless for denying Aid. \n\nTo wrap it up, regarding your last paragraph - for as long as Billionaires have existed, the US has been in the hands of Billionaires. Does that make it right - No, is it fair - No. Yes, it\u2019s outrageous and shouldn\u2019t be possible in a country that claims to be a democracy. Maybe I will be proven wrong but If we had no choice, (we don\u2019t) and had to choose one billionaire to provide their input, I would rather it be Elon. I don\u2019t always agree with him or condone his actions, trolling attempts and sometimes bizarre behavior but at least you can point to specific examples where he has put his money, mind and  companies to use for the good of mankind - Super batteries to stop Australian blackouts, opening up Teslas patents to allow the electric car industry to progress, and Starlink which will hopefully continue to provide internet connections to areas impacted by natural disaster and small or rural communities that have been neglected by big telecom companies but of course he should never be absolved  from legit criticism.",

                    "body": "I'm in a much better mood today, so you won't have to deal with my sometimes surly, a\\*\\*hole nature that can be taken out of innocent people. Also, I'd like to apologize for the length of my posts, and if I in any way come off as condescending. It's certainly not my intent. I can get long winded and obviously over-thinking crap is a major personality flaw I have.\n\nYou make a legitimate point about the young engineers, and *optimistically* speaking, it's a good call. However, it's a pretty big gamble, and they *are* unfortunately mishandling classified material. Installing improperly cleared servers on classified networks, adding hard drives to workstations to copy classified data. Aside from security procedures, there's a strict chain of custody when it comes to classified material, and that has been broken.\n\nBut...does that really matter, though? It just depends on how you look at it, frankly. I can fully understand an argument that says it doesn't.\n\nBit of a sidebar here, but maybe give you some context. You can ignore this lengthy paragraph if you want. You're **absolutely** correct about over-classification. I myself was prone to doing it when I was an analyst. See, the thing is, there's one, and only one, ranking individual in a chain of command (in the case of the DoD, the area I worked, it was a ranking Colonel or higher) that could legally apply or remove a classification to a document or data. They can delegate that authority, but ultimately it's their responsibility. BUT, there's a flaw. When writing an analysis paper or some other such product, you have to source each paragraph, and its classification. Often times though, the *compilation* of data can increase its classification. So I may have a document that uses nothing more than Secret level sources, but putting it together may make it Top Secret. Instead of taking that paper to the team in charge of such things to vet the classification, it was easier to just slap Top Secret on it so I knew I was safe. We'd have to write multiple papers a day with deadlines, and it was just too time consuming to have it done. Moving to digital only made that problem worse, because we weren't forced to deal with mounting piles of papers that needed to be shredded. We had a full time FOIA person on staff that worked directly with us, but her job was an overwhelming one. What we ended up with was serious, serious bloat, and that continues today.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I don't have much concern of what Elon is doing at USAID, because you're probably right...it needs to cleaned out. You'll get no argument out of me for that.\n\nYou're also correct about the US being in the hands of billionaires, and before this debacle, I quite respected Elon for all the reasons you state, and then some. The only thing I'd say in response, is that in the history of the United States, no one single person has had this level of direct control over the machinations of State than Elon does right now. Not even a President. I'm specifically referring to the Treasury Dept and OPM (and it's EHRI). His engineers don't need Read/Write on the Treasury mainframe to do their job, but they have it, and are reportedly pushing code already. I can't verify the veracity of them pushing code, but the full Read/Write access on the Treasury mainframe is confirmed. It's a direct violation of separation of power, and a concerning one.\n\nAt a personal level, my entire life history, including the results of my lifestyle polygraph (*deeply* private and personal), are at Elon's disposal. All were part of my regular background investigations for my clearance, and the polygraph was for working at the DIA. I entrusted that data to OPM, whom I knew was (mostly) properly and securely managed, and were at least held accountable for it. \n\nI did NOT entrust that data to Elon, and he's not being held accountable for it at all. There have been breaches at OPM before, but my clearance data thankfully never got out, as it was in a more secure system. People got in trouble for that breach. Elon and his group of young engineers? Nothing. They have zero accountability. \n\nNothing against those young engineers, but they simply do not understand the level of risk they are putting everyone in. Treasury dept aside, would *you* entrust every detail of your life, including your spouse, kids, neighbors, friends, coworkers, banking info, credit history etc. and your deepest secrets to them with the way they are handling the situation? Because along with thousands of others, I have, and I don't like it at all. It's simply a matter of professionalism and respect, to which they are displaying neither.",

Only time will tell. One thing I can say is I\u2019m always ready to admit what I don\u2019t know and can almost admit I could be wrong. \n\nAlthough I have yet to see evidence that clearly details the mishandling, only have seen claims that it is happening which isn\u2019t enough to move the needle for me. \n\nI think you have to have first hand knowledge that the servers they installed didn\u2019t follow proper protocols to make that claim but since they have made the audit independent and shut out everyone else, I don\u2019t know or don\u2019t know if I can trust that claim. I also can\u2019t prove they did follow proper protocols. \n\nTo even further muddy the waters, I don\u2019t know what the proper server protocol entails and wonder if it involves its connecting the servers to another system that can be monitored and or accessed by other within the government. \n\nIf I go with the claim that they are indeed going outside of standard protocols, I think you can take this in 2 ways: \n\n1.) They way that are completing the audits outside of protocols to prevent over-site or access from people looking to protect their own interests or status quo. This option would be so the audit can be guaranteed to be independent.\n\n2.) They are doing this outside of protocols to hide their actions for nefarious reasons, for example like allowing the Trump Admin to cherry picking what they make public to drive their narrative. \n\nI\u2019m a data driven person and have no ideological ties to either party, nor have I voted for either of the parties ever, and so far from what has been released enforces my belief that a lot of times the federal government establishment (congress, senate etc) truly acts like Uniparty behind the scenes, yet in public the right and left divide tends to be just political theater.\n\nWith that being said, as long as the Audit follows option 1 and the data is pure just that, data, then wherever the chips fall and whichever program or people (left or\nright) are prove to be abusing the system for their own benefit should face consequences as the have failed the very tenets they were supposed to uphold as duly elected representatives in a supposed democracy. \n\nIf it is proven to be option 2, then it should be called out and the audits should pause until new or safer protocols can be agreed upon and implemented. \n\nOf course there could be more nuance and other options or even some sort of combination but I\u2019m keeping it simple. Regardless, If it\u2019s option 2, I say pause because I believe the US is better off performing some sort of Audit and reform what we are doing now, from top to bottom. \n\nI will remain optimistic until proven otherwise because for once in my life there is a group of people outside of the biased establishment completed audits with the goal of reforming the unsustainable way our government has been running. The direction it has been going needs to go in a different direction IMO and this is the most optimistic I have been that something positive might come out of this. \n\nI just wish the politicians involved with attacking Elons and the audit would just admit there is some truth to why the audits are necessary and at least stop the name calling and hyperbolic claims. All it is doing is creating division, rilling people up, and muddying any legit conversation that could be had. \n\nConcerning this last election cycle, on the left in particular, I would argue it is part of the reason the country ended up voting for Trump in the first place. The more strategic approach would be to admit to any truths that come out or need to be said. The way the left are approaching and attacking these audits and accompanied largely quiet response from the establishment right, to me shows Elon and his crew are truly on to something. \n\nAlso let me just state that you have very valid points and I also apologize for the long paragraphs but it is also the way I am wired as writing it out can sometimes help me sort my thoughts.",

            "body": "Yes and no.\n\nLegally:\n\nOutside the kind of blatant data access issues with Elon et al are galloping back on, they probably have the legal ability to eliminate the organization known as USAID and bring it under the state department.  The organization's independence and structure hinges sadly on an EO.\n\nHowever, the funding and the mandate to spend it on foreign aid is legally required. So it's not like they can win any ground there. Destroying the USAID infrastructure is just going to massively disrupt this system which will lead to lawsuits as the money exists and must be spent. And much of that money is actually already earmarked for specific countries/causes in the congressional budget so it's not like that money can't be spent. Probably part of the goal is to wither that infrastructure.\n\nPolitically:\n\nCan Dems find a way to win this fight? Possibly, USAID is a lightning rod for right wing conspiracies (see this comment section) and has had some actual stumbles in the past (see controversy section on Wikipedia). Foreign aid in general despite being a fairly small number has always been a target of contention for the right (and interestingly the far left who accuse it of a source of American imperialism). Though again it's hard to point  to specific programs, Musk got full access and the best he could point out was some low cost feel good arts programs as bad things the program is doing. US soft power abroad is one of the most important but least visible reasons of why our world is relatively safe, that being said it has largely withered since the Bush era. \n\nUSAID has worked to reduce the AIDS epidemic, reduce starvation, maybe knock down apartheid, stabilize weak democracies and generally spread good vibes about America in Africa and the middle East (that part where we have allies to hunt down whatever terrorist organization we want to of the day). The majority of USAID's budget currently is going to Ukraine. The State Department on the other hand has typically sucked at aid as it's generally short sighted and somewhat distracted and bad at having boots on the ground (see the failures of the Afghanistan money surge). Having local partners to work with on the ground and having USAID as a separate org is probably a good thing if you believe in foreign aid. That being said since firing fed employees is actually pretty hard it's likely Rubio will largely just use the existing infrastructure shortterm as State lacks experience in dispersing aid.\n\nSo it's both tricky and easy to defend. The problem is most defenses lead to 'culture war' traps by the right: ie AIDS prevention and birth control for women to help improve QOL gets branded as condoms, abortion, eugenics, and sex trafficking. The Dems can push back on the Ukraine aid as Trump/Musk betraying Ukraine but State will probably just respond by spending that money. Also Trump has weirdly pushed back against Russia offering a quick end to the war. The apartheid  thing (Musk having benefited from apartheid and being mad it ended) is a good angle of attack but is kind of tenuous as far as I can tell. Food aid is the easiest to defend but Americans have gotten weird about that too with inflation. That being said when it comes to actual budget negotiations, major cuts to USAID/foreign funds will face pushback, Americans generally like having a view of themselves as stopping AIDs, starvation crises, and spreading clean water. Many Republican senators have pet projects and causes that fall under those aid dispersements. Republican senators will have a hard fight to trade tax breaks for starving children. Also pulling aid from countries like Jordan would absolutely collapse America's influence in the middle east and lead to a much less safe world.\n\nI guess in summary, foreign aid is good thing but weirdly controversial. The current move will probably just shuffle deck chairs and names of things and fire some contractors (some temporarily some permanently) and lead to disruption and chaos. The data access part is probably illegal but less illegal than the treasury data access. The current move lacks the budgetary mandate to actually do anything. What will really matter is the coming budget debate over the Republican tax break plan and if the Dems take power in 2026 and 2028 (and how that power is transferred).",

Thank you, whoever you are.\n\n\nThe reason that trans people are the way they are is because THEIR PARENTS REJECTED THEM IN SOME WAY. Or a significant role model. They were abused, rejected, and dismissed. You wanna know why I think this way? I've worked in mental health and addiction treatment for a couple years. I have BPD, diagnosed in 2014. I confronted my demons, and I'm in the best place of my life now. I wanted to use my pain to help others. I worked the 12 steps and 2 years later started working in treatment. I met a lot of trans ppl who didn't act like the ones we see on YT. They were fucking chill. We got to know each other on a personal level. And there were a couple who said they think they're like that bc they had a fucked up childhood.... Your party wants you to stay sick.

Musk has since created a team, delegated his authority, and had his team enter federal data centers without proper clearance, confiscate classified material for which they are not cleared, gain root access to systems to which they are not authorized, and copy data that state laws say they cannot have. Musk has also halted and/or deleted fund transfers from the Treasury system - something only Congress can do - violating court orders telling the President to stop. He has also shut down federal entities authorized by Congress, a power he does not have. \n\nI think our President and his minions are acting unconstitutionally and must be stopped. If they don't stop as ordered by the courts, they must be physically stopped. \n\n>Who do you think will win ultimately? \n\nUltimately, all of this is temporary and will be reversed in time. Ultimately, the people will win\u2014long-term. It might take four years, but we will win.\n\n>How will Democrats respond? \n\nUnless AOC, Bernie, or some other member of the Democratic Party says party seniority rules be damned, we will continue to see Senator Chuck Schummer hem and mumble in his monotone while providing no authentic leadership. The Democratic response will be utterly ineffective if they aren't able to provide leadership to the people who take to the streets tomorrow. Then, the Democratic Party risks being replaced by a third party at the midterms. Bernie is not a Democrat, so it would only take AOC and several other charismatic and outspoken politicians to form a new party that showed moral courage for the Democratic Party to fall into history. This has happened before in US history, and this scenario is most likely to cause the party to die. \n\n>How will Republicans respond?\n\nThis is the wild card to me. I know several people who voted for Trump and Republicans in the last election who are now calling and emailing their Republican representatives demanding that Musk be stopped. If the outrage from the people who voted for them continues to grow, then they have to decide if they are willing to lose their political careers for Trump and Musk. They also have to wonder if their limited power will still exist if Trump and Musk continue to push into unconstitutional territory. At some point, if they don't act, they just become a rubberstamp committee that looks nice for the press as the President does whatever he wants.",

The LA fires have people looking at Karen Bass and there could be a possible recall election, and the DSA has four members on the LA City Council. San Francisco is also starting to glow a little more Red in the Asian community, and they just elected a billionaire over a progressive.",

In turn, Trump has built a tollgate at the swamp door and fills his pockets while the richest man in the world, who drank $180 billion of swamp water himself, now claims to be draining the swamp on our behalf. Of course, Trump fired the IGs and anyone else who would provide oversight and assurance that Elon wasn't stealing or messing things up, so we just have to trust him.\n\nNo - I belive we are gearing up towards two sides - one that returns to following the Constitution and one side that wants to ignore it.

Matt Gonzales was Bernie Sanders before you ever heard of him, the one thing that has been proven is that progressives rarely of ever get anything done, and when they eventually got to hold power there, they screwed that city all up. Even with all the new money and historic gentrification that should had transformed that city, but they also voted far left. Oakland, the far left screwed that city as well. You can't win over people when your social programs fail in cities that vote for them. Vermont repealed their own single payer health care system after only two or three years when it was implemented. You want more people on your side? The do a better job at governance.

So the center on the right side is gone, if you think that the Leftist anti-capitalist DSA pseudo Trots should do the same with the center left, pushing their chosen ones like Ocasio-Cortez to the front of the line over center left lawmakers and blame the establishment if they don't succeed, then they are no different from MAGA. \n\nAnd good luck with that.

[**Since stopping funds, the number of preventable cases has gone up (link).**](https://www.wired.com/story/usaid-researchers-email-access/)\n* Aids in poverty and disaster relief.\n* Assistance in overall aid for whatever country they're in.\n* Helps the optics of the US, through this so-called 'soft power'. Sounds kinda nefarious, but it seems to help counter influence of Russia and China, as well as lay the groundwork for agreements/deals in the future, which sounds like a good thing. \n\nNow could there be programs through this agency that could be cut? Sure - I think that goes for literally any gov't agency. However, just shutting it down first causes immediate ripple effects to the parts that ARE helpful. \n\nJust shutting this down instead of looking at it first has already hurt both the countries it was aiding [**as well as us, since the agency purchases american goods**](http://usaidstopwork.com/)**.** Also, this agency's budget has been appropriated by congress, so not necessarily only a liberal thing.\n\nAs for right-wing causes, some of the only things that come to mind are making sure Israel gets whatever they want, defense funding despite numerous failed audits, integrating religion into public schools, and providing tax cuts largely for corporations and the obscenely rich. Otherwise, they've largely been against a lot of things that would actually help, such as defunding education in favor of religious/charter schools, programs that help the poor and kids get out of poverty, arresting/deporting legal immigrants (the ones that want to work here), claiming to be pro-life despite repeatedly voting against proposals to help with medical costs and risks associated with child-birth, parental leave, daycare costs, while making it illegal to have an abortion under any circumstance. \n\nBit of a rant. Again, I don't disagree that gov't funding should be carefully looked at, but scrapping a whole agency (one that uses less than 1% of the total budget) just because you disagree with part(s) of how they spend their congressionally-allocated budget is nonsense and terrible management.",
