    "selftext": "The rhetoric and ideologies around illegal immigration seem to have taken a major shift in recent years, especially among the left. \n\nImmigration was a bipartisan issue at one point in time, including under the Obama administration, with the common agreement being that those who enter the country illegally get deported. This is also the accepted norm and law of the land in many other countries around the world. \n\nThis seems to be a relatively new perspective for America. What caused this dramatic shift? And why are so many Americans opposed to mass deportations an in favor of undocumented immigration or support open borders altogether? ",

No country has a policy of willfully allowing those who entered illegally to stay indefinitely because the legal means are too slow. Not even 3rd countries in Africa where my friend was from. In fact a lot of those countries are much stricter than the US. If the legal means need reform then reform them. Simple as that. \n\nAllowing those illegally to stay is not fixing the legal route. You're just creating a pull force and hence encourage MORE illegal immigration by showing people if you come illegally you will be allowed to stay eventually. This is why DACA back fired on Obama. He wanted to give amensty to those who arrived as young children but then there was a massive flood of hundreds of thousands of minors trying to enter the southern border because the communication back home (and from the human traffickers who wanted to take advantage of this) is you can come as a minor and be allowed to stay once you reach 18 through DACA. We should be doing everything in our power to deprive human smugglers/cartels of a means of income. \n\nIts also why Germany got overwhelmed after they said no Syrian refugee would be deported in 2013. 1 million refugees flooded in and according to my friends there this completely overwhelmed their welfare state and they had to introduce limits again.",

You also don't acknowledge that every economist knows that immigration is good for the economy, and no statistic has shown that immigration lowes gdp. \n\nThe reason being: immigration goes towards where jobs are already available. They're coming here because there are shortages in certain sectors. If there weren't jobs available, they wouldn't be coming here in the first place.

This is especially true since immigrants can't apply for federal welfare or access social security. So immigrants often pay more than the average American, and I personally would be alright if we required a \"residence tax\", where immigrants pay a slightly high percentage of income tax because of their residency status. That way we could get more income from them, and Americans could rest more easily knowing that immigrants paid more in taxes than citizens.",

Also lower wages mean less taxes, so they end up taking more out of the system than they're putting in.\n\nBut they're working, so this problem could also be resolved by 1. Giving them a path to citizenship so they have a stronger foundation to negotiate working conditions, and 2. Raising minimum wage to a living wage, so that working people don't need welfare. Which was exactly the democratic platform this past election.\n\nMass deportation solves the issue of them draining social services, but at steep costs due to the need to hire more people to carry it out. Depending on how fast they want people out, it can easily cost a lot more than the social services drain. And that's not even counting the cost to the economy from losing their labor, because they're a significant part of the workforce, especially in certain industries like farming and construction.\n\nEvery country has a right to decide who gets to be a citizen, and how to enforce their borders.

                                    "body": "\"I've heard\" is not a great source. But you're absolutely right that them being undocumented does mean that it's harder to track if they are paying appropriate tax. Records and statistics do show that immigrants get more out of social security than they directly pay in with taxes - I'm not trying to debate that point at all. It is a problem. But there can be multiple viable solutions to a problem. I'm trying to say that the solution of mass deportation is neither the cheapest, nor the best for the economy as a whole. \n\nAs an example, let's say an undocumented worker builds a house. He gets paid $10k over the job, and he pays no taxes because he's not listed anywhere as employed. He then pulls benefits for his kid. Obviously, he's taken more out of government funds than he put in, which isn't great. But the house he built still exists, and can be sold. When it's sold, taxes are generated, the housing market is a tiny bit less saturated, mortgages likely lead to banks making money etc. Also, if he wasn't there, that house would have needed to be built by somebody else, and if you just look at the statistics, if we remove all undocumented workers from the construction industry, you're left with not many people to build the houses. Of course, those jobs could hypothetically then be taken by American nationals, but it is very much an open question if enough Americans want those jobs, or have the skills to take them over quickly. In reality, removing undocumented workers quickly would result in many construction companies being shut down, which would turbocharge the housing crisis and negatively impact the economy. That is one example of why the economic impact of undocumented immigrants is actually considered to be positive, even though the immediate effect on social security is negative. \n\nAlso, if our illegal immigrant example became documented, he could more easily be required to file taxes, meaning that cases of tax evasion and welfare abuse would decrease. Creating programs for getting him documented would undoubtedly mean some more people need to be hired, but not nearly as many as would be needed for mass deportation (because it's a lot easier to push paper than chase people down and detain them somewhere, and take care of them while they're being detained). Overall, economically, there is absolutely no reason for mass deportation. The only reason to do it is because you don't appreciate that they came in illegally, and you want them out, even if it means shooting yourself in the foot economically. Which is perhaps an understandable sentiment, but I have to say, unless you are a Native American, it's more than a little bit tone-deaf.",

But if the overall economic impact is positive, that means the money to pay for it exists. It's just making its way to the top of the pyramid, where it becomes some rich guy's asset. And since America is so allergic to taxing big corporations and the rich, yes, it means you end up borrowing instead, while you head in the direction of French-revolution level income inequality. \n\nYou're accurately assessing the US's financial state, imo, but you're blaming the wrong people for it. None of this has to be this way. Not the undocumented status of these people, meaning they can get away with not paying tax. Not the insane level of income inequality you have. Not the excessive borrowing of money to avoid taxing the rich. But you know who's for sure not gonna change any of that? A racist multi-millionaire (or more, not sure) surrounded by billionaire buddies, who gave massive tax cuts to the wealthy last time he was in office. \n\nAnd yes, low income people don't pay much tax even when documented. But what's the solution to that? 1. Get rid of everyone below a certain income level, regardless of citizenship (which would catch a lot of born-Americans too, plus leave a lot of industries entirely without workers), 2. Go full communist and pay everybody the same, or 3. Just accept that some people are going to contribute more into the system than others, because they have more to give and can afford to help. \n\nI get not wanting to feel like you're paying for undocumented immigrants, or that your country is going into debt to pay for them. I really do. But what I don't get is wanting to pay way more, in both the short and long term, to get rid of them, when there are cheaper options to solve the problem that have the added advantage of being more humane.",

Secondly, they returned home as soon as the threat of persecution subsided (via Herod dying).",
