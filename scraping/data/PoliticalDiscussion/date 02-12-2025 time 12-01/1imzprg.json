    "selftext": "Hello everyone,  \nDuring the elections in Germany, I tried to find out about the current situation in Ukraine. My problem is that I have not yet found a trustworthy source that analyzes whether Ukraine is even capable of winning the war with the troops it has available. If this is the case, I have not yet been able to find any information about how many billions of $/\u20ac in military aid would be necessary to achieve this goal.  \n  \nImportant: (Winning is defined here as: completely recapturing the territory conquered by Russia)  \n  \n  \nSo here are my questions:  \n  \n1. Can Ukraine win the war with the current number of soldiers?  \n  \n2. How much military aid in $/\u20ac must be invested to achieve this type of victory?  \n  \n3. How many soldiers would likely lose their lives as a result?  \n  \n  \nI am aware that the war could easily be ended through intervention in the form of NATO operations (even if this also raises the question of costs and human lives and hardly any NATO country is currently in favor of this). Since this is not the question asked here, I would ask you to ignore this possibility.  \n  \nFurthermore, if figures and facts are mentioned, I would ask you to verify them with links to sources.  \n  \nThanks\n\n",

That should favor Russia, given that it is the larger nation with the larger population.  On the other hand, Russia ultimately needs to be able to advance and take territory if it is to succeed, and it has done a miserable job of that.\n\nThe west has been betting on a Russian economic collapse.  That has yet to happen and those expectations were far too optimistic, with the Russian economy in some ways performing better than anticipated thus far.\n\nHowever, Russia's economy may be on the verge of finally tumbling, potentially creating political pressures.  One commentary on the subject that sees headwinds coming at Russia:\n\n[https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/addicted-to-war-undermining-russias-economy/](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/addicted-to-war-undermining-russias-economy/)\n\nUkraine has done well with destorying Russia's Black Sea Fleet.\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/russia-black-sea-problems-ukraine-drones-2009065](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-black-sea-problems-ukraine-drones-2009065)\n\nRussia's loss of its naval base in Syria is also a blow to Putin.\n\nThe greatest threat to Ukraine is Trump.  It is unclear what the US is going to do at this point.\n\nWe can only hope that oil prices fall while Ukraine destroys some of Russia's oil production.  The loss of revenue could help to push Russia into decline.",

But certainly one with lasting consequences.\n\nThe mythos surrounding Russian military capabilities are certainly in question. What was once thought of as the second class military of the world is colloquially on par with the Italians (and that is definitely meant as an insult). Their borders with China are certainly thought of as less concerning after this conflict. \n\nAlso, similarly to conflicts like Iraq and Dessert Storm. Armor divisions, which were once thought of as a vice like crushing force. Russian reliance on heavy armor as an offensive military option are shown to be ... troubling. Certainly armor and tanks have a space in modern war. But they may be increasingly outdated and moved to support roles. \n\nThe other piece of this is Putins' particular place in the Russian government. I'm not in so deep on the inner workings, but certainly, the number of senior officers ... left. Or who are shoring up their own place when Putins time ends. Is increasing. Hell, they nearly fell into a coupe of their own when Prigozhin turned around for that time ... even if it might have ended quickly and seemingly only served Prigozhin (at the time). It doesn't exactly look stable for Putin from the outside.",
