    "selftext": "In recent politics there have been two major political pushes for diversity and equality.  However, both instances led to backlashes that have led to an environment that is arguably worse than it was before.  In 2008 Obama was the first black president one a massive wave of hope for racial equality and societal reforms.  This led to one of the largest political backlashes in modern politics in 2010, to which  democrats have yet to fully recover from.  This eventually led to birtherism which planted some of the original seeds of both Trump and MAGA. The second massive political push promoting diversity and equality was in 2018 with the modern woman election and 2020 with racial equality being a top priority.  Biden made diversifying the government a top priority.  This led to an extreme backlash among both culture and politics with anti-woke and anti-DEI efforts.  This resent contributed to Trump retaking the presidency.  Now Trump is pushing to remove all mentions of DEI in both the private and public sectors.  He is hiding all instances that highlight any racial or gender successes.  His administration is pushing culture to return to a world prior to the civil rights era.  \n\nThis leads me to my question.  Will there be a backlash for this?  How will it occur?  How can democrats lead and take advantage of the backlash while trying to mitigate a backlash to their own movement?  It seems as though every attempt has led to a stronger and more severe response.  \n\nAdditional side questions.  How did public opinion shift so drastically from 2018/2020 which were extremely pro-equality to 2024 which is calling for a return of the 1950s?",

You just don't hand the party over to a few chosen upstarts who are in safe districts.

If the Dems lose center, they're toast, the Republicans have made gains in blue states and with minorities. One of the reasons for Trump's comeback was his campaign winning the culture war, as big reason Florida is solid red now is because of the same. Perez is a blue collar Dem, hell she and her husband built their own home. Harris only gain was with white college educated liberals/progressives. \n\nThe Dems need to find another white, southern, male ala Bill Clinton.

I've seen this happen at volunteering organizations that lean progressive (e.g. nature conservation group) and my time at a few consultant firms. The rolling eyes is prevalent there too. It's often because its irrelevant to the context of the meeting and seems extra/cringe. Anecdotally,  the pronoun thing is a product of one [influential] person's pet project or a small group that got to push a organization wide initiative. The latter is often done because its cheaper to appease than evaluate its effect on employees. Many managers just assume people will react positively or be indifferent.",

While pronouns are indeed part of the English language it\u2019s very hard to move all of society in the same direction regarding gender pronoun taxonomy. What the gentleman is trying to convey is that pronouns in relation to gender identity can and does wrinkle people, not just far right but inclusive of all factions or political ideologies (with exception to ones that are directly associated with those seeking to disclose pronouns). Case in point, most people I work with (hospital nursing) don\u2019t use gender pronouns in day to day conversations, though some may use pronouns in their email signature. I\u2019ve also never been in a meeting where someone identified themselves and then disclosed their pronouns, and there are a lot of LBGTQ+ individuals that work in healthcare. However, my wife has had clinical fellows who have been non-binary; one who was very vocal about pronouns and the other did not care or expect nor raise concern if they were not correctly identified. \n\nIt will take a generation before the language is mainstream much in the same way as women, black Americans, gays or lesbians are today. This is the nature of new cultural norms. Language takes time to be adopted. This is our moment to learn and understand how to communicate effectively and politely with these pronouns.",

Far left progressivism is fundamentally connected to a cultural worldview and ideology usually termed postmodernism. One of the fundamental characteristics of postmodernism is the questioning and deconstruction of assumed or \u201cgiven\u201d beliefs, values and power structures. This block probably makes up about one third of the general population, predominantly in blue states and cities on the coasts. Like it or not, transgenderism and gender ideology are most certainly part of this deconstructive cultural movement, in this case the deconstruction of gender and sex categories Which have been fundamental for Western culture, and indeed most cultures around the world for millennia. Now conservatives and Trump is in general subscribe to much more traditional world view instead of values and feel very very very threatened by this kind of deconstruction of fundamental cultural institutions and categories that they see far left Progressives pushing for. This is the reason for the backlash. It doesn\u2019t have to do with pronouns, it has to do with the very foundations of their world shaking beneath their feet. To them it\u2019s a very real threat to their existence and they\u2019ll fight tooth and nail to hold on to what they have. Now that wasn\u2019t the only reason why Democrats lost the election, but it\u2019s a very big piece of it.",

I marched with BLM a few years ago and I have a multi racial family.  Women have no idea what the experience of men is, they only think they do.  Modern women want the strength and power of high status men, all the privileges of being a woman, and the responsibility and accountability of children.  You couldn\u2019t wear my BOOTS to work every day.  I don\u2019t come from money so I have to do tangible and visceral work and not one single soul gives one single f*ck about my feelings, health, wealth, mental health, or if I live or die outside of my son.  Yet I\u2019m the privileged one.  Men are not human beings, we are human doings.  Our only value is what we produce, what we provide, what we contribute, and outside of that we are completely expendable.  \n\nYes, the people at the top of the apex of power are mostly men but there are many types of power.  Power is the ability to influence or control your surrounding environment and the average woman has way more power than the average man.  %80 of consumer spending is done by women.  There is a safety net for almost every bad decision a woman can make and situation she can find herself in.  Mine are homelessness and suicide, both greatly skewed towards men.\n\nThe left has done a horrible job in their messaging for and about men in the last 20 years.  Apparently we don\u2019t have any problems, we are the problem.  After this election it\u2019s nothing but crying victim hood and it\u2019s all men\u2019s fault and misogyny that she didn\u2019t get elected.  FWIW I voted for her. Never mind that she was never a great candidate, didn\u2019t win in any primaries, spent the money on celebrity endorsements instead of middle class outreach, didn\u2019t have a good message and didn\u2019t separate herself from a highly unpopular president, it\u2019s because she\u2019s a woman.

No. They only want the climate controlled easy jobs that pay well and continue to complain about how bad they have it.\n\nI understand your frustration, but it seems misguided to be upset at women over this. I don't think many people would argue that we've eliminated gender roles--half of us can barely open a pickle jar, so I think you know why women aren't lining up to do manual labor, nor would we be welcome in those environments. Like anyone else, we look for jobs that we think we can realistically do well at in the long term.\n\nIf there are high-paying trade and sanitation jobs women are leaving open, then go for them. If you want to work in a climate-controlled environment not doing manual labor, then go for that instead. Men dominate sectors like tech, finance, and insurance (and many claims leaders don't even have a degree).\n\nI didn't like my old work environment--a public library. And before that, retail. Sure, I whined a bit, but I eventually realized it was my responsibility to make sure I was living the life I wanted. Now I work from home, own a house, and can save and invest a substantial amount of money.\n\nThis is something that for some reason seems to not be intuitive to us. We are the only person who will make our life better. Not a left-wing revolution, not Trump, not God/Jesus, not a cosmic force to ensure that our life was meaningful (if only to ourselves). Sometimes it's easier to get shit done when you really understand there is no one else to do it.",

I mean, would black women's rights, would gay Catholic rights be worthy of attention? Do we fight for white, high school educated, male rights?  I know they think we don't fight for their rights now, but certainly most of the policies Democrats advocate for, especially the economic ones, would benefit them as well as it would benefit all of these other minority groups. \n   The problem today's Democratic Party has is that it's the party for all minorities. The Dems try to have political room for everyone. But, that's always gonna cause conflict between member groups who, while they may believe the same thing in one area, have opposing views in other areas. But, to me, you can't be the party that believes everybody is inherently valuable and deliberately not support an issue a particular minority group cares about. The current Republicans don't have as much of a problem because, while MAGA is not the same as the old establishment Republicans, both groups believe in the superiority of wealthy, white men over everybody else. Their policies are rooted in that principle. So, if you're cool with, or benefit from, that perspective, the Democratic focus on the diversity, equity and inclusion( i.e. safe spaces, pronouns, etc.) of these minority groups viewpoints feels silly and pointless. But, it's what separates the Dems from the others, and why I support them.",

Turns out that for things like car crash safety, or chemical exposure limits, etc, women *aren't* perfectly identical to average men.\n\n- There's medical sensors that don't work right on black people because uh....oops, we forgot those exist. Also diagnostic criteria that aren't at all correct for various minority groups - turns out that ethnic group X has a higher baseline level of Y and so seeing it isn't proof that they have disease Z like it is in a white person of European descent.\n\nEtc, etc.\n\nNo org is ever going to be perfect at this, but an org that is all one type of person will make these mistakes, and less disastrous things that reduce their appeal, **much** more often/more widely.\n\n--------\n\nNow, with that said - I typically don't think *forced* diversity works.

Time and time again white male Soldiers, Seamen, Airmen and Marines are given preferential treatment for promotion statements and punishments over their minority and female counterparts.\n\nIf two Soldiers are exactly the same on paper and in physical job performance, the white soldier is more likely to receive a favorable promotion statement AND if they fuck up, the white soldier is more likely to be granted clemency or leniency, if they are held accountable at all.

The entire idea that it is appropriate for two people with the same qualifications, experience, and work ethic, to achieve different outcomes is inherently discriminatory. It means that something other than their work experience factored in, and that pretty much leaves either they got ahead by either knowing someone above them, by exchanging favors, or through unconscious bias. Unconscious Bias is usually the answer in those cases.\n\nDemocracy, in a vacuum, is largely built on equality of opportunity but democratic society itself maintains stability through a rough variant of equality of outcome. It's the reason you see folks discussing income gaps and wage differentials. Too many millionaires and billionaires cause our system to break down. Democratic society (one built on equality, liberty and brotherhood) requires folks to be within a few tens of factors of wealth from each other to maintain stability.\n\nYou can't have sexual, gender, racial, ethnic and religious groups falling behind the majority to such a degree that it is blatantly observable and society to remain cohesive.",

Maybe for the first few years especially after the last stimulus packages (2023) but covid showed how much we are willing to spend for items we need. Food, clothing, toiletries, etc. corporations saw that and continued to cut production cost while simultaneously raising prices to give themselves an even larger profit margin. \n\nAn irl example is at the liquor store I work at is the frequent increases in cases of 6 bottles, up to 16, from distributers. According to my boss even at peak covid price increases were usually smaller like 10-25 cents per bottle and happened maybe once per quarter on fewer brands. Now it's every month on tons of different products/brands. \n\nI've talked extensively with our reps from glazer, republic, capital Reyes, and they confirmed that the vast amount of price increases coming from distribution companies. There's definitely some distilleries that have had to make small adjustments to keep their margin up, but according to the reps and the few distilleries we buy from directly those increases don't justify distribution prices. \n\nAnother one that's easy to overlook in general is adhesives for things like labels, or on boxes and packaging materials.",

Attempting to use a bunch of imported asian yuppies who go from already being upper class in china to working for goldman sachs and D.E shaw or w/e to make it sound like the only reason ADOS people are economically disadvantages and not just as successful is because their lazy is some dumb shit.",

People care about their wallet and bank account. Fill those things up and literally ANY person can be President. Dems failed to convince people they would alleviate the average American's financial woes, however.\n\nIt's kind of hard to believe someone who claims the economy is \"great\" when your bank accounts prove otherwise. Or prices in general are not exactly affordable by the majority of people... It's also very difficult to believe that they would help \"us\" when they are spending billions upon billions on other countries.\n\nDems tried to convince everyone that everything was peachy perfect - specifically the economy - when we knew that it... wasn't anywhere near being good, or great.\n\nIt'd be like me telling you that your zero dollar account balance is actually pretty good and better than most people's.. lol",

The end goal should be exactly what the Republicans are pushing for right now - merit based everything. The problem that Republicans are willfully ignoring though is that we have not only a long history of extremely racist systems, but there are still many in existence that haven't been corrected. Until we make it an even playing field, removing DEI programs is negligent and dangerous. So in the meantime, adjust DEI to focus on socioeconomic status and work to correct the ongoing root causes that disadvantage minorities.",

In China, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d consider Chinese/Asian to be the default. In Mexico, being Hispanic would be considered the default to which all other minorities in the country are compared. They definitely do this in Japan where all minorities are labeled as Gaijin, and compared to the default.\n\n**Whiteness as centric**\n> As the majority of Americans are White, whiteness is considered the default race of the United States, the existing cultural norms of whiteness are classified as the norms of American culture. Such classifications include stereotypical expectancies of behavior, in which a binary system is created that classifies a person's culture as either \"White\" or \"other.\" Majority racial status plays a major role for those of white identity creating cultural \"norms,\" as one's behaviors and expectations of how a culture should live and interact is more easily reinforced by association with the majority. Lack of awareness parallels the centric nature of whiteness as majority through self-imposed color blindness, existing through the reality of White privilege.\n\nOkay, got it. Makes sense, I don\u2019t entirely disagree. But the question I keep asking myself reading this is \u201cWhy do we care?\u201d Are we simply illuminating this phenomenon as a curiosity, or are we trying to say something here? \n\n**White identity**\n> The idea of whiteness as \"normal\" reinforces the idea of racial marginalization, through which an identity of may be created through the antithesis of subjugated \"otherized\" cultures. Much of White identity is formulated around the absence of an identity. Because there is no association towards being objectified by social, racial, economic, or judicial systems for the middle-class White identifiers, White identity for an individual may be intentionally crafted to suit the wants and needs of the individual. Such a choice of \"coloring in\" one's whiteness is a reflection of the privileges of whiteness and a lack of diverse community association.\n\nI strongly disagree with this. It reads like it was something that was conceived solely by non-white people who don\u2019t know shit about white people. It\u2019s basically saying \u201cWhite identity is not actually having an identity because nobody slaps labels or assumptions on you so you\u2019re free to create whatever identity you want!\u201d which is so, so fucking wrong.\n\n> The only way this argument has any foundation is if you're arguing that whole entire racial groups have nothing of value to contribute to the work that an otherwise racially homogeneous group could. \n\nCan you rephrase this? I\u2019m honestly having trouble understanding what you mean here.\n\n> Human history has always shown that incorporating the diverse perspectives of others provides advantages that would not be afforded if everyone's blind spots were the same.\n\nI mean, again, the vast majority of human history seems to disagree with you. The Chinese didn\u2019t need help from Europeans to build the Great Wall. The Greeks independently developed ideas about civics and philosophy that we still utilize to this day without needing South American sound boards to tell them why they\u2019re ideas may be flawed.\n\nI get what Obama is saying 100%, but the thing is, his approach is not remotely novel or new. People have been doing that for literally all time. Yes, most intelligent people are aware that only hearing one perspective is extremely limiting and that they can immensely benefit by hearing as many informed perspectives as possible so they can reach their own conclusions. Business leaders have enjoyed sitting in a conference room watching their underlings fight like hell over different strategies and ideas so they can reach their own decision based on what they think was the most compelling argument for decades (Jeff Bezos was infamous for this). I have never heard anyone argue against diversity of ideas and thought. I\u2019m sure some crackpot jackass out there is doing it, but they\u2019d be so statistically negligent as to not even be worth mentioning. \n\n> You think those innovations only came from White people? How is it, exactly, that America was able to position itself as the most powerful, wealthy country in the world? You think Whiteness is the only thing responsible for that? LOL\n\nI mean, many of them objectively did. My point wasn\u2019t that white people are so smart because they invented shit, it was that these inventions came along at a time when America was far, far more white than it is today. Yes, obviously exploitation of black American slaves was significant, but it wasn\u2019t everything. The most industrialized states that made the country one of the most economically powerful countries in the world by the late 19th century were all states that had outlawed slavery more 70-100 years prior. We didn\u2019t become the indisputably most powerful nation, economically or militarily, until WWII when nearly 50,000,000 people were killed and much of the world\u2019s entire infrastructure was absolutely devastated. \n\n> Human diversity in race, age, ability, class, religion, sexuality, gender identity, experience, occupational history, and more. That implies the decentering of Whiteness (including heteronormativity, patriarchy, Christianity, etc). Not its complete and total eradication; but its decentering.\n\nLiterally all of this except race can occur within a racially homogenous group with any one race at its center. You can have a large group of people who are all orange. These orange people can vary in socioeconomic status, education, work experience, sexual preferences, life experience, hobbies, ideas, interests, and literally everything else except for the fact that they are all orange. What is the explicit tangible benefit to adding in blue, purple and red people to the mix? The argument is that adding them brings *unique* beneficial strengths they couldn\u2019t get otherwise, but **no one is answering how**.",

One could call them the \"First Americans\" - you know what they look like?\n\nWell I was born in the state with the highest population of them in the country and have enough direct ancestry with them to be eligible for certain tribal benefits (that I won\u2019t take), so I kinda know what they look like :)\n\nThough I get what you\u2019re saying, but at the same time, doesn\u2019t it in a way? \u201cAmerica\u201d as we know it did not exist in any way, shape or form until white people came along and colonized it. They did horrible things to Native Americans, perpetuating atrocities for centuries that no one disagrees with, but they also built this country from the ground up largely without the natives. Many populations around the world aren\u2019t \u201cindigenous\u201d in the traditional sense. My whole point with this though, was that wherever you go anywhere in the world, the dominant ethnic group is going to be the center. This isn\u2019t exclusive to America. I don\u2019t see it as inherently bad either, but I\u2019m not really sure if whiteness theory does too? It seems to be moreso remarking on the phenomenon in the case of white dominated cultures rather than making a claim this is necessarily good or bad. Am I off? Or is the implication that this is bad?\n\n> Why do we care?\n\nSo I watched the video, Sean Harper had a good explanation of what DEI is and I think he articulated well what the goal *ostensibly* is, but I disagree with him that the narrative that split people between privileged and oppressed was political misinformation when we all literally saw many of the most vocal DEI advocates also using these same terms. Sean is correct I think, in saying that many people can get behind the *spirit* of DEI. The problem however is many of the messengers and their incompetence in execution and rhetoric.  But my original question of \u201cWhy do we care?\u201d was moreso directed at white identity dominating the culture. I\u2019m a white American male, so yes I realize that I personally have nothing to lose by maintaining a status quo dominated by whiteness, but I\u2019m struggling to understand what minorities are losing. When the Wiki said\n\n> Majority racial status plays a major role for those of white identity creating cultural \"norms,\" as one's behaviors and expectations of how a culture should live and interact is more easily reinforced by association with the majority.\n\nThis makes sense, I\u2019m just not really seeing an argument of why this is good or bad. \n\n> You assuming that these differences have no inherent or unique value makes it difficult for you to grasp the concept. I don't mean to say this in a condescending way. \n\nBut what is the basis for the assumption that these differences have an inherent, unique value? I\u2019m assuming this whole time we\u2019re speak\nstrictly on racial differences. I\u2019m going to make another bolder assumption and assume you\u2019re black. If you and I were born on the same day, grew up next door to each other in the same neighborhood (it can be a nice middle class neighborhood or a shitty poor one), went to the same K-12 schools (again, could be nice schools or shitty schools), had the same family structure (nuclear family, single parent, or other) had the same friend circles, had the same hobbies and the same friend circles, go to the same college and get the same major, and apply for the same job, what is the biggest difference between us at that point? At that point it\u2019s safe to assume our value systems align, our education is the same, our extracurriculars are the same, maybe one of us had a crazy ex-girlfriend and took a unique perspective from that the other didn\u2019t or something, idk lmao, but for all intents and purposes, it seems like the company is going to get the same benefit from you as they would from me. I want to know what is the unique benefit that the company derives from the racial difference between us. I don\u2019t have any issues grasping the inherent value of different perspectives and experiences working together collaboratively for the same reason Obama credited it with job success. What I\u2019m struggling to reconcile is how racial diversity inherently has an advantage when you could can pretty easily ensure you have thought and experience diversity regardless of race.",

This sort of framing is extremely common in Democrat circles. It's not a winning strategy; it's read by others as a holier-than-thou, demeaning, or condescending \"you are a terrible person who has view X, explain yourself\". Many people of the view you oppose likely do not believe X. You often won't get a response because your critical question breaks safety and encourages an echochamber by socially outcasting your opponent.\n\nIf your version of equity-based policy is perceived to have a significant benefit for wealthy individuals in minority classes, they will not be popular to poorer individuals in majority classes. Or actually, more generally, if your policy excludes these poorer individuals **\\*\\*who society has wronged and put at a disadvantage\\*\\*** (to use your exact phrasing) because your verbiage implies these disadvantaged folks are somehow advantaged over others who are often clearly of significant means, you certainly aren't winning the silent majority over.",

I hired one guy a few years ago who was very smart, and was a perfect fit for the role however, he was very disliked by my team and everyone he encountered. Extremely narcissistic and \"my way or the highway\" kind of mentality.  I let him go 8 months later - not for that reason, though. He straight up took a week off without telling me lol.\n\nI've also been a manager at various other companies, some were also fortune 500 and others were much smaller. Same thing applies.\n\nThe thing that people don't understand is that it depends on the industry. Take IT for example, there simply aren't a lot of women who are interested in that field and even less who apply for positions in that field. So 99% of the people I hire, are men.\n\nIf I need a position filled, I tell HR what I want and need. HR then filters the resume's/applications and the ones that make it through are sent to me. I then review them and choose the ones I feel might be a good fit. Many times, I have no clue what their name is until I inform HR that I want to interview this person.",

            "body": "The first thing Democrats need to do is understand what exactly is being promoted. Very often they'll dismiss criticisms and just say \"no, it's about fairness\" or \"we're just teaching the real history of race,\" or whatever the latest mantra is without examining what's actually going on.\n\nWith affirmative action, the narrative is that when it's two equally qualified people, the minority will win out, but that minorities won't be chosen over more highly qualified people. It'd be nice if that were true, but then we get Biden saying black women and black women *only* will be considered to fill a Supreme Court seat: \"I\u2019m looking forward to making sure there\u2019s a Black woman on the Supreme Court to make sure we in fact get everyone represented.\"\n\nOr, [this is now a bit outdated](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/), look at medical school admissions. An Asian student scoring at the 80th percentile on the MCAT had the same chances to get in as a black student scoring at the 50th percentile. That's not \"all else being equal, choose the minority.\" That's choosing mediocre black students over exceptional white and Asian students.\n\nIf Democrats want to continue pushing DEI (or whatever new name it ends up taking), they need to accept that this type of thing does in fact happen, and then decide whether it's a good thing or a bad thing. What won't win is telling people it doesn't happen.\n\nSame thing with critical race theory. And I'm not talking about the stuff Derrick Bell wrote, I'm talking about the Pop CRT that makes it into the mainstream.\n\nFor instance, in the opening essay of the 1619 Project, we get this claim: \"one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.\" That's just not true. Historian Gordon Wood (yeup! that one) could find *no* evidence of colonists expressing any worry about the British ending slavery in the colonies. The Declaration of Independence gives a laundry list of complaints against the King, and slavery doesn't come up. Fighting in the Revolution began in New England, where slavery was much less common, and Massachusetts abolished slavery *during the frigging revolutionary war.* By 1804, all the northern states had abolished slavery. I guess they didn't get the memo.\n\nAny time someone says \"they're not teaching CRT in schools,\" you need to know that the 1619 Project was in fact taught in thousands of classrooms. If your response is \"that's not what CRT is,\" then you're missing the point, because *whatever that is*, it's what people are complaining about when they talk about CRT.\n\nOr let's take Ibram Kendi's best selling How to Be an Anti-Racist. His definition of anti-racist is actively promoting racial outcome equalization. Anything other than that is definitionally racist. Colorblind admissions policies are racist. A white parent taking her kid to soccer practice is racist (white kids participate in more extracurricular activities, so she is furthering the racial divide). A white person getting a good night's sleep is racist (whites get more and higher quality sleep). Literally everything you do that does not advance equalizing outcomes for blacks is racist.\n\nLowering capital gains tax is racist because it benefits more white people. Not a hypothetical, he actually said that in an interview with Ezra Klein. Failing to raise capital gains tax rate, also racist. How much should it be? 100% might be too low. \"Capitalism is essentially racist; racism is essentially capitalist. They were birthed together from the same unnatural causes, and they shall one day die together from unnatural causes.\" \"I think in order to truly be antiracist, you also have to truly be anti-capitalist, as I write in the book. And in order to truly be anti-capitalist, you have to be antiracist, because they\u2019re interrelated.\"\n\nHe's not some fringe guy I dug up. He has multiple best selling books, he's done the talk show circuit, his anti-racism research center at Boston University got $50 million in funding (including a $10 million donation from Jack Dorsey), and after mismanaging that fund, he's being given a new center at Howard.\n\nThis isn't \"we just want to teach the history of racism.\" This is saying we need to seize all the assets of white people and redistribute them to equalize wealth. And if in 20 years it happens to be that white people saved more and made more prudent investments, we'll have to seize it and redistribute it all again. How is that history?\n\nThis shit is real, it's happening, it might not yet be the mainstream of the left, but it's far from just the fringe. Democrats need to figure out whether they agree with it or not, and if not, how they can deal with it.",

But at the same time, look at actual history. We got schools that are nominally integrated but still have extreme racial divides, and the schools that are predominantly black have far worse outcomes than the predominantly white schools.\n\nSo rather than separate but equal, we basically have separate and unequal.\n\nImagine if we could run the experiment again and in Brown the Supreme Court decided schools could remain segregated so long as per-pupil funding was equalized across the state.\n\nWould black student end up with better educational outcomes than they have today? I think we have to say *maybe.*\n\nWe can also say that segregation is fundamentally evil, even if it results in better outcomes, and so we just can't tolerate it.

And I don't think any of them were even very good, much less dominant. It's a non-issue.  And frankly one that localities and individual leagues can handle.\n\nAnd the impulse is to just say \"well, it only impacts 10 people, so we should just give in and that will end the discussion\" but it never does.  Because for conservatives it's not actually about women's sports (that they have never cared about before) and as soon as you concede and inch there, they will jump to the next corner case and work to slowly erode trans rights across the board.\n\nThe real failure of Democrats was waffling and their inability to point out what a stupid discussion this is given trans people are still facing hate crimes just for being trans.  But one of liberals worst impulses is wanting to be seen as reasonable and nuanced and always looking at both sides of an issue.  So we will allow the focus of the debate to shift from \"should trans people have equal rights\" to \"is it technically fair for a trans woman on estrogen to compete in NCAA women's sports.\"",

We finally won state ballot initiatives when we stopped apologizing and treating claims about teaching kids about gay sex as reasonable and we went on the offensive and had teachers saying we their goal is to keep all kids safe and ensure equality.\n\nSlipper slope is true here because it's how Republicans operate.  The real failure was Biden and Harris not tackling the issue straight on.  They apologized.  They both gave up ground on trans people in sports and medical procedures on minors (again, a non issue that does not happen in real life) and it did not help them one bit.\n\nDitto with immigration.  Biden passed a draconian EO.  Harris was \"tough on the border\" and said she (and Biden) had built more of a wall and Trump was ineffective.  And yet that did not help her one bit.  It just confirmed to people the border was an issue and there was a crisis and of people who believed it was a big issue, most voted for Republicans and trusted them to do a better job.\n\nPlaying defense and placating Republicans never works.",

If this \"I am the best at everything ever and nobody ever won as bigly as us!!\" ego-driven nonsense wasn't repeated ad-nauseum in 2020, if Trump had handled the pandemic with any sort of respect or humility, if he ever admitted at least a single mistake, or showed care for people that were hurting most in 2020, he would have won re-election easily, like how Bush did in 2004. Instead he lost that purely because of his own folly, where people were so tired of his nonsense that his opponent received the highest popular vote total in US history, and MAGA is still so ego driven that you all haven't even accepted that, either.\n\nWith how many mistakes Democrats made in 2024, how much both the Biden campaign and the Harris campaign screwed up at different points, with the state of the economy, Biden having by far the worst debate performance in the history of US presidential debates, Trump narrowly surviving an assassination attempt, he would have easily won in a 2008 style blowout if he kept his trap shut for once and set his ego to the side.\n\nHell, post-Butler PA, Republicans and news pundits were setting him up for a more palatable, popular and calm tone, and yet MAGA is such an insufferable, chronically angry movement, that Trump couldn't even keep that up, and it led to him taking a slam dunk potential landslide, and won in a squeaker and the third most narrow win of the 21st century, behind only 2016 (yet another time he almost fumbled against a historically unpopular candidate) and 2000. \n\nYour exact lying and boasting about fake data like \"hasn't been done since Reagan\" is the exact reason why the GOP can never stay popular or loved for more than a year in the Trump era, even against historically unpopular opposition.",

The left has seemed to make it a major issue for a decade or two, and at some point voters want to move on and feel like there's too much effort being spent for the benefit. Pronouns, for example - how often do you hear about that vs how many people actually need it clarified? It comes off as ridiculous as the right worrying about banning all of it. \n\nFor better or worse, the average voter cares about what affects their life locally. How big of a deal are most of the left's positions when compared to the ACUTE, LOCAL effect it will have on someone's life? Gay marriage? Sure, that should happen. Pronouns, gender reassignment, etc? Mostly zero effect. They aren't racist, but get mad when they're called racist for not being an activist and the other person comes off as extremely thin skinned.  \n\nWhat does acutely affect people? Money, money, and money - and perception is all that counts. Trump/the right focus on getting more money to people. Does it actually happen? It's irrelevant - it appears to happen, and if/when it doesn't, they have a scapegoat. The left is focused on making sure the climate gets fixed (which needs to happen), but it always seems like it'll make everything cost more. The left says LGBTQIA is a major point of emphasis (again, I'm not saying that's wrong), but to the average voter, that has very little true effect on their lives. They think it's a good thing, but don't want it to affect them - \"live your life how you want and let me live mine how I want.\" Not figuring out pronouns and getting treated like a piece of shit for a mistake. Not spending hours and hours with company training sessions. Not walking on eggshells for fear of being cancelled. Is that how things are? No, but it seems like the left always talks those points up. \n\nSo voters are left with 'you're terrible if you're not actively pushing for DEI' vs 'get more money' (again, in their mind only, not reality). When they're around people who don't agree with them politically and say they're not super anti Trump, they're looked down on. At some point, they throw up your hands and say who gives a fuck then. The left has done XYZ for LGBTQIA, but what about me specifically, other than tell me I have to behave a certain way. \n\nUntil the left gives more shits about the average and less about the fringe (in statistical terms), the only time they'll win is when the right screws up horrifically. Because voters saw what Trump did, then saw what the left did, and said Trump was a better option. So unless the right rolls out someone worse than Trump, the left will struggle until they adapt. \n\n*All of this was from what I hear on a regular basis. Some I agree with, some I don't. I'm just trying to put forth what I've seen the usual beliefs to be.",

                                                    "body": "Apologies for the delay in responding.  Was traveling, but assuming this is in good faith, let me offer a few thoughts on where I agree and disagree:\n\n*DEI mostly. The average person has no issues with people who are LGBTQIA, but just wants to live their life. The left has seemed to make it a major issue for a decade or two, and at some point voters want to move on and feel like there's too much effort being spent for the benefit. Pronouns, for example - how often do you hear about that vs how many people actually need it clarified? It comes off as ridiculous as the right worrying about banning all of it.*\n\nFirst, two points here.  One is that I was confused by your use of the left, but you seem to more broadly mean Democrats.  We often subdivide ourselves so we have centrists, moderates, and leftists/progressives.\n\nAs for this being a multi-decade issue that is because rights have come slowly.  Much faster than say civil rights for minorities.  But still, it has taken multiple decades to even achieve baseline equality and in some places you can still be fired just for being LGBT and other rights are constantly under attack from conservatives.  So it's been a fight out of necessity, as least for the actual left.\n\nFor liberals / centrists, they also take a lot of money from big donors, so they do enjoy focusing in on cultural issues such as social equality because the whole party can agree on the importance of social equality, whereas the other big pillar of progressives, economic justice is much more controversial and upsets the people writing the big PAC checks.\n\n*For better or worse, the average voter cares about what affects their life locally. How big of a deal are most of the left's positions when compared to the ACUTE, LOCAL effect it will have on someone's life? Gay marriage? Sure, that should happen. Pronouns, gender reassignment, etc? Mostly zero effect. They aren't racist, but get mad when they're called racist for not being an activist and the other person comes off as extremely thin skinned.*\n\nI agree with most of this, but how many times are people attacked as being racist or for some small misstep in real life?  I am a cis gay man and have misgendered transgender people on several occasions.  Every single time, they politely corrected me and I apologized and used the correct pronoun after.  Obviously, people are individuals and there are good, bad, and crazy people in all groups, so I believe that at some point in time someone made an innocent mistake and was read the riot act by a trans person, but that is not the norm.  It is not an everyday occurrence.  And if you surveyed all of your friends, it probably has not happened to any of them or at most one of them if they got unlucky.\n\n*What does acutely affect people? Money, money, and money - and perception is all that counts. Trump/the right focus on getting more money to people. Does it actually happen? It's irrelevant - it appears to happen, and if/when it doesn't, they have a scapegoat. The left is focused on making sure the climate gets fixed (which needs to happen), but it always seems like it'll make everything cost more.*\n\nI agree with you here.  As a progressive myself, I believe that economic justice and social equality are linked.   And both are very important.  But as mentioned earlier, centrist Democrats don't want to recon with that.  Hillary Clinton famously gave her idiotic speech where she asked if \"breaking up the banks would end racism\" when she was getting scared of Bernie surging in 2015.  And that epitomizes what I was saying earlier.  Tacking racism is important, but it's \"easy\" on the left as everyone agrees.  Tackling the \"too big to fail\" banks is popular with voters, but not with the banks funding Democratic and Republican Super PACs.  So they place a lot of emphasis on the former and not the latter.  \n\nWhich is too bad, because the debate from 2016 of racism v. economic anxiety is a dumb one, as the two are interconnected.  Throughout history we can see as economic anxiety increases, people start trying to blame \"others\" such as immigrants, racial minorities, etc.  Latent racism that exists but is sort of dormant or not a driver of someone's voting or day to day actions activates as people worry about providing for their families and want someone else to blame for their struggles.",

Which supplied low housing.  By the late 1970s, the industry struggled with reduced production volumes and diminished accessibility for low-income buyers.  \n\nThe permanent chassis requirement for manufactured homes, established under the 1976 HUD Code, mandates that all manufactured homes be built on a steel chassis.   This limited design flexibility, increasing costs, and creating barriers to integrating manufactured homes into traditional neighborhoods.\n\nEliminating the chassis would reduce material waste and allow for more efficient use of resources in factory-built housing production and help address the U.S. housing shortage by modernizing manufactured home design.\n\nAnd it\u2019s entirely up to the Federal Government.",

His original campaign promises were pretty vague, but inasmuch as he talked about policy it was mostly about ending the Iraq War and reforming healthcare \u2013 neither of which has much to do with race. No DEI, no reparations, very little about the police or welfare or other issues in America that are often considered \"racially coded.\"\n\nThe 2010 anti-Obama backlash was so massive in part because of sheer racism and the increasing popularity of news sources like Fox. But the economy's poor performance and the fact that Obama was seen as \"not doing enough\" to fix it were the main reasons.

I hope I can help you find a solution.\n\n\n\n\nThere has always been some sort of push back to diversity in general. I usually heard gripes about it when it pertained to all media. Some examples would be when Disney got backlash about the Little Mermaid live action casting, or memes expressing how there's always an ethnic person that's a side character, or how the main character of a game is non binary, etc. Which would open discussions about race some were productive, most were not. This used to be coupled with celebrations and encouragement but at some point the dissent over took the enthusiasm and people got tired of the celebrations. I started to hear expressions amongst the people I interacted with that the enthusiasm is manufactured, that corporations are only trying to have more views and \"pats on the back\" this attitude got more pessimistic as time went on and we faced more challenges with race such as the BLM protests and police misconduct and brutality in general. Then it really took off when SFFA VS Harvard ruled against affirmative action, but it all came to a head when Ron DeSantis became the face of \"the culture wars\" and people were \"tired of being PC\". Governor DeSantis called it \"woke\" and then Elon Musk started using the term and it all got bundled in there with the hate for \"the left\" and \"what's wrong with modern America\" and now here we are. DEI is seen as the opposite of what it was for, I see it get called racist and oppressive frequently now and now \"DEI hire\" can double as \"white power\" and as a slur to tell you that your inferior along with the term liberal or leftist.\n\n\n\n\nMy solution on what to do about it? Unfortunately I don't have a solution, I'm keeping it simple and winging it. Im getting more educated on my rights, I'm energized to get involved in my community, I'm energized to prioritize my responsibilities as a citizen and do more than just work and vote. I'm calling my congressman, and my senator and reminding them that my voice needs to be considered, I'm calling my other states men and telling them that I support them and their causes, I'm calling other states man and telling them my concerns as a voter. Finally and most importantly, I'm learning to have discussions. Reddit has been very helpful in getting me energized and focused. I can't change minds, but I can have discussions and I think that's powerful. I now think that approaching ideological oppositions with productivity as the top priority is the way to go. I'm probably over optimistic, and I'm late and I'm messy but I'm taking action and I hope others do as well. I believe that the Democrats need encouragement to continue to uphold the Constitution and they are in a position to listen to constituents all over the nation so they can platform on it. If Democrat voters have been frustrated with their party and its ideals now is the time to speak up now is the time to embolden them to continue to resist and slow down DOGE and its takeover.",

That's entirely different than saying DEI is bad, economic fairness is also insufficient, and many are conflating the 2. White men of similar economic class will always have advantages due to systematic racism.

Point to the Trump administration, which is stacking itself with horribly unqualified loyalists, not the best people for the job. Hammer that home repeatedly the next 4 years. Diversity is good.

RFK Jr was someone targeted by Trump consistently on his fake twitter until last year when he suddenly sucked up to him and all of a sudden he\u2019d qualified to lead a health related department? \n\nYou promote it without talking about it, but rather by attacking the credibility of the people who are against it. DEI was never about just giving unqualified minorities jobs, it was about making sure that we treat each other with respect regardless of background and making sure highly qualified leaders don\u2019t get overlooked on jobs based on inherent biases of older, white employers. But that\u2019s the kind of thing that I think naturally most people WANT to believe, which is why they always use \u201cDEI\u201d instead of actually spelling out the words it stands for. They\u2019ve turned it into a mainstream attack just like \u201cwoke\u201d.\n\nTurn it back on them. If we\u2019re two years into this, the economy is in the shitter, prices are up and we\u2019re in conflict with multiple countries then you need to aggressively attack the types of decisions being made right now as the reason for it. Then when you get power back, hire someone competent regardless of race. Which you were already doing, but when they yell \u201cDEI\u201d at the first sight of a black person, it won\u2019t have the punch since they won\u2019t have credibility. \n\nYou\u2019re already kind of seeing it happen with the airline/ATC shit. The DEI attacks are not sticking, because it\u2019s ridiculous and it\u2019s a lot easier to whine about everything when you\u2019re not in power. There\u2019s a reason Trump won twice as a challenger but lost as an incumbent. He\u2019s a perennial victim who is always looking for an excuse to pass blame onto someone else for any reason his mind can come up with, which is a lot harder to get away with when you\u2019re the fckn president.",

You should be putting Pete Hegseth on full blast constantly over what makes him specifically qualified to make complex decisions at the defense department. Yes I know he was in the military. There are tens thousands of people who have been in the military, does that make every one of them qualified? It\u2019s not hard to make the case that Hegseth was chosen based on loyalty to Trump alone. \n\nMy worry with Democrats isn\u2019t that the case can\u2019t be made, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t seem to have someone right now in any position of power capable of making it that people are listening to. Like I like Chuck Schumer, he\u2019s my senator\u2026.. but his boring and monotone C-Span rants are not gonna move a single needle. As for Hakeem Jeffries, he\u2019s very good at uniting the Democratic house conference and looking competent when standing next to Mike Johnson, but he doesn\u2019t have the same power pull that Pelosi did and until he actually IS speaker, nobody is gonna listen or know who he is either. \n\nThat leaves what\u2026 former presidents and VPs? I\u2019d be shocked if we ever hear from Biden again. Harris seems to be biding her time. Obama and Clinton don\u2019t have the pull they used to.

My understanding is DEI is simply trying to recruit new employees from under represented groups and trying to remove existing internal barriers for advancement within those groups. Recruitment, retention and promotion are things every existing Human Resources department does. Seems like they should approach these goals as an improved way of running their existing HR departments rather than making it a whole new thing they have to do.

It's a wildly ahistorical claim with nothing to back it up, and relies entirely on a single newspaper article in the colonies discussing Somerset v. Stewart ending slavery in England and Wales. But there's no record of this influencing the revolutionaries, they didn't mention it in their long list of complaints against the King, and Massachusetts even abolished slavery *during the war*, with the rest of the North following suit by 1804.\n\nMeanwhile, DEI won't push learning about people like Maggie Smith. She was the daughter of a slave who chartered a bank in 1903 to help Black business women. The early successes of Black business leaders undermines the un-nuanced DEI narrative of oppression. Was there oppression? Yes. And I have no doubts that Smith and others like her faced tremendous hurdles because of their race. But DEI can't square her success with its narrative. [But you will hear about Black Wall Street](https://utulsa.edu/about/offices/diversity/race-massacre-centennial/), only because of the Tulsa Race Riots.\n\nSimilarly, efforts to teach the \"real history\" of slavery conveniently leaves out the role Africans played in the slave trade. We end up with the mythology popularized by Roots of whites going into Africa to catch slaves rather than buying them from African slavers (white slavers would have quickly died from malaria if it happened like Roots portrayed). Roots of course isn't the product of DEI -- DEI wasn't around at the time, but it's a view DEI has adopted. But DEI's attempt to rewrite history is how we got The Woman King, a movie that depicts Dahomey as being anti-slavery, when the kingdom was one of the biggest slavers in Africa at the time, providing 20% of the slaves in the Atlantic slave trade; the British navy had to forcibly end the practice.\n\nOr take Juneteenth celebrations, [which have become a big part of DEI initiatives](https://ogletree.com/insights-resources/blog-posts/juneteenth-is-a-federal-holiday-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-tips-for-proactive-employers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Juneteenth of course purports to celebrate the actual end of slavery in the United States when the Union army freed the slaves in Galveston, Texas. Missing from the Juneteenth observances though is any mention that slavery actually continued for almost an entire year after, until it was ended on Indian reservations. The Smithsonian's African American History Museum [marks Juneteenth as the end of slavery](https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/why-juneteenth-important), with no acknowledgement that it continued after. Why? Because that runs counter to the DEI narrative that America is first and foremost about White oppression of Blacks.\n\nThat's the sort of principle that underlies DEI.",

From the trail of tears, to slavery, to the abuse of Chinese laborors, America was built on the backs of abused minorities who were not paid their worth and who's lives were incredibly hard.

My brief review told me this was a \"historically SET\" piece written with the intention of exposing a different perspective.  Hardly worthy of such strong words as \"attempting to re-write history\".  Giving a different view is common today and useful as we NEED to understand each other's perspectives.\n\nAfter all, the people of Germany supported Hitler.  Wouldn't it be valuable to know WHY?  you don't have to take every utterance as fact, it is perspective.\n\nI read through the rest of it and it seems like you are saying that what is taught shys away from a handful of success stories to try and paint a bleeker picture than you think is real.

I think it is because forcing them to look at their privilage and the fact that wealth and income distribution is so horribly skewed in this country BECAUSE of the racist actions of their grandfathers and the fact that the system was built to keep minorities down is uncomfortable.\n\nFor example, to throw away Juneteenth because , , ,\"slavery actually continued for almost an entire year after, until it was ended on Indian reservations.\" is hardly constructive and I might even call it a red herring.  GOP conservatives are not suddenly all about equity but DEI isn't doing ENOUGH.  What I suggest, based on your apologetics of your side, is that conservatives are grasping at any excuse they can to rid themselves of REMINDERS that they are decedents of those who heaped abuses onto others.  Those reminders ping at their guilt and rather than face the reality and feelings (As I have and other liberals have) they want to quite literally white wash it away.\n\nAnd to support my beliefs about the GOP endgame, I offer the following observations.  DeSantis got rid of DEI and replaced it with NOTHING.  He railed against DEI as \"Discriminatory\" but how?  And finally, how does BIG GOVT forbidding universities (for ADULTS) from spending money on DEI promote \"real equality\" as he claims?\n\nCan you explain or shed light on how refusing to talk about the realities of our history and hiding them away again will HELP us grow as a nation?",

The claim is that the *defining characteristic* of America is oppression. That's not a \"fact,\" it's an opinion, and it's one that's very hard to square with the facts. If the *defining characteristic* of America is oppression, how can you explain the North ending slavery so quickly. By 1804 was the North fundamentally anit-American?\n\n>this was a \"historically SET\" piece written with the intention of exposing a different perspective\n\nExcept that it's based on massive historical inaccuracies. This isn't my opinion, it's been lambasted by serious historians. It's distorting history to fit a narrative, not simply telling it from a different point of view to highlight forgotten or ignored parts of history.\n\n>Do you think that ALL blacks had the opportunities of Maggie Smith or C. J. Walker?\n\nOf course not, but DEI wants to push a narrative where there is no nuance. It was only maximum suffering all the time because *the reason America exists* is for the purpose of oppressing Black people.\n\nNot \"oppression has been a prominent part of American history\" but \"oppression is the only thing there is in American history.\"\n\n>the fact that the system was built to keep minorities down\n\nHow do you square this with the fact of a black woman chartering a bank in 1903? Why didn't the system, which she needed the permission of (that's what chartering a bank involves), keep her down?\n\nYou can certainly find examples of the system keeping black people down, but if the *sole purpose* of the system is oppression, do you think they just were asleep on the job that day? What gives?\n\n>What I suggest, based on your apologetics of your side, is that conservatives are grasping at\n\nI'm not a conservative.\n\n>Can you explain or shed light on how refusing to talk about the realities of our history and hiding them away again will HELP us grow as a nation?\n\nI'm not talking about what DeSantis has done and I don't think you'll find anything in what I've written that voices support for him.\n\nI'd be all for DEI talking about *reality* of our history if it was promoting reality. But it's not.\n\nIn the 1619 Project NHJ writes \"one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery.\" That's patently false. The abolitionist movement in Britain didn't kick off until a decade *after* the Revolution and was inspired largely by *American* abolitionists. That's not just me saying it, that's Princeton history professor Sean Wilentz. It's also Leslie Harris, a history professor at Northwestern and an expert in colonial slavery. And historian Steven Hahn, who serves on the Pulitzer's board. And the list goes on.",

Some of this is just a belief in social equity, but it spills over into my curiosity as a human and also as a capitalist/investor.\n\nMy observation of DEI programs is that the implementations are usually \"let's make sure we at least talk to a representative group of candidates\" while still aiming to hire the best out of that group. The other part is making sure processes are focused on identifying the people most qualified for the job and not biased in some other way.\n\nSome go a bit farther and investigate, for instance, where in someone's life they become less interested in a particular career path (ex: why do fewer women go to school for computer science?) and attempt to offer programs to show that it's a good opportunity so that the pool of new graduates is more balanced in a few years.\n\nWhen I see a company publish in their SEC filings that they want to hire more diverse candidates, my expectation is that they're finding ways to get a broader applicant pool, which tends to raise the bar on who they hire. That's generally good business and makes the company more attractive to me as an investor.\n\nI've never seen a case of a company hiring someone because of their race directly, or advantaging an individual over another because they are a member of some category - at least not directly. What I have seen is \"hey... We do all of our recruiting at ivy leagues - what if we expanded a bit and made sure we include some schools in the south\" - the total number hired stays the same, but it turns out that they find a candidate from an HBCU who beats out a rich Harvard legacy for a job. Similarly, a company who historically hired through referrals sets up a table at a community job fair and happens to find some candidates more skilled than Joe's cousin.\n\nAs an investor, I find DEI and ESG issues to largely be parts of the same coin. Thinking about long term sustainability and cost of energy supplies is important - especially for energy intensive sectors like data centers and reporting on it is good. Thinking about how you find and build the most qualified workforce is good. I don't understand how they became political targets and not just something for business to care about.",

It's also why the republican right is working very hard to shut down education and publications that support a more educated and tolerant population as they will and are losing control of us.",

A winning strategy is to get back to the content itself and the deeper reasoning of it, and deliver it without the political weight.\u00a0\n\n\nDiversity isn't about getting more people of color in to the group, it's about the value in having a diverse crowd of opinions and backgrounds that can offer different views and different understandings of a problem, which can result in more creative solutions. It empowers a company, not detracts from it.\u00a0\nThe US is built on that multiculturalism and we continue to build in with every immigration wave.\u00a0\nBut this Diversity Concept holds true in an all woman all Black company just the same.\u00a0\nIt also doesn't mean each company should have an exact number of individuals from each race, sexuality and gender. There's value in being different, but by embracing the concept of diversity you can grow stronger.\u00a0\n\n\nEquity is also not a bad concept either, but you cant jam it in at the end of the process, otherwise people would feel cheated. Equity should be about the understanding that our starting point is not the same, and there are many people of low economic backgrounds who do not have access to the same resources and thus end up with less qualifications. Which means we need to bridge that gap and add resources to those that lack it so they can reach the same height when climbing the ladder. This also requires an understanding that there are white people who are similarly disenfranchised. Sure, at much lesser numbers than other minorities, but we should focus on bringing them all up regardless of their skin color.\u00a0\n\n\nEquity is about creating the same starting line, so they could all be enjoy Equality at the finish line.\u00a0",
