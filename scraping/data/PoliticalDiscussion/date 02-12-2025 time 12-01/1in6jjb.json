    "selftext": "Is congress the enforcement arm of the federal courts for the president? During the Nixon administration and the watergate scandal, Nixon was considering refusing to listen to the Supreme Court which then led to congress threatening to impeach him, and after this he abided. With Trump now being over the US Marshals, is congress technically the only enforcement arm available to the federal courts in the case that Trump won\u2019t oblige?",

Other than that, there is little anyone can do since he is the executive over the various law enforcement agencies that would otherwise enforce legal judgements.\n\nThis is why people are using the term Constitutional Crisis, the situation is what it is, and there is a remedy for it laid out in the Constitution, but will the Congress act, or stand by and let Trump defy the law?  The interesting part will be those not POTUS, and how they think they will fare if he is removed.  That is why they are forcing everyone out and replacing them with loyalists that are ignorant of what could happen to them if they obey clearly illegal orders, especially if Trump is no longer POTUS to issue pardons.",

            "body": "Yes. If the President chooses to disregard a ruling of the Supreme Court, the only Constitutional mechanism for enforcement of that ruling is impeachment and removal from office. The Supreme Court has no mechanism to enforce its rulings - any normal enforcement of the Supreme Court's authority comes from the executive branch which, of course, is under the ultimate authority of the President. And while Congress could pass laws attempting to restrict the President's authority, the normal enforcement of the Congress's authority comes from the executive branch as well. The exception to this is impeachment.\n\n  \nThis highlights a terminal flaw in our Constitution. The President was intended to function as the chief executor of the government, administering the laws passed by Congress. Independent presidential powers were intended to be limited to those that required a rapid and flexible response (largely foreign affairs). By limiting presidential powers, the position could be both independent of the legislature and judiciary branch while minimizing the risk of a rogue President. Meanwhile, the electoral college was intended to separate the President from the interests of the people. In this way it was hoped to maintain the President's independence from those interests as well. This failed. \n\n\n\nUltimately, the system for electing the President has given us a semi-populist presidency, with Presidents having their own domestic policy positions and agendas and a pseudo-responsibility to the interests of the people who voted for them. Meanwhile, it was apparent from pretty much 1800 on that the President would have more power than intended. This was necessary to maintain a functioning state. And so, we have been dependent on unwritten agreements where the President respects the authority of the Supreme Court and the Congress, and vice versa.",

Truthfully that has been true since Andrew Jackson's day.  \n\nWhat power the Court had over the Executive branch was due to those previous administrations respect for the Constitution.  That and Congress's control of the money.  At this juncture, Congress is complicit/subservient to the Executive branch and the current POTUS has been pretty much held unaccountable by the Judiciary for past transgressions.  So he has no reason to comply with any federal courts ruling.",

The DOJ is suppose to be independent but I\u2019m assuming Trump won\u2019t let that happen. So the only way Congress can \u201cenforce\u201d is by either impeaching and the senate removed him from office, political pressure or by creating a new law that gives Congress powers to enforce. However, I\u2019m not sure if that new law would need to be a constitutional amendment or just an act of Congress. If Trump continues to cut departments and lay off staff illegally then we would likely be in a constitutional crisis",

            "body": "Actually no - Congress isn't technically an enforcement arm, but rather they're using their constitutional power of impeachment as a political check when other enforcement mechanisms fail. The federal courts typically rely on the executive branch (DOJ, US Marshals, etc.) to enforce their decisions through the principle of constitutional separation of powers. While impeachment can pressure a president to comply with court orders, it's more of a constitutional failsafe than a direct enforcement mechanism. If Trump were to defy court orders, there are still several enforcement options available - including the DOJ's existing authority structures that operate independently of presidential control, state law enforcement in relevant jurisdictions, and potential enforcement through civil contempt powers. The impeachment threat worked with Nixon because it represented a total loss of political support, not because Congress was acting as direct enforcement.",

The only court that can technically overrule a president would be the Supreme Court as they can declare something unconstitutional, therefore, not allowing it become a law or removing it from the law. \nThe high court would be the only \"enforcement\" against the POTUS if you consider the veto or declarations of the court to be enforcement. A lower level court, even a lower federal court, will have a hard time stopping a presidential order. With that said a lower level federal court could issue a temporary pause on presidential orders/powers until they reach the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case. Cornell put out a paper on that sometime ago and laid out some constitutional law. I'll find it and link it. \n\nhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-7/clause-1\u20133/the-veto-power\n\nhttps://www.archives.gov/files/legislative/resources/education/veto/background.pdf",

No one freaked out with Bush, Obama, or Biden  filed appeals against judges injunctions\n\n  \nThere was a Supreme court case like 150 years ago that covers if a district court can issue an injunction on a president, btw.  it said they can't. \n\n  \nI am one of the opinion that's its totally fine to rehear cases even when there's case law / precedent though.",
