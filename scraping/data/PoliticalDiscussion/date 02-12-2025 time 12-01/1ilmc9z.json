I mean they vote to fund a program, but then the executive branch just says \"no' well use that money on something else.\n\nWould this represent a huge shift in the form of government in the US?\n\n",

Tearing that down and letting the president do whatever he wants is how we get autocracy.",

It makes me envious.\u201d  He wanted to know more about the German application \"as a source of information and inspiration,\" and envied Mussolini's position because he had \"the press controlled so that they cannot scream lies at him daily.\"\n\nWhat we tend to forget is that fascism wasn't a dirty word back then.

He absolutely didn't work within the framework of the Constitution.  He repeatedly violated it, was repeatedly struck down by the Supreme Court, and threatened to pack the court in response to this very basic check on his power.  There is nothing to indicate that FDR worked within the framework of the Constitution at all; even many of his supporters would acknowledge this.\n\n> Keynesian economics was the framework for liberal democracy\u2019s until the 1980\u2019s. \n\nAnd it's no surprise that we suffered through 40 years of economic chaos and malaise over that time frame.\n\n> FDR was the leader the people needed to insure the government worked for them. Worker protections, banking protections, all stem from his leadership. \n\nThe problem is not that he made the government work for the people, but that he made the people work for the government.  Under FDR's tenure, individuals and private organizations were strongarmed and directed to execute the agenda of the central power, the federal government.  There's a word for that, corporatism, the integration of private interests into the state apparatus.\n\n> He was not a facsist dictator anymore than Abraham Lincoln was a Tyrant.\n\nAbraham Lincoln was dealing with a Civil War.

Yes, but the groundwork that was laid for a strong social safety net and increased union-labor partnership was successful and I can\u2019t see an argument for how it failed post WW2. \n\nWell, let's look at it from an economic standpoint, then.  The Depression era should have put the nail in the coffin but it didn't.  We weren't decimated as a country and had a ton of savings, so the relative boom in the late 1940s into the 1950s wasn't completely out of sorts. At the same time,  growth was anemic during that time.  I think the average was about 2% growth during that era through the beginning of JFK's term, and that's when JFK started in with the decidedly non-Keynesian tax reforms.  \n\nThe 1960s were pretty great from an economic standpoint as a result.  What happened in the 1970s?  The Great Society, which went back to New Deal-style economic reforms and led directly to stagflation, only solved thanks to a repudiation of that type of economic activity under Reagan.\n\nIt's fine that you think the groundwork was laid for unions and safety nets during that time.  What we see, however, is something different: unionization peaked in the 1950s and has been in constant, perpetual decline ever since.  Turns out people might like unions, but they don't really want to be in them.  Meanwhile, Social Security and Medicare have become highly expensive boondoggles that cost more than anticipated and are structured in such a way that they're closing in on a collapse.  LBJ's welfare policies established a perpetual underclass that didn't get sorted out for decades.  It's very difficult for me to look at the era as a positive.\n\n> I don\u2019t know enough about fascism, especially how it was wielded by Mussolini in Italy, to know how the U.S. worked it into their political framework of the Great Depression period. But economically, in the U.S. in 1932 the Great Depression was like nothing people had ever seen. A large Cause for this was that Laissez-faire economic policy had left this country in ruin. \n\nThis simply isn't true.  The \"laissez-faire economic policy\" of the time led to decades of growth and wealth.  A critical problem was the Federal Reserve's treatment of the monetary supply (note: I am not a Federal Reserve skeptic) which led to the output problems economically. The speculation boom/bubble combined with the oversupply of food products created a real storm of circumstance that few could have realistically seen coming.\n\nInterestingly enough, there's reason to believe that President Coolidge saw it coming and thought sticking to market principles might have solved it.  We'll never know for sure.\n\n>  Herbert Hoover was an abject failure because he believed in the power of the market to solve the problems of the Depression. \n\nNot only did Hoover not believe in the power of the market, but he made a series of anti-market moves that exacerbated the crisis.  He acted early to establish federal price controls on farming goods (which certainly contributed to the oversupply problem), put in place a bunch of tariffs, and established federal lending programs, and a host of regulatory changes that ensured we'd stay in the economic doldrums.\n\nDespite all of this, the fact that Hoover's rhetoric stuck to the individualist mindset despite his actions remains the common wisdom.  \n\n> FDR did have to make changes to create the type of Federal Government that the people of the U.S. needed for recovery. But Congress also passed many laws, such as: Emergency Banking Relief Act of 1933, putting safeguards in the banking system, The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, allowed for the formation of unions and the right to strike, The Social Security act and many others. \n\nYour assumption that these were \"needed\" is part of the problem.  None of them addressed the issues with the economy at the time, and many of them outright created an additional drag on the economy that led to the second collapse in the late 1930s.  \n\n> FDR\u2019s administration had to challenge these laws in the courts but in the end these and many others stood as the ground work for what liberal Democracy would look like in the period after WW2. I do not believe Roosevelt was a facist dictator who re-wrote the Constitution. I believe he saw a county that needed a strong federal government to handle the economic problems of the day. \n\nIt's fine that you don't believe this, but the fact remains that his prescriptions were textbook fascist behavior.  His actions were designed to make the economy work for the state, not for the people.  It's a hallmark of fascist regimes: the state is what matters, and everything that matters is in support of the state.  Corporatism.\n\nAgain, it's fine if you think it was the right move.  I look at what happened in other fascist regimes and think we got lucky that we only came out of it with some bad programs and thousands imprisoned.  We could have been Spain.\n\n> FDR lead a nation in ruin to and economic recovery that after 1944-45 was the greatest the world had ever seen. His legacy should be that of a great Democratic leader. \n\nHe did none of these things.\n\nWhat FDR did was prolong an economic malaise by means of radically reforming the very government he served, inspired by the worst leaders in Europe, and saw his economic disaster saved by a wartime effort that, outside of Pearl Harbor, never directly reached our shores.\n\n> In a closing note, in defense of Keynes. If a government elected by the people, and through its elected representatives, vote for changes in the federal government. And they want to work and get paid than this is the vision of a liberal democratic economic system. Because some dictators chose to also control the economy with a centralized form of government, while it will work, it is not sustainable as shown by Italy\u2019s utter collapse after WW2 started. \n\nThe thing is that we have a Constitution specifically for the guardrails in place to ensure that we don't fall into tyranny.  Saying \"yeah, but things are bad so we need to ignore it\" is lawless behavior.  The federal government had no authority to do things like the violate the takings clause or assume powers reserved to Congress in the name of economic reforms during a crisis.  \n\nThink about what this post started out as: right now, Trump is rightfully getting skewered for impoundment actions, and that is *nothing* compared to what FDR did.  Whether \"the people\" want Keynesian economics or not, there's still the law in place.\n\n> In my opinion the main failure of the post WW2 Keynesian economic model is the failure to raise taxes on corporations when times are good so there is a surplus.\n\nThe reason we've abandoned this concept is because we know, now, that a tax on corporations is simply a tax on people.  100% of costs of a business are passed along to the consumers or employees through higher prices or lower wages.  \n\nI dislike the amount of debt we take on, too, but that's a different problem.",

And of the things he liked? That Mussolini had \"the press controlled so that they cannot scream lies at him daily.\"\n\n[Roosevelt wasn't afraid of praising Mussolini either] (https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt), saying \"[t]here seems to be no question that [Mussolini] is really interested in what we are doing and I am much interested and deeply impressed by what he has accomplished and by his evidenced honest purpose of restoring Italy,\" in 1933.\n\n[Roger Shaw] (https://books.google.com/books?id=Qnx_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT178&lpg=PT178&dq=%22Fascist+means+to+gain+liberal+ends%22&source=bl&ots=UnAeMezONF&sig=ACfU3U2iz_m7CYp3NXNZcCPx51QwkgHt_A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNldbsjcjnAhUZknIEHXevD4UQ6AEwBHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Fascist%20means%20to%20gain%20liberal%20ends%22&f=false): \"The New Deal uses the mechanics of Italian fascism to combat the spirit of fascism in American business... employing fascist means to gain liberal ends.\"\n\n[Herbert Hoover's memoirs] (https://books.google.com/books?id=Eum9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT367&dq=%22the+New+Deal+introduced+to+Americans+the+spectacle+of+Fascist%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiP5e6Rj8jnAhWNylkKHQKJCdoQ6AEwAXoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=%22the%20New%20Deal%20introduced%20to%20Americans%20the%20spectacle%20of%20Fascist%22&f=false): \"the New Deal introduced to Americans the spectacle of Fascist dictation to business, labor and agriculture,\u201d and that measures such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act, \u201cin their consequences of control of products and markets, set up an uncanny Americanized parallel with the agricultural regime of Mussolini and Hitler.\u201d\n\nPulitzer-winning journalist Anne O\u2019Hare McCormick, who spent significant time reporting on the rise of fascism in Europe, [saw the comparison as valid too] (https://books.google.com/books?id=LJMsCk8bnKEC&pg=PA533&lpg=PA533&dq=%E2%80%9Cenvisages+a+federation+of+industry,+labor+and+government+after+the+fashion+of+the+corporative+State+as+it+exists+in+Italy.%22&source=bl&ots=XM9DSe85yK&sig=ACfU3U0QHlgdoRtRNq2x0vjTnFdc9onhcw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiOlbWxjcjnAhXlgXIEHf58AnMQ6AEwA3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%E2%80%9Cenvisages%20a%20federation%20of%20industry%2C%20labor%20and%20government%20after%20the%20fashion%20of%20the%20corporative%20State%20as%20it%20exists%20in%20Italy.%22&f=false), observing the New Deal as a program that \"envisages a federation of industry, labor and government after the fashion of the corporative State as it exists in Italy.\"\n\nHis [1938 address to Congress] (https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/message-congress-curbing-monopolies) is another example, which talks about fascist tyranny abroad while completely ignoring the fact that what he described was largely what he did over the prior eight years under his leadership (minus the military-backed expansion).  \n\n> The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism\u2014ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power. \n\nHe knows this isn't true, and he's trying to change the conversation.  Mussolini and Hitler were not fascists because their governments experienced \"ownership... by any other controlling private power.\"  They were fascists because they utterly destroyed any sort of barrier between public and private power through nationalization and government superiority.  Sort of like what FDR had spent years doing.\n\nIn fact, a lot of people like to talk about how fascism tries to exploit \"fear of the other.\"  Same speech:\n\n> The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living...\n\n> Among us today a concentration of private power without equal in history is growing. \n\n> This concentration is seriously impairing the economic effectiveness of private enterprise as a way of providing employment for labor and capital and as a way of assuring a more equitable distribution of income and earnings among the people of the nation as a whole.\n\nMaybe this sounded great back then for people who didn't know what fascism wrought.  We know better now, and we shouldn't pretend otherwise. FDR and his New Deal, to me, looks exactly what I'd expect fascism to look like today, and I'm tired of pretending it wasn't.",

That was the combined work of a fiscally responsible democrat president and a pushy fiscally responsible republican controlled congress. This is back when both sides could, of course, work together. Pretty much every president after him piled on to the debt at staggering levels. \n\nIf we want to go way back in the day, Andrew Jackson almost completely eliminated the US's national debt. If I'm not mistaken he had 98%-99% of the debt gone. Although it was significantly less back in the day. Calvin Coolidge also did a good job at cutting spending and reallocating money to reduce pain from the national debt. \n\nWe need the president and congress to work together to get spending under control. That's what history tells us. Cut unnecessary spending, tighten the reigns on needed spending, and get control of the checkbook in Washington. Before all Americans suffer the results of the US defaulting on her debts.",

The other party successfully convinced America that they could lower prices, and then abandoned that promise pretty quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nCutting spending at levels necessary to reduce the debt is going to cause a recession. Our economy is just too dependent on federal spending. So the party doing the cutting would have to stay in power despite a recession, which would require both parties to not cynically exploit the situation for political gain. This doesn't seem possible in today's political environment.\n\n\nThat said, I don't see why we need to eliminate the debt. It just needs to be controlled. But again, that requires a fiscal responsibility that most Americans are not going to care about enough to continually vote for it.",

In the politically charged environment we have now I understand that's probably going to be something with slim odds. \n\nWhile I understand a certain amount of debt is needed in the short term to make funding some programs feasible in the US, I would liken it to someone with credit card debt not paying off their total balance every month. No debt frees up what we're spending on the payments and interest. A constantly growing debt means those payments and interest get higher and higher. Eventually, once a debt becomes so high, a default is inevitable. And a US default would shake the world and home economies. I'm always a fan of \"zero debt\" financial living personally.",

I zero out my credit card bills every month too, but a national economy is so much different from a household economy that it's basically pointless to compare the two.",
