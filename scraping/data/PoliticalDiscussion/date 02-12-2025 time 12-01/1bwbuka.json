                    "body": "> Why are Trump supporters ignoring all of the warnings from our country's most senior and respected leaders?\n\nThis may help explain why some Trump supporters don't trust politicians and or respect leaders like Gen. Mark Milley (Ret.), who said in 2023: \n\n>  In the broader sense, the war [in Afghanistan] was lost. We were fighting the Taliban and their allies for 20-plus years. And they prevailed in that capital for a lot of reasons. . . Wars aren't lost in the last 10 days or 10 months. Typically, they're the cumulative effect of lots of turns and twists over many, many years. And this war, when the final history is written, will prove to be the same. Lots of lessons learned. Lots of lefts when you should have gone right. And that'll all come out in due time. But lots of regrets, absolutely, 100%.\n\nThe Free Press recently hosted a debate on the subject \"Should the U.S. Still Police the World?\u201d  Matt Taibbi was one of the panelists, and following the debate he wrote: \n\n> [W]e\u2019ve suffered numerous humiliations at the hands of more furious and determined adversaries in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, to say nothing of disasters like our Libyan engagement. The common theme has been politicians betraying soldiers by saddling them with unjust or unclear missions, against people fighting on their own land for their lives and families. . .\n\n> [T]raveling around the U.S. in the 2016 cycle I met soldiers who showed up at Donald Trump\u2019s rallies in larger and larger numbers. Some were responding to his \u201cendless wars\u201d rhetoric, others said they were just curious. Many had been stop-lossed into multiple unexpected tours, or had been injured or seen friends die in an idiotic war, and then come home to find VA services in tatters and economic opportunities hollowed out.\n\n> They were pissed, more than anything at politicians and intellectuals who asked for sacrifice without making it themselves. Far more than the 2008 financial crisis, it\u2019s America\u2019s moronic wars that drive anger toward \u201celites.\"\n\nIn summary, then, it seems some Trump supporters have simply lost confidence in intellectuals and politicians who ask for sacrifice without making it themselves, and who betray soldiers by saddling them with unjust or unclear missions in 20-year wars that are ultimately lost because \"there are lots of lefts when you should have gone right.\"",

Gain of function research is done to study diseases with the purpose of being better prepared for an outbreak. No serious person talks about Covid-19 as a bio-weapon.\n\n>why the push to make it a 'lab leak'?\n\nSecond off, I wouldn't agree with this characterization. There is strong evidence that Covid-19 was the result of a lab leak. Following that evidence isn't a \"push,\" nor would it \"make\" it a lab leak. You're essentially asking \"Why if it was a lab leak is anyone interested in discovering this?\" Because it was a global disaster and people are rightfully interested in knowing how it happened.\n\nAdditionally, Fauci strongly downplayed the lab leak hypothesis and also denied US was involved in gain of function research. Without litigating the case here, there's reason to believe Fauci downplayed the lab leak hypothesis specifically because he was involved in getting the funding for it. If one of our nation's top public health officials was trying to cover up the origins of Covid-19, that's a big deal and should come to light.\n\nThen on top of that, the political right really hates Fauci, so there's an additional political angle to attacking him.",

I looked this up and only found two instances where there was talk of (1) detention camps for illegal immigrants while awaiting deportation, and (2) camps for the homeless so they're not laying out in the streets. When people use the term *concentration camp*, they're usually referring to the Nazi death camps rather than a more general internment camp. By either definition, a camp for homeless people to stay (which would be voluntary) or detention centers to hold illegal immigrants awaiting deportation are a far cry from some permanent camp for \"undesirables\". Using the term \"concentration camp\" here is a deliberate attempt to conflate homeless or deportation camps with Nazi death camps. However, they're obviously very different.\n\nPersonally, if I were in charge I would not be looking to deport illegal immigrants, but doing so isn't exactly the most horrific, unthinkable government action one could imagine.\n\nAnd with the millions dying thing, if you're talking about COVID, that would've happened no matter who was President.\n\nBottom line, if Trump is elected this year, it's not going to make a difference in most Americans' daily lives.

In the Trump era, that prohibition has eroded. It is still rude to bring up politics in a casual conversation, but there are a lot of Trump supporters who no longer feel constrained by manners in their political expression, and put huge flags on the backs of their pickup trucks with his name on them, and wear the red MAGA hat in public. Some of them were inclined to scream insults at houses with Harris signs out front, as they drove by. A great many of the houses that put out Trump/Vance signs before the election, have not taken them down. There are even a few that have had Trump signs in their yard continuously since 2016.\n\nI find it all exhausting and depressing. The left side of American politics has its problems, but I have never seen a political movement as angrily belligerent as the MAGA mentality.

By comparison, the Obama administration did not send weapons to Ukraine, even after Russia invaded Crimea.\n\nYou can make up your own mind on how to weigh these things, especially how much weight to give Trump's rhetoric.

                    "body": "It helps to get into the details of what the allegations are. And I haven't followed any newer stuff, so I'm just going to speak generally here, drawing from the allegations around 2020.\n\nThe claims about election rigging aren't that the final result is locked in by some corrupt people at the top of the system.\n\nInstead, it's that smaller scale issues could happen with the *potential* to flip a state and change the outcome of the election. Think for instance about a state election board changing the rules at the last minute to allow mail-in ballots that were postmarked too late and in a context where the state knows it's going to be close and the mail-in ballots are going to strongly favor one candidate over another.\n\nThat might get an allegation of \"rigging\" because it seems to be changing the rules to favor one candidate. *But*, it'd still make sense for the candidate making the allegation to encourage people to vote because the decision is still coming down to the vote count -- the \"rigging\" just has to do with deciding whether a small percentage of votes would be counted or not.\n\nSimilarly, we could go the other political direction and imagine a state where one party is shutting down polling places in districts that heavily favor the opposing party. That could be called \"rigging,\" but it still makes sense to encourage people to get out and vote. They're not rigging the vote tally, but trying to get less of one side to vote, so you counter that by showing up to vote regardless.\n\nIt's also worth noting that many things that get calling \"rigging\" an election have nothing to do with trying to let in more or fewer votes at all. Lots of times biased media coverage will get called \"rigging\" an election. That allegation has been made around the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Or I could cite Bernie supporters who've used \"rigged\" language to refer to Hillary getting debate questions in advance, or Buttigieg dropping out and endorsing Biden before Super Tuesday.\n\nSo that's the long answer.\n\nThe short answer is that \"rigging\" tends to refer to attempts to put a thumb on the scale, but that thumb can't overcome a decisive advantage.\n\nAnd if you want a sports analogy (because who doesn't!), imagine the refs \"rigging\" a football game. There's lots of close calls when it comes to penalties, so some questionable things get called against one team, don't get called against the other. At halftime, the coach goes into the locker room and everyone is aware of what's going on. What does he tell his team, to just pack it in and leave? No. He tells them to go out there and play harder so it doesn't matter what the refs are doing. Don't have to worry about the ref not calling defensive pass interference in your favor if your wide receiver just blows past the coverage and doesn't have a defender near him to interfere in the first place.",

There are various reasons theorized why older people vote more consistently:\n\n1. They're often retired, so they have a lot more free time to go vote.\n2. They probably don't have young kids in their house to take care of, so once again, more free time.\n3. They're more likely to have lived in their community for a long time, which makes them more likely to want to have a say in state/local issues. Younger people are more likely to have moved around a bit because of education, early career, getting married, maybe starting a family, etc., so they're less likely to have a strong attachment to their community.\n4. Older people have had a whole lifetime of social pressure to vote and have had a chance to develop it into a habit.\n\n> Is it because there\u2019s THAT many more hardcore Republican voters than Democrat voters?\n\nIf showing up to vote every election is \"hardcore,\" then yes.\n\n> Aren\u2019t most major cities in the US overwhelmingly Blue?\n\nGenerally, yes.",

You can pick two of them, but will suffer on the third. If you want it universal and affordable, quality will suffer.\n\nOf course a hiccup in his analysis is that we're both expensive and not universal -- we're at about 92% (and some of the remaining 8% could get insurance but for a variety of reasons don't).\n\nHealth*care* in the US is generally very good. We have shorter wait times for specialists than a lot of European countries, and do very well on cancer survival rates. While the cost is obviously a sore point for most people, it's hard to gain popular support for lowering cost and simultaneously lowering quality.\n\nFor one example, the US has a 90% 5 year survival rate for breast cancer compared to 86% in the UK. How much would you have to see your health insurance costs go down to accept a 40% increased chance of dying if you get breast cancer?",

You're probably seeing the worst 1% of the hearings, if it's even that high.\n\nBut why do some people act like that? A few reasons.\n\nSome members are hoping for moments that will go viral and help get them some national recognition, probably with an eye towards pursuing the presidency or a cabinet position.\n\nSometimes they're just assholes.\n\nBut often it's because the witnesses are being unresponsive and the members usually only have 5 minutes to ask questions (which includes time spent getting answers).\n\nAs a recent example, we had the head of the Secret Service testify about the Trump assassination attempt. A huge portion of her responses were to just refer the Senator to the FBI since they're the ones investigating. For instance, that's the response she gave when asked how many shots were fired, and then how many shell casings were recovered. Later in the hearing another senator had the insight to ask if she'd talked to the FBI about the shooting. She had. Then the senator asked if the FBI told her how many shell casings were recovered. It did. Would she say what the number was? No, they'd have to ask the FBI.\n\nAnd very often the witnesses will do what has become known as filibustering. They'll launch into long-winded non-responses. Just as a (hypothetical) example:\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Thank you for the question, senator. Before I was born, my parents considered a number of different choices for my name, both for if I was a boy or a girl...\"\n\n\"Reclaiming my time. Is your name on your birth certificate?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me what your birth certificate says?\"\n\n\"Thank you for the question, senator. I don't have my birth certificate here today, but I can certainly have my staff provide you with a copy of it.\"\n\nNow you might be wondering why they bother if witnesses aren't going to be responsive. Well, most are, and they don't always know who is going to act like that before a hearing, though often they can suspect. But the point then is basically to cause embarrassment for the person not answering. These hearings do actually matter to people, especially people in powerful positions. Following questioning of university presidents about their responses to anti-Semitism on campus, a few were pressured into resigning. And the head of the Secret Service resigned after her disastrous day of giving non-answers.",

It's a partisan position, so they're not impartial, and the time belongs to the individual member asking questions.\n\nThat said, other members are free to use their time to let the witness finish an answer where they were cut off by someone reclaiming their time.\n\nAlso, when a member's time expires, the witness is given additional time to finish answering whatever they were asked. The chairman can use that time to let the witness answer a question they were cut off on, though usually only if it's at the very end of the 5 minutes.

It's not worth a candidates limited time to go to communities where they won't get a large new voting block. Take Mississippi. That state could easily be the bluest state in the US, with a 37% black population. But because black voters don't turnout, no Democrat ever focuses on the state. As a result, no national Democrats come out of Mississippi, unlike states like Pennsylvania, New York, California, ect. If he wants the system to change, he has to go out and vote.

My family is half black(adoptive on mothers side) and they all vote. I vote. It isn't about how much worse Trump will be. Anyone who pays any attention knows this. They just don't care. Instead, you need to outline to him that every time he doesn't vote, he shows Harris, or Democrats as a whole, that paying attention to him is not worth it. This is not just federal, but also state and local elections. Candidates only have so much time and money, so they will only focus on the people they know will turnout. They will only fix the system for people they know will turnout. I cannot emphasize this enough: When your goal is to be elected, you only care about people, say it with me, **who they know will turnout**. He is actively showing politicians that caring about him is not worth their time. Why do you think Biden just proposed a massive new set of legislation around building housing? It's because he knows it will get young people to turnout, and young people will. Why do you think Trump cut taxes in 2017? It's because that gets a lot of his base to turnout. Why do any politicians do anything? It's for the voters that turnout. You can't demand the system be fixed when you refuse to do anything about it. He won't be on politicians radar until he votes(and trust me, politicians do listen to actual voters) and until then, we get the system we currently have.",

The \"loophole\" she's talking about is an exception to the law that imposes criminal penalties when any alien (legal or not) votes in a federal election. The exception essentially says that if an alien is a permanent resident in the US from childhood (before the age of 16), has US citizen parents, and reasonably believes that he/she is also a US citizen, then that person can't be criminally punished for voting. The intent to perform the act of voting as an alien just isn't there in that circumstance, so it's unreasonable to impose fines/imprisonment for it. That doesn't mean it's legal for them to vote.\n\nI'm not even sure how that exception could possibly apply to an illegal alien. It seems like the people it's targeted at would probably be legal permanent residents who are children of citizens but never got naturalized for whatever reason.\n\nThis is the law she's referring to:\n\n> (a) It shall be unlawful for any alien to vote in any election held solely or in part for the purpose of electing a candidate for the office of President, Vice President, Presidential elector, Member of the Senate, Member of the House of Representatives, Delegate from the District of Columbia, or Resident Commissioner\n\n> ...\n\n> (c) Subsection (a) does not apply to an alien if\u2014\n\n> (1) each natural parent of the alien (or, in the case of an adopted alien, each adoptive parent of the alien) is or was a citizen (whether by birth or naturalization);\n\n> (2) the alien permanently resided in the United States prior to attaining the age of 16; and\n\n> (3) the alien reasonably believed at the time of voting in violation of such subsection that he or she was a citizen of the United States.\n\n> https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/611",

Crimes have two main pieces to them, a guilty act and a guilty mind. The requirements change depending on the crime, but many require you to *knowingly* do something. For instance with theft, you have to *know* the property isn't yours. If you leave the airport with a suitcase that looks like your but is actually someone else's, you didn't commit a crime, you committed a mistake.\n\nLikewise with the situation being described here. If a non-citizen mistakenly believes they are a citizen and votes, they won't be punished. And that's as it should be.\n\nEngelbrecht calls this a \"loophole\" that makes it so non-citizens can vote, but what she's obviously overlooking is that no court in the country will think you just oopsied on not knowing your citizenship status. You can't just claim you made a mistake and expect that to be the end of the story. You have to actually convince a judge or jury of that, and good luck on it.",

The second largest employer in the US is Walmart (last time I saw the numbers). And they're starting pay is around $15 an hour average.. \n\nSo let's just assume overtime pay is time and a half. So 15+ 15/2 =22.5\n\nTheir tax rate is probably around 20% and this income bracket, If they have a kid It's probably even less significantly less because they get to write off $5,000 for the kid. If it's two kids it's even more. But let's just stick it 20% which would be the high amount.  So for every hour of overtime they would  pay $4.50 in taxes in over time\n\n\nSo they will make $225 and pay $40.5 subtracted (so 180 with tax) from that to pay tax. So trump policy only saves them 40.5. \n\nNow if they worked 8 hours instead they would make $180 and pay $36 in tax. \n\nSo yeah you are right that if the worker wants to make the same amount of money for working 8 with out tax for 10 hours with tax.  But they can also make an additional $45 working 10 hours with no tax, and if they're so desperate to do that with text then they're likely still be willing to do it without the tax",

So it is possible that we'll have states with senators from two different parties based on political changes in the 2-4 years since the last race (they have 6 year terms).\n\nThe House and Senate have \"equal\" power in terms that majorities in both are needed to pass legislation. However, the Senate is generally considered to have more power because they (and not the House) confirm Cabinet members, federal judges, and some other top positions. The House has a unique power in that spending bills must originate there. Then they have different duties in impeachment, with the House basically indicting and the Senate acting as the jury.\n\nFor the Electoral College, each state has a number of votes equal to their number of members in Congress, so a minimum of 1 member of the House and 2 in the Senate. DC also has 3 votes in the EC, though none in Congress (they have non-voting delegates). Also with the Electoral College, while technically it is the electors who vote for President, they follow the results of the state they're from. \"Faithless electors\" who do otherwise are very rare and there's a myriad of state laws against that.",

Here many of Trump's lies, fearmongering and outrageous arguments and opinions, are being rationalized by the readers.

May not flip anybody directly, but could it create some doubt, or cognitive dissonance, and lower enthusiasm perhaps?\n\nAfter all, the trump supporters seems to be \"trained\" to disregard all negative news as fake news, so arguing directly with a person is perhaps a better way to reach out to them.

He hated daily intelligence briefings to the point where his advisors had to shorten the meetings and use a lot of visual aids to keep his attention. He hated the demands on his time, having to attend memorials and services (it's notable that some of the most objectionable things he has said, like the \"losers and suckers\" bit, were when he was forced to do something he didn't want to do.) The White House website makes Presidential schedules public, and Trump's schedule usually didn't start until 10am, and ended by 4pm.

Please don't have TOO many ads in between segments , thank God Alex Jones show is basically unbearable due to vitamin ads every 90 seconds or I could've fallen deeper into the rabbit holes \ud83d\ude04",

If they go through the correct processes to enter the US, they can try to petition for asylum--if it's granted, they're considered refugees and their immigration is legal. During covid, the US closed the border and temporarily stopped processing asylum applications. This meant that a lot of these migrants--who were very far from their homes--just sat on the Mexico side of the border for months, under bad conditions, during a pandemic ... and eventually plenty of them decided to just attempt to cross into the US illegally rather than wait for the legal refugee process. That's why encounters with border patrol went up.\n\nThe border restrictions started to ease in late 2021, but even after that, there was obviously a backlog of people to process at the border. And once the borders opened again, then a lot of migrants who had been holding off on traveling to the border (because they knew they wouldn't be let through) made the journey, so there was a new surge of people coming. Since covid happened, there's just a very big backlog to work through--and the bigger the backlog, the more people give up on entering legally and just try to enter however they can.\n\n(Also, the chart cutting off in August is probably a little misleading--as you can see from previous years, fewer people attempt to travel in summer for weather reasons. This winter's numbers are likely to go up again, although probably not to pandemic-era levels.)",

They do save the ballots for the purposes of recounts and things like that, but you can't tell who the ballots belonged to.\n\nThat's why recounts get so contentious. When there's a ballot that wasn't filled out correctly, the workers have to guess at what your intentions were. If there was a way to trace that ballot back to the voter, they could just call you up and say, \"What were you trying to do here?\" But they can't do that.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about the process, a good way to learn more is to volunteer to be a poll worker on election day!

He's realigned voters into a coalition that shows up big for him when he's on the ballot, but doesn't when he's not--and even that majority isn't always enough to win, thus 2020. Democrats have overperformed in the midterms since 2016, in part because Trump has sent the most reliable voter demographics (suburbanites) screaming in their direction. DeSantis tried to run as a Trumplike candidate and it worked okay in state, but flopped on the national stage. Vance's reception has been similar. There's no indication that any of Trump's kids have the juice to fill his shoes, and his habit of shivving his allies means he's not really building any kind of bench to replace him. It's certainly not out of the question that some kind of savior for them shows up in the next four years--nobody predicted Trump in 2010 either. But right now it seems like once Trump finishes this term, conservatives have a tougher path forward.\n\nOf course, as other posters have mentioned, the fact that there's no clear path forward through the electoral system is a heavy incentive for the Republicans to not try to go through the electoral system going forward ...",

After that, you end up with a lot of chaos. In that case, the military probably would side against Trump and eventually force the transition, but there would be a lot of chaos and institutional breakdown in the mean time. It's hard to predict how that would play out--escalation to some kind of limited or full-blown civil war is possible, but so is something like Trump just setting up some kind of fake White House at Mar-a-Lago and complaining that he's the real president for the rest of his life, like he did the past few years.\n\nThe other possibility is that Trump gets most of the military on his side and uses them as enforcement.

I think it\u2019s something like a projected -10 electoral votes for dems and +14 electoral votes for republicans.

The allure of a conspiracy theory is that it presents an understandable narrative. Reality is messy, confusing, often contradictory and random. Conspiracy theories organize reality into concise structures, with causes and effects, beginnings and endings, good guys and bad guys. They also have the effect of making the follower feel they have a special level of insight, giving them the delusion of being important and knowledgeable.\n\n The attraction of conspiracy narratives, is an emotional appeal, not a logical one. So it follows that you're not going to dissuade anybody from believing them, by disputing the facts. It is doubtful you would even be able to get your Mother to agree on what sources of information are legitimate, and which are unreliable. Most conspiracy enthusiasts are watching Youtube, reading blogs and other highly subjective sources. \n\nIt follows that if the appeal of the conspiracy is emotional, that only emotional reasoning is going to disrupt that appeal. That is an uphill battle, because convincing somebody to reject the conspiracy requires you to convince them they have been a fool, which is something most people will go to absurd lengths to avoid. Your best bet in this situation is to try to understand what your Mother finds appealing in this belief system. What underlying fear (it is usually fear) does these beliefs address, or what underlying emotional attraction do they address. But to do that, you would have to sit down and listen to her talk about this stuff, which can be really hard to do. It is hard to listen to somebody you love talk a bunch of crazy, in a patient and accepting way. \n\nOn the bright side, most conspiracy theorists are cyclic. It is very likely there will come a time when her current belief system grows old and boring. When the zeitgeist moves on, the slow drip of new \"information\" dries up. At that point she is likely to lose interest in Dr.Fauci and the coronavirus, and move on to a new, more engaging idea. If you can recognize that inflection point, you have some chance of introducing a new and hopefully healthier enthusiasm. As with most behavioral habits, it's very hard to quit a behavior, but it is much easier to replace it with another. \n\nI'm genuinely sorry you have to deal with this. You shouldn't feel obligated to have to \"save\" your mother from this kind of thing, unless you feel it's actually doing her harm.",

But my understanding is that the Fauci position is essentially equivalent to saying they didn't fund making ice cream because the lab makes gelato, which up until 2 minutes ago was considered to be a form of ice cream.\n\nWhere she absolutely breaks with reality is the claim that Covid-19 was released to overthrow Trump.

She's previously taken the stance that the US should be supporting Russia in their campaign to help Assad murder his own people in Syria, she was quick to blame the US for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and she repeated Russian talking points about the US funding bioweapons labs in Ukraine (which was completely false). Russia appreciates the fact that she's willing to amplify their positions to a US audience via her public statements and social media, so they use their online influence to promote her and help her reach a wider audience.",

They genuinely do not think the things he did are a problem, they like the things he is saying/doing, and genuinely believe the Democrats are ruining the country. These are the red cap, hard-core MAGA voters.\n\n2. Always red voters. They don't care about what Trump did, or think it was overblown, and will always vote Republican. This is, I would guess, most of the Republican voting block. Trump isn't their guy, but they don't strongly dislike him either.\n\n3. \"I don't like Trump but Biden is worse\". They do think some of the things Trump did/said are distasteful, but typically not to the point of illegality. They are dissatisfied with the system and want change, so they vote for the guy who is bringing change, regardless of if it's good or bad. These were the swing voters. With the economic reactions to covid still hanging over our heads, people were feeling more stressed about the economy, so Trump saying he would do something radical and different (tariffs) is able to get their interest, even if it's a shit idea (also tariffs). I think a lot of these people also have seen evidence of Trump lying before, so they twist it in their heads to \"he probably won't actually introduce a bunch of tariffs, he'll do something else\". You can exchange tariffs for whatever policy you want; they're basically seeing whatever they want in him and dismissing the rest as silly ol' Trump. That's pure speculation on my part though, I've seen a lot of mental gymnastics around what Trump actually meant or what's okay for him to say.\n\nAll of this is based on my own observations and should not be taken as some big definitive assessment.",

Musk's people are similarly fired, arrested, and interrogated.  Musk, if he survives, is stripped of his citizenship and deported.  Trump then invokes the TikTok ban to shut down twitter, cancels all SpaceX contracts, and tariffs every component that goes into a Tesla.

It has no claim to First Amendment protection. Its\npurveyors are child predators and misogynistic exploiters of women. Their product\nis as addictive as any illicit drug and as psychologically destructive as any crime.\nPornography should be outlawed. The people who produce and distribute it should\nbe imprisoned. Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed\nas registered sex offenders. And telecommunications and technology firms that\nfacilitate its spread should be shuttered.\n\nSo it is true that Project 2025 wants to get rid of porn, and would prosecute teachers and librarians who distribute it.\n\nBut there's a lot misleading here. The biggest thing is her description of \"spicy books\" and \"romance novels.\" What does she mean by \"spicy\" and \"romance\"? Does she mean *porn*? Because if those are euphemisms for *porn*, then yeah, that's what Project 2025 is going after. But if you're reading Pride and Prejudice? No.\n\nI think by \"spicy\" what she means are books with graphic descriptions of sex designed to be used as masturbation material. Yeah, that's porn.\n\nBut she then says \"they *also* want to make it illegal to write or produce porn,\" so she seems to be trying to distinguish between \"spicy\" literate and pornographic literature.\n\nI'm not familiar with the books she mentions, so I'll move onto the Oklahoma law that's discussed. The definition of obscenity used there is literally just the current definition used by the Supreme Court. Here's the test from Miller v California, it'll sound familiar:\n\n>(1) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;\n\n>(2) whether the work depicts or describes, in an offensive way, sexual conduct or excretory functions, as specifically defined by applicable state law; and\n\n>(3) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value",

So, for a lot of voters the question is less about the specific individual in the White House and more about whether they want a President who will approve the Republican agenda or oppose it.\n\nThere's also an important social question at play. While the President doesn't have much formal power when it comes to social issues, a win by Harris will embolden the progressives to push harder on their agenda, while a win by Trump signals that the progressives are too radical and may push more independents and moderate Democrats to tone things down.\n\nA running theme in this race and the two prior is Trump saying to conservatives \"I'll fix your problems.\" Some folks believe it, but a lot just take it as the bog standard empty political promises that go nowhere. But on the other side, they hear from Democrats who say \"You're the problem that needs to be fixed.\" And while they don't really believe Trump means what he says, they believe the Democrats absolutely do mean it.\n\nIf given the choice between one side that's going to be mostly self-serving and not really care about you but will say nice stuff every once in a while and a side that calls you a basket of deplorable, garbage, racist, fascist Nazis, a lot of people are going to vote for the guy who isn't out there saying he hates you.\n\nPlus the 9 ton elephant in the room, the Supreme Court.

We also have a decent sized hispanic population and we all recently gotten a company wide email about not using the latinx term as it offends most of our hispanic patients. My girlfriend is also Latina and she explained that some Hispanics view the term as a white saying that goes against their language and culture.

In Spanish, gendered terms usually (not always) end in -o for masculine and -a for feminine, while the plural defaults to masculine (unless it\u2019s 100% women). For example, a group of men and a mixed group of men and women would both be referred to as \u201clatinos\u201d in Spanish.

Partly this is shaped by outside circumstances, but it's also down to how candidates choose to campaign. Obama 2012 fundamentally ran as a referendum on austerity & right-wing economics, and tied both to Romney's past at Bain gutting companies & outsourcing. People who were economically left but socially right were primed to think about the race through economics first, so gravitated towards Obama. In 2016 Hillary tried to make the race about character & fitness for office, so those same people weren't primed in the same way, and so gravitated towards Trump out of a preference for right-wing social/cultural positions like abortion & guns.",

In Manhattan County for instance, Trump won 12% of the vote. With that number, there'd be an 80% chance of at least 1 Trump voter being on the jury.

Oral arguments took place on 11/27/2018. With Gorsuch's recusal, there was a 4-4 deadlock on the case, and they announced they wouldn't be issuing a decision that term. They heard a separate case in 2020 (McGirt v. Oklahoma) that involved similar issues, and Gorsuch didn't recuse from that case. McGirt was decided 5-4 on 7/9/2020, and the court issued a per curiam decision for Sharp v. Murphy on the same day based on the reasoning in McGirt. 5/21/2018-7/9/2020, so about 25.5 months.",

I believe outreach into impoverished (generally POC communities) is worthwhile. I don't care if people smoke weed and think it's very much a \"state-run\" issue.\n\nWhere I've gotten uncomfortable with the Democratic side -- and you see the extremes happen both ways -- is that I may agree in principle on many of the social positions that Democrats hold, but they have made the mistake of taking it a step further. There's a lot of gaslighting going on of Republican voters, ie \"What? How could you *possibly* think this is problematic?\" I think a lot of issues within my own \"community\" (LGBT) are of messaging. I have lived and worked in some of the most conservative insitutions in the country: Military, Fire Department, \"boots on the ground\" handyman stuff, whatever, and to be honest, the worst treatment I got from people was in high school when kids are just dumb as fuck. The majority don't care if you are competent and a good person.\n\nEven though I want us to be a respectful, tolerant society, I think Republicans get wrongly mischaracterized as a whole based on the statements of a few fringe people. When it came to the transgender issue, for example, while most trans folks I have met are fairly reasonable, you can't raise any kind of concern or have any kind of discussion without getting shut down as a bigot. A little bit of education and discussion on both sides would go a long way.\n\nFrankly I've got a lot to say about how Democratic messaging, so all this to say: I get it. Most people, everyday people, are reasonable within the bounds of the information they are given. Unfortunately, I see political minorities being weaponized and of course that's going to frustrate and drive people away from the positions I see as otherwise reasonable.",

Clayton County that employers discriminating against employees/job applicants based on their gender identity or sexual orientation was a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This ruling is specific to sex discrimination in employment and didn't automatically carry over to other laws prohibiting sex discrimination in different contexts.\n\nSince Biden became president in 2021, some executive agencies responsible for enforcing various other sex discrimination laws have adapted their interpretations of sex discrimination to encompass discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation based on the reasoning used in the Bostock decision. Project 2025 explicitly calls for a reversal of these agency rule changes. They know they probably can't do anything about the Bostock decision in the short term, but they propose that it be applied as narrowly as possible and that it be pushed to the bottom of the priority list in terms of enforcement.\n\nTheir general position is laid out on page 584-585 of the Project 2025 document you linked, but you can find references to specific programs elsewhere in the document. The ones I saw were related to the Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Education prohibitions against discrimination by federally-funded health care providers and federally-funded schools respectively.\n\nFrom Page 584-585:\n\n> **Restrict the application of Bostock.** The new Administration should restrict Bostock\u2019s application of sex discrimination protections to sexual orientation and transgender status in the context of hiring and firing.\n\n> **Withdraw unlawful \u201cnotices\u201d and \u201cguidances.\u201d** The President should direct agencies to withdraw unlawful \u201cnotices\u201d and \u201cguidances\u201d purporting to apply Bostock\u2019s reasoning broadly outside hiring and firing.\n\n> **Rescind regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, and sex characteristics.** The President should direct agencies to rescind regulations interpreting sex discrimination provisions as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, transgender status, sex characteristics, etc.\n\n> **Direct agencies to refocus enforcement of sex discrimination laws.** The President should direct agencies to focus their enforcement of sex discrimination laws on the biological binary meaning of \u201csex.\u201d\n\nPrior to Bostock, the Obama administration attached nondiscrimination conditions to federal funding for adoption agencies, preventing faith-based adoption agencies that accept federal funding from rejecting same-sex couples just because their marriage conflicts with the religious beliefs of the agency. Project 2025 calls for a reversal of this policy.",

I redoucbled saying \"No, really, I want to know.\" But they just ignored me and proceeded their discussion. I overheard a few minutes later how Trump will put an end to this nonesense once he wins.\n\nI am flabbergasted. I am incredibly sympathetic to the Palestinians for a long time, but it has been US policy (maybe blindly) to support Israel. I am unaware of policy changes on this subject regardless of president, including Trump in 2017-2021. Yet this is a Joe Biden issue??? Not congress or the house who have not done anything either?? And Trump is going to fix it??\n\nWar and armed conflict are horrible expressions of mankind. But what makes the Gaza area any different than the Syrian Civil War or the Yemen Crisis where the documented civilian casualties are much higher?? In these situations, there is no competition for which atrocity is the most repulsive.\n\nPlease help me understand.",

That is, not taking a hard stance against Israel for how aggressively they're retaliating. However, to believe that Trump would go against Israel seems poorly informed, so I find that a surprising take.\n\n\n>Not congress or the house who have not done anything either?\n\n\nSomeone made an interesting comment that's stuck with me: many policies that are implemented (or not) are almost solely at the discretion of congress, yet the president is the one who gets blamed or applauded. I'm not making a judgement on the right approach but I know in the past things I'd liked I'd say were the result of the administration where as things I didn't were because of congress. So I'm trying to be more conscious of that.\n\n\n>But what makes the Gaza area any different than the Syrian Civil War or the Yemen Crisis\n\n\nThere was a bit by Eddie Izzard this reminds me of: the public isn't as concerned when a country is killing its own people. Think of the loss of life in Soviet Russia or China's Great Leap Forward. There's a different feeling when a people is fighting amongst itself or suffering from its own policies vs one people attacking another.",

So much so that both the then PM of Israel and then US President Reagan had to tell him there weren't going to be that extreme and to chill out.\n\nHe's never wavered in his extreme support for Israel until just recently and it's clear that is only because it might be hurting his re-election chances.\n\nSo if you're someone who thinks the USA should not be supporting Israel, Biden is worse than the typical US president in recent decades.\n\nIf you're trying to argue that Trump will not be any better, then yes, but some people don't buy into supporting the lesser of two evils and feel like the only way to get the Democrats (because the GOP is a lost cause) to listen to them is to make them lose elections.\n\nAnd frankly there is a lot of truth in that strategy; The only way to get politicians to do what you want is to either be wealthy enough to bribe them or to make them fear for their jobs.\n\nThat's how \"MAGA\" ( in quotes because I'm using it as a catchall for the various anti-establishment voters in the GOP coalition) took over the Republican Party; After Obama got elected they realized they had been getting played by the GOP establishment so they started taking out establishment pols in the primaries even if it meant that they would be weaker candidates in the general election and lose to the Dems. After they did that several times the GOP establishment got scared and fell in line with MAGA.\n\nSo if the people who support Palestine vote for Biden all it will show him is that they can be safely ignored because when push comes to shove they will fall in line.",

I\u2019d like to know what it does legally for the sitting president.  If immunity for sitting presidents is absolute then doesn\u2019t that mean Biden (as a sitting president) legally ,and with lethal force, stop Trump from becoming president?",

More people than the two were on the call; we don't know who exactly, but at some point one of Biden's advisors was asked to join. It wouldn't be uncommon for either person to have staff members listening to the call.\n\nCNN's source is \"according to four sources briefed on the call.\"\n\nKeyword here is \"briefed.\" They did not listen to the call themselves, but were told about it.\n\nAnd a very important thing that we're not told is if these four sources received the same briefing. For instance, did a Pelosi aid tell four other staffers in one meeting, or did a Pelosi aid tell one staffer, and a Biden aid told another staffer, and someone else told someone, and these are four independent reports?\n\nIt's important to pay attention to the specific wording used in the articles because they're usually factually correct, but aren't always honest depictions of the sourcing.\n\nA good example is back in the 2016 primaries. It was widely reported that Sanders said to Warren that a woman couldn't be President. I can't recall the outlets specifically but probably was CNN (because that's the site I read). The stories said that was told to them by four people (iirc) \"familiar with the conversation.\" Digging a bit deeper though, it was clear it was a private conversation with only Sanders and Warren in the room. It's likely that she told some of her staffers, who then told the press. So in truth it wasn't four different people saying that's what Sanders said, but rather one person --Warren-- who made that claim, which was then repeated by four different people who did not hear the conversation themselves. They spun it to sound like Sanders was saying a woman couldn't do the job, but most likely he said there's too much sexism for a woman to win the vote, totally different things. Warren then mischaracterized the conversation to her staff, which went to the press, and suddenly the press has four seemingly credible sources (they're familiar with the conversation!) confirming that Sanders is a sexist who thinks a woman can't do the job.\n\nDoesn't answer your question about these specific reports about Pelosi and Obama, but this is the typical way sourcing on these types of things works. Someone with first hand knowledge tells someone else, and then that person goes to the press, and the press reports it without making it clear that the story is hearsay. Very often the hearsay is true, but not always.\n\nWhen it's not true though, we can expect the subject of the story to deny the claim. When there is no denial and the story is major news, usually safe to assume it is accurate. I don't think Biden, Obama, or Pelosi have denied these claims and they'd each have good reason to if it was false.",

A source close to Schumer could report what Schumer told him he was going to say, or afterwards what he did say.

The RNC focused on trying to expand the base, which we saw with speakers like the Teamsters president and Amber Rose.\n\nThat said, the PBS commentators pointed out that having Biden, Clinton, the Obamas, and Pelosi all speaking could end up backfiring because it runs counter to the idea that Harris is someone younger bringing a new vision to the party. Their appearances in the prime slots gives an impression that Harris will just be more of the policies of a decade ago.\n\nWhat you really should be asking though is why Romney and W. didn't speak at the *D*NC. They're center-right Republicans with zero love for Trump.\n\nHarris wanted Republican speakers to show their appeal across the aisle. But all they got was someone who was press secretary for less than a year, a campaign staffer for McCain, and the mayor of Arizona's third largest city.\n\nIf Harris actually does have appeal to moderate Republicans, why could they not get anyone higher profile?",

I'm sure MAGA would bitch about it, but fuck em.\n\n\n>But, also no other U.S. entities have their own independent teams.\n\nUS Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam all have their own Olympic teams.",

                    "body": "When Trump was running against Joe Biden, he was completely in his element: Biden was easy to attack, both as a sitting president who could easily be blamed for the nation's issues, his incoherence and his age were easy targets, and Biden just generally wasn't articulate enough to defend himself against Trump's force of will.\n\n\nIn that context, Trump had nothing to gain by picking a running mate who'd grab the spotlight\u2014 the more attention on the Biden Administration struggling with the issues, the better. He also didn't need to pick another Pence to stop Conservatives from defecting, since Trump's attacks and embracing of partisanship had already solidified his base. Really, all Trump needed was a second Trump, who would reaffirm the MAGA agenda without causing too much of a stir.\n\n\nI thought at the time that the knockout choice would have been Nikki Haley, who could have protected Trump from his biggest Achilles' Heel at the time (Trump's approval of overturning Roe v. Wade) by giving him a redemtion of sorts with female voters, while also letting him appeal to the kind of Compassionate-Conservative groups that voted for Romney and McCain who wouldn't turn out unless Trump broadened his appeal. Knowing what I know now has only reinforced my beliefs, but I also recognize that Trump didn't want to compromise his agenda if he was obviously going to win\u2014 and there were only a few things he needed.\n\n\nHere comes the real answer to your question. Firstly, Vance is from a Midwestern state. That's a big plus in most elections, but for Trump\u2014 whose populist rhetoric risks traditional conservative states like North Carolina and Georgia in exchange for chances of winning big Midwest states like Michigan and Pennsylvania\u2014 winning in that region is effectively necessary for the success of his campaign. Speaking of rhetoric, Vance is also the ultimate populist\u2014 even saying his favorite Democrats are the \"Bernie Bros,\" an unheard-of take by a Republican in a national election. His selection removes any and all doubt that Trump has compromised his views after his loss, and helped to further the wedge between populist and establishment Democrats that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign against him in 2016 and seemed like it would keep key Democrat groups home in a race between Trump and Biden.\n\n\nAnd finally, though Vance was a former opponent of Trump, he has since become one of his most avid supporters, and agrees with him on almost every issue. While Vances differences with Trump on abortion and problematic rhetoric about family values have made that Achilles' Heel an even bigger target, back when the Republican line was about fixing the Biden economy and getting out of Ukraine, Vance would have had no issue to deviate from Trump on. He seemed exactly like what Trump needed: a running mate that was politically alike and noncontroversial.\n\n\nAs an added bonus, I'll compare him with Walz. They're both Midwestern folk, but while Walz is an ex-coach and has that compassionate, neighborly rhetoric that the Harris campaign has emphasized, Vance was educated at Yale Law School and is of the Republican-intellectual class you don't hear too much about lately. If you read how his interview with the New York Times went back in August, you'll find his reasoning to be much more logical and reasoned\u2014 not necessarily factual, but definitely much more organized and rational than Trump's speeches, which tend to be more casual and freeform, more about Trump than Trump's policies. Most importantly, this reinforced the idea that Vance's airtight logic would prevent any gaffes, and had the election topics stayed on the logical-reasoning economy argument rather than the more sympathy-driven abortion debate I have no doubt that Vance would have succeeded in this goal.\n\n\nIn summary, Vance's midwestern roots and populist stances help him appeal to the key voter blocks Trump needs, and his similarity to Trump on most issues made him a nonvolatile, low-risk partner on the campaign trail.",

I haven't seen Vance at a rally, so I've got no idea how effective her is here (but I'm sure the comments will assure you that he's an absolute shitshow, regardless of how he actually plays to a crowd).\n\n(3) Ability to take over for the President. This tends to get downplayed because no candidate wants to run on \"I might die in a couple years.\" But, with certain candidates like Trump, Biden, and McCain, this is on voters' minds. Vance's experience is a detriment here, but I think voters believe he'd largely continue with Trump's agenda (as opposed to picking someone like Haley).\n\nAnd then here's the one that no one actually talks about\n\n(4) Administration agent. VP picks are not just about the campaign, but also having someone who will be effective in helping implement the President's agenda. Pretty similar considerations to 3. Bush picked Cheney as a political operation and Obama picked Biden in large part because of his experience and connections in Congress. Vance doesn't have much experience, but Trump views him as someone who would be a loyal surrogate.",

So looked at [this most recent clip](https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-we-tipping-point-our-country) from Sean Hannity and counted 9 instances of Kamala Harris, 4 Kamala, and 5 Harris.\n\nI also looked at [AOC's comments at the DNC](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-speaks-at-2024-dnc).

Republicans were forced to use the reconciliation process to bypass the filibuster since Democrats wouldn't support the tax cuts. Reconciliation bills have a lot of rules for what's allowed to be in them, and one of those rules is that a reconciliation bill can't have anything in it that increases the deficit after 10 years. They had to set an expiration date on a lot of the tax cuts in order to comply with this rule. If they manage to get a trifecta again, then I'm guessing they would extend it.\n\n>  Taxes for everyone except corporations and billionaires are increasing yearly from 2021 to 2027 per instructions\n\nNothing in the tax bill expires until the end of 2025, so nobody will see a tax increase until 2026.\n\n> The Trump tax bill drastically reduced the amount of state tax a middle-class family could write off in their federal tax.\n\nThis probably doesn't affect most middle class families, so not a huge concern. You need some combination of a lot of income, a lot of valuable property, and a high state tax rate to hit the limit.\n\n> Tariffs are a sales tax and economics predict Trump's tariffs (which he can do without Congress) will add on average ~$4000 in costs to the average family\n\nTrue.\n\n> no tax on tips, ok now CEOS are paid in tips;\n\nThis would never work.\n\n> Trump's tax will drastically increased deficit spending.\n\nYes, but they blame the bloated federal government for the spending problem, and the Republicans are running on gutting it. History says they won't actually do it, but Republican voters still believe they might some day.\n\n> All of these things, he would have to get through Congress as would Harris have to get her policies (except tariffs)\n\nMany of Trump's policies can be passed via reconciliation if they manage a trifecta. A lot of Harris's policies can't be passed via reconciliation, so they would either need to secure 60 votes in the Senate or get enough support to eliminate the filibuster entirely, both of which are more difficult.",

IE: he will become a dictator.

I've heard all the common talking points; \"We survived his first term\" (before he had eight years to build up a following of fanatic loyalists); \"Every candidate says this every election\" (he is the first to deny the results of a fair election and inspire insurrection); \"He's too old/incompetent\" (he can pack the White House with die-hard yes-man who will let him get away with anything).\n\nI want to have faith that local governments -especially since even republican politicians are turning on him- will be able to keep him on a leash, but I just don't know...\n\nWhat I really want from this thread is a *measured* response from people who know more about the inner workings of our government.

                    "body": "First things first, if you're experiencing daily anxiety about this, you should probably look into cognitive behavioral therapy. Since you said you're tired of apocalyptic doom scrolling, you'd probably do well with CBT, because it's main aim is at getting you to recognize the anxiety-inducing BS your brain likes to tell itself. Also helps to insulate you from the anxiety-inducing BS other people's brains want to tell your brain.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's start breaking things down. And what I'd suggest is looking more into things Trump has actually said (not through the filter of left-wing media/social media, but straight from the horse's mouth), and also then thinking about what the government can actually do. That means in terms of executive orders, and then legislation given a very tight Senate and like either a Democratic House or a very narrow Republican majority.\n\n>IE: he will become a dictator\n\nI assume this concern comes from the \"Dictator on day one\" comment. But go look at the comment. He wasn't saying \"Starting on day one I'll be a dictator for the next four years.\" He said *just on day one.* And even then, he was talking only about executive action regarding drilling leases and border security. That's it, he was using colorful language to describe the types of executive action every single presidential candidate talks about doing on their first day of office. The Constitution is set up so that it's basically impossible to actually be a dictator, and Trump did even express an intent to try. So, let's scratch that off the list of things to be anxious about.\n\n>particularly with implementing the controversial Project 25\n\nSo let's start by reminding ourselves that Project 2025 isn't Trump's agenda. He's said that parts of it are completely ridiculous and his criticism about it led to the director of Project 2025 resigning. Trump's daughter-in-law Lara has also been very critical of it. And she's not a nobody; she's the chair of the RNC.\n\nSo, there's very good reason to think the stuff in Project 2025 you find most troubling are also opposed by Trump. And even if he did support them, most of it requires getting through Congress which isn't really plausible.\n\n>prosecuting political rivals\n\nRecall that for all his talk about locking up Hillary Clinton, he made zero effort to do so. If you're thinking about his comments directed at election officials, go back to the actual words. He said he would go after any election officials who *cheated.* Do you think that prosecuting people actually involved in election fraud is outlandish or dangerous? Do you have similar thoughts about the case against Trump in Georgia? If Harris said her administration would prosecute anyone who illegally tried to suppress or intimidate voters, would you think that's a problem, or would you think that those are serious crimes that should be prosecuted?\n\n>removing the board of education\n\nI think you mean *Department* of Education. And doing that would have to go through Congress. Even with a Republican majority in the House and Senate, there wouldn't be votes for that. Any proposal that comes close to shutting it down would have to keep in place all the funding to states to stand a chance of getting passed, but the state funding is basically the whole enchilada. It'd be like shutting down the Post Office, but keeping the mail delivery.\n\n>censoring the media\n\nRecall that in his first term he routinely threatened the media, especially the New York Times, then made zero effort to do anything about it. That's because he has no power to do anything about it. Congress has no power to do anything about it. SCOTUS is extremely pro-free speech. And his threats this time around are basically just that they'll get more scrutiny. Worst case scenario, there's Congressional hearings where some executives get browbeat for a few hours and nothing happens after.\n\n>mass deportation\n\nThis would of course be limited to people actually eligible to be deported (meaning illegal immigrants) and then further limited by the government's manpower. In 2016, Trump threatened mass deportation, but actually ended up deporting fewer people than Obama. Obama, criticized by the left as \"Deporter-in-Chief\" actually deported fewer than W. Bush, and W. Bush in turn deported fewer people than Clinton. Doesn't seem like much to be concerned about here. Probably more focus on stopping illegal immigrants from getting through in the first place, but mass deportations will probably be no worse than under Obama. How worried were you about it then?\n\n>stripping LGBT rights\n\nHe has very little power here. The most important rights (gay marriage, anti-discrimination) are already enshrined in law. We got Obergefell then the Respect for Marriage Act, and Bostock. That's not going anywhere. What you might see at the margins is some stuff around trans women in sports and certain books getting removed from school libraries (but remaining otherwise easily available through the same channels most people get their books).\n\n>having more power of the DoJ\n\nThere's not a ton Trump can really do here, even with some big shakeups, most of the DoJ's business will continue as usual. There could be some change in focus, but any effort to send the DoJ after his political opponents will probably be about as effective as Garland going after Trump. And remember that he talked about going after political opponents before and that just didn't happen. Hillary Clinton remains blissfully unindicted.\n\n>using the military on protestors/civilians\n\nThis is largely constrained by state governors and the Posse Comitatus Act. Using the military on protesters would end up looking a lot like when Walz brought in troops to help with BLM riots. I doubt you're too concerned about Walz's chance of being in the White House.",

Campaigning in California is largely a waste of money outside of things like high-dollar fundraisers that bring in more money than they cost. Tailoring campaign platforms to focus on things Californians care most about doesn't really make sense. The Republican candidate is never going to win over enough voters to flip California, and winning over more voters in California doesn't get the Democratic candidate any additional votes in the electoral college, so why bother? This same thing mostly applies to all entrenched states.\n\nWhen you add up the electors in all of the entrenched states, it's not enough to get either candidate past the 270 mark they need to win. They both need those last few votes from the swing states to get over the line, and since those are the states that have a chance to \"swing\" towards either candidate, those are the ones where it's most important for candidate to try to win over voters. Winning over just a small amount of voters in those states specifically is what ultimately decides who wins or loses the presidency. That's why candidates spend a ton of resources campaigning there and are extremely incentivized to focus their campaign issues on what voters in those states care about.",

So for example, California is a democratic state, and if I voted for a Republican president, it would not count as the senators will vote democratic, and this is the electoral college, and this vote counts rather than the popular vote.\n\nIt all depends on what you mean by a vote \"counting.\"\n\nOften people will say a vote doesn't count if it's in a state where the outcome is a foregone conclusion, such as California or New York. There's a roughly 100% chance those states will go for Harris. Voting for Trump in California has no chance of helping Trump win the state, so folks will say it \"doesn't count.\" Though at the same time, a vote for *Harris* in California also has no chance of changing the outcome, so by the same logic that vote wouldn't count either.\n\nIn pragmatic terms about affecting the outcome of the election, this makes sense, and so all the focus goes on the swing states which will \"decide\" the outcome of the election.\n\nHowever, it's a rather simplistic (and I think a bit jaded) view. Without California, Harris has no chance of winning the election. So in that sense, California still matters a whole lot. It's just not as dramatic because we already know which way it's going to go.\n\nI like to analogize this to a football game. Imagine it's the 4th quarter with 2 minutes left, the Tigers are on offense and trail the Hares 20-21. The Tigers just need to get into field goal range, get a successful field goal, and go up 23-21 as time expires to win the game. As they get set to make the kick, you'll like hear the announcers say something like \"it all comes down to this one play!\"\n\nBut does that mean the other scoring drives \"don't count\"? Of course not. Without the 20 points scored earlier in the game, that final field goal could not possibly make a difference. If the Tigers ended the game 3-21, they lose.\n\nAll the safe states matter, they're just not where the drama and uncertainty is.\n\n>It sounds rather unfair, and so wondering why not switch to the popular vote?\n\nBecause it'd take a constitutional amendment and there's no chance of getting 3/4 of the states to agree.",

Because of issues around bias (intentional or accidental), a lot of polling reporting uses an aggregate model, where they add the data from all the polls together, and then use median averages as their best information. \n\nMuch as we saw in late 2020, we're seeing a whole bunch of right-wing or Republican funded polls suddenly showing up. We see a lot fewer polls produced by Democratic aligned groups. This sudden influx creates the appearance of a surge in support for Donald Trump. Is it possible that surge is actually happening? Maybe. But as you have pointed out, there hasn't been a major event for either campaign before these sudden swings in numbers started appearing. You be the judge.",

A small local college isn't going to have enough of a student body for there to be a varied political environment on campus. At a University you will have Democratic and Republican Party groups, as well as some 3rd party representation and groups focused on individual issues and demographics (black political groups, Latino, etc.). This kind of environment would give you a chance to explore the field and decide whether you have a real affinity for politics. \n\nIf you look at elected officials at the national level, you will notice a great many of them have Law degrees and attended Ivy League Universities. This has less to do with the education they got at those schools, then it does the people they were able to network with. If your freshman dorm roommates uncle is a sitting US Senator, you may have an opportunity to meet and network with people working in government. It can be a leg up, but it's obviously not the only way to get into politics. \n\nPolitical Science isn't the only way to go. A lot of degrees can be useful in the political field. I always laugh when Republicans insist that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is \"stupid\", or mock her having worked as a bartender. She has dual degrees in Economics and International Relations from Boston College. She's better qualified for Congress than most of the people there. I'm sure you can see how those degrees might give her some insight into policy. When you look at it that way, it's not hard to see what other subjects might be useful to study; Psychology, Statistical Analysis, Business, even something seemingly unrelated, like Computer Sciences, could impart a proficiency that many politicians and their staff lack. It would obviously be useful to learn a second language, too. \n\nI wish you luck and admire your willingness to get involved at such a young age.",

                    "body": "Following the convention, Harris had a significant lead over Trump, topping out around 3.5% according to the 538 polling average. By the time of her Fox News interview, it had dropped to 2.4%, and then down to about 1.5% following the interview, finally falling to 1.2% going into the election.\n\nIt would seem that the more people got to know Harris, the less they liked her. And this runs contrary to the \"it was sexism\" narrative, where we would have expected to see a strong initial dislike of her which waned as people got to know her more.\n\nI think one of the biggest problems for Harris is how she answered questions. And I'll highlight a few examples:\n\nFracking: She was asked on multiple occasions what her stance is. In 2019 she was fully in favor of banning in. But during her campaign she said she made her position clear in 2020 (referring to the VP debate). The problem is in the VP debate she said *Biden* opposed banning fracking, and the fact checkers called her out on that. Add in the \"my values haven't changed\" line, and folks end up thinking she still wants to ban it but refuses to say so.\n\nInflation and Anti-Gouging: One of her key policies she discussed for bringing down high prices of groceries and the like was a federal law against price gouging. Problem is price gouging laws only go into effect in declared emergencies, so they're irrelevant to the issue. Also, most of the country (including 5 of the 7 swing states) already has anti-gouging laws, so this wouldn't change anything for them, and folks are familiar with the fact that they're only about emergencies, not the present economy.\n\nDifferences From Biden: When asked what she would have done differently, she said she couldn't think of anything. Didn't even answer with bills she would have liked to have passed but couldn't with a Republican House.\n\nBiden's Decline: Brett Baier asked her when she noticed Biden was having more pronounced problems and her answer was that Biden isn't running and Trump is bad. But the question is about her credibility and whether she has helped to hide Biden's problems from the public.\n\nThe overall impression I think a lot of voters got is that she's a typical slimy politician, but without the policy intellect of someone like Hillary, Obama, Sanders, Pelosi, etc. Not exactly someone who is going to inspire people.\n\nMoving on:\n\n>Why Hispanics voted Trump in masses?\n\nProbably two things. The first is social conservatism, especially among Catholics. The second is the border. An important dynamic here is that most Hispanic American voters are of Mexican origin. But, Mexicans are no longer the majority of illegal immigrants. I'd wager that's made tough-on-the-border policies a lot more appealing to Mexican Americans.\n\nNationally, the high school drop out rate is 8.8%. For Hispanic Americans, it's 24.8%. For (only) a bachelor's degree it's 23.4% nationally, and 14.5% for Hispanic Americans. So guess who is hardest hit when it comes to competing with immigrants (legal and illegal) for jobs.\n\n>What's your thoughts on people having to pretend to be Kamala Harris supporters for social acceptance, but voting Trump in secret?\n\nMinnesota, Wisconsin, Nevada and (likely) Arizona all elected Democratic senators while also voting for Trump, so there was a lot of ticket splitting going on.\n\nI don't think there was a lot of pretending to support Harris going on, and probably more just keeping quiet on the issue. But also my social circle is fairly open about who they support, including Trump supporters, so I don't have a great sense on this particular question.",

He is replacing people loyal to our Constitution and the nation with those loyal to himself.  He breaks the law with impunity and has used a \"divide and conquer\" approach to gaining power.  Trump often praises dictators and threatens to use the power of the state to punish his political opposition.   He lies constantly, inverting reality to serve his own purposes, as do the right wing media outlets that support him.  \n\nTrump wants to be the mob boss of a mafia state, a kleptocracy run by a rich oligarchy, like in Russia.  He doesn't want any watch dogs or constraints that would look out for the interests of the citizenry instead of his own.  BTW, many of his efforts to dismantle the federal government will harm the average citizen, but of course you won't hear him or his cronies talk about that.",

He has or will replace other agency heads, like the IRS and DOJ, with those who will do his bidding, so he can weaponize those agencies against his political opponents.  This is absolutely Autocracy 101.\n\nTrump's Supreme Court picks are extreme and ideological to the point where they have undermined public confidence in the court.  They disregard past precedent and make up justifications for their rulings.  For instance, stating that the president has legal immunity if the crimes he commits were done during his official duties.  Some of the worst things he wanted to do in his first term were constrained by Republicans who were still loyal to our Constitution, but they have been taken out of power.  The old Republican party is dead, it is now a far-right party led by a wanna be dictator.\n\nThose voters who think they want to live in an authoritarian regime will be disappointed, because there is no public accountability.  Such regimes are notoriously corrupt and they serve those in power at the expense of the well being of the average citizens.  Lies, propaganda, and terror are all used against the people to keep them in check.  \n\nListen to the podcasts of scholars who are expert in this area, such as Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Anne Applebaum, and Timothy Snyder to name a few.

The more likely explanation is that more liberal Gen Zers stayed home, especially in non-swing states. CNN exit polls, for example, had 18-29-year-olds making up [17% of the electorate in 2020](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/exit-polls/president/national-results), but only [14% in 2024](https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/exit-polls/national-results/general/president/0).

There aren't an equal number of men and women running. Do you know how many women have run in the Democratic primaries?\n\nYou can count them on your fingers: Shirley Chisholm, Carol Moseley Braun, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, and Tulsi Gabbard (not counting fringe candidates who withdraw before the primaries).\n\nThe American public has shown many times that it's willing to elect women into positions of power. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Biden was elected with Harris as his heir apparent. Harris lost the popular vote by only 1.6%. Nancy Pelosi was Speaker of the House for 8 years. There's 12 states with female governors currently (and incidentally, only 4 of them were won by Harris).\n\nIf you want to know why there aren't more women in office, the question to ask is why more women aren't running. And the answer isn't that they can't win.",

Libertarian votes are often protest votes against the Democrat and Republican, rather than actual support for the Libertarian party. Kennedy was a viable protest vote option for people on the conservative side as many Libertarians are.\n\nSecond, they may have just stayed home rather than voting. That wouldn't help Trump win.

It's different in each state, so you would have to do some research. For example, in my state (Indiana) you have to file a pretty basic declaration of candidacy form and also submit a petition containing at least 500 signatures from registered voters living in each of Indiana's 9 congressional districts, so at least 4,500 signatures. Get all of that filed before the deadline and you're on the primary ballot. Win enough votes in the state primary, and you get delegates sent to the national convention to vote for you to be the nominee.\n\nThis is a good starting point for ballot access requirements in each state: https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_access_for_presidential_candidates",

He's only said he hasn't ruled it out. There's a meaningful difference between the two things, and if it seems just like splitting hairs, it's actually a very important difference when it comes to Trump.\n\nWhen it comes to negotiations, Trump routinely will not publicly rule things out. If Trump was asked if he's ruled out developing a gundam program to lay siege to Amsterdam to force them to cede Greenland to the US, he'd also say he hasn't ruled that out -- but we shouldn't take that answer to mean he has plans to do it. If he was asked if he's ruled out crashing the moon into Amsterdam to force a surrender, he'd say he hasn't ruled that out either.\n\nHe's actually talked about this negotiation strategy, and just as a matter of course he doesn't answer those types of questions about negotiations.\n\nAlso, the War Powers Act would limit any troop deployment to 60 days, and Congress would never authorize a war with Denmark to annex Greenland, so the whole thing is a non-starter.",

Does she think Biden \"drinks on the job?\" President is a 24/7 job, but that's an asinine way to characterize it. A far better line of questioning would be about what support he is getting for not drinking, such as attending AA meetings.\n\nLast thing, there's a meme going around saying Hegseth refused to consent to an FBI background check. The FBI has already done a background check in fact, and the committee leadership has it (they're not shared with the entire committee) and the check was even referenced in the hearing. Anyone spreading that rumor is lying to you. What he was asked was whether he'd consent to an *expanded* background check and his answer was that he doesn't decide what the FBI does, which is true, his consent isn't needed for the FBI to talk to more people. That decision would be made by Christopher Wray and the Biden administration.",

What I can't understand is why they are turning a blind eye to the fact that:\n\nOne, Trump was originally in favor of the Tiktok ban.\n\nTwo, many Republicans in Congress voted in favor of the ban and 2026 is a midterm election, not a presidential election.\n\nThree, the Supreme Court unanimously upheld the ban despite the court having a 6-3 conservative majority with Trump, himself, appointing three of the justices during his first term.\n\nAnd four, if Trump's tariffs cause prices to get more expensive, this will likely outweigh the fact that Trump saved Tiktok.

Educators and public librarians who purvey it should be classed as *registered sex offenders*.\u201d\n\nOn page 554 it states the following. Emphasis mine.\n\n> \u201cEnforce the *death penalty* where appropriate and applicable.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt should also pursue the death penalty for *applicable crimes*\u2014particularly heinous crimes involving violence and *sexual abuse of children*\u2014until Congress says otherwise\n> through legislation.\u201d\n\nBack to my own words and research.\n\nWhile the word \u201cpedophilia\u201d may not be explicitly used, the intention is clear. The US has a [long](https://time.com/7015646/project-2025-lgbtq-history/) history of criminalizing LGBTQ+ folks, with very harsh punishments in some cases. Much of the \u201cgrooming\u201d rhetoric towards trans women today is line for line what was used against gay men in the 80s and 90s. And with your example of the courts, that doesn\u2019t offer much comfort when Lawrence v. Texas criminalized sodomy, but was largely used to target gay people, and was only overturned in 2003. Either way, much like racism didn\u2019t go away after Brown v. Board of Education, queerphobia didn\u2019t go away after Obergefell. And it\u2019s come back with a vengeance. \n\nAnd just because Trump has said he supports gay marriage and has gay people in office doesn\u2019t mean he is friendly to the LGBTQ+ community. He frequently lies and has demonstrated he will align with whoever will enable his power, and say whatever he has to in order to rile up his base. He has promised to end the \u201c[transgender lunacy](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20241223-trump-vows-to-stop-transgender-lunacy-as-a-top-priority)\u201d, and has already signed EOs attempting to [federally mandate a gender binary](https://apnews.com/article/trump-transgender-passports-prisons-eggs-sperm-da1d1d280658a8c85c57cfec2f30cefb#). If challenged, they may go to a kangaroo SCOTUS who has already hinted at believing some laws, such as Obergefell, were wrongly decided. He has also cut [anti-discrimination protections](https://www.google.com/search?q=trump.lgbtq+rights&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS868US868&oq=trump.lgbtq+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggBEAAYxwMYgAQyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABjHAxiABDIKCAIQABjHAxiABDIJCAMQABgeGMcDMgkIBBAAGB4YxwMyCQgFEAAYHhjHAzILCAYQABgKGB4YxwPSAQg1Mzg2ajBqNKgCArACAeIDBBgBIF8&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8).

What are the guardrails, and how far could this go?",

Prior to Obama's tenure, we didn't count those people in the formal \"deportation\" tally. It was not because he was more likely to deport people who were already settled and working in the country--the number of deportations of those people went *down* during his administration, relative to Bush.

(There is no good comparison for how that's going to go, because mass-deporting undocumented agricultural workers has previously been a third rail in American politics, and it hasn't happened in recent history.)",

The US gained more than 2 million illegal immigrants over the same time period, so any undocumented laborer who was deported was replaced with another one relatively quickly. That was in part because Obama's immigration policies were fairly lax compared to GWB's, which encouraged people to come here, and also in part because the fallout of the 2008 recession was rough on Mexico, and the unemployed there went abroad in search of work. That was a major focus of Trump's 2016 campaign messaging--that he would crack down on Obama's lax immigration policies, and that by doing so, illegal immigrants would be dissuaded from coming.\n\nSo if your argument is that Trump can replicate what Obama did without consumers feeling it at all--then the way that Obama did it was by illegal immigration remaining at high enough levels to offset his deportations. Which is very much what Trump doesn't want, and has argued he'll fight against. There isn't a way to have negative net illegal immigration *and* no effect on agricultural prices. You have to pick one or the other.",

The control is for obvious reasons. The chaos is to overburden the institutions meant to place checks on power. This way, the press and the courts have so much to contend with, they can't tell the difference between real efforts and feints meant to waste their time and resouces.

If you're spending time in spaces that are left-leaning, then you're going to see more things calling out the dumb ideas of the right, but not so much pointing out the crazy beliefs of the left. At the extreme end, you can end up in spaces where the left's conspiracy theories are actually taken as the accepted wisdom.\n\n(2) How we label something as a \"conspiracy theory.\" The left has a lot of nutty views that do get criticism, but aren't often thought of as conspiracy theories, while we're pretty quick to label things from the right that way, even when they don't meet the normal definition of a conspiracy theory.\n\n(3) Similar to (2), we're quicker to label someone as being on the right than on the left, even when the evidence is mixed. If someone thinks the moon landing was faked, holds right wing views on LBGT issues, and holds left wing views on social welfare, they'll probably get labeled as a right wing conspiracy theorist.",

When public figures mock Trump for any of his very obvious ridiculous qualities (the incessant dishonesty, the makeup, the elaborate comb over, etc.), many of them react as though their religious beliefs are being mocked.

That's baked into his polling numbers already. The (over)reaction to the debate on Thursday seemed predicated on people thinking there are a substantial number of voters out there that didn't realize Biden was old until the debate, and that's just not true. Almost everybody knows he's old, and most of them have already decided that either they won't vote for him because of that or will anyway. The debate isn't going to move the numbers much on that, because there are just not that many voters left to move.\n\nTo answer the OP's question, of course people who are going to vote for Biden are finding ways to psychologically justify it to themselves. And Biden's campaign and the Democratic Party and their surrogates are certainly being enlisted to counteract the narrative right now. But also, the reaction to the debate on Thursday night was incredibly hyperbolic, and was always going to be walked back. The reaction to a disastrous debate was always going to be that he'd get a lot of extra media attention at his next few weeks' of appearances, he'd probably perform fine there (especially because unlike at the debate, he has a teleprompter), they'll give us some PR appearances where he's working out or speaking directly about some complicated topic.

It mostly means that people are overestimating how simple or effective it would be to replace Biden with another candidate.\n\nBecause these are your other options:\n\n1) Biden steps down, lets Harris take over. Harris already polls worse against Trump than Biden does. And this is still while she's largely untested--her numbers could go down further over a presidential campaign. So that's not a better option.\n\n2) Biden steps down and chooses someone other than Harris to replace him. This would ignite an absolute firestorm within the party over bypassing Harris and taking black and/or female voters for granted. These demographics are your fiercest organizers, donators and door-knockers, and you'd be alienating them at the exact time you need them most. In addition to that, a lot of the candidates people are suggesting as replacements are either divisive (Newsom, Buttigieg) or unknown and untested (Whitmer, Beshear), and thus don't poll any better against Trump than Biden does. We're only a few months out from the election, and that doesn't give either camp much time to get their numbers up. So this is a very high risk option that could permanently damage the Democrats' relationship with some of their core demographics, without necessarily helping them in the presidency. And it could hurt them not just in terms of the presidency, but with every race up and down the ballot.\n\n3) They wait until the convention and have some kind of brokered convention scenario. As the other poster pointed out, this isn't a realistic option unless Biden cooperates because first-round delegates are all required to vote for him. (And if Biden was cooperating, he'd choose his own replacement as in option 1/2, not this.) It's also not a realistic option because these days, the convention is a formality and is often held after state ballot access deadlines have passed. And it would be insanely divisive among voters supporting various candidates, with minimal time left for them to defuse, get over it, and reconcile. There's a reason we usually do this intra-party fighting during a primary now, almost a year out from the election, and not a couple months before it. A couple months after the fighting, people are still pissed!\n\nAlso, many of the same problems from option 2 (divisive or untested candidates) still remain in this scenario. And both scenarios 2 and 3 (and to some extent 1) introduce the problem that Democrats are running on a platform of \"protecting the democratic process\" while circumventing it, running a candidate who voters didn't vote for in their own primary. It's heavily undercutting their own message.\n\nBiden is a very flawed candidate. But all the other scenarios are also highly flawed and riskier than running Biden.",

Would it concede the election to Trump or would it put in place an alternative plan?

Like you said, she is even more unpopular than Biden and will inspire no one to come out and vote for her.\n\n2) I think the fear that Harris is getting \u201cpassed over\u201d is overblown and unserious. Surely we\u2019re not still doing checkbox politics in 2024. If Harris were the best choice to take on Trump, it would be her. She\u2019s not.

We\u2019re worried about the folks who may not turn out and the folks who want a Trump alternative but don\u2019t want Biden. If the base won\u2019t turn out because choice A is not as good as choice B, maybe all that talk about voting in a corpse over Trump was a whole lot of hot air. \n\n3) any scenario where it\u2019s not Biden involves his participation in stepping down. There is no mechanism to force him out, but the idea is folks would appeal to his sense of country over self. It may be messy. I think a lot less messy than skeptics of this idea.

Unfortunately, people are not truly interchangeable.  It's not so simple that we have 1000 jobs and 1000 people willing to work. Most jobs have specific skill experience requirements that only some people can fill and people also need to be willing to move to the job and know that it exists.

Massive publicly funded works programs are sorely needed now and could focus on the Healthcare and IT jobs we sorely need.  The underemployed custodial staff probably could not become surgeons but they probably could work in radiology or as CNAs.

So no, someone that says they\u2019ll get the fire extinguisher and then runs off would not, in reality, be criminally liable. They don\u2019t have a familial or caregiver relationship, they aren\u2019t a civil servant with those specific duties, they didn\u2019t cause the fire and they aren\u2019t contractually obligated to do anything. Those are the very specific legal criteria\n2. Even if someone were criminally liable for Omission based on \u201cassuming the care of another\u201d - it\u2019s not murder. It\u2019s at most manslaughter. And so no, it\u2019s absolutely not the same as implied in the OP\n3. One can argue the contractual obligation point. And yes insurance companies and their CEOs have been brought to court for failing to meet their contractual obligations. It happens already. There\u2019s an avenue for this. Nobody is getting a free pass for not fulfilling contracts. The issue is that moreso oftentimes it\u2019s in the contract that specific circumstances aren\u2019t covered. And while you can argue that CEOs are \u201cevil\u201d in making contracts and coverage so restrictive, it\u2019s still not legally a crime if it\u2019s omitted by the contract\n\n\nThe issue is people are confusing morality and spirit of intent. Rather than the actual letter of the law. And while there\u2019s subjective ambiguity in the former, there isn\u2019t that ambiguity in the latter. \n\n\nPeople can morally and with regards to spirit of intent think that killing CEOs on the street is the same as CEOs restricting coverage. But per the letter of the law it\u2019s worlds apart.\n\n\nI\u2019m not making a moral judgement. I\u2019m saying per law - the situations are extremely different.\n\n\nAlso, kill the Bard.

Those are the very specific legal criteria\n\nNo, those things are covered in the other criteria:\n\n>There are at least four situations in which the failure to act may constitute breach of a legal duty. One can be held criminally liable: first, where a statute imposes a duty to care for another;  second, where one stands in a certain status relationship to another;  third, where one has assumed a contractual duty to care for another;  and fourth, where one has voluntarily assumed the care of another and so secluded the helpless person as to prevent others from rendering aid. (Jones v. US, 1962)\n\nThe familial relationship part is \"certain status relationship,\" and caregiver (like a at home nurse) is \"assumed a contractual duty.\" The fourth one is about someone stepping in to render aid and then deciding not to do so.\n\nMaybe the confusion here is because we're imagining two different scenarios, so let me try again with something more clear cut:\n\nA pedestrian is hit by a car, seriously injured, and looks like they'll die without medical help. There's six bystanders. One of them shouts \"someone call 911!\" Another bystander gets out his phone and says \"I'm on it!\" He talks on the phone for a minute and then says \"Hang on, an ambulance is on the way.\" But in truth, he didn't call anyone and just pretended. Half an hour later the pedestrian dies, but would have lived if given medical treatment. The guy who pretended to call for help but didn't will be criminally liable for that death. He voluntarily stepped and his actions precluded others from helping (because of his actions, the others believed they didn't need to call 911 and so did not).\n\nIt's extraordinarily rare, to the point where the court in Jones had to cite British cases from the 1800s. And it's easy to see why it's rare, because that's just not the way people act. In fact, the textbook example with the drowning person has the rescuer not just say fuck it and turn back for no reason, but rather he exhausts himself swimming out against a strong current and is forced to turn back or else risk drowning himself. The underlying rule is that once he's stepped in to render aid he has a legal obligation to see it through, but is saved from liability by the impossibility of the situation.\n\nIt's a huge stretch to apply this sort of liability to health insurance companies, and I don't think the argument would ultimately be successful. And it's all predicated on the insurance agreement actually saying they would aid in those specific circumstances *and* that other insurers would not have also denied the claim.\n\nBut also, the contractual duty actually exists here, so we don't even need to go down this rabbit hole. It's just a question of what the specific contractual duty is.\n\n>Also, kill the Bard. He\u2019s nothing but trouble.\n\nBruh, that's my character. I'm proficient with the lute and performance. I'm actually a ranger, but we joke that I'm the bard since we don't have one. Also, we needed one last night. Each character individually had to pass a DC20 Arcana check to escape the lair of Ezzat, the lich in Undermountain. Two of us had +0 to our rolls, and bardic inspiration would have been clutch. Instead we just had my Enhance Ability to help. And later I had to cast Revivify. Why? Who went down? The friggin' cleric. So no, don't kill the bard, not even my off-brand bard you got from Wish.com.",

            "body": "I assume you're asking in the context of US law.\n\nNo.\n\nSo the place to start here is with the cause of death. That would be cancer, heart attack, whatever is actually killing the person. Obviously that's not the health insurance company.\n\nSo what you'd have to try to argue is that the health insurance company had a duty of care which create liability for inaction. For these types of cases where the duty arises from a contractual relationship, the argument would have to be that the victim wouldn't have been in the situation that led to their death if the contractual relationship didn't exist.\n\nFor instance, if a life guard fails to go rescue someone who is drowning, presumably that person wouldn't have gone swimming without the life guard on duty. Drawing from a real case here, a coal miner wouldn't go into the coal mine if they knew the pit boss wasn't going to turn on the exhaust fans.\n\nYou can't really argue \"I wouldn't have gotten cancer if I knew my health insurance claim would be denied!\"\n\nThe best argument that could be made is that they would have gone with a different insurer who wouldn't have denied the claim. And that's an okay argument, though it's also going to be a bit of a novel theory as far as I know.\n\nThat's not the end of the analysis though.\n\nWe also have to ask what precisely was the contractual agreement. To go back to the lifeguard analogy, imagine a sign on the lifeguard stand says \"This beach is patrolled in the area between the two green markers.\" If someone swims *outside* that area, there's no longer a duty to rescue them if they start drowning.\n\nLikewise, with insurance, your agreement is not just a one line \"We'll cover everything.\" You know when you get your insurance that not everything is covered and the insurance company has the ability to deny claims.\n\nSo what we'd have to do from there is show that the claim was denied in breach of the agreement. And since that's getting into the fine details of the agreement, the answer here is just going to have to stop at \"it depends.\"\n\nIt's a shaky legal theory and relies on a lot of the specific agreement between the parties. But now to answer the question as you actually phrased it:\n\n>For example, if you recognize that a person's healthcare\u2014be it immediate treatment or long-term care\u2014is essential for their survival, then choosing to cut off that care or deny access is effectively committing murder, including mass murder and premeditated murder.\n\nThe way you've written it, this would include someone going to a chemo therapy center with no insurance, not a dime in their pocket, and just being turned away. The doctors have chosen to deny access, knowing that the person's health depended on getting that care.\n\nThe cancer clinic has not committed murder as there was no duty to protect the random person who wasn't a patient.",

Most people don\u2019t have a duty to rescue another person unless they were the catalyst of the danger to their life, or unless there was such a circumstance where the person didn\u2019t attempt to save themself or were in greater danger because they were assured they would be rescued. Also, killing somebody else is not necessarily \u201cmurder.\u201d If you are acting in self-defense, for example, you could intend to kill somebody else but the aggressor is usually held responsible.\n\nI\u2019m gonna make an educated guess that this question was inspired by the United CEO assassination. There\u2019s not really much question that the healthcare insurance industry is largely, or at least in part, built on a callous disregard for human life and wellbeing. Like most other types of insurance, their business model is to spend as little as they can get away with, but one of the key differences is that it is much harder to keep them in check (for example, if you ever have a property insurance claim, you *absolutely* want to consider hiring a public adjuster. That is not an opportunity here). However, to call it murder implies that most people would be safer and better off without their healthcare plans. Paying for treatment exclusively out of pocket is usually much more dangerous. Medical insurance is extremely deceptive and as unhelpful as it can get away with, but not murder. However, there is tons of room for reform, and it is a failure of the U.S. government that they don\u2019t have more responsibility to their policyholders.",

History is my poison of choice, being best versed in the American civil war, and its antebellum period, whilst studying politics is more of an interest and a hobby. I especially enjoy reading about American politics for a multitude of reasons, one such reason being the complexity of it.\n\nI remember reading something after the election last year and it got me thinking, and after talking about it with people not particularly knowledgeable about American politics, I thought I would make this post to get everyones thoughts.\n\nThe two women that have run for President have both lost, however both did not have smooth campaigns. Kamala did not enjoy a full campaign run, and Hilary has A LOT of baggage, even without issues that happened with Bernie that split some Democrats away from her. There are logical reasons why they did not win, however how much of a factor was their gender in the outcome of the vote? \n\nIs this an issue about the women that have run for President, or women running for President? If Michelle Obama or Nikki Haley, for example, were to run for President in the next election against a man, would their gender impact their prospects of becoming President? Ultimately, can a woman become President in the next 20 years? Why, or why not?\n\nIt is a multilayered question, and I urge you to try to remove political bias when you think about this question, however this is obviously difficult to do.\n\nEvidently, there is perhaps no right or wrong answer, however if this post does get a couple of replies and cause debates in the comments, please can we keep these debates civil.

You can be sure that Trump will do everything in his power, which is considerable, to ensure that Democrats never win another election. That very much includes making sure that the election machinery is more friendly to Republicans than it is to Democrats and very much includes using the Justice Department, filled with Trump lackeys, to prosecute any potential opponents.

There's no strong evidence of that, or defining evidence of any other single issue being the decisive point the elections were decided on. This is why you see so much acrimony and argument among the political pundits following those elections. They're all certain they know what caused Harris or Clinton to lose, but there is no real consensus. \n\nIn 2016, Clinton received about 3 million more votes than Donald Trump, so it's hard to say how her sex may have affected that election.  \n\nThe 2024 election results were extremely close, with Trump getting only about 1.5% more votes than Harris received. All things being equal, would a man have won that race? There's really no way to know. If Harris had been a white woman, would that have been enough of a difference to win the race? Still no way to measure that objectively. \n\nIt's useful to remember that the American experiment was started by a religious group looking for the freedom to practice their beliefs as they chose. Americans are taught to venerate these \"Puritans\" from a very young age, in our school systems. The often ignored historical reality, is that these immigrants came to North America because their religious practices were so oppressive and vicious, they were no longer welcome in Europe. The Puritans were the Christian Taliban of their day. That cultural DNA is still present in the modern American social fabric.

If you're interested in the structure of American politics, check out Gouverneur Morris and John Adams, the two who really wrote the constitution (and then went on to France to do the same thing again).\n\n(Editing bc I dropped my phone and sent the comment prematurely)\n\nAdams and Morris believe in something called natural aristocracy. Which is exactly as it sounds. Fast forwarding to your question, parties were seen as contrary to the execution of natural aristocracy. So it's reasonable to think the alternative to political parties was just elections/appointments of the natural aristocrats. \n\nYou might want to know what the other non-party options were and Adams was aware of many. He rejects them thoroughly in many of writings, particularly his 3 part defense of the constitution. One  option is the Athens-model of a government by random selection. However, if your question is \"what did the founding fathers think?\" Then it wasn't of any democratic option. The natural aristocrats were to rule.",

In 1963, JFK drafted an Executive Order to withdraw all American troops from Vietnam. He did not publish it because it would make him look soft on communism before the election. When LBJ returned from Dallas as POTUS, he asked the JCS what it would take to win in Vietnam. The answer came back\" 1. A declaration of War against North Vietnam. 2. Full mobilization of the Guard and Reserve. 3. Unrestricted bombing and mining of the harbors of the North. 4. 500,000 troops on the ground inside Vietnam. According to Scotty Ropstow who was in the room when it happened, LBJs response was \"boys if I take that to the Hill, Sam Rayburn is gonna hand me my Great Society and tell me 'You hang on to this Lyndon, we got a war to fight', and that's not going to happen. Get me some better numbers.\" The JCS came back with and increase in military advisors to 50,000 and additional naval air strikes in support of ARVN. That's what LBJ asked for, and then his minions harassed the sonar operator from the Turner Joy to say he was certain he heard torpedo's in the water, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and down the rabbit hole we went.\n\nThe redistribution of income and wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 10% happened because Reagan eliminated the top brackets from the tax code and removed protections for Unions. From 1936 until 1965, the TMR was 91% so the ones dividing profits would only receive 9 cents of every dollar they gave themselves. LBJ cut that to 70% to win support for his War and in 1981 Reagan cut it to 50% and in 1985 to 28%. From 1936 to 1980, workers received pay raises that were 94% of their increased productivity and the bottom 90% saw income and wealth steadily increase faster than that of the top 10%.. Globalization didn't help, but moving jobs to cheaper labor had been a feature of the American economy forever. Likewise automation has been here since the Jacquard Loom. From 1981 to 2021 worker productivity nearly doubled while worker real income increased about 12% while executive compensation went up over 300%. The change in the tax code is the ONLY rational explanation of the change in income distribution - after Reagan's cuts, the boss's could keep the money they gave himself, so that's what they did.",

If anything, I'd be very comfortable betting most of the 5 Republican legislators that did vote for repeal would vote yes on the 1864 ban were it introduced as a ballot referendum (or at least one with nominal rape/incest/health of the mother exceptions), and that those that did vote in favor of repeal did so because they represent competitive (or in Shope's case, kinda-competitive) districts.\n\nIn the last two years of the Ducey administration, two bills were signed into law that demonstrate partisan breakdowns on abortion in AZ.

SB1457 - alongside a ban on all abortions for genetic abnormality-related issues - included a fetal personhood clause that anti-abortion activists in states across the nation (and in DC) have been leaning on to try and dismantle existing abortion laws whole-cloth:\n\n> THE LAWS OF THIS STATE SHALL BE INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED TO ACKNOWLEDGE, ON BEHALF OF AN UNBORN CHILD AT EVERY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES AVAILABLE TO OTHER PERSONS, CITIZENS AND RESIDENTS OF THIS STATE, SUBJECT ONLY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE  UNITED STATES AND DECISIONAL INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. \n\nSB1164 - the bill that nominally created a 15-week abortion ban, also had a passage in it that said \"We don't want this bill to seem like we're legalizing abortions before the 15-week point, and we definitely don't want to repeal the 1864 ban\", a line the state supreme court relied on when deeming it to be the law in AZ last month:\n\n> This act does not:\n\n> 1. Create or recognize a right to abortion or alter generally accepted medical standards. The Legislature does not intend this act to make lawful an abortion that is currently unlawful.\n\n> 2. Repeal, by implication or otherwise, section 13-3603, Arizona Revised Statutes, or any other applicable state law regulating or restricting abortion. \n\nBoth of these bills passed on party lines, including 2 Yes votes each from then-Rep. Shawnna Bolick (now a State Senator who voted in favor of repeal after her husband sided with the state supreme court's majority in making it active law), Rep. Tim Dunn ([on record saying he backed repeal to take the wind out of the sails of the ballot referendum enshrining it in the state constitution](https://twitter.com/TimDunn_AZ/status/1783257432678101025)), Sen. TJ Shope, and Rep. Justin Wilmeth.\n\nThe Republican State Representatives in office now who weren't members of the legislature for 1457 and 1164 are as follows: Reps. Bliss, Carbone, Gillette, Gress, Heap, Hendrix, Jones, Kolodin, Livingston, Marshall, McGarr, Montenegro, Barbara Parker, Pe\u00f1a, Smith, and Willoughby. On the Senate side that list consists of: Sens. Bennett, Carroll, Kerr, Shamp, and Wadsack. Of those, Gress was the only one to vote in favor of repeal this past month.\n\nFast forward to 2023, and Gress - elected to his first term - puts forth a [series of 5 bills that seem like they're intended to make pregnancy easier (giving pregnant women the right to drive in the HOV lane, tax credits while pregnant, heightening penalties re. pregnant DV victims, etc.)](https://azmirror.com/2023/02/06/gop-proposals-to-help-pregnant-women-are-really-aimed-at-ending-abortion-critics-say/), but which all would have served as backdoor ways of enacting the same fetal personhood ideas in SB1457 which were blocked by a court into law. [Here's US Sen. Kevin Cramer](https://www.cramer.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-cramer-rep-johnson-introduce-bicameral-legislation-to-allow-pregnant-mothers-to-receive-child-support) talking about how a bill he helped introduce at the national level akin to Gress's was explicitly about making sure laws reflected that idea that life begins at conception:\n\n> Life begins at conception, and this bill is a straightforward first step towards updating our federal laws to reflect that fact. \n\n\nGress was open about how he had sought help from the deeply socially conservative think-tank called the Center for Arizona Policy, though he denied that the intent of the bills was to strengthen the legal standing for fetal personhood. While 3 of Gress's bills were held in committee, both HB2427 and HB2502 were voted on by both chambers and passed on party lines. Everyone in the above list cast Yes votes on both 2427 and 2502, except for Willoughby, who was appointed to the legislature a couple of months afterwards to fill a seat left vacant by the [expulsion of Liz Harris](https://azmirror.com/2023/04/12/liz-harris-expelled-from-state-house-for-lying-about-conspiracy-presentation/).\n\nAnd as for her, while she hasn't sponsored any abortion-related bills from what I can tell in the year or so since getting appointed, she did [spend several minutes during the repeal vote trying to get Dunn to switch his vote to No](https://twitter.com/AZCEBVus/status/1783207882546372941) and then - despite representing a Biden+3 House district - voted No herself.\n\n> And do you expect them to lose the legislature in November?\n\nProbably? But I got my hopes up 3 times in a row in the past, with Dems repeatedly coming several thousand votes away from flipping both chambers in 2018, 2020, and 2022 but falling short each time (House has been 31R-29D since the 2018 election, Senate was 17R-13D from 2016-2020 and then 16R-14D since then). The party staff I consider responsible for boneheaded candidate recruitment and campaign funding decisions are gone, and the environment and maps are the friendliest they've ever been for Democrats - but I've emotionally swung and missed at that football too many times.",

Once they got control of the country, they couldn't risk upsetting the established corporate interests and conservative military leadership, so they largely purged the elements of their party that wanted to continue to push for a socialist revolution. From that point on, they were pretty much purely focused on nationalism and racial superiority rather than any socialist ideology.",

In order to win a state, you need to just win the popular vote in that state.

They just have to convince the jury that the intent was there to commit/aid/conceal the crime when these business records were being falsified.\n\n> I remember something about the judges instructions mentioning to the jury not having to agree on the crime being committed, or something akin to that?

Burglary is typically defined as breaking into a building with the intent to commit a felony. Any felony will do, and intent is all that's necessary, so if you break into a house with intent to rob it and then get scared off by an alarm before you steal anything, you can still be convicted of burglary if the prosecution can convince the jury that you intended to commit robbery when you broke in. If you break in, beat up the resident, sexually assault the resident, and rob the place, then you've got potentially three felonies that could have been intended at the point of breaking in. It probably varies by state, but in at least some states, the prosecutor isn't required to get the jury to unanimously agree what the original intended felony was at the point of breaking in. They just all have to agree that at least one felony was intended.\n\n>  If one crime was committed in furtherance of another, wouldn't one have to have proven that that second crime which the first one was in furtherance of to have actually been committed?\n\nNot if the law says that intent to commit the second crime is sufficient for guilt.",

When it comes to welfare it advocates for a specific and moderate type of welfare that tries to appeal to both the center left and the center right, like free college tuition and healthcare. The right gets on board with it because they can more directly see the good in it. They feel this type of welfare benefits everyone and is necessary and not wasteful. One nation conservatism is something else. All of its followers believe in conservative social values and economic values. As for welfare it believes that\u2019s the job of the private sector, not the government. The ideology acknowledges that there are problems in the country but says the reason for them is that the private sector has somehow lost its way and is greedy and isn\u2019t like how it\u2019s supposed to be. They say in a true economic paradise the big businesses have \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d social values where they take care of the people so everyone can prosper. The difference in the ideologies is that the latter believes that returning to a compassionate conservative society rather than making a compassion conservative government is the answer to all our problems. Both ideologies are kind of like following Jesus, where you love and give to everyone and many of his followers believe that\u2019s the way you get people to embrace conservative social values, being loving instead of harsh.",

No. Not only has there been no evidence of that, can you imagine Trump taking orders from *anyone*?\n\nI think the most damning thing to this whole hypothesis is that the Trump administration actually sent lethal military aid to Ukraine. Everyone remembers him trying to get a political kickback from Ukraine, and then forgets the context of us actually sending weapons to Ukraine in the first place, including the all-important anti-tank missiles that helped to stall Russia's advances in the first days of the war.\n\nAnd for further context, the Obama administration's policy was to send only non-lethal aid. A bit more than the \"just blankets\" Trump has portrayed it as, but even following the invasion of Crimea, Obama didn't start sending them weapons. And this followed four years of the Obama administration trying to build a stronger relationship with Russia, including cancelling plans for a missile defense shield in Europe.\n\nYou could just as easily argue the Obama or Clinton were Russian assets.

It makes me wonder what function those hearings have. The video I mentioned surprised me because I would have assumed, critiquing CEOs is more a thing of a left-leaning party (i.e. the Democrats). Can you shed some light onto what function those hearings have in US politics? Is it purely for good publicity for the questioner? If both parties agree that certain CEOs behavior is bad, you'd think they'd find a compromise to tackle the problem. Commenters certainly feel those CEOs should be put in jail (though I guess there's surely no legal basis, else it would be in front of a court and not in front of parliament).

So sometimes, that's what they do, and people will do that to be heard.\n\n\n\nNow, let's think about representation. Representation, it's like having a voice in a choir. Each district has its own choir member, singing its own part. House rules, they\u2019re like the sheet music, guiding who can sing what notes. When members say they can only serve their district\u2019s residents, it\u2019s like saying they can only sing their part of the song.

Support for third-party candidates always withers as we get closer to the election--it's easy to say you're going to vote third-party in July, when you don't have to deal with the consequences.

            "body": "**Are there other good poll aggregator sites and EV prediction sites other than 538?** Specifically I'm looking for a predictor that's willing to make some gutsy calls. Mainstream media today is guilty for the last 4 or 5 races for putting up a [map like this](blob:https://imgur.com/1cdf4334-407d-4bdd-aa41-4d4c2c46be37) where they assign some red and blue states and then leave a giant gaping middle--obviously those are battleground states, but even ones that will highly likely go one way or the other, they deliberately assign enough of those states to make it seem both sides have strong chances of winning. I remember going back 2020, 2016, 2012, and each time the winner had 300+ EVs but we'd see these \"ohh we think both candidates sit at ~220 and will need to duke it out for the other states.\n\nI liked the old 538 maybe even before 2016 where Nate was more focused on polls, and assigning a color to each state. I know he's split off from 538 now but the 538 today is just as guilty as the MSM in making all the battleground states purple and purposely refusing to assign a color based on the current state of polls.\n\n[RaceforWH](https://www.racetothewh.com/president/polls) is probably the closest I've found to give you an accurate picture of the race today, but I'm looking at their past history and they claim they got every state except Ohio, Florida and NC in 2020. Those were battleground states in 2016 but clearly went for Trump after looking at polling issues. In 2020 NC was the closest, but how do you get a Trump +8, Trump +3.5, and Trump +1.5 all as misses? I mean if they missed Arizona or Georgia or Wisconsin, I'd let that go. Those were RAZOR thin states.\n\n[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/prediction-model/president) is probably a decent one, and goes beyond most MSM sites in actually assigning some guess to PA/GA/NV/AZ which are all currently trending pretty strongly for Trump right now. I agree states like MI and WI are truly the nailbiters in this current moment where it's hard to make a strong prediction.\n\n[Decision Desk](https://elections2024.thehill.com/forecast/2024/president/) has clearly shifted into conservative projection mode. For a while they were sharing regular poll numbers [showing 312 vs 226 scenarios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AmU7XFDKHs). I remember for at least a few months they were showing Trump strong EV wins but even if the polls aren't too far from when they made those videos back in Spring 2024, EV simulations would be pretty similar today. But no, in the name of keeping this a horse race, they cannot show these kinds of outrageous predictions.",

Why do conservative voters want to vote for Trump? He has a pretty solid standing. Not just why would people want to vote for him over other candidates. What do conservative voters see in him?",

Trump is no blue-collar worker, but he was an outsider to the Washington machine who campaigned specifically on thrusting the elite from power.

No matter who it is. That is why we've all seen for years many people showing their frustrations with their options: \"really? These are our two options?\", etc.\n\nVoting in your party's candidate can create long-term benefits to your belief in values that last a lot longer than the candidate's term. An example of this is that Trump was able to significantly sway the power of the SCOTUS to be conservative for many, many years to come even after his term(s) as president.\n\nBut because of the two-party system, you get stuck with the option that the party props up. Even if that individual is not someone you prefer - but because they're the ticket to \\*your\\* party getting power, most people are going to stick with that candidate.\n\nTrump has managed to create a base of voters that are very loyal to him specifically - which has given him great power in the Republican party. He has \"Obama\"-type influence on the Republican party.\n\nI could go on, but at the end of the day, it really is the two-party system that is offering voters only two viable choices. Most people are going to stick with the side that offers them the path to having their values represented. And due to the power of both parties, many voters feel (and there is truth to it), that if they vote for an independent that may actually align with their individual beliefs more, they're actually wasting their vote on a non-viable option which could lead to the candidate they don't want to have an advantage.\n\nWhich is why elections are now primarily decided by the independents who \\*DO\\* sway on who is actually running, rather than based on the party they're representing.",

If they both were off the ticket, they'd be required to offer refunds to their respective donors, who then would have to make the decision to donate their refunds to the new candidate's campaign.\n\nThe challenge from the Republican party, I am assuming, is if they were to do the latter option. Like Fuji\\_Ringo said: supposedly they could alternatively transfer the money to the DNC, who could therefore use those funds to support the new candidate, but not necessarily give that candidate the funds to their campaign directly.\n\nRealistically, in my opinion, the challenge is probably meant to be a: \"This probably won't change anything, but if we do manage to win it, the other side will be set back significantly.\" When a lot of money moves and has a lot of people involved (donors), it creates an opportunity for the opponent to do whatever they can to disrupt the transfer of money, and maybe, find some sort of grounds along the way. I don't think they'd be successful in their challenge, but the reward of challenging outweighs their risk -- so they're probably thinking: might as well see if we can create some sort of disruption in our favor.\n\n(Just my opinions - please don't take my speculations as certain haha.)",

Pennsylvania is a *must-win* for the Dems, because if they lose it, they will require the rest of the swingiest of swing states (MI, WI, NV, AZ) in addition to at least one more of the \"leans red\" swing states (OH, NC, GA), at least according to 270towin.\n\nSo, due to this, with Shapiro's popularity in PA and the necessity of the state going blue, he seems like the most straightforward and logical pick, despite his weaknesses of his Jewish heritage (frustrates me that this has to be stated) and his relative inexperience in politics compared to other candidates.\n\nThere is other evidence of Shapiro's political acumen that shouldn't go unnoticed, but his main draw is his ability to clutch PA.

Trump is unusual in that he was once President, but Romney did meet with world leaders in the 2012 campaign (e.g., Sarkozy), McCain in 2008 (e.g., the British PM), etc.\n\n- Bibi needs to rebuild relations. Biden is very pro-Israel (he has been for a long time) but he recognizes Bibi's not doing Israel any favors and/or his base is more pro-Gaza than he is, Harris also has to deal with the Dems' division on the issue, and Trump is annoyed at how Bibi almost ruined his biggest diplomatic accomplishment, the Abraham Accords. Honestly Bibi tends to rub everyone the wrong way, but if he wants to maintain US support he needs to try to get them back.\n\nSo Bibi has a good reason (meeting competing politicians is normal and he's already here) and an important one (he needs to rebuild relations with the Democratic Party and hope Trump doesn't flip on him).",

            "body": "They're all different. \n\nOld Republican policy was always to cut taxes and regulation and allow the free market to work. This sometimes worked, as it allows for companies to expand rapidly, and it quickly increases the amount of money people have which they can spend. There are downsides to this. It usually creates greater amounts of economic inequality and helps bolster monopolies through the destruction of anti-trust regulation, like what Reagan did. For some examples, look at Trumps tax cuts in 2017(I think this was when they passed)\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, prefer to focus on large, long term investments and incentives. Things like the infrastructure bill and chips act. These, of course, create tons of jobs(look at the new fabs and rail jobs) and help build up American infrastructure over the long term, especially in urban areas. The downside here is almost always the increase in spending, and subsequent increase in taxes, which every American hates. They also generally support higher regulation to protect people and the environment, along with stronger social programs.\n\nBoth the economic systems have their pluses and minuses, but the real difference is long term vs short term. Short term, tax cuts will always make Americans happier and boost the economy, as you're essentially instantly giving Americans a big stimulus cheque. Sounds great, right? Well, long term, Democrat policies usually prevail. Spending on infrastructure, social programs, and long term investments, by every single economic indicator, has significant economic benefit. Take the Chips act. Yes, Biden could've just cut 280B or so from people's taxes, and immediately made many Americans happy, but over the next 10 years that Chips act is gonna create thousands of high paying jobs, and usually whenever a high impact industry like tech and chips comes around, it creates whole ecosystems to support these companies and people, which in term further boosts the economy(Look at Detroit in the early days of cars, or the Bay Area for tech, or LA for Media). The biggest reason why we don't just do this investment all the time is, well, those tax increases would be really unpopular, and we do also need some short term growth. You can kinda think of it in sports terms. It'd be like trading your pick this year for 2 picks 5 years out. Yes, 2 picks is worth more, but your team will be worse now, and we can't be 100% sure what those picks will turn out to be.\n\nAs for Trump, well, it's not like the other 2. Yeah, he has a lot of the same principles as the other republicans, with lower taxes and regulatory cuts, but there is also the tariffs, which have basically been universally lambasted by economists. The down stream effects of tariffs are, simply put, terrible. Tariffs help a lot of raw material companies, like steel mills, along with simple goods manufacturing, like clothing. It, however, really hurts any company with more complex goods, like chips, tech, cars, and tons of other non-raw good companies. Basically, these companies, to manufacture at a good cost, need to import raw goods to survive and manufacture, which becomes near impossible to do so with high tariffs. Here's a list of companies hurt by this:  \n[https://www.cato.org/commentary/here-are-202-companies-hurt-trumps-tariffs](https://www.cato.org/commentary/here-are-202-companies-hurt-trumps-tariffs)  \nCompanies need open trade for goods to manufacture, and every point of evidence we have says that tariffs end up as a tax on consumers and domestic complex goods manufacturers, which just so happen to be our largest sector of manufacturing. During his last term, Trump lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs before covid even started. Meanwhile, the investment Biden has done over the last 4 years has led to a massive boom in manufacturing jobs. This will likely continue to grow more and more as new plants open. Going back to the sports terms, well, it'd be like trading the 1st overall pick for a late 2nd and some old guy you can slot in for a few minutes. \n\nBasically, old Republican and Democrat policies both have upsides and downsides, and both should have their place in an economy, while Trumps policies are flat out dumb.",

Meanwhile, in 2008, Sarah Palin proved exceptionally unpopular, and when compared with the(at the time) very popular Joe Biden, it made the ticket look way worse.\n\nThe main 2 that seem to be getting the nod is Mark Kelly and Josh Shapiro. Both have downsides and upsides. The main benefit to Kelly is that he's very popular and can help secure the southwest when that region is increasingly becoming the battleground for elections. He's been in 2 races so far, and in those races he's far outperformed the other democrat on the ticket. He's very well liked and regarded, and him on the ticket would really help in Arizona. \n\nShapiro, on the other hand, has risen to prominence after he fixed that freeway that collapsed in like a week. He's proven to be a guy that gets stuff done, which has made him exceedingly popular in Pennsylvania, even amongst Republicans. He does have strong Pro-Israel views, and he's much more moderate than other Democrats, but he's also done a lot of bipartisan work, and having 2 people with some policy disagreement might be good for the White House, as they compare and contrast each other.\n\nNow, who would I pick? Shapiro. Pennsylvania is probably the most important state in this election season, and picking Shapiro would definitely boost any chances of winning in the state. However, if Kelly gets the nod I wouldn't be shocked or unhappy. He's very well liked nationally, as he's a vet, a former astronaut(look up the video of him with the gorilla suit in the ISS), and he's become nationally acclaimed for his gun control stance after his wife, a then congresswoman, was shot(she's alive, but not nearly fully recovered).

Trump has done nothing but lost supporters since 2020, either due to his insurrection attempt, or his multiple convictions, or his recent push further to the right, or his pick of JD for VP, or even his age(now the oldest candidate in American history). Trump and Biden both won about 94% of their respective parties vote. Trump needs to get at least 94% to have a sliver of a chance at the election. During the primary exit polls, 1 in 10 Republicans(not independents, Republicans) said, in no uncertain terms, that there was no way they would back Trump. Trump has done basically nothing to expand his tent, while Harris has done a lot, bringing younger voters, black voters, and asian voters closer in, and will hopefully start pushing for hispanic voters. Trump has also lost quite a lot of voters between 2020 and 2024 due to the affect known as death. A lot of older voters have died, and around 9 million people are dead between 2020 and 2024, a lot of which were older voters who favor Trump. Meanwhile, Harris has had millions of new voters due to the affect of turning 18, and 18 year old's love them some Democrat. In fact, Gen Z is the most left wing party ever, and the anticipated shift of millennials from the left to the right is not happening the way republicans have banked on in past generations. It happened with boomers, it happened with gen x, but it is not happening with millennials, likely because the party has refused to shift policy towards ideals of the younger generation. \n\nCall me crazy, but over the last 4 years I have seen nothing Trump or the Republican party has really done to bring in new voters, while the Democrats have. I don't see Trump having a strong path to the white house. That's just me and my delusional optimism, but I just don't see it. Trump has a ceiling, and he's hit it.

Worth noting that Perot was running as a third party both years.\n\nMondale only got 40.6% against Reagan. Carter only got 41%, but with John Anderson as a significant third party in that race.\n\nAnd there's McGovern's 37.5% against Nixon.\n\nThe most realistic scenario is a credible third party takes enough votes to pull one party below the 40% number. I think you could potentially have that happen if one party is already polling so low that voters aren't actually concerned with splitting the vote because they're already lost. For instance, imagine we screw with the timeline and you have a 2012-era incumbent Obama running against 2024 Trump and then Mitt Romney or Nikki Haley decided to run as a third party candidate.",

            "body": "I looked at the speakers from last night (not including those listed as performers, or the closing benediction), and here's the breakdown, with percent representation that night versus their representation in the general population:\n\nWhite: 23 (46% < 58%)\n\nBlack: 13 (26% > 12%)\n\nHispanic: 8 (16% < 19%)\n\nAsian: 6 (12% > 6%)\n\nFar from there being little to no representation for Hispanics at the DNC, they actually got the closest to being proportionately represented.\n\nWhen we look at the prime spots, the numbers change quite a bit. If we look at the last 13 people to go (starting with Hakeem Jeffries), there's 9 White, 3 Black, 1 Hispanic. For Hispanic speakers to get proportional representation here, there should have been 3.\n\nSo now to get to your question, why is that?\n\nFor starters, one of them was Walz, and 3 of the speakers were relatives of Harris (2 in-laws, 1 niece).\n\nThree of the speakers are also the party elite, Bill Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and Hakeem Jeffries. Then we also have Pete Buttigieg and Josh Shapiro. Maybe we count Amy Klobuchar as part of the party elite.\n\nSo that accounts for 9-10 of the 13 top slots, with 1 of the remaining going to a Hispanic senator from Nevada.\n\nIt seems like the answer is the Hispanics were well represented to the DNC, and to the extent they weren't well represented in the prime slots the answer is because neither Harris nor Walz are Hispanic, and it usually takes a long time to get into the party leadership so their lack of representation among the party elites reflects past lack of representation.\n\nThat leaves us with one big question though which is why *now* Hispanics are under represented among Democrats. For instance, despite the Hispanic population being 50% larger than the Black population, there are 6 more Black members of Congress than Hispanic. With all the hype around Harris's race, I can't recall any serious conversation about her having a Hispanic VP. It certainly seems that the Democrats are far more focused on giving more representation to Blacks with Hispanics largely being forgotten, despite their much larger numbers.\n\nI think a lot of that has to do with the pipeline. The Black population in the US goes back hundreds of years, while the Hispanic population is fairly new. Since 1990, the Hispanic population has *tripled.* It takes a long time for a group to get established in politics.",

They want a more socialist economy (broadly meaning more control by workers) and much more social programs (like universal free healthcare).\n\nThe right uses \"liberal\" interchangeably with \"Democrat\" because the Democratic party has long been associated with greater liberalism, at least on social issues (think civil rights, gay marriage, marijuana, criminal justice).\n\nThere is however a (small) trend of people on the moderate left using the liberal label to distinguish from the far-left which they'd label as \"progressives.\" This is due largely to a split over issues involving things like affirmative action and free speech.",

Which is not surprising if you understand the modern GOP;\n\nShort answer is that the establishment GOP fucked over their voters for decades and so now their own voters don't trust them and have rolled the dice with Trump.\n\nLonger answer:\n\nSince Reagan took over the party ~45 years ago the Republicans domestic policy has only one goal:\n\nTo put more wealth and power into the hands of those who are already wealthy and powerful. They are the masters the GOP actually serves.\n\nThey primarily serve them through tax cuts and destroying government regulation (including making bribery legal).\n\nThe problem is that platform only benefits a very small percentage of the population so they need to convince people who are not helped (and may actually be harmed) by their policies to vote for them. That's why they have an informal coalition with the single issue voters (anti-abortion & gun worshippers) and the broader conservative culture warriors.\n\nHowever if there is a conflict between the desires of their true masters and the culture warriors the GOP will always serve the needs of their masters. For abortion and guns that's not a problem because the wealthy and powerful will always have access to safe abortions regardless of the law and they are very rarely victims of gun violence.\n\nWith regards to the broader culture warriors there's largely no conflict because the wealthy have always been able to ignore any conservative cultural norms. However there is one major issue in which there is a conflict: Immigration.\n\nFor the conservative cultural warriors their primary need is that America remains a strongly White majority country with traditionally European-Christian values. Since, post-WW2, less than 10% of all immigration has been White, immigration directly attacks their core needs.\n\nHowever immigration helps grow the economy and provides cheap labor so the wealthy and powerful are pro-immigration because it makes them richer.\n\nSo from the 1980's through ~2010 the GOP never did anything about immigration because that's what their masters wanted.\nHowever they did demogogue about it a lot on talk radio and Fox so they gave their voters the impression they were on their side while they did nothing.\n\nIn the 80's and 90's they were successful because non-White immigrants were largely confined to their traditional areas (major cities on the coasts,  Texas and the Southwest, southern Florida) however as they became a larger part of the population they started showing up in smaller towns / cities that had previously had no minorities and so now the issue was in the voters faces.\n\nThen in 2008 a Black man with a Muslim sounding name got elected president and the culture war crowd realized they really had lost control of the country. They recognized that the GOP establishment was not working for them and so they used the primaries to take out GOP establishment politicians even if it meant their culture warrior candidate would lose in the general election. So they broke free of the threat that they needed to vote for GOP establishment or the bad guys would win.\n\nAfter doing that a few times the GOP establishment got scared and fell in line behind the voters. However the culture war crowd had slept on the issue for too long and by the time they acted it was too late to change the fact that Whites will become a minority in the USA within the next 10-15 years.\n\nThe only way to avert that is to take really extreme actions like halting all non-White immigration and deporting tens of millions of immigrants. However doing so would harm the economy and likely crash the stock market and so no GOP politician will actually do it.\n\nSo they need someone who is crazy enough to do the things they want. Although it's unlikely he would actually do so (because of the money) their best chance at that person is Trump so they are ride or die with him.",

A lot of Americans were seriously put off by Trump's last debate performance, and Vance, whether you wanna call it \"sane-washing\" or \"slick talk\" as a lot of commenters here are, came off as a much calmer and more policy-focused candidate for the viewers who care about that.

Her and Biden's admin saw a historical amount of positive legislation getting passed such as the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the inflation reduction act, the CHIPS act, the PACT act, and the bipartisan safer communities act. They capped the prices of many drugs, most notably insulin saving many Americans thousands of dollars per year. I expect Kamala to continue pushing for legislation like this. \n\nTrump on the other hand is a convicted felon. He had his charity shut down for fraud. His business has been found liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in fraud. He has been found legally liable for sexual assault. He said he would hire the best people in his first term, yet most of the people in his cabinet have come out and said what a terrible human and president he was. He chastised Obama for golfing too much during his presidency, yet when Trump was president he ended up golfing more than Obama, all at his resorts which cost the taxpayers millions of dollars which went directly to Trump's properties. \n\nHe literally tried to overthrow the last election violently. Many historians have already dubbed him the worst president to ever serve. He praises dictators like Kim Jong Un, Xi, and Putin while disparaging our allies. His entire platform is grievances and fearmongering about illegal immigrants when he himself employs illegal immigrants. The only major legislation that passed under his first term was a tax break that cut the taxes of large corporations and billionaires while the middle class saw next to nothing. He is a terrible, selfish, human being and he does not belong anywhere near the white house.",

However, I understand that this concept does not actually work, and instead of the top CEOs taking the money from these tax cuts and bettering the national economy in the form of investing in other businesses, or making new jobs for their own company, they simply send it overseas to tax havens to have that money avoid being taxed at American rates. \n\nWith this being said, would I be right to say that the top earners ought to be taxed more, and the middle class be taxed less...? From how I see it, this would give Americans a plentiful amount of disposable income to invest in the economy, while also maintaining similar standards of social services. Piggybacking off of this question, is this POV more of a democratic one? I am not too knowledgeable on their perspective of the domestic economy, broadly speaking. \n\nTo wrap all of this up... if the average American would benefit more as a result of higher taxes on the top 1%, and Trump's tax policy actually reduces taxes on the top 1%, would this mean that Trump is a president for the rich, whereas Harris is a president for the middle class (strictly speaking economics-wise)?",

Do you not remember what happened when he implemented tariffs in his first term? China implemented retaliatory tariffs against various US agricultural products, which destroyed a bunch of farming businesses. People were committing suicide due to being financially ruined. The US had to pass $16 billion in bailout funds to rescue farms that could no longer sell their product.\n\n> Therefore, he will increase the wages of US citizens and legal immigrants.\n\nTrump doesn't care about legal immigrants.

Illegal immigrants also keep prices down because they take the jobs that normal citizens will not take. Trump himself employs illegal immigrants, so talk about hypocrisy. Expect insane prices increases if every illegal gets deported out of this country. Speaking of which, we still don't know how Trump is going to cleanly deport every single illegal.

Even those who are don't tend to feel much fondness for illegal immigrants, and they apparently don't feel that the Republicans are a threat to legal immigrants, despite the recent Haitian stuff. A lot of Hispanics have expressed support for the Republican efforts to build a wall and increase deportations.\n\n> He openly admits he hates to pay for union workers in his own business, yet the union bosses love him, just ask Sean of the teamsters. I am sure there are union members that will still vote for him.\n\nJust because people are in a union doesn't necessarily mean that they will only vote based on how a candidate feels about unions. They may not even like unions, but they ended up in a job where you basically have to be in one. Or maybe they do like unions, but they care about other things more than unions.\n\nFor both Hispanics and union workers, it likely comes down to the same thing: as Democrats have won more and more support among college-educated voters and white-collar professionals over the years, they've become less and less focused on working class issues, and the Republicans have taken the opportunity to make themselves the party of voters who don't have a college education, so truck drivers, construction workers, farmers, miners, etc. have drifted towards the Republicans. A lot of these jobs are unionized.\n\nTariffs are generally bad economic policy, but if you can convince people that tariffs would make it too expensive to import stuff from overseas and bring factory jobs back to the US, then you can see how that would be attractive policy to workers who don't have a college education.\n\n> Tariffs? I doubt any of that will happen, and that is my point.\n\nTariffs are probably one of the most likely things to be implemented by Trump because it's one of the few things the president has the power to do without Congress.",

If you're a Swiftie who was just planning to ride the couch election day, but that Taylor Swift does a big event endorsing Harris, that might motivate you to show up and vote, provided that you were only deciding between the couch and Harris.

You'll often start with people who are relatively unknown to the voters. A celebrity endorsement can generate press and get people to look more into the candidate.

They used very different methodologies.\n\nExit polling is when they sit outside of polling locations and try to get people who just voted to fill out questionnaires. It's prone to a lot of error due to sampling issues and non-response bias. It's not extremely accurate and not really meant to be. The main purpose is to provide media companies with enough data to be able to call the winner of states during their election night coverage. On top of that, the pandemic messed up the usual exit polling methodology because so many more people didn't vote in person or voted early. The exit pollsters tried to account for this by doing exit polling at early voting locations and adding in some telephone polling to supplement, but it probably still threw off the results a lot.\n\nThe Pew poll was conducted entirely through their normal polling methodology of getting people to fill out surveys online or over the phone after the election, and they used voter data from the states to verify that the people they were talking to actually voted in the election.\n\nI would expect the Pew data to be more accurate.",

So it's logical that Catholics would prefer to vote for a candidate whose policies align with those views.  \n\nAnd while religion and God are not what politics are supposed to be about, Harris' choice to introduce consideration of both by taking issue with three separate appointees' membership in the Knights of Columbus understandably made many in our very diverse community uncomfortable.  \n\nI don't think I really have anything more to add on this subject, but I hope this gives you some food for thought as to why some people think that it is appropriate to take into account the alignment of a candidate's policies with religious principles as they understand them.",

I don't think we'll see the nightmare scenarios of seats remaining open for years. Instead, we'll get older moderate nominees who can pick up 2-3 Republican votes. Have to keep in mind that an important part of the dynamic is that it's currently a 6-3 split in the Supreme Court, so Republicans can replace a conservative with a moderate liberal and still have the majority. The worst case scenario for them is generating a ton of ill will by refusing to seat someone during an early vacancy, losing control of the Senate in 2026, then having a young far left judge appointed.",

The arrangement would also be likely to allow Musk and Ramaswamy to continue working in the private sector and serve without Senate approval.\n> \n> Trump said he wanted the department to help deliver \"drastic change,\" and he compared its ambitions to those of the World War II project to develop atomic weapons.\n> \n> \"It will become, potentially, 'The Manhattan Project' of our time,\" Trump said. \"Republican politicians have dreamed about the objectives of 'DOGE' for a very long time.\"\n> \n> He gave a deadline of July 4, 2026, for the department to conclude its work.\n> \n> In his broader efforts to pare down the government, Trump could seek to ask Congress give him \u201cpresidential reorganization authority\u201d under the Presidential Reorganization Act to permit him to consolidate, reorganize or eliminate agencies within the executive branch. The last time Congress gave a president such authority was during the Reagan administration.\n> \n> Trump could also take steps to eliminate federal worker jobs by re-signing his \u201cSchedule F\u201d executive order, which would reclassify tens of thousands of federal civil workers as political at-will positions as a means of either installing politically aligned workers or removing a chunk of the federal workforce altogether.\n> \n> Trump signed that executive order in October 2020; President Joe Biden rolled it back.\n> \n> The Government Accountability Office, the main federal government watchdog, indicated it would provide any necessary information to Trump's new entity.\n> \n> \u201cGAO has cooperated and shared information in the past when presidential or congressional commissions have been established to address the federal government\u2019s programs and operations, as well as fiscal and other challenges.

You can get the sort of \"official\" definitions by reading the Wikipedia pages on those topics. But, that's not going to tell you how the terms are getting used by the MSM, politicians, and on social media.\n\nSo with that last part in mind, I'll add a bit on what you're not going to find from Wikipedia.\n\nFascism -- This gets used to describe some things which can be reasonably called fascist, such as certain totalitarian and anti-democratic policies, like locking up political opponents. But it's also used to describe aggressive use of the President's legitimate executive authority. And then it gets used to describe any sort of racist/sexist/etcist stances.\n\nSocialism -- This is probably the most abused term in American politics, and both the left and right screw it up. It gets used to describe any sort of welfare policies, and then also used to describe more overtly redistributive policies. What gets very complicated here is that a single policy can be socialism, but that doesn't make the entire system socialist. For instance, increasing the capital gains tax in order to fund increased the EITC with be a socialist policy, but wouldn't turn the US into a socialist state.\n\nCommunism -- Most folks recognize countries like Russia and China as communist, but you'll be a lot of \"um actually\" folks who argue that the only *true* communism is stateless. You similarly get people who say the only *true* democracy is direct democracy. But of course both come in many different flavors.\n\nTotalitarianism -- Wikipedia will tell you this requires a dictator, but the intuitive meaning would just be a government with *total* control or unlimited power, regardless of the actual structure of the government. For instance, if the US government was set up to allow Congress to pass whatever laws it wanted unchecked by the limits we actually have, that's arguably totalitarian (though you could split hairs between if they have to use the power to be totalitarian or not). Along the same lines, \"dictator\" is often confused with monarch. A monarch is a leader for life, while a dictator rules by dictates. If somehow a US president became President for Life, they'd not necessarily be a dictator unless the executive power was greatly expanded; they would be a monarch.",

I mean, Robert Kennedy Jr. is about to become the new head of Health Department:\n\n> **Public Health Experts Alarmed at Trump\u2019s Pick of RFK Jr. to Lead HHS**\n> \n> President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who spreads medical disinformation and conspiracy theories, to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) alarmed public health experts who say that Kennedy\u2019s potential confirmation could have dire consequences for the state of health and science in America.\n> \n> \u201cI can\u2019t think of a darker day for public health and science itself than the election of Donald Trump and the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of health,\u201d says Lawrence Gostin, director of Georgetown University\u2019s O\u2019Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law. \n> \n> \u201cTo say that RFK Jr. is unqualified is a considerable understatement,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe minimum qualification for being the head of the Department of Health and Human Services is fidelity to science and scientific evidence, and he spent his entire career fomenting distrust in public health and undermining science at every step of the way.\u201d\n> \n> If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy would have sway over health agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that fall under the purview of HHS. Kennedy, who endorsed Trump in the 2024 election after ending his own longshot presidential campaign as an independent, has promoted a plan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d which includes goals like reversing \u201can epidemic of chronic disease,\u201d banning certain food additives and chemicals, and cleaning up \u201ctoxic chemicals from our air, water, and soil.\u201d\n> \n> But Kennedy, 70, has faced blowback for spreading medical disinformation. He has falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism, which has been debunked by years of scientific research proving vaccines are safe and effective. He\u2019s claimed that adding fluoride to the water supply\u2014a safe and long-standing practice that protects oral health\u2014is linked to IQ loss, bone cancer, and more, and has said he would stop the practice. **He\u2019s accused the FDA of \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of raw milk; the FDA doesn\u2019t order people not to drink raw milk, but cautions that raw milk can contain dangerous bacteria, including E. coli and listeria, which can lead to illnesses and even death (health authorities have also been advising the public to avoid drinking raw milk during the bird flu outbreak, since the virus can survive in it).**\n> \n> Since the election, Kennedy has said that he and the Trump Administration wouldn\u2019t take vaccines off the market, but public health experts are concerned that he would appoint officials in the FDA or CDC who share his debunked anti-vaccine views and could try to slow, restrict, or revoke vaccine approvals. Gostin says there are \u201cguardrails\u201d in place that would prevent Kennedy from passing extreme policies\u2014for instance, the head of HHS wouldn\u2019t have the power to ban vaccinations or vaccination mandates, since those public health powers are left up to state or local officials. If the FDA tried to withdraw approval of a vaccine without scientific justification, Gostin says he expects that that argument wouldn\u2019t hold up in court.\n> \n> Even so, Gostin says he believes Kennedy \u201ccould do enormous damage\u201d when it comes to vaccine policy in the U.S. He worries that HHS could \u201ccherry pick\u201d data that casts doubt on the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, which could influence state and local officials and sow public distrust. Agencies like the FDA and CDC \u201cset the scientific gold standard for public health recommendations,\" and if they release false or misleading information, Gostin worries \u201cit will poison the well of public opinion and nobody will know who to trust.\u201d And that could lead to fewer people getting vaccinated and \u201can explosion\u201d of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, and rubella, Gostin says.\n> \n> \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have somebody who\u2019s a vaccine denier and science skeptic as head of the nation\u2019s most venerable scientific agencies,\u201d Gostin says. \u201cHe\u2019s shown that, on a huge range of public health issues, he takes the position outside the scientific mainstream, that he peddles mis- and disinformation, and that he\u2019s not to be trusted with the health and safety of Americans.\u201d\n> \n> Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has served on CDC and FDA vaccine advisory committees, says he was \u201csickened\u201d by the news of Kennedy being nominated for the position. He compares Kennedy being considered for the role to \u201chaving somebody who doesn\u2019t believe in gravity being the head of NASA.\u201d He criticizes Kennedy for previously indicating that he would deprioritize infectious diseases as a research focus at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n> \n> **\u201cWe are experiencing an H5N1 [bird flu] outbreak right now, and so if we remove infectious disease funding\u2014then what? I\u2019m trying to make it make sense,\u201d says Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and founder of the newsletter Your Local Epidemiologist.**\n> \n> Kennedy will face an uphill battle to win Senate confirmation. But Offit says the nomination alone is a concerning representation of a lack of trust in science. Experts worry that Kennedy could continue to spread medical misinformation as the head of HHS\u2014and that many people will believe it.\n> \n> \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance that falsehoods and rumors will be broadcast from the most powerful office in the nation, and I think this will drive confusion, anxiety, and questions that are going to have a direct negative impact on Americans who genuinely have good questions and are interested in making evidence-based health decisions,\u201d Jetelina says. \u201cMy biggest concern is the disinformation that will be amplified\u2014that is no longer on the fringes, but it will become mainstream.\u201d\n> \n> While many public health experts fear Kennedy\u2019s stances on vaccines and infectious diseases, some are more optimistic about his positions on food and nutrition. On his website, Kennedy promises to \u201cban the hundreds of food additives and chemicals that other countries have already prohibited\u201d and \u201cchange regulations, research topics, and subsidies to reduce the dominance of ultra-processed food.\u201d Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and director of the Food Is Medicine Institute at Tufts University, says Kennedy\u2019s focus on food and nutrition is \u201cpotentially very powerful to finally have some real, meaningful change in this country to address our national nutrition crisis.\u201d While other experts acknowledge that food and nutrition do need reform, they cast doubt on whether Kennedy would do so effectively, and stress the threat that he would pose to other areas of health, including vaccines.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019m going to be hopeful and be optimistic and not pre-judge what RFK Jr. might do as a Cabinet secretary and head of a major agency based on what he\u2019s done and said in the past,\u201d Mozaffarian says. \u201cI hope and assume he\u2019s going to use the best science to move forward.\u201d\n> \n> Still, a day after Trump announced the nomination, most public health experts are dismayed about what Kennedy\u2019s leadership at HHS could bring. \u201cIn short, he\u2019s not going to use science, and he\u2019s not going to do the hard work to make America healthy again,\u201d Gostin says. \u201cIn fact, I think he\u2019s going to make America ever more sick and distrustful of public health.\u201d\n\nhttps://time.com/7177027/rfk-jr-hhs-secretary-trump-public-health/\n\nKennedy is guaranteed to become the next head of Health Department since Republicans have 53 out of 100 seats in the Senate and this guy is notorious for promoting things that would cause bird flu pandemic like raw milk - and bird flu has a fatality rate of at least 54% while having a slow ramp-on period where the host is still functional and can spread the virus for weeks before going down like COVID-19 did (though I could be completely wrong on that). Doesn't that mean that 2025 is 100% guaranteed to be a start of bird flu pandemic that will cause another year-long shutdowns and/or lockdowns?",

The Senate can refuse to convict if they don't think it's valid.\n\n> Is there even any point in impeaching him a third time? What downsides would there be to impeaching him again?\n\nI don't think it would be a good idea to try to impeach him over his felonies. There would probably be a ton of backlash from people on both sides. Obviously most of the right thinks he's either completely innocent or being selectively charged for crimes that are usually ignored. The left thinks the Democrats completely dropped the ball by waiting too long to charge him, so they would view an impeachment as a pathetic attempt to get the tiniest of wins out of the whole debacle.\n\nIf he does something really bad during his presidency, then it would probably be worth it to impeach him again even if it's destined to fail.

They're very much the gold standard in journalism, but tend to be very brief (it's easier to avoid bias or even the appearance of bias, by saying less), they just print the facts as simply as possible. \n\nI like to keep an eye on The Guardian. It's a left leaning publication, but it is out of the UK and even it's writers in the US are usually Brits. I find they often give an outsider view of American politics and news. Al Jazeera is useful that way too (Arabic language world news outlet), but its coverage is often overtly hostile to the US, which can be informative in its own way. \n\nThe legacy networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) all started in the era before the 24 hour news cycle, when networks made their money from their \"prime time\" entertainment programming and saw their news hour as a public service. They do a fair job of actual reporting these days, but have drifted into doing a lot of \"human interest\" fluff, because it's cheaper to produce and they struggle to maintain audience share in the current media environment. \n\nCable news is garbage, largely bloated with punditry and argumentative dialog. There are a few respectable voices there, but not many. I recommend you avoid it. \n\nPolitical comedy can be very informative, and is more entertaining than straight news. John Oliver is an absolute treasure, and covers a lot of subjects that aren't part of the political dialog. I always enjoy the Daily Show, but it is overtly left in focus. \n\nHope that helps.",

This being the true definition of libertarian \u2014 the federal government should protect constitutional rights, military directives, necessary regulations that should apply across state lines(FDA, USDA, EPA, and a few others, albeit with their powers limited). However, where this diverges, is I believe everything else, such as extrinsic rights not explicitly given in the constitution should be at the state level.  The idea behind this is that states are large enough to have the necessary funds and abilities to run an effective government (compared to a small town of ~100 people), while still being small enough to understand the individuals who live there and the problems they face on a day to day.  \n\nWhat kind of political ideology even is this? The only thing I can find that comes close to it is pre-civil war era politics. \n\nOther political ideologies of mine:\n1. Decreased to potentially no federal tax \u2014 all federal funds should be funneled through state taxes up the chain.\n2. States operating their own military and training during peaceful periods (exception being military research, development, and high ranking generals and admin during war times).\n3. This whole idea would result in a stronger domestic economy that\u2019s less reliant on global manufacturing (without federal subsidies, states without raw resources MUST take advantage of the production chain).\n \nThanks, interested in what reddit will have to say about this",

Mercury was central to alchemical practices, where it symbolized the mutable essence of matter, as well as being associated with change and communication in mythology (e.g., the Roman god Mercury).\n\nIn the context of Stephenson\u2019s series:\n\t1.\tTransformation and Discovery: The Enlightenment era was a time of rapid scientific progress, intellectual upheaval, and societal change. Quicksilver mirrors this fluid, unstable environment where ideas and beliefs were constantly in flux.\n\t2.\tPhilosophical Dualities: Like mercury\u2019s liquid and metallic properties, the series explores dualities\u2014alchemy vs. science, old systems vs. new ones, reason vs. faith.\n\t3.\tNewton and Alchemy: Isaac Newton, a key figure in the series, was both a scientist and an alchemist. His obsession with mercury in his alchemical studies ties directly to the metaphorical and literal presence of quicksilver throughout the narrative.\n\nThus, quicksilver is not just a substance in the story but a symbol of the world shifting from old, mystical ways of understanding to new, empirical ones.

But for Lydia Echols from Texas, having her fallopian tubes removed is the price she's willing to pay to ensure her reproductive rights.\n> \n> Newsweek spoke to five women who have either undergone sterilization procedures or plan to in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's victory on November 5. They all expressed fear their reproductive choices will be taken from them under Trump's administration.\n> \n> \"If I am to be denied any rights in the next four (or more) years, I will not give them up without a fight,\" Echols said.\n> \n> Newsweek has contacted Trump's transition team, via email, for comment.\n> \n> Last week, a 39-year-old from Washington state, who did not want to be named, underwent a bilateral salpingectomy, in which her fallopian tubes were removed.\n> \n> \"I am not happy that I felt forced into a surgery I did not want to alter my body, I feel like the election tied my hands and forced me to be sterilized\u2014that is horrible,\" she told Newsweek.\n> \n> The issue of abortion and reproductive rights was a major one in this year's election. Trump, who took credit for the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, removing the constitutional right to an abortion in the country, has repeatedly said that his position is to let the states decide their own abortion laws.\n> \n> He has also said he would veto a national abortion ban, writing on Truth Social in October: \"I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of their voters (the will of the people!)\"\n> \n> But this has not quelled the fears of multiple women who, on top of being worried about access to abortion, are also concerned about whether the availability of birth control will be impacted.\n> \n> **'I Would Have Canceled the Surgery if Kamala Harris Won'**\n> \n> The woman from Washington has not told those close to her that she has been sterilized. Since she was a child, she has known she does not want children.\n> \n> She and her husband, who had a vasectomy in 2021, both felt that they had experienced too much trauma as children themselves to be the parents they wanted to be. She has also struggled with multiple health issues, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which made pregnancy risky for her.\n> \n> But \"neither of us wanted to subject me to an unnecessary surgery or jeopardize my health.\"\n> \n> \"I paid way too much attention to the vitriol Trump repeatedly spit during his previous term,\" she added, \"and am keenly aware of the people he keeps around him and in his ear, who all seem to see women as incubators and possessions to subjugate.\"\n> \n> The woman scheduled a sterilization appointment in October, \"fully planning to cancel the surgery the day after the election, assuming Kamala won.\"\n> \n> \"With Trump's victory, we quickly learned that my choice to cancel the surgery had been taken from me,\" she said. \"We both believed that I had no choice but to proceed to ensure that I can protect my health should I be assaulted during a Trump presidency, should my husband's vasectomy fail and/or should my hormonal birth control become inaccessible.\"\n> \n> She added: \"This isn't a wanted procedure, but one of necessity due to the politics and subjugation coming our way.\"\n> \n> **'This is the Time to Prepare and Be Prudent'**\n> \n> Echols said she had \"been wanting to be child-free for a very long time\" and is planning to get a bilateral salpingectomy with an endometrial ablation\u2014when the lining of the uterus is destroyed. Her doctor approved the procedures earlier this month.\n> \n> \"The next four years will go in the way of the Christian nationalists if what I have seen and heard and experienced is to be believed,\" she said. \"Anyone who has...taken a look at the social tirade Donald Trump encouraged and employed during his years in the office knows that this is the time to prepare and be prudent for what could yet come.\"\n> \n> \"I'd rather be safe than sorry,\" she added.\n> \n> The former teacher also said she wished she could \"give [her] fertility to someone who desperately wanted to have children.\"\n> \n> \"I am sad that I cannot take away the pain of infertility of another person who desires to have children,\" she said.\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

She thought she would start asking doctors about sterilization when she turns 27, when it will be time to get her intrauterine device (IUD) removed.\n> \n> But, after November 5, she said it became a \"now\" issue and has set up a consultation for December 5.\n> \n> \"I have no idea what Trump will and won't follow through on,\" Wood said, \"I was already upset when Roe v Wade was overturned.

I refuse to be a person that ends up not being able to get medical care just because I own a uterus with some cells growing in it.\"\n> \n> She was referring to several women who have died while pregnant in states where abortion laws restrict when doctors can intervene.\n> \n> In September, Amber Nicole Thurman, 28, was named the first \"preventable\" abortion death, when investigative journalism site ProPublica reported that Thurman experienced a rare complication after taking abortion pills and died during emergency surgery in August 2022.\n> \n> Georgia's law banning most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, labeled the LIFE Act, took effect on July 20, 2022. Thurman had passed that mark when she discovered she was pregnant, records shared with ProPublica showed.\n> \n> The new law also made performing a dilation and curettage (D&C), a procedure to remove tissue from the uterus following an abortion or miscarriage, a felony offense with medical exceptions.\n> \n> Georgia's maternal mortality review committee, which includes 10 doctors, concluded that there was a \"good chance\" that Thurman's death could likely have been prevented if the D&C had been provided earlier.\n> \n> **'I Am Choosing Me'**\n> \n> Eden Ixora, 25, who lives in Florida, is also worried about sexual assault. She made a \"firm decision\" last month that she will get a bilateral salpingectomy.\n> \n> \"All the political noise is what really finalized my decision for me,\" she said. \"It wasn't just Trump winning but rather all the online rhetoric that followed.\"\n> \n> She cited nationalist podcaster Nick Fuentes' viral clip, telling women \"your body, my choice\" and the \"jokes\" about it as an example of this.\n> \n> Newsweek has contacted Fuentes, who has said the comment was \"sort of a joke\" and a critique of the pro-choice movement and modern feminism, via direct message on X, for comment.\n> \n> \"For me it was a call to action,\" Ixora said. \"A need to get this locked in so I don't have to live in fear that at any moment some random guy can completely destroy my life.

But here is what I am seeing in the masses of the public and I hope someone can clear this up for me. \nThe news for me first arose when Gaza invaded a festival taking about approximately 800 civilians as hostages. I know the history goes way way beyond that but since that\u2019s the aspect that I don\u2019t understand, I\u2019m gonna start there. As expected Israel started counter attacks to free the hostages. I know the attacks go way beyond just freeing the civilians and is by all means above any measures that can be justified to free civilians. But although these attacks are harsh and way beyond good morals. I see basically everyone completely siding with Gaza. \nNow, as I see it, neither side is innocent here, Israel\u2019s attacks are brutal and are impacting the civilians of Gaza way too heavily. But the initial attack against the civilians of Israel is an inhuman act as well. I don\u2019t know how people can deem Gaza/Hamas innocent and side completely with either side of the story? Both are wrong and I feel like people siding with Gaza are completely disregarding the 800 civilian hostages and no historic events can justify the attacks on innocent people on either side.\n\nSorry for the bad grammar. English is not my native language. Thank you all for your answers in advance. With this post I don\u2019t mean to offend anyone siding with either side of this discussion, it\u2019s just genuine interest.",

And the numbers were 251 hostages taken and 1,180 killed (about 800 civilians and the rest were security forces).\n\n>As expected Israel started counter attacks to free the hostages.\n\nThis was not the objective. Israel counter-attacked to destroy Hamas. Israel essentially sees this as a war against Hamas. Compare it to the US invasion of Europe during WWII. We didn't stop once France was liberated. We went into Germany to destroy the Nazi regime.\n\n>Israel\u2019s attacks are brutal and are impacting the civilians of Gaza way too heavily\n\nThis is where things get very complicated. In every military conflict there's bound to be civilian casualties. I've heard (but not actually seen the data) that Israel's civilian death rate is actually *low* compared to other *urban* conflicts.\n\n>I don\u2019t know how people can deem Gaza/Hamas innocent and side completely with either side of the story?\n\nThe pro-Gaza side's argument is that Israel is oppressing the Palestinians in such as a way as to justify armed resistance. While Israel was not occupying Gaza at the time, they effectively have a blockade on Gaza and control how much food and other material gets in, they have restrictions on fishing, etc. But that doesn't justify attacking civilian targets.\n\nI think the best way to look at this is two countries at war, though this is made far more complicated by the fact that the Palestinians aren't recognized as their own nation.\n\nWhen it comes to proportionality, there's two important concepts to understand. One is criminal proportionality where the offending party is punished in proportion to their crime committed. The other is proportionality in war. This isn't a tit-for-tat proportionality, but rather we measure proportionality relative to the military objective. So the question isn't \"Did Israel kill more civilians than Hamas?\" but rather \"Did Israel kill more civilians than it needed to in order to achieve its military objective in destroying Hamas?\"\n\nThink about the war with Japan. That started with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. We didn't just go and attack Japanese ships until the numbers had been evened. We continued all the way up to bombing Tokyo and dropping two atomic bombs in order to defeat the entirety of Japan. (There's debate about whether dropping the bombs was justified, but the framework is thinking about in terms of the military objective, not comparing it to the numbers that died at Pearl Harbor.)\n\nI'm far from an expert and can't say one way or the other to what extent Israel has gone too far in trying to pursue its military objective. But I can say that if we view this in a framework of war, Hamas's attack on October 7th was in no way justified. The civilian deaths weren't collateral damage in a justified military operation. Hamas's target was civilians and there was no legitimate military objective.",

Given that it's a request, state/local authorities aren't obligated to honor it. If they do choose to honor it, then they're potentially opening themselves up to a lawsuit if it turns out that the person is a US citizen for example and they're being held past the point when they should have been released:\n\n> A federal court has ruled that federal immigration officials and the state of Rhode Island violated the Constitution in detaining a U.S. citizen without probable cause while the federal government investigated her immigration status.\n\n> The American Civil Liberties Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of Ada Morales, who was born in Guatemala and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1995. In 2009, when she was arrested by Rhode Island authorities for an unrelated state charge, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued an immigration hold against her. A judge had ordered her release, but the state Department of Corrections held her for an additional 24 hours solely because of the ICE detainer, and even after she repeatedly told officials she was a U.S. citizen and offered to show them her naturalization certificate and passport.\n\n> https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/court-finds-federal-immigration-officials-and-state-rhode-island-violated\n\nICE is free to pursue this person and take on the liability themselves when they wrongfully arrest a US citizen. States/localities are under no obligation to do that. Choosing not to assist isn't anywhere close to the same thing as interfering.",

Which, Cabinet aside, includes the Presidential power to hire and fire any military or civil service worker he wants, based on the criteria only he chooses (e.g. perceived loyalty), rather than any objective merit or following any system enacted by Congress, and not restricted in that matter by any other Congressional laws, either (e.g. the Civil Rights Act), under the same argument that no statutory law can abridge a power the President has been directly granted by the Constitution.\n\nThis would destroy the modern American bureaucratic state, which would allow Trump and his cronies to rebuild it in their image. To him, it's exactly the \"drain the swamp\" he promised. The fact the Federal government is irrepairably damaged as a result, to him, is a feature, not a bug. His supporters want a return to the States' Compact Theory (where the Federal government is powerless to enforce civil rights or anything else in individiual states against their will), and this is the closest they can get to it. They know they can't *formally* get individual states to have the right to nullify Federal law, so their goal is to simply make the Fed be too weak to enforce it, especially in areas of civil and human rights.\n\nThis is why Trump fired those 18 inspectors so quick. He knew it was blatantly against the law, but he wants it to go through the courts and get that law stricken down. And given the SC has just ruled the President has absolute immunity for Constitutional powers, there's a good chance he'll win, which will be the biggest change in American internal governance since 1883, and not for the better.",

Musk and his henchpersons are now in control of SS, Medicare payments, grants, making false claims, and all taxpayer info.\n\nDoes anyone know if marches are being organized for Feb 5?\n\nfrom Heather Cox Richardson:  \"But then, yesterday, Elon Musk forced the resignation of David A. Lebryk, the highest-ranking career official at the Treasury Department. Lebryk had been at Treasury since 1989 and had risen to become the person in charge of the U.S. government payment system that disburses about $6 trillion a year through Social Security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, contracts, grants, salaries for federal government workers, tax refunds, and so on, essentially managing the nation\u2019s checkbook.\n\nAccording to Jeff Stein, Isaac Arnsdorf, and Jacqueline Alemany of the\u00a0*Washington Post*, Musk\u2019s team wanted access to the payment system. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) demanded answers from Trump\u2019s new Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, warning that \u201cthese payment systems simply cannot fail, and any politically-motivated meddling in them risks severe damage to our country and the economy. I am deeply concerned that following the federal grant and loan freeze earlier this week, these officials associated with Musk may have intended to access these payment systems to illegally withhold payments to any number of programs. I can think of no good reason why political operators who have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the law would need access to these sensitive, mission-critical systems.\u201d\n\nNow, though, with Musk\u2019s people at the computers that control the nation\u2019s payment system, they can simply stop whatever payments they want to.\n\nWyden continued by reminding Bessent that the press has reported that Musk has previously been \u201cdenied a high-level clearance to access the government\u2019s most sensitive secrets. I am concerned that Musk\u2019s enormous business operation in China\u2014a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems\u2014endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk.\u201d\n\nThis afternoon, Wyden posted that he has been told that Bessent has given the Department of Government Efficiency full access to the system. \u201cSocial Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it.\u201d\n\nJosh Marshall of\u00a0*Talking Points Memo*\u00a0posted: \u201cThis is more or less like taking the gold from Fort Knox and putting it in Elons basement. Anyone who gets a check from soc sec or anything else\\[,\\] he can cut it off or see all y\\[ou\\]r personal and financial data.\u201d Pundit Stuart Stevens called it \u201cthe most significant data leak in cyber history.\u201d",

Since 2003, $2.7 *trillion* in improper payments had been made.\n\nIs it possible that this is just a plot to get Musk people's data so that he can sell it to China? Maybe.\n\nBut it's also possible that he wants access to the data to find better ways to detect fraud and abuse.

This isn't good for American consumers because it just raises prices for things that we may have no interest in producing domestically or even may not be capable of producing.

The administration still hasn\u2019t really cleared up exactly what DOGE is and what their authority is. During the transition it seemed like they were just going to be an advisory panel but now it\u2019s an actual group within the federal government that apparently has authority to look at whatever they want. They also haven\u2019t really been showing their work - they claim they found billions in fraud at USAID but to my knowledge haven\u2019t actually shown that outside of expenditures they just disagreed with and weren\u2019t fraud.\n\n\n\n3. It appears a lot of the staff at DOGE are early-mid 20 something\u2019s who have just worked with Musk before.

Most major outlets have some clearly identifiable political leaning, even though many will swear up and down that they are nonpartisan.

Many people are barely involved in the voting process and therefore would be unlikely to engage with a donation process. Companies can simply raise the amount of money being donated to match the extra influence that citizens would gain, and it does nothing to stop dark money groups from spending unlimited amounts of money on indirect campaign donations (ad campaigns not sponsored by the candidate, events, outreach, etc.).\n\n>But the point of my question was to ask what people who want to overturn Citizens United would propose.

Think it makes more sense to extrapolate how many people are engaged from the average election cycle. On top of that, it's not going to be even close to a 1:1 ratio of voters:donators. Yes people in swing states may make up some of the difference, but theres already a lot of variables here to be so certain. I'd also add that it doesn't really fix the problem so much as it kicks the can up stream. There will still be tons of dark money campaigns to influence how people spend their donation voucher, and dark money will still have a significantly larger seat at the table than someone with a donation voucher. Last thing I'll say is that it's sort of a nonstarter solution anyway because federally funding that would never pass through Congress. Overall, I like this idea a lot but I don't think it's as fleshed out as you're implying it to be. \n\n>I asked because people here routinely criticize Citizens United but without articulating what rule they'd prefer in its place.\n\nFair enough, but myself and one other poster have both answered the question and articulated our position and your response was kind of just to shoot those things down as non starters, even though they were within the bounds of what you asked.

Had Trump been held accountable for the insurrection, then there's no way he'd win in November.  It's why I continuously say that it's the Supreme Court's fault as to why Trump's chances of winning the election are looking good right now.

Since students can pretty much get however much money universities ask for, price sensitivity was greatly diminished and schools could rapidly raise tuition. Imagine if every American was guaranteed a loan for $100,000 that could only be spent on cars what that would do to the price of cars. And all this happened when college was still very affordable. And actually, college is still very affordable if you go to community college for two years, then finish at a state university, and make use of subsidies like Pell grants.\n\nWith housing, it's mostly an issue of supply and demand. Our housing stock is pretty low, and there's a lot going into it, but a big issue is still hangover from the 2008 crash and the slowdown in new construction that followed. On the demand side, it's driven in large part by people moving to cities and it's a whole lot faster to move to New York or San Francisco than it is to build new housing there. Then you've also got things like our previously very low interest rates which both drive up demand and make people willing to pay more (similar to how the availability of loans drove up tuition rates).",

This is only for the first year of operation, If the business succeeds for 5-10+ years it's paying taxes for all those years, so long-term it should be a net benefit to the federal deficit. \n\nThe 25K, I'd be totally fine with this having an income cap as well, Just like they do on the electric car tax credit. So let's say you qualify for the 25K only if your income is below 150k, or 200k joint filers. Owning a home is one of the best ways to build wealth in our country, so moving somebody from being a renter to an owner, hopefully allows that person/family to move into the middle class and when you expand the middle class you increase spending and their tax contribution. This one is less clear cut and probably does cost us a little bit, but at the same time taxes on billionaires and corporations is at the lowest level it's been since before the 1970s,. Kamela also plans to increase corporate tax rates 28% from 21%, and that could hopefully offset this. We have places like Walmart which we as taxpayers subsidized their non-living wage pay. Do a search and you'll see US taxpayers are providing subsidies of 6.2 billion dollars to Walmart workers. When you factor in the indirect tax credit that we give to Walmart workers, Walmart's effective tax rate is well below 21%. I looked it up in Walmart paid an income tax of $5.7  billion in 2023, and then us taxpayers subsidize their workers by 6.2 billion (sorry this again is a tangent but I thought it was interesting)\n\nThe $6,000 tax credit you said you liked so I'll leave that one as is. I'd say this one should also have an income limit to qualify.",

It would be a net benefit if the policy somehow helped new businesses get off the ground, but it doesn't. It only helps businesses that have already reached the point of profitability. The problem is that it doesn't help them to reach profitability in the first place, just cuts them a tax break once they get there.\n\nFor the housing subsidy, I don't see how any of what you said changes the fact that it adds to the deficit. You might think this is a perfectly fine thing to raise the deficit to fund, but it still raises the deficit.\n\n>The $6,000 tax credit you said you liked so I'll leave that one as is\n\nI don't think you'll find me saying that anywhere in my comment.\n\nBut, it does add to the deficit.\n\nI really don't see how you can say \"It's selfishness that caused the deficit\" when really it's not, and then argue that people shouldn't be so selfish and should instead support policies that would increase the deficit.",

And I did concede that this one would cost us money but at the same time she also proposed corporate tax increase from 21% to 28%. \n\nSorry I confused you with the other thread regarding the $6,000 tax credit for new borns. Long-term this is important, we have a declining population with the exception of immigration, and these things like social security and Medicare funding are only going to get worse because we won't have as many people paying into the tax system to fund those programs. So yeah the benefit there is 20 years down the line and hopefully there's more people paying into the system. We should want the current generation to have a lot of children, who are educated and solve future problems and painted the tax system. \n\nThe reason why I say it's selfish but then also pays back into the system, Is because I people largely see policies and programs through the lens of their selfish bias. You don't want to pay now in higher taxes so when you see these programs you find ways to spin them in ways that you can justify why you should not paying for them. Same goes for those of us who want these programs because we want to build a better world, though we're willing to try things and fail rather than instinctively reject everything by default because it costs us something now.",

If the Constitution says the President can do it, that carried with it the implication that it's legal for him to do so, and neither federal nor state law can override that.\n\nWhen the power comes from a federal statute, there's a strong presumption of immunity.

SS taxes are applicable to all earned income, excl. capital gains, so idk why you're acting like billionaires are not subject to SS.\n\nlet's assume the average american makes $100k/yr, and assume effective tax rate is 20% (obviously both of these numbers are inflated to support the leftist argument). all $100k is subject to SS taxes, so the total effective tax rate is 26%, so the average american pays $26k in federal taxes per year.\n\nin order to exceed the raw amount on long term capital gains (we're using long term instead of short term because, again, it favors the leftist argument), a billionaire would have to liquidate an amount that would yield more than 26k/0.02 = 130k in gains. at 10% annualized returns, that's about liquidating 1.3m in assets, which is multiple orders of magnitude less than what occurs in reality, so billionaires pay far more in federal taxes per year at a raw amount (admittedly, whether or not you want to compare raw amounts or rates is a separate argument, however). i'm not even including the other taxes that are paid here\n\nalso stocks are paper money unless it's liquidated, so i really have no clue what you're even getting at. if you don't liquidate, you don't pay capital gains tax, whether you're a billionaire holding 1million shares of S&P500 or a homeless guy\n\n  \nthe point is that blanket misleading comments like \"\"Billionaires pay less taxes than I, an average working class person, do\" are asinine",

We can debate the merits of that, but we both agree it's true.\n\nSo even though billionaires have acquired billions of dollars worth of wealth in the past few years, very little of it is technically \"income\", and therefore is totally untaxed.  \n\nEven without liquidating that wealth, it can be leveraged to purchase things anyway.  For example, Musk leveraged billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock to buy Twitter, but did not pay taxes on it, because he didn't *sell* it.  \n\nIf billionaires can manage to go their whole lives without technically selling their assets, when those assets are inherited, all capital gains are reset to zero.

This is the second  time she has overstayed on her VISA .  She did this 20 years ago as well. Im not sure why they let her back a second time.  Im just curious. Is it a known fact that Trump won't deport if he wins the election? Im just confused. Her brother tried sponsoring her, and she was rejected because she overstayed her visa 20 years ago.  Totally puzzled.",

Given the chance, you should just ask this woman why she would support Donald Trump given his stance on undocumented immigrants and stated desire to deport them, his treatment of women (found liable for sexual assault in court), and especially as she is not going to be able to vote in the election. There could be an interesting conversation there?\n\nYour post also touches on a little understood reality of illegal immigration in the US. The majority of undocumented residents here come into the country on valid student, work and tourist visas, then overstay the terms of that visa. The last couple years of stress at our Southern border is an anomaly and not the common source of illegal immigration.",

If you make an election model that uses only the highest-rated polls (like [this one](https://polls.votehub.us/)) then the perceived tightening of the race disappears, though it's still a very close race.\n\nMy question is, which of those models-- one that just uses the polls we know for sure are accurate and unbiased, or one that uses all available data-- should we trust?

The resulting lawsuits were financially damaging enough that almost all manufacturers stopped making pertussis vaccines. It just wasn't worth it given the low margins on vaccines. When people stopped being able to get the vaccine for their kids, we collectively decided that it was better to have the pertussis vaccine around, which meant the system had to change to make it financially viable for the manufacturers to start making them again without being sued into oblivion every time somebody convinced the population that vaccines cause autism, brain damage, death, or whatever other malady that people try to blame on vaccines.",

Some of these have proven health hazards, the vast majority are mostly inert. Whatever - let's say he actually bans the potentially dangerous ones. Now what? Well, it's really easy for a big corporation to substitute the old dye or additive for a new one that is slightly different yet functionally identical. Nothing changes for them. The trump administration get to claim victory while not doing any significant harm to big business.\n\nYou know what he *doesn't* mention? High fructose corn syrup, saturated fat, ultra processed foods with absurd caloric densities and no real nutrients. You know, the stuff that is actually really bad for you. Nothing about it! In fact he says that fruit snacks are a \"healthy snack\". Seriously? He's ignoring all the actual big problems of american nutrition *because* removing them would be very bad for business. He knows that, Trump knows that and the corpos know that. If you flat out ban high fructose corn syrup (and other similar ingredients) suddenly all the production lines that have been designed to pump it through pipes are useless, as an example.

The left has pointed out that a lot of people close to Trump were involved in it and use that to claim Trump is just playing coy. It's not very good evidence though, as any big project like that is naturally going to have people very interested in policy on it, and policy-minded people from the Trump administration of course wanted to continue doing that sort of work during the Biden administration. Economic Policy Institute (a left-leaning think tank) is headed by Obama's chief economist. Also at the top of EPI's leadership is Liz Shuler, President of AFL-CIO which endorsed Harris and she spoke at the 2024 DNC. Is this evidence that Biden secretly had EPI's policies as his own agenda? No. It's evidence that Washington is a small world.\n\nThe left also argues that even if Trump doesn't like Project 2025, many of the people he appoints do and will try to adopt its policies. That's a more compelling argument, but maybe only for smaller issues where the President isn't going to be directly involved. Big decisions are still going to come from the President.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Trump has brought in America First Policy Institute to advise his transition team, not Heritage Foundation, and Trump has publicly criticized some of Project 2025's ideas.\n\nSo is it what Trump and his team are going to try to implement? There's reason to think maybe, and I think better reason to think probably not. But also it's *900 pages*, so any conservative agenda is bound to overlap with part of it.\n\nNow none of that answers what Project 2025 actually is in terms of substance. And again, it's 900 pages, so that's a long complicated answer.\n\nPerhaps the biggest part of the agenda is to replace a lot of career bureaucrats with political appointees. The left is naturally concerned with politicizing the executive departments and losing people with technical expertise. On the other hand, the executive branch is inherently political and everyone there works for the President.\n\nThe rest of it is a laundry list of conservative policies ranging from rather moderate conservative positions (reducing the corporate tax rate from 21% to 18%) to more far right and fringe positions often described as a Christian nationalist agenda (such as banning pornography).",

Idk how much more Dems could meaningfully do to \u201ccall out\u201d Fox. Plus, it would be incredibly ironic if they began campaigning on fake news.",

For one thing, she's the candidate; Carlson was just a hype man. But the more important thing is that it built into the narrative about her being a total fraud. She ~~called~~ strongly implied that Biden is a racist, and then went on Colbert later and laughed it off saying \"It was a debate!\" No, it's an accusation of racism which the average person considers to be a very serious thing, and they're tired of how casual people have gotten with the term.\n\nThen that fits in with stuff like her position on fracking. She campaigned against it, then said Biden doesn't support banning fracking, then said she made her position clear previously referring to her answer that Biden doesn't support a ban. Her whole campaign was marred by people having no sense of who she is and what she stands for. I bet for a good number of people, her comment at the debate soured their opinion of her.\n\nNow in 2020, yeah, I don't think voters cared what Harris said about him.",

Few people are going to tune in to see a campaign speech for a member of Congress that's not in their district or even in their state.\n\nI think the smarter thing to do would be a media blitz, similar to how Trump and Vance did a lot of podcasts (plus The View for Vance). They need to get a unified message for the party and a vision for the country, and go on places like Pod Save America, Club Random, and (of course) The Joe Rogan Experience.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws for the Democrats is that they've ceded pretty much the entire realm of both debate and longform discussions to the right.

It can't be criminal to exercise those powers because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. Congress can't pass a law that overrides the Constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to free speech, the Constitution doesn't give the President power do anything like criminalize criticism of him.

He would not have immunity for acts that he's not Constitutionally authorized to take.\n\nAnd if you're inclined to respond that all bets are off with the current Supreme Court, then know that this SCOTUS is probably the strongest we've ever had on free speech.",

You can find lots of people opining about how our system of checks and balances, the courts and congress, will act as restraints on Trump's worst impulses.

Trump attempted an insurrection and the overthrow of an election, and has suffered no real consequences for those crimes. For a greedy, amoral, habitual criminal like Donald Trump, that has to look like an open invitation to do as he pleases. In his first term, he largely staffed his administration with Republican insiders, people who were part of the establishment and knew how government worked. Those people generally resisted his worst efforts at overreach and abuse of power. Those people are gone, and he is clearly staffing with like minded miscreants and yes-men, this time. Most of them have no experience in government, no interest in maintaining normal functions of bureaucracy, and even less interest in benefiting the average American in any way. \n\nTrump has hired (so far) 14 other billionaires to work in his administration. That should scare the shit out of most Americans. Even if his raging nonsense about Greenland or Canada evaporates like most of his threats and promises do, best case scenario, I think we should expect the Trump administration to engage in a wholesale rape of the American government. We will likely see very lucrative deals made to \"privatize\" government functions and property, much the way the Oligarchs in Russia did after the fall of the Soviet Union. All those billionaires didn't set aside their financial interests to fix housing or poverty in America.

I'm not going to try to convince you that Trump is either good or bad for the country, just that nothing as enormously bad as an authoritarian state or the Holocaust is going to happen. By all accounts, Trump weakened the presidency in his first term. He deregulated the economy and reduced federal oversight in education, environmental policy, and other areas. And now, that's his biggest platform for the second term. He's creating a department made specifically to slash federal programs, moving federal jobs outside of D.C., is dismantling the Department of Education, and made broad promises of reducing spending, among other things. Agree or disagree with these policies, but they work in the opposite direction of forming a dictatorship.\n\nIt's reasonable to be concerned about the state of politics, but remember that it is never as apocalyptic as engagement-hungry social media sites and corporate media outlets make it seem.",

Trump then tried to conceal Cohen's crime by disguising the reimbursements as payments for legal services that never occurred, because accurately recording what the payments were actually for would have revealed Cohen's campaign finance crime. The intent to conceal Cohen's crime bumps the falsification of business records up to a felony.",

I agree they\u2019re going in fast and furious lol and while that may look or even be undesirable by most, I think that simply is a product of his personality. Those who like and prize themselves on efficiency tend to try to get things done as quickly as possible to maximize their time, especially because they only have a year and a half to get this done and I\u2019m not sure what all their department is tasked with so I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re being speedy simply because they are able to and because they like it or if it\u2019s due to a time constraint. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s good or bad, I just think it might be what they\u2019re doing. Additionally I was a bit confused because I looked it up and some places seem to say that through executive order, a president can state where the funds should and shouldn\u2019t go depending on the president\u2019s general agenda, however I also saw things saying he needs Congress approval for this so I\u2019m not entirely sure which one is correct. \n\n2.) I do think there\u2019s some things USAID uses their funds for genuine good and helpful things, but I do think other things were simply directed towards because it\u2019s what the previous presidents agenda and desires were. Some members of Congress were even saying THEY weren\u2019t aware this is where the funds were going which sounds to me like Congress DOESTN get a say in where the money goes and if that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m not sure that Donald Trump withdrawing those funds and directing them elsewhere according to his agenda is illegal or unconstitutional either since Biden seemed to do the same. \n\n3.) I\u2019ll try to cut this shorter than it is and address the other points here. The bunch of kids things I understand but at the same time I don\u2019t think age or degree always determines one\u2019s intelligence or ability to do something.

Congress appropriates funds for certain and the Executive Branch has to spend those funds. But, the Executive* also has a lot of discretion. (*Executive referring to the the branch generally, both the President and the bureaucracy.)\n\nFor instance, is Congress appropriates $10 billion for foreign aid health programs, the Executive can decide to spend some of that on funding gender transitions procedures in one country, or mosquito nets in another country. But, if Congress appropriates $1 billion for HIV medications in the Congo, then that's where it has to go, though there may still be discretion on which medicines to buy, what organizations to partner with, etc. It all depends on how specific Congress has been with its instructions.\n\n>which sounds to me like Congress DOESTN get a say in where the money goes and if that\u2019s the case\n\nCongress *does* get a say in these things. However, Congress often *chooses* to delegate that discretion to the Executive, because Congress is better at big picture stuff, not micromanaging the government.\n\nHowever, several members of Congress have complained that when USAID staff were asked for more transparency on the spending, they were stonewalled and couldn't get answers. They've referenced some hearings, but I've been unable to find those on CSPAN to see just what exactly went down.\n\n>however, tons of people we aren\u2019t even aware of have access to our private info in government and nobody seems to care about that so that one seems hypocritical\n\nThis is kind of a mixed bag. The talk about *unelected(!)* DOGE people having access really does miss the mark because there's like 100,000 Treasury Department employees, none of them are elected, and only about 6 go through Senate confirmation. The government is always run by unelected bureaucrats.\n\nThat said, most people also had a lot more confidence in the bureaucracy to be professional and apolitical. Jobs would have specific qualifications, there'd be a competitive hiring process, new hires would go through job training, etc. DOGE is a total break from the norm. These are hand-picked operatives going in with a very specific political agenda.",

They have a lot to do, they probably don\u2019t have the time to go through and vote on each and every place/reason for funds to be spent. \n\nI will say the lack of total transparency as well as potential lack of security clearance from the doge team is a valid reason to be a little skeptical and anxious about what\u2019s going on. However, those conducting or planning on conducting criminal activity generally don\u2019t broadcast who they are and what they\u2019re currently doing. What I mean is that if Elon Musk was planning on doing shady stuff, it would be rather stupid of him to make himself known as head of this agency.

My issue is, if the government is corrupt and they have been doing some shady things, I actually would feel better about a 3rd party group going in and conducting an \u201caudit\u201d instead of someone from the government because a group in the government will just cover up the corruption and shady activities.

Musk was \"appointed\" by President trump, to head an agency that does not actually exist, has not been funded by Congress, and has employed people who are accessing secure government computer networks, but have never received any kind of security clearance or had a background check conducted by the DOJ.\n\nThe current and most obvious objection to their actions is that they have stopped the function of a number of government agencies, and halted the use of funds that Congress has passed laws to allocate to certain sources. Musk is operating on Presidential authority, and the President has some leeway in moving funds around within the government, but he has no authority (as spelled out in the Constitution) to interfere with laws passed by Congress and funds allocated by Congress. \n\nTrump and Musk claim that his goal is to reduce government waste and corruption. Yet his first efforts were aimed at USAID, an organization that accounts for less than 1% of Federal spending. That organization has been gutted, and is largely now completely dysfunctional. \n\nMusk and his team now have access to the records of all Federal monetary disbursements, including Social Security, Veterans benefits, and income tax returns (which means, the details of most Americans financial records), but have given no reason for why they would need access to those records. \n\nCuriously, while doing that, Musk and Trump have stopped all work at the Consumer Protection Bureau (these are the people who regulate banks to keep them from charging you all kinds of outrageous fees, remove faulty products from retail stores, etc.).\n\nFinally, the DOGE Squad is not operating in a vacuum. While all of that is happening, Donald Trump is passing Executive Orders at an unprecedented rate. Among them was a freeze on all Federal hiring, while he is simultaneously offering Federal employees a \"buyout\" (currently paused by the courts). He is rapidly downsizing the number of experienced and competent employees working in Federal government, some of whom work in vitally important positions, like air traffic controllers in the FAA, CIA employees and FBI workers. \n\nThe fact that Elon Musk's companies receive billions in subsidies every year from the Federal government, and Musk now has a stranglehold on who gets money from the Federal government, should be the kind of conflict of interest that concerns all Americans.",

These people view anyone who doesn't give Israel the unlimited right to retaliate as being \"anti-Israel\" and view things like October 7th as proof of what happens when Israel *tolerates* the existence of certain Palestinian groups, never mind non-Israeli Arabs in the land as a whole.

Despite multiple attempts over the past couple of decades to prove that this is a significant issue in our elections, nobody has been able to find more than a handful of cases per election. As a result, voter ID seems to be a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist.\n\nSecond, it's been repeatedly proven that there are a significant number of eligible voters who don't have a form of ID that's valid for voting, so voter ID laws mean those people won't be able to vote unless they're able to get an ID (which many can't). On top of that, the party that's pushing for voter ID laws is also well known for wanting to defund the agencies that provide IDs, meaning those agencies have to close locations, cut staff, cut open hours, etc. all of which makes it even harder to get an ID.\n\nGiven that voter ID laws would likely stop no more than a handful of in-person voter impersonation fraud cases and disenfranchise many thousands of eligible voters in the process, it seems like a nonsensical policy.",

Low-income whites are more likely to live in rural areas or small towns, while low-income African-Americans tend to live in urban areas and can get around by walking or public transportation.\n2. Despite any added difficulty, low-income whites basically have to go through the trouble of getting a driver's license out of necessity in order to be able to go into town for groceries or get to work. Since most of them get a driver's license as a necessity, they can vote by default.\n3. Low-income white people are far more likely to own a home and stay in one place for a long time. Low-income minorities who live in urban areas are more likely to rent and move around a lot. Every move increases the chances of losing vital documents, and changing addresses means more work to keep IDs up to date.\n4. There are African-Americans alive today who were born in the Jim Crow South and were never issued a birth certificate due to discriminatory policies in place at the time.

Does that make state governments racist?\n\nThere's no right to a job. There is a right to vote. And like I said, it's possible to get a job with ID that isn't valid for voting.\n\n> No you didn't.  You may not have remembered showing them your ID as it's such a common practice but you did not rent an apartment without an ID\n\nIt's a house, not an apartment, and I promise you that I didn't show my ID at any point and neither did my wife. My wife's job makes her a very desirable tenant in this town, and my wife had previously rented from a different landlord who highly recommended her to our current landlord. I met with the landlord once to look at the house, we agreed on rent/utilities/security deposit, I texted him our legal names to put on the lease (still have the text in my phone), etc. Never showed him ID or anything.\n\n> It's 100% accurate if you want a free bus pass.\n\nLike I said, it depends where you live. Buses are different in different places.\n\n> You can look it up in any city/state.\n\nOkay, I already told you that I can ride the city bus with my university employee ID. That's not a valid ID for voting. University students can also ride the city bus with only their student IDs, but many of them aren't eligible to vote, so they obviously don't have IDs valid for voting.\n\n> Not hard to get a birth certificate at all, whomever keeps feeding you this nonsense is misinforming you.\n\nI'd like to hear how you would go about getting a birth certificate if you were born in the 1950s and your birth was never registered because of racist policies. I promise you that it isn't an easy task proving when and where you were born so that you can be issued a birth certificate.\n\n> Lastly, you need an ID to get into college to get these school IDs you keep talking about\n\nNon-citizens and out-of-state residents can get into college. They somehow manage to get into college with IDs that aren't valid for voting in the state where the college is located. I don't think that you're understanding that there are IDs that aren't valid for voting that can be used to do all of the things you're talking about.",

I recently proved where I live to the government with a utility bill and my signed lease, not an official ID. The point of voter ID is just to prove that I am who I claim I am, not where I live. That's why passports are valid voter IDs despite the fact that they contain no information about where I live on them.\n\n> There is a right to keep and bear arms yet you need an ID to keep and bear arms\n\nYou don't need an ID to keep and bear arms. You need an ID to buy arms in most scenarios. If you buy arms and then lose your ID, you don't suddenly lose the right to have your guns.\n\n> Free legal services are offered anyone in this situation.  Simple Google will get you hooked up with folks who will do it for free\n\nEven if that is true, it still takes a lot of time and is an arduous process. Time is money.\n\n> If you aren't a resident of California you aren't allowed to vote in California elections.  Simply going to school in a state doesn't make you a resident of that state.\n\nThat's true, but as an example, I went to school in NC and had a Texas ID. After I graduated, I continued living in NC while I searched for a job, which took several months. At that point I was an official resident of NC despite having a Texas ID, and I was eligible to vote there. This was before NC implemented voter ID laws, so I was able to register and vote while still holding a Texas ID because I had proof I was a resident.",

There's no requirement that you officially \"register\" to become a resident. You officially become a resident the moment you start living in a place with the intention of establishing a home there. People aren't actually required to get an ID at all unless they need to drive. People without IDs are still official residents of where they live.\n\n> You were actually breaking the law if you did this more than thirty days.\n\nEhh, it wasn't so black and white, but even if I was breaking the law for not getting things switched over in time, it didn't change the fact that I was a resident and had a right to vote there. I didn't vote illegally.\n\n> You likely voted illegally as you weren't an official resident until you changed your ID\n\nThat's not how it works. You have to officially be a resident before you can get your ID changed. The timer on the \"thirty days\" thing starts when you officially become a resident. Getting the ID switched isn't what makes you a resident.\n\nFor example, from my current state's website says you have 60 days from when you become a resident to switch your license over:\n\n> When you become a resident of Indiana, you have 60 days to obtain an Indiana driver's license if you hold a valid driver's license from another state.\n\n> https://www.in.gov/bmv/licenses-permits-ids/new-indiana-residents/",

We've established that proof of where you live can be established with a combination of documents like utility bills, lease, paystubs, etc. that show name and address. Then it's a matter of proving that you're the same person named on those documents. At that point it's irrelevant what your proof of identity does or doesn't say about where you live. It's already been established where you live by the first set of documentation. An out-of-state ID should be accepted for proof of identity at this step.

While 2020 can be partially excused due to stuff like COVID, getting two national elections \"wrong\" in a row mean the polling data is more discounted than usual. Reports on things like how Americans are responding to phone polls less and less are not helping. Even as late as 2020 you'd be the norm and the others viewed as wishcasters.\n\n2. There have been weird countervailing factors. Biden has been much better at fundraising over the last five years (although allegedly Trump might finally be learning how to make money). The Biden Decline narrative has been matched with or to a degree even replaced by the Trump decline. The economy is improving and Biden is making moves on immigration to blunt Trump there. More importantly, Trump is doing strange things that no winning candidate has done in decades, or perhaps ever, like scrounging for votes among Libertarians. To be blunt, Trump is not acting like he thinks he has it in the bag- which either suggests he believes the polls as much as the Discord guys do, does believe them but this is some 6D underwater ping-pong maneuver he forgot to pull in 2016 and 2020 or didn't think he needed to do until now, or he really has left the realm of reality by, say, preferring to go to Chicago the week of the RNC instead of showing he's not just some crazy whack job who doesn't want to go to a \"horrible\" city like Milwaukee but thinks the site of the 1968 DNC Dumpster Fire is somehow better. *Random anecdote about sharks that even Reagan didn't engage in when he was more clearly having issues*\n\nI think people are partially reacting to this weird dissonance. I'm not going to tell you Biden has it in the bag, but I feel like I at least understand why people are acting so...oddly...",

            "body": "Thanks for being chill and for willing to hear all sides. In today\u2019s political climate, it\u2019s a relief when we can have civil discussions \n\nThe biggest concerns with project 2025 isn\u2019t how it will effect people of color but more so the effects it will have on the lgbt, on abortion and concerns over porn bans and how that would violate the first amendment, and concerns over project 2025 erasing the line between church and state \n\nProject 2025 aims to take away lgbt rights by doing things such as redirecting federal funds to what it called a \u201cbiblically based\u201d definition of family, aswell as wrongfully equating being transgender with pornography, and it even pushes the harmful and false stereotype that lgbt people are pedophiles.\n\nIt also seeks to ban pornography. It shouldn\u2019t matter what you or anyone else\u2019s personal or religious views on pornography is, it\u2019s protected by the first amendment and as long as the porn in question involves consenting adults, it should be allowed. Amongst young adults compared to older generations, sex is seen as less of a dirty thing, so this could also be a way for older conservatives to attack the younger, and generally more liberal and progressive, generations. There\u2019s also a concern over what is defined as pornography. Is anything with nudity considered porn? If so, lots of movies, books, and art would be banned, and this does also include educational books and movies, such as history books discussing Greek statues and displaying a Greek statue depicting a nude man or woman. As brought up earlier, transgender is being linked to pornography. Drag shows, despite not being inherently sexual, could be banned due to being considered \u201cporn\u201d. There\u2019s also concerns of how this will be enforced. The internet is filled to the brim with sexual content. And then there\u2019s also physical dvds or art that is sexual. \n\nThere is also concerns about abortion. Should abortion be banned across the board, then rape victims won\u2019t have access to possibly life saving medical care. Amanda Zurawski was a woman who almost died because she couldn\u2019t get an abortion in her state. [There was also a 13 year old girl who was forced to give birth](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/teen-girl-mississippi-abortion-ban-b2392968.html) because her state banned abortion. A little girl who is raped should not have to deal with giving birth and having a child, especially when giving birth can be dangerous for children. [There was also a case of a woman who was forced to give birth to a child who she knew wouldn\u2019t live for more then a day](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/03/health/texas-abortion-law-mother-cnnphotos/). And yes, she couldn\u2019t get an abortion because of Texas abortion laws \n\nFinally, there is concerns over the separation of church and state being removed with project 2025, with project 2025 using lots of religious language, and wanting to do things like allowing teachers to force their religion onto students and increased funding for religious schools",

It's not cognitive dissonance to like Bernie, think he's doing a good job, and still think he is too old for president/there should be age limits. \n\nI have no issue with calling on Bernie to retire and for implementing term/age limits in Congress. I think the desire for age limits is twofold: Super old politicians risk their health inhibiting their ability to make decisions at critical times, and super old politicians are often out of touch with the issues and concerns of younger generations. That's not to say that younger politicians aren't out of touch with the issues of older generations, but I don't think we're at risk of Boomers' concerns being ignored anytime soon.\n\nBernie is in seemingly pretty decent shape despite his age. He was no Dianne Feinstein. And the reason a lot of young voters like him so much is that he absolutely was in touch with our needs, moreso than most other Democrats. So if we passed age limits and it forced him to retire, it'd be a sad but necessary consequence.",

We have two months until Trump returns to the WH which gives me plenty of time to call out the Supreme Court.  To specify why I'm blaming them, polls in late 2023/early 2024 generally had Trump ahead of Biden, yet when the question was asked who'd they support if Trump got convicted on J6, Biden pulled ahead believe it or not.  This showed that even Biden, of all people, had a really good chance at defeating Trump if the latter was held accountable for J6, and if Biden even had a chance, then Kamala would've most definitely soundly defeated Trump if he got convicted on the J6 charges.  SCOTUS was the reason to why we didn't get the J6 trial before the election.  When the DC Circuit shot down Trump's stupid immunity claim (that he brought up only to delay the trial) in early Feb, it seemed that Trump was going to face accountability before the election after all.  But then, SCOTUS interfered and did everything to ensure that Trump doesn't face accountability for what he did.  First, they decided to hear the immunity case when they shouldn't have, then, they moved so slowly on it, waiting until late April to have the oral arguments, then waited all the way to July to hand down the opinion, and finally, and worst of all, the opinion itself where they actually gave Trump some immunity which could lead to some major consequences once Trump is back in the WH.  Had it not been for their interference and their immunity ruling, Trump would've likely been found guilty for J6 by the time of the election, and this consequently would've led to him losing the election badly and facing prison time right now, but instead, he got away with it and is returning to the WH all because six justices on our highest court did everything to protect him which goes against what they were supposed to do.  This is exactly why I'm blaming the Supreme Court to why we're in this position, and I have every right to do so.",

The first debate, Biden\u2019s mental fitness, the rushed primary, Israel, Ukraine, the economy, border security, any many more topics were, by the polls, all losing issues for the Democrats. Kamala herself was not well liked before she was nominated, back in January her favorability rating fell to just over [35 percent](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris/) and barely climbed until Biden dropped out. I simply do not see any evidence of a shift on Jan 6th that outweighs everything else in Trump\u2019s favor, and which could explain why he had a victory as big as he did.",

However, it's important to note virtually every President has a positive approval during their transition. For example, Gallup had Biden at 57% in his first presidential approval rating poll. It's more of a \"nothing has happened yet so there's nothing to be upset about\" kind of response.  \n\n\nI think once Trump has been in office 6-9 months, which is the usual honeymoon period, we will see his approval rating go back to where it was in his first term. I think the days of President's consistently having about 50% approval are over due to polarization.",

You should start by looking into someone who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy. There's also free CBT resources online [such as this](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheets/cbt/none).\n\nThe name cognitive behavioral therapy may be a bit confusing, but it's about recognizing cognitive distortions in your thinking. For instance, if a barista was rude to you and you end up thinking \"They must think I'm a loser. Everyone must think I'm a loser,\" CBT has tools to help you stop and go \"Actually, I can't read that barista's mind. Maybe they were just having a bad day. Maybe they just broke up with the boyfriend, or dog died, or got yelled at by their boss.\" It doesn't deal directly with this doomer scrolling as far as I know, but I think a lot of the skills you learn from it would be useful.\n\nPlease seriously look into it.\n\nAs for Kumar, what are his credentials? I looked him up. He also predicted WWIII would break out between March 29th and April 21st of this year. It didn't. He also said June 10th had big possibilities for triggering WWIII. Granted, I spent most of Monday in bed recovering from a serious injury, so I may have slept through it if it happened. I wasn't reading a lot of the new on Monday this week. Did WWWIII start on Monday?\n\nNostradamus predicted doomsday would occur in July 1999. Nope. Pat Robertson predicted the world ending on April 29, 2007. Nope. The Shakers predicted the world ending in 1792. When that didn't happen, they revised it to 1794. Still didn't happen. Christopher Columbus predicted it would end in 1656. Wrongo. Pope Innocent III thought it would be 1284, 666 years after the founding of Islam. Not sure if it's the type of pronouncement meant to be infallible, but he was quite fallible.\n\n[Wikipedia has a list of doomsday prophecies a mile long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dates_predicted_for_apocalyptic_events), and you might be surprised to learn they have a 100% falsehood rate. Personally, I'm going with the Geological Society of London which predicts a massive volcanic eruption ending all human life... in about a million years.\n\nYou know who have been the two biggest prophets of our lifetime?\n\nThe US intelligence agencies in predicting Russia's invasion of Ukraine (they're not predicting nuclear war, btw), and Roaring Kitty, the guy who predicted Game Stop's stock going up. This Kumar hasn't predicted shit.",

There would have to be a really good reason, and no, repeating the same talking points in campaign speeches isn't a good reason.\n\nSecond, the Democratic Party doesn't actually control whether or not she gets primaried contrary to popular belief. If nobody wants to run against her, then the party doesn't have a way to force somebody to run. If somebody does want to run against her in 4 years, then they're free to do so. There's not much the party can do about it. Challengers just need to be organized, get their campaign infrastructure set up early, make sure all of the proper paperwork is filed on time, etc. In most states, they can get on the primary ballot even if the party doesn't want them there, because the state government controls ballot access rather than the party.",

Second, by the time Harris became state AG, [California had changed its possession laws](https://archive.is/74dO) and the overwhelming majority of possession cases were downgraded from a misdemeanor to basically a parking ticket-level offense. Marijuana convictions dropped sharply under this new law.\n\nHarris *was* in charge of these decisions when she was DA of San Francisco, before she was AG. During that time, around 2000 people were prosecuted for marijuana offenses in San Francisco--this includes possession, sale and cultivation. But the overwhelming majority of them were funneled into diversionary programs, not prison. Only 45 of them went to prison. (Another small number probably spent some time in county jail for it, but data for that isn't public.) Most of those who did prison time probably weren't there on simple possession charges.\n\n> \u201cOur policy was that no one with a marijuana conviction for mere possession could do any (jail time) at all,\u201d said Paul Henderson, who led narcotics prosecutions for several years under Harris. Defendants arrested for the lowest-level possession would typically be referred to drug treatment programs instead of being charged, and weightier charges for marijuana sales would routinely be pleaded down to less serious ones, he said.\n\n> Solis, who led the public defender\u2019s office misdemeanor division for part of Harris\u2019 tenure, agreed that her office only rarely prosecuted people for low-level, simple possession.\n\n> \u201cKamala Harris and I disagreed on a lot of criminal justice issues, but I have to admit, she was probably the most progressive prosecutor in the state at the time when it came to marijuana,\u201d Solis said.\n\nThere are legitimate concerns with Harris's record as a prosecutor.  There's also a lot of misinformation floating around out there on social media. It's worth fact-checking anything you read on Reddit or Twitter to make sure it's actually true.",

She was also a Goldwater Girl who always seemed to have a \"My Turn\" bit about her.\n\nBy contrast, Harris actually beat an incumbent to become the DA of California, built up a reputation, became the California Senator (*remember it's a Jungle primary, so she had to compete against other Dems and not just a no hoper Republican*), positions herself around wherever the Dems and American center are, etc.\n\nPlus, given that Hillary's defeat is heavily attributed to the last minute Comey letter, we may need a bit more to work with before we try to say how a white female former Republican who was married to a former president resembles an African American woman who married an apparently normal Jewish man, even before the politics.",

There's a sea of red but it's truly mostly empty. The counties that really matter include the cities and they're blue or purple (maybe not York or Eerie, not sure). Basically, there are purple \"swing counties\" in PA; if you win them there's no realistic way to lose the state. Dem enthusiasm has increased and, if enthusiasm is high enough and translates to Dem turnout and independents break close to or over 50% for Harris (realistic, IMO), it's nearly mathematically impossible for Republicans to win, as there are 300k+ more registered Democrats.\n\n2. Anecdotally, I live in a \"swing county\" (Lehigh, though it does lean D and is less swingy than some others). There's no \"Trumpy\" feel in the air like there was in 2016 and 2020 (pretty sure). The vibe is a lot different. I think people in non-rural PA are sick of Trump's bullshit and want a president who isn't nuts, regardless of any other factors. The \"he's weird\" will play well. I think many voters truly were concerned about Biden's age alone and that was the only thing saving Trump...\n\n3. Some potential proof of that? Casey (D) is polling 4-10% above McCormick (R), who people dislike specifically for his MAGA and insurrectionist stances. It doesn't make a lot of sense that people would vote for Trump but vote against someone because they are MAGA. Then again, people don't always make sense.

There are some people who have basically no opinions on anything, but they're a small minority, usually hovering around 7-9% of all adults in the US. A larger segment, almost 30%, have enough of an opinion about policy to lean towards one party or the other. They generally like the party they lean towards, and when they do vote, they typically vote for the same party every time, but they don't vote as consistently as other people for whatever reason.\n\n> Am I expected to have knowledge on a wide variety of topics that I do not find interesting like whether immigration is beneficial?\n\nYes, adults are expected to have some at least surface level knowledge of various topics. Adults file taxes. They deal with things like health insurance and getting healthcare. If they're sexually active, then they should be thinking about what happens if a pregnancy occurs, and they should probably realize how abortion policy will affect that, including in the case of miscarriage or other complication. Adults participate in various commerce activities. They have bank accounts and often retirement accounts with investments. You don't need to take an economics class or do any sort of deep study to have a basic understanding of how these things work at a high level and how various policies would affect them.",

So the pardon would have to be for a specific charge instead of just their conduct. For example, let's say somebody was accused of colluding with a foreign government. That may lead to more specific criminal charges, but collusion itself is not a criminal act, so I as the President could not pardon them for collusion and thereby stop them from being investigated or charged for anything else. I'm not an expert and I could be wrong, that's just how it reads to me.",

Inappropriate laughter: Sociopaths may laugh or smile at others' pain or hardship, even in serious situations like court hearings or accidents[](https://www.aspergers101.com/the-destroying-sociopath/)\n2. Enjoyment of others' distress: Some sociopaths find genuine pleasure in witnessing or causing pain to others, which can manifest as laughter[](https://www.aspergers101.com/the-destroying-sociopath/)\n3. Use of laughter as manipulation: Sociopaths may use laughter and humor as tools to charm or manipulate others, rather than as genuine expressions of joy[](https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/62966/1/168_m_2012_ProyerFlischTschuppPlattRuch.pdf)\n\nIt's important to note that emotional experiences can vary among individuals with antisocial personality disorder, and not all will exhibit the same patterns of laughter or emotional expression",

He indicated that he would continue this behavior if he were to be allowed in, so the university barred him from entering.\n\n> Joseph Howley, a Jewish classics professor who has been supporting students participating in the pro-Palestinian protests, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that he understood why the university might prevent Davidai from entering the main campus right now.\n\n> \u201cIf they have information that specific individuals pose a security threat, it seems reasonable to me that they would want to exclude them, even just temporarily, to defuse that threat.

            "body": "> What is the goal exactly of this?\n\nThe first thing to understand is that in the federal government, you basically have two types of employees: civil servants and political appointees. Civil servants are typically your lower level employees who have long-term careers working for the federal government. They don't get fired and replaced when a new president comes in. Political appointees on the other hand are typically the higher level people who set high level policy for the agencies they run. They typically get replaced when a new president comes in.\n\nYou may have heard Trump and the Republicans blaming various problems on \"the deep state\" over the past several years. They're referring to those civil servants who are long-term employees. Their argument is that these people are so set in their ways from working for so long in the government that they stand in the way of the types of major reforms to the way the federal government functions.\n\nThe goal of Project 2025 is to try to defeat \"the deep state\" and institute massive reforms. They plan to do this by first reclassifying a bunch of civil servant positions as political appointees, so the president would be able to fire a lot more employees and replace them with loyalists who will go along with reforms. They also want to make sure they do this quickly, because they know they only have limited time to get it done before an election comes around and potentially makes it impossible, so they're already starting to recruit and vet people for all of the positions they'll need to fill so that they're ready to start appointing them on the first day of a presidency. They also want to make sure that these people are actually loyal to Trump and won't stand in his way like a lot of people did in his first term. If they succeed at getting a bunch of these people in place, then it makes it a lot easier for them to start tearing apart a lot of the federal government agencies.\n\n> As a citizen How can we prevent this from happening?\n\nVote for Biden in November. Try to convince people you know to vote for Biden in November. Volunteer for Biden's campaign. Vote for the Democratic senator if there's one running in your state this election, and especially if it's an important race.\n\n> What are even the pros to this?\n\nIf you're a Republican who agrees that the federal government is too big, then the pro would be that the federal government probably gets undermined a lot and stops enforcing a lot of stuff.\n\nIf you think Trump is the greatest man alive and brilliant, then you get a lot of pros because you get a bunch of people in the government who will do whatever Trump says.\n\nIf you think the federal government is generally a beneficial entity for a lot of people, then there probably are no pros.\n\nIf you're concerned about what Trump's first term would have been like if Pence hadn't been there to stand up to him when he wanted to stop the count of the electoral votes, if the various people hadn't stood up to him when he wanted to appoint Jeffrey Clark as Acting AG to push election lies, if Don McGahn hadn't stood up to him when he wanted to have Hillary Clinton and James Comey prosecuted for no reason, etc., then there are probably no pros.\n\n> This has been mentioned years ago, how come it will be able to be in effect soon?\n\nIt's a plan that was put together after Trump's first term. It's meant to correct a lot of the perceived failures that prevented Trump from enacting a lot of policy changes. It will be able to go into effect soon if Trump becomes president again in January 2025.\n\n> Is trump winning?\n\nThe race is pretty much even right now, so it could go either way. A lot could happen between now and November that could swing things to one side or the other.",

They probably won't be able to do all of it.\n\n> Like surely other powers in government have to ability to stop this right?\n\nThere's a lot of administrative rulemaking involved that could be challenged in the courts. That might delay a lot of changes, and even conservative judges haven't always sided with Trump's executive actions, so some might get stopped. That's especially likely to happen if his team skips required steps in the rulemaking process, which becomes more likely if they go through with their plan to purge a lot of the career civil servants from government, because those are the types of people who have the institutional knowledge to navigate the rulemaking process properly.\n\nOther proposed changes require legislation to be passed by Congress, so if the Democrats can take the House or if the Republicans in the Senate refuse to get rid of the filibuster, then that would prevent a lot of the proposed changes. Another aspect of Democrats controlling the House is that it gives them standing to sue the administration over changes they feel are in conflict with the law. They wouldn't have standing as a minority party in Congress.\n\n> Is 2025 the beginning of end of our democracy?\n\nDoubt it, but anything could happen.",

So basically I'd point to Project For A New American Century as to the beginning of the end of our Democracy. It was created well before I was old enough to vote.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century\n\n-----------------\n\nI have been told to look into 2025  by a few people and and finally have. Unitary Executive theory sounds scary but it allows the president to have more authority over the executive branch. Also when I looked into it I saw some stuff I liked, slashing funding for the FBI, DOJ and DHS all sound great to me. When it gets into socially conservative stuff it sounds a bit scary but like the other reply said it probably couldn't even be done. If anyone knows how to thwart the plans it's agencies like the FBI.\n\n-----------------\n\nWhen it comes down to the social conservative stuff though, I wasn't in public school too long ago and we had crappy programs like DARE and Abstinence Only Sex Education. We didn't have gender identity stuff  in middle or high school.  We had Sex Education in 5th 9th and 10th grade and definitely could've done better on the consent concept.\n\n----------\n\nThe abortion ban was awful and it's awful for all the women who live in those states but I was in college when all the lgbt stuff was coming out and it was heavily in my major and the social sciences. One thing that conservatives are correct about is that radical gender theory, radical race theories and radical lgbt theories were taught in select majors around Obamas second term. I also knew what I was majoring in so I didn't necessarily disagree with it. I agreed with a lot of it. That said I'm not a parent and I wouldn't know what I'd think if I were. By the Trump era it seemed to be part of the Democrat Playbook to double down on the gay/trans stuff and promote it to younger kids.\n\n----------\n\n2025 doesn't necessarily violate the separation of powers as it gives the president more control over the executive branch. There would still be the legislative and judicial brances..The framers didn't foresee a gigantic administrative state so it'll be tough to say whether it's constitutional or not.\n\n-------------\n\nI think that if Trump wins he'll wuss out on any Project 2025 stuff. Trump ran on Drain The Swamp and then the swamp monsters were in his cabinet, guys like John Bolton who was in the Bush administration. People like Omarosa and Bannon left the administration and then we're replaced by guys like Bolton and Mattis.",

It's a justifiable homicide, and therefore not illegal.\n\n> Congress did not in any way shape or form authorize Obama to target an American citizen without a trial\n\nThey did through the AUMF that was passed following 9/11. It authorizes the president to \"use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.\" There's no \"except for American citizens\" included in there. Al Qaeda is an organization that \"planned, authorized, committed\" the 9/11 terrorist attacks, so the president is authorized under this legislation to use \"all necessary and appropriate force\" against Al Qaeda. If a US citizen joins Al Qaeda and goes to a place where apprehension isn't feasible, then military force is absolutely a legal option available to the president as long as the AUMF is in force.\n\nIt's not possible to hold a trial for a person in absentia in our system. They're required to at least be present for arraignment. Assuming apprehension just isn't possible, is your suggestion that our hands are completely tied if a US citizen is planning and facilitating terrorist attacks against the US from abroad? We're required to let them continue to do that for the rest of their lives?",

Anyone who does it can be tried in the same way as an American who murders someone inside U.S. borders.\n\nBut in targeting and killing Awlaki, Obama appears to have relied on the \"public authority\" justification, which allows government officials to break the law when doing so is authorized by \"proper public authority,\" i.e., other laws that give them legal authority to take an otherwise illegal action. \n\nThe law that arguably gives that authority is the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) Act. \n\nOne counter argument to this is that the AUMF cannot be interpreted this broadly since doing so would be unconstitutional: the Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from executing US citizens without due process of law. If challenged on this point, Obama would presumably argue that denying Awlaki due process of law was legally justified as he posed an \"imminent\" threat and it was unfeasible for the U.S. to arrest him instead of killing him.\n\nA second counter argument is that, while the Authorization for the Use of Military Force Act could potentially justify a military strike under the public authority justification, it doesn't apply in this instance since it was CIA operatives who fired on and killed Awlaki and the CIA isn't part of the regular armed forces.\n\nIf you want to dive into this a little deeper, there's a good resource [here](https://www.justsecurity.org/12061/backgrounder-release-justice-departments-targeted-killing-memo/). \n\nBut that was the status of the law in 2011.  The facts around the killing of Awlaki would almost certainly be considered an \"official act\" and the president who ordered it immunized today under *Trump v. U.S.*",

Absolute immunity only applies to the President's preclusive Constitutional powers and none of your hypotheticals invoke Constitutional powers like appointing judges or giving pardons.

It would be an exception that swallows the rule.\n\nBut otherwise, I think your comment is on the mark. People have grossly misunderstood the opinion. It's not \"if you shout 'official act' you're immune from prosecution\" as so many seem to think.\n\nThere's some totally backwards reasoning going on. The President gets immunity for things that are within his official power. Then people imagine scenarios like the above wiretapping an entire town. For him to get immunity for that, people would have to think that (before the recent opinion) wiretapping an entire town was already part of his official powers.

Reagan's would-be assassin was also mentally ill and his attack wasn't driven by politics, which made it easy for people across the political spectrum to have sympathy for the president.\n\nThe 24-hour news cycle also just means stories--even big stories--have little long-term impact.

In 2012, Obama was a very popular incumbent, no surprise he won. In 2008, any Democrat would have defeated any Republican. In 2004, W.

As they're only umbrella terms meant to describe a persons appearance- not their culture, history or traditions.\n\nLike people of color- white people are also a diverse group with many different races included- the Irish, Scottish, Italian, Scandinavian, the list goes on. With huge differences in culture and historical events related to their lineage.\n\nBut this misunderstanding that white people are a race leads to many inconsistencies and inaccuracies. People often falsely assume that two white people share a culture that values things like imperialism but it's a mixed bag of oppressor and oppressed and always has been for as long as humans have lived. It causes a type of racism and judgement towards white people that is undeserved.\n\nFor example, some people will say 'Jewish people are not white', but many are. Such as Jon Stewart of Kamala Harris's husband. They are Jewish, but also white. Since if you get robbed by one of these men you would describe them to police as so. Even if they were wearing a yamaka, you would tell them \"I was robbed by a white man wearing a yamaka.\".\n\nDoes that make sense? I know it's a bit of an oddball perspective but I think it's an inherently political discussion but you let me know if it belongs in the sub. Perhaps it does but is too inflammatory to be worth discussing. But I'm not saying or insinuating anything negative about anyone, only that the term 'white people' is the same as 'people of color' as it does not denote a particular history, culture or lineage and set of traditions. It's purely a descriptive term.\n\nThe question; Does the discussion belong on this sub?",

It's simultaneous a very prominent White ethnic group (at least White Hispanics are; Black Hispanics are obviously not part of that), but also gets given equal treatment to racial groups in most discussions about race. It's a bit like Washington, DC. It's not a state, but for lots of discussions we kind of think of it as a state (especially around elections since DC gets 3 electoral college votes).\n\n>As they're only umbrella terms meant to describe a persons appearance- not their culture, history or traditions.\n\nIn the US race is not synonymous with culture, history or tradition. There's obviously a very strong connection to the two ideas, as members of a race often share culture, history, and tradition, but race in the US is about genetic lineage.

There won't necessarily be much genetic similarity because of the different ethnic groups within a single race.\n\nBut it's not just skin color. That is the way most people are identified by race, but at the same time we accept that someone may belong to a race without really looking like it.

Perot saw a drop off both in his initial and final numbers in his 96 run, Nader failed to regain the 6% he got early on and placed a point or two below his final numbers in 2000, and neither of the 2016 third parties got anywhere near their initial polling.\n\nThere's other evidence too in that link, such as John B. Anderson in the 1980 election placing well below the ~20% he got in ~February through July. Looking back further Henry Wallace (1948) never recovered, although Strom Thurmond (1948) and George Wallace (1968) actually held on.\n\nGiven that RFK isn't a Dixiecrat though he's more likely to level off.

Anderson, a Rockefeller Republican who also attracted disaffected Carter voters- in that Anderson was an establishment type who attracted people who had severe problems with Reagan, weren't conservative, and/or didn't care for Carter due to his issues at the time, whereas RFK Jr. seems to attract liberals who see the famous name and admittedly Trumpian Republicans who seem to prefer a different flavor that might be closer to their position on other things (e.g., believes vaccines are evil but also thinks global warming is something that must be fought).",

But that needs a huge caveat, which is that races aren't toss ups. Take 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2020 as examples. If you only got 3/4 predictions right for those years, you wouldn't have an impressive accuracy, you'd be worse than average.\n\n>why it favors Trump to win\n\nBetting markets are influenced a lot by who people *want* to win. Think about sports betting. Plenty of people bet on their team to win even when they know their team is unlikely to win. I thought Georgia was going to beat Alabama, but when I bet on the game I bet on Alabama because I'm an Alabama grad. People who want Trump to win aren't going to bet on a Biden victory. And to make things more complex, there's probably a big disparity in the rates of gambling among conservatives and liberals, and I'd wager (sorry) that the betting market skews right.\n\n>and what is the reason Trump must win and reclaim his presidency\n\nHe doesn't need to win.

Not the least because Reagan is not highly regarded by about half the political spectrum. Reagan also wasn't a convicted felon, adjudged rapist, twice impeached, serial business fraudster who continually hawked garbage with his name on it to his fans.

Especially the reason for his popularity because of his yuppy days in the 80s because of his properties, his reality show in the 90s and his presidency in the  2016-2020",

For few  reasons\n\n* Most Americans are unhappy  with Biden's term, especially that recent conflicts started to appear because during trumps reign there are no Russia and Israel wars. And Kamala is a vice president of Biden, which is why most Americans don't want Kamala as president\n* The reason why Trump is always the main nominee for the Republican Party is that Trump has a no defeat attitude and doesn't let go and move on, the same with  his supporters, and he wants to reclaim his presidency and because he has easily beaten his republic opponents to get the main nominee and still has his loyal supporters especially that most Americans are unhappy with both parties instead of a multi party like most countries which is the reason Trump is always the main nominee for the republic party and why most people want the Republican Party to win.\n* Trump can easily beat a female candidate except Biden because he is male, and he will likely beat Kamala like he did to Hilary back in 2016, he lost to Biden because most people are tired of Trump.\n* Oh and one more reason, Trump's Teflon luck, his luck helps him gain what he wants and whenever he ends up in difficult or worse situations, his luck always saves him and will likely help him regain his presidency.\n\n>5.2016 maybe\n\nThat could be  another reason, but for me, it's like a repeat of both 1968 and 2016 election because you see in 1968 Lyndon B. Johnson announce that he will not seek reelection due to the Vietnam War pressure  so Hubert Humphrey (Johnson's vice president)  became the democratic nominee instead and like Kamala he gains a surge in polls in the early weeks of the election  but in the final weeks his polls are declining and comparing the situations between 1968 and 2024 that involve conflicts like the Vietnam War in 1968 and the ongoing multi conflicts in the world that will lead to world war 3 like the Israel war, Ukraine war and the upcoming China-Taiwan war then it's possible that like Nixon, Trump  will regain his presidency while Kamala like Hubert will lose.\n\nAlso, there could be three reasons why Kamala will likely lose the 2024 election (along with trump) but this link from politico will explain both the candidate's 3 weakness [https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/25/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/polling-update-00185644](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/25/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/polling-update-00185644)",

Generally, I side with the Democratic platform, but I\u2019m also frustrated with the DNC's strong preference for establishment candidates, which I feel hinders meaningful innovation. Right now, my options are voting for Harris, going third party, or leaving the presidential spot blank.\n\nHere\u2019s my thinking:\n\nIf Harris wins, it\u2019s likely that we won\u2019t have a Democratic primary until 2032, and by then, I worry the DNC will continue to promote only establishment candidates, pushing out fresh voices. But if we get a competitive 2028 primary, I think there\u2019s potential to see a larger, more diverse field, with newer ideas getting attention. For me, non-establishment candidates like Andrew Yang in 2020 helped show the value of primaries for exploring and mainstreaming innovative policies like Universal Basic Income (UBI) and ranked-choice voting. The awareness and support for UBI, for example, rose significantly, and I see that as invaluable (Yang claims approval for UBI was at 25% before his run, and 66% after - though I can't validate this and don't know if this is just for dems or what). So, having a vibrant primary, in my view, is one of the best ways to keep our democracy healthy.\n\nWith a Harris win, I fear the DNC may feel validated in its current strategy, and we might not get the innovation our democracy needs. And while I can\u2019t support Trump, I also think his presidency would shake things up enough to foster real dissatisfaction with the two-party system, which might just open up space for a third party to gain traction.\n\nI\u2019m not sure yet if a third-party vote is the way to go\u2014whether it makes a statement strong enough to call for change. But I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m validating the current DNC approach by voting for Harris. Does anyone else feel this tension? How are you thinking about immediate impact versus long-term democratic innovation?",

Of course there's toll roads, but on a bigger scale there's gas taxes which are generally earmarked for road maintenance. And with public transportation, people do pay to uses buses and subways.\n\nWe have some other pay for usage services as well. You pay for your electricity and sewage. You pay taxes that fund unemployment benefits if you ever need them (why it's called unemployment *insurance*). You pay to use the Post Office (though taxes still cover some of the costs).\n\nFor a lot of stuff though, it just can't work. How would Medicaid or food stamps work? Basically anything aimed at helping the poor isn't ever going to work because the whole point is that they don't have money.\n\nThen there's also things like police and fire departments. We could presumably require homeowner's insurance that is then used to fund fire departments. But with police, we all benefit from them even when we don't encounter them, and it'd be pretty shitty to require people to pay to have the police respond to a call.\n\nIn the end, there's very little where we could switch to a usage fee, and education is probably the biggest one. But how much do we want to increase taxes on poorer families so they can send their kids to school and not lock their kids into more poverty? (Also have to note that with so much education funding coming from local property taxes, we're partly to people paying for the service already.)",

The way you do it is to try to cram all the other parties' votes into one district and spread your own out--so instead of having two districts that are D+10 and two that are R+10, you create one D+30 district and then have three R+5 districts. In an average year, this means that the gerrymandering party wins more elections than they should--in this case, the Republicans would win three seats instead of the two they would have won with an ungerrymandered map. But in a wave year, where there's an eight point swing towards the Democrats, the Republicans actually get wiped out completely and lose all four of those seats, whereas with an ungerrymandered map, they would have held two. So gerrymandered maps cause more swinginess, not less.\n\nWe just had a wave election in 2018. There's no evidence it's impossible now. The fact that it hasn't happened in the last few years is because 2020 and 2024 were driven by high, fairly even levels of both pro- and anti-Trump sentiment, and in 2022 what should have anti-Biden backlash was tempered by anti-Dobbs backlash. 2026 should likely be less even, unless Trump pursues a much less chaotic economic agenda than he's proposed, and we may end up seeing another wave.",

Here are some short answers for both, which do not include a lot of important context.\n\nThe immediate trigger for WWI was when Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by a Serbian nationalist. Each side had a complex system of treaties which dragged other nations, who were already at odds with each other, into the ensuing war. The United States also eventually joined because of public support, Germany destroying their merchant ships with unrestricted submarine warfare, and partially to fulfill Woodrow Wilson\u2019s vision for a new international community, which helped create the League of Nations.\n\nWW2 was also caused by a combination of things. At this point, the world was suffering from the Great Depression, and some countries, namely Italy and Germany, looked to fascism as a solution. In Germany\u2019s case, they were also bitter about the terms of their surrender in WWI, and blamed minority groups, especially Jews, for \u201cstabbing them in the back.\u201d At the same time, Japan was invading China in the second Sino-Japanese War. These three nations formed the Axis Powers to support each other\u2019s quests of territorial expansion. It became a World War when Germany, with the help of the Soviet Union, who also wanted to expand their territory, invaded Poland, leading to other nations, after years of attempting to forestall conflict, finally declaring war on Germany, leading to full scale war across most of Europe. The United States eventually joined after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. When the U.S. declared on Japan, Germany declared on them (even though they totally didn\u2019t need to). Russia, who originally helped Germany, joined the allies after Hitler betrayed them and invaded during Operation Barbarossa, because his vision of Germany\u2019s future territory, referred to as Lebensraum (living space) included a large chunk of the Soviet Union.",

States can use their National Guard, but once the National Guard is federalized it falls under the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nHowever, the Insurrection Act provides an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nNothing going on right now looks like an insurrection in the normal meaning of the word, but the Insurrection Act is actually pretty broad. You've probably seen pictures of the National Guard escorting black students during desegregation in Alabama. That was through the Insurrection Act. It was more recently used to restore order in the US Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo, and during the Rodney King race riots in LA. That was the last time it was used (1992). Trump talked about using it in response to the BLM rioting, but ultimately did not.\n\nNow a big thing to understand here is that invoking the Insurrection Act isn't what most people think about when they hear \"martial law.\" It allows the National Guard to be used for law enforcement, but doesn't suddenly change what the laws are. There wouldn't suddenly be a military dictatorship. It's more like if the President decided to hire and deploy 100,000 more FBI agents and US martials. The President can already use federal law enforcement to enforce federal law, and the Insurrect Act essentially gives him a lot more law enforcement officers.\n\nThere is no legislative approval needed for the Insurrection Act, though they are needed to fund the military. The Constitution limits Congress to funding the military for 2 year periods, but typically we have annual budgets. Additionally, Congress could amend the Insurrect Action, though this would require a veto-proof supermajority (since naturally the President would veto it).\n\nInvoking the Insurrection Act could also be challenged in court, but the act is pretty broad and there's a lot of precedent for it being used for many things that look nothing like an insurrection, so the legislature is the better check on the President.\n\nAnd the biggest things to keep in mind here is that Republicans have the tiniest majority in the House and a pretty small majority in the Senate. Anything resembling martial law would be incredibly unpopular among both parties. Any attempt would be more likely to result in Trump being impeached than martial law actually going into effect. Republicans don't have a lot to lose now by ditching Trump and letting Vance take over (which would then give him the incumbency advantage in 2028).",

The advice may have come from the campaign managers, but it's her job to know what advice to take and who to listen to.\n\nAnd that answer on The View was hardly an aberration for Harris. It's not like she routinely gave great answers, but got bad advice on that one. She routinely fumbled in interviews.\n\nFor instance, following the debate, she went on a news talk show and was asked to elaborate on her economic plan. Rather than going into more detail as the hosts wanted, she repeated her \"I was raised middle class\" spiel and vague \"opportunity economy\" line.\n\nAt a CNN town hall she was asked if she could accomplish only one goal as president, what would it be, what's the most important thing to her. Her answer was that there's not just one, then she fumbles around talking about bipartisanship, before finally giving a list of policies which weirdly starts with housing.\n\nHer interview on Fox News was a total mess, not the least of which is again failing to say what she'd do differently than Biden, even after seeing the negative reaction it got on The View. A lot of folks on the left have talked about Baier kept cutting her off, but he did so only after she started giving non-answers. In the entire interview she answered exactly 1 question.\n\nAnd of course there's her flip flopping on issues, fracking in particular. She said made her position clear in 2020, and MSM factcheckers correctly pointed out that she didn't. She was referring to the VP debate where she talked only in terms of Biden's position on fracking. After the factchecks came out, she continued to repeat that she'd made her position clear.\n\nHarris is both the head coach and the quarterback, and if play after play continues to fail, you can't really blame it on the offensive coordinator.",

But the bully behavior ends where foreign countries begin to take the threat seriously: Trump has also advanced the idea that the U.S. should take the Panama Canal from Panama.

I won\u2019t back down from them, either.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cMy job is to try to collaborate and find common ground wherever I can,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said in an interview after laying out her approach to Mr. Trump in remarks at the Detroit Auto Show. \u201cThere will be moments where we can\u2019t, and I will have to be on the other side, but I\u2019m not going into it with that mind-set.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cPeople are exhausted,\u201d added Ms. Whitmer, a leading Democrat from one of the nation\u2019s most crucial battleground states \u2014 a place, she also noted, that both she and Mr. Trump have now won twice. \u201cThey want leaders who can solve problems and make their lives better.\u201d\n> \n> Taken together, a new and difficult Democratic balancing act is coming into view, as elected officials across the party try to show that they have heard the electorate\u2019s demands for change, while grappling with where to oppose Mr. Trump and how to talk about him \u2014 if at all.\n> \n> In tone and emphasis, it is a sharp departure from the brawling mood of resistance that characterized much of Democratic politics over the last eight years.\n> \n> Partly, that is an acknowledgment of political reality: Republicans are set to control all of the levers of power in Washington, and Democratic officials across the country will need support from the federal government.\n> \n> It also reflects how the anti-Trump fervor that was manifested in mass protests and shaped popular culture has given way to political disillusionment and burnout in left-leaning circles, at least for now.\n> \n> And while Mr. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, some are grappling with the fact that he narrowly won it in November, in part by cutting into Democrats\u2019 traditional constituencies. A Gallup poll last month found more Americans approving of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of his transition than at around the same time eight years earlier, though those numbers still significantly trailed other recent presidents-elect.\n> \n> \u201cBy winning a second time and by winning the popular vote, Trump now has greater legitimacy than in 2016,\u201d said Miro Weinberger, who during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term was the mayor of Burlington in Vermont, a famously progressive state where Republicans made surprising gains in the fall. \u201cThat is causing deeper reflection this time about the ways in which Democratic governance is failing.\u201d\n> \n> Of course, Democrats stressed in interviews, Mr. Trump, who will be the first felon to serve as president and whose re-election bid was opposed by some who worked with him most closely last time, has yet to take office.\n> \n> Once he does, the policies he and the Republican Congress pursue may well prompt the kind of broad backlash that propelled Democrats to many of their victories over the last eight years and create new pressures on elected Democrats to oppose him wherever possible.\n> \n> Honeymoon periods never last, and for Mr. Trump \u2014 an exceptionally polarizing leader in a closely divided country \u2014 it could be especially short.\n> \n> Efforts to check Mr. Trump are also already underway from a range of Democratic state officials and advocacy groups, especially in blue states, while Democrats from more conservative areas, too, have cautioned against over-reading the election results.\n> \n> \u201cMy takeaway is there is not a clear mandate, and that the people of eastern North Carolina, in particular, want us to come to Washington, D.C., and work for them,\u201d said Representative Don Davis, a North Carolina Democrat who won a district that also supported Mr. Trump.\n> \n> Democratic energy more broadly will not be dormant, lawmakers argue, if Republicans threaten the social safety net or target abortion rights. The far-reaching crackdowns on undocumented immigrants Mr. Trump has proposed also have the potential to create wrenching scenes with unpredictable political reactions.\n> \n> \u201cIf this administration and Congress attempts to institute a nationwide abortion ban, you\u2019re going to see that type of protest happen again,\u201d said Representative Susie Lee, a Nevada Democrat who won in a district Mr. Trump also captured in November. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re moving into a period where everyone\u2019s just going to, you know, sit back and let horrible policies like that be enacted.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt\u2019s picking those areas where you have to hold firm, but without making it every single thing, a knee-jerk reaction to everything that comes out of the administration,\u201d Ms. Lee added.\n> \n> The fissures and dilemmas around how to do that are already coming into view, especially on the issue of immigration.\n> \n> Last week, the House passed a bill targeting undocumented immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes for deportation, with support from Republicans and nearly 50 Democrats.\n> \n> Representative Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat who opposed that measure, said he worried that some in his party were misreading the lessons from Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid, which included a promise to carry out mass deportations.\n> \n> \u201cThe first election, everyone thought it was just a fluke, and they felt like, you know, it wasn\u2019t where the American people were at,\u201d Mr. Frost said. \u201cThis time, there are a lot of Democrats that are worried that this wasn\u2019t a fluke, and this is what people want, the most extreme parts of his agenda.\u201d\n> \n> He warned against that interpretation, arguing that many Americans simply voted for Mr. Trump \u201cbecause he was effectively able to make this a referendum on how people feel about the economy.\u201d\n> \n> But Mr. Frost, who also described his party\u2019s messaging challenges, insisted that he was not in Washington \u201cto just resist.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cYes, we will be resisting and pushing back against parts of his agenda we disagree with, 100 percent,\u201d he said. But he added that he would > also look for areas of potential cooperation with Republicans, though he was skeptical of how much good-faith negotiating Republicans would be willing to do.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019m keeping an open mind for sure, but people can\u2019t blame me for coming to the table with an eyebrow raised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not there to work.\u201d\n> \n> Representative Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat from a more competitive district, has in some ways laid out a similar approach toward Mr. Trump.\n> \n> He offered to travel to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida home and private club, for negotiations concerning removing the state and local tax deduction cap. And he said in an interview that he would work with anyone, including Mr. Trump, to \u201cmake my community more affordable, more safe and more free.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIf he\u2019s doing anything counter to those goals, I will fight to the end of the earth,\u201d Mr. Ryan pledged.\n> \n> Just don\u2019t call that resistance.\n> \n> \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the real world thinks about it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about their lives. They\u2019re thinking about putting food on the table, a roof over their shoulder. They don\u2019t want to hear the sloganeering.\u201d\n> \n> Misgivings about that r-word are not limited to House members from competitive districts.\n> \n> In 2017, Rabbi Sharon Brous, the prominent leader of a synagogue in Los Angeles, addressed the Women\u2019s March on Washington, describing the awakening of a \u201cspirit of resistance.\u201d\n> \n> Eight years later, Republicans are on the cusp of fully controlling Washington, crises abound abroad, Rabbi Brous\u2019s city is burning, and the political left, she said in an interview, has \u201cbecome so fractious, differences of position and perspective have become almost existential.\u201d\n> \n> At a moment that demands new relationship-building and more local organizing, she suggested, the word \u201cresistance\u201d feels less resonant now.\n> \n> \u201cI don\u2019t want to be lazy with language,\u201d said Rabbi Brous, who gave an invocation at the Democratic National Convention last summer. \u201cI want us to speak about what we\u2019re actually trying to do, what we actually believe in, and where can we unite?\u201d\n> \n> For former Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who lost in November but outran Vice President Kamala Harris, the answer to that is clear: advocacy for working Americans, many of whom have drifted away from the Democratic Party.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell my former colleagues, \u2018Resist,\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t resist,\u2019 \u2018Use the word resist,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy mission is to make the Democratic Party the party of workers, like we used to be.\u201d\n> \n> He added: \u201cIf we start doing that and we make that contrast \u2014 \u2018Who\u2019s on your side?\u2019 \u2014 you know, whatever the other things that party activists, party office holders do, is just less relevant.\u201d\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

He\u2019s one of the people who called Trump \u201cunfit.\u201d However, I don\u2019t personally give much weight to that since the biggest schism between him and Trump was that Bolton was far more hawkish.

He then went on to make untold millions with his memoir slamming Trump, which sold nearly 800k copies in its opening week alone.\n\nPence, imo, is much more justified.

Here is a quote where Critical Race Theory explicitly endorses segregation:\n\n>8 Cultural nationalism/separatism. An emerging strain within CRT holds that people of color can best promote their interest through separation from the American mainstream. Some believe that preserving diversity and separateness will benefit all, not just groups of color. We include here, as well, articles encouraging black nationalism, power, or insurrection. (Theme number 8).\n\nRacial separatism is identified as one of ten major themes of Critical Race Theory in an early bibliography that was codifying CRT with a list of works in the field:\n\n>To be included in the Bibliography, a work needed to address one or more themes we deemed to fall within Critical Race thought. These themes, along with the numbering scheme we have employed, follow:\n\nDelgado, Richard, and Jean Stefancic. \"Critical race theory: An annotated bibliography 1993, a year of transition.\" U. Colo. L. Rev. 66 (1994): 159.\n\nOne of the cited works under theme 8 analogizes contemporary CRT and Malcolm X's endorsement of Black and White segregation:\n\n>But Malcolm X did identify the basic racial compromise that the incorporation of the \"the civil rights struggle\" into mainstream American culture would eventually embody: Along with the suppression of white racism that was the widely celebrated aim of civil rights reform, the dominant conception of racial justice was framed to require that black nationalists be equated with white supremacists, and that race consciousness on the part of either whites or blacks be marginalized as beyond the good sense of enlightened American culture. When a new generation of scholars embraced race consciousness as a fundamental prism through which to organize social analysis in the latter half of the 1980s, a negative reaction from mainstream academics was predictable. That is, Randall Kennedy's criticism of the work of critical race theorists for being based on racial \"stereotypes\" and \"status-based\" standards is coherent from the vantage point of the reigning interpretation of racial justice. And it was the exclusionary borders of this ideology that Malcolm X identified.\n\nPeller, Gary. \"Race consciousness.\" Duke LJ (1990): 758.\n\nThis is current and mentioned in the most prominent textbook on CRT:\n\n>The two friends illustrate twin poles in the way minorities of color can represent and position themselves. The nationalist, or separatist, position illustrated by Jamal holds that people of color should embrace their culture and origins. Jamal, who by choice lives in an upscale black neighborhood and sends his children to local schools, could easily fit into mainstream life. But he feels more comfortable working and living in black milieux and considers that he has a duty to contribute to the minority community. Accordingly, he does as much business as possible with other blacks. The last time he and his family moved, for example, he made several phone calls until he found a black-owned moving company. He donates money to several African American philanthropies and colleges. And, of course, his work in the music industry allows him the opportunity to boost the careers of black musicians, which he does.\n\nDelgado, Richard and Jean Stefancic Critical Race Theory: An Introduction. New York. New York University Press, 2001.\n\nDelgado and Stefancic (2001)'s fourth edition was printed in 2023 and is currently the top result for the Google search 'Critical Race Theory textbook':\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=critical+race+theory+textbook\n\nOne more from the recognized founder of CRT, who specialized in education policy:\n\n>\"From the standpoint of education, we would have been better served had the court in Brown rejected the petitioners' arguments to overrule Plessy v.

Since ballistic missiles have different ranges, speeds and size and performance characteristics, the Ballistic Missile Defense System is an integrated, \"layered\" architecture that provides multiple opportunities to destroy missiles and their warheads before they can reach their targets. The system's architecture includes:\n\n* Networked sensors (including space-based) and ground- and sea-based radars for target detection and tracking;\n* Ground- and sea-based interceptor missiles for destroying a ballistic missile using either the force of a direct collision, called \"hit-to-kill\" technology, or an explosive blast fragmentation warhead, and;\n* A command, control, battle management and communications network providing the operational commanders with the needed links between the sensors and interceptor missiles.\n* Layers: NGI missiles will be able to intercept ICBM's, Hypersonic missiles. Layer 2 will be THAAD and Aegis, \n\nBut maybe you're right this general consensus you speak of is likely filled with tons of experts and we should just give up.",

            "body": "I have seen this content before, but it recently came up on my feed. The creator is likening the struggle black Americans have had to suffer through by using 450 games of Monopoly as a metaphor. These were my honest thoughts and questions that I truly like opinions on:\n\nLet's say the same person is not playing the 450 rounds. Say, the \"loser\" is the same person, but the \"winner\" is swapped out each game. Each swap, the \"winning\" player becomes more reluctant to play a stacked game, but, born into a \"winners circle,\" are pawns? How is this solved? It's a sincere question. One that is not ignoring the privilege of the winners or persistent, systematic, and devastating racism against the \"losers.\" How does a society get these two groups together? On a larger scale, the steps are clear. Lately I'm seeing that on an individual level, revenge or hate on the last \"winner\" forced into playing is acceptable and praiseworthy. I absolutely loathe the question, \"Can you be racist to a white person?\" It is extremely problematic mainly because of the thinking behind it; that racism is an absolute must; a need; an involuntary action that can't be avoided. Why question if words can hurt? They can, and they do. If it's revenge; because it \"feels good\"; because \"I hurt, so they need to hurt\" or anything similar,  that's frankly understandable, but gets a society nowhere.  The more appropriate question is, \"Is racism acceptable?\" The answer, by the way, is no. I recognize my opinion is not popular but probably won't change. If anyone has found ways on an individual level for racism to not be accepted, I 100% would like to know. If making fun of, insulting, and describing every white American as the problem is the way this movement is meant to go, then that's fine; this movement was not built for me or by me and doesn't want me as a part of it. Alienating and separating into categories is the easiest way to assure the destruction of a society. I'm not sure if my meaning is being delivered as intended, and I am not ignoring the 450+ years of oppression.  Moving forward, I don't see how hate is going to mend the rift in any way at all. If the end goal is a voluntarily segregated society, then I can't stop that. However, I truly would like to know why it's okay for white kids to believe it's appropriate to be insulted for their race as long a black kid is doing it? And how is this behavior going to lead toward any kind of equality for anyone? I really would like to hear honest feelings and opinions. I will be perceived as a racist by some and can't change that. I have never and will never support any form of racism towards blacks from pre-colonial Africa to today. I'm asking, as a white person, honestly, what? What do you want us to do? I know that's triggering because we're not supposed to ask. But I grew up thinking that learning about racism, stopping and preventing racism, speaking out against racism, helping the black community when i could, educating everyone regarding acism was the way to live as an ally; a support; a person fighting for change. I never learned what to do when that wasn't enough. When my skin color, regardless of my behavior, determined whether I was a help or a disgrace. Don't get me wrong, that very statement reeks of white privilege but my honest feelings are that I don't think that in order to gain a society based on equality, it is necessary for whites to roll over and take it. I simply don't believe hatred and separation is how equality is going to be achieved. \n\nFinally, it is very natural for humans to segregate into similar groups (races, religions, ethnicities, genders, etc.). It's a psychological function of the human brain and is very healthy. However, once it moves from voluntarily enjoying a feeling of acceptance and same-ness with people like you and morphs into exclusion and derision for all other groups, it becomes unhealthy and dangerous.",

The types of people who work in presidential administrations tend to be really interested in policy and involved in the future plans of the party. And if you were trying to get a group together, having a bunch of former White House staff involved would lend it a lot of weight.\n\nBasically the idea here is that this is probably the group we'd be likely to see whether or not Trump was involved.

So it depends on what infrastructure you're referring to. Try calling, emailing or visiting the relevant jurisdiction and asking. The water lines in my city aren't being updated because a local levy failed for example. \n\n>Can someone explain to me why my tax dollars are fueling foreign wars while the country collapses from the inside out. \n\nYeah but it depends which war.\n\nFor example , the Ukrainie-Russia war has turned into a proxy for a semi-cold Russia-America war but the US doesn't need to send soldiers. So American politicians and foreign policy strategists view this as a war America needs to fight- and at a discount by not funding a full-out traditional style of war where it's their own soldiers, logistics etc. \n\n>Do my tax dollars have anything to do with funding these foreign conflicts?\n\nI guess it depends who you are. Most tax revenue comes from the wealthy. And the wealthy buy up American debt that's funding the war. Is this the sort of answer you want? I don't know what kind of answer you want other than yes but not as much as Bill Gates. \n\n>Does this not boost inflation every time we approve these huge bills?\n\nNot necessarily but it's likely. Considering America's economic philosophy right now the answer is almost certainly yes since tax increases and interest rate hikes are both unlikely. It depends on how much money there is in circulation. \n\nThere could be a scenario where the US raises taxes, pays off war debts but holds some revenue in the reserve. This would lower inflation. This isn't how America operates currently though. Raising taxes and interest rates while sequestering cash would require replacing most of Congress and the Fed. \n\n\n>I apologize if I\u2019m basing my animosity towards the federal government\n\nWell. Let me bring up 2 points. \n\n1. The current federal government is holding onto a fairytale where we can have war without war. We can fight a war for the sake of a new conception of peace that doesn't involve conquest, reparations or spoils for the victor. What do the American people get besides a vague ideal of \"global peace\"?\n\n2. The US is putting the interests of a useless \"international order\" before their own in a completely subservient way. A long war involving Russia is bad for Europe and in a direct relationship, good for the US. Europe depends on Russian oil. Oil prices go up -> Europen manufacturing costs go up -> there is an opening for the US to step in and take over Europe's manufacturing territory. That's more  $ for the US. The US doesn't have to and isn't going to take advantage of this but they should be telling Europe the more the US solves your own economic problems from this war, the more you're going to do for us. But America isn't demanding anything in return. \n\nIf this isn't disgruntling, what is?",

The type of inflation you're talking about is what happens when growth in demand for goods outpaces the growth in the supply of those goods. Businesses see that they're selling out, so they capitalize on that and raise their prices because they can. Basically, spending divided by goods = price, and so an increase in spending means an increase in price. That's inflation. Consumers in the US spend about 18 trillion a year. If that falls by 100 billion and the government offsets it by spending 100 billion, it washes out and it doesn't cause inflation. Government spending also does not cause inflation if the increase in goods production is enough to match the increase in spending.",

Project 2025 continues to make headlines and further fuels the panic. The vast majority of Americans don't want another Biden-Trump rematch: (source: [Trump vs. Biden: The rematch many Americans don't want | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-dismayed-by-biden-trump-2024-rematch-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2024-01-25/)) and many of us on the left are disappointed that Biden, who will be 82 when he is re-elected and 86 when his term ends and Harris, who has consistently shown some of the lowest popularity ratings for a VP (souces: [Kamala Harris : Approval Polls | FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/), [NBC News poll: Kamala Harris hits record low for VP net favorability (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/26/kamala-harris-poll-2024-election-biden)) are the only two people standing between Trump and the White House.\n\nYeah, I get it.\n\nBut that's not an RFK Jr problem, it's an indictment of the DNC. We shouldn't be neck and neck with Trump, who has 91 pending felonies. So, ANY perceived threat, such as RFK Jr. to an already weak foundation is unacceptable to most on the left. Me personally? I'm tired of voting against people and would rather vote for someone. If Trump wins, it's not on RFK Jr, West, Stein or anyone else the DNC would like to shift blame to. It's squarely on the DNC. There were plenty of other candidates I would have supported, but nope, we're going to fall in line, again, out of fear.\n\nThat said, sounds like you've already heard some of the over simplified \"anti-vax nutjob, conspiracy theorist, family beef\" smears and are keeping an open mind. If you haven't already, I suggest checking out the following for his responses (and some other good mashups from other supporters) that address the common criticisms:.\n\n1. \"AntiVax Nutjob\": [RFK Jr.: Saying I'm anti-vaccine is 'way of silencing me' | RFK Jr. Town Hall (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLxBwIupF88)\n2.

We have so many other issues that he has good ideas for, such as regenerative agriculture, addressing chronic disease, regulations on AI that no other candidate is even acknowledging, yet people are stuck on the out-of-context smear headlines on vaccines...\n\n\\*edit - formatting",

In fact, very little has been passed in congress the last couple years because Republicans control the House, i.e. we have checks and balances that literally stop the president from being a dictator right now. To say the last 4 years have been living under a dictatorship is objectively false or straight up trolling. \n\nTrump has definitely said things and signaled that he would like the executive to have more power. The messaging from the Democrats has been the complete opposite, and they have spoken out against the Supreme Court granting the president immunity from prosecution on official acts.

They were Egyptians\u2019 slaves and then captured by the Roman and made slaves there too. It was Emperor Constantine who allowed the Jews and all the Romans to worship whichever Gods or Goddesses they wanted. The Jews were allied to live in peace in Europe until Hitler decided to exterminate them. After the Allies won WWII, the British, American, Russians and the French decided to carve out a piece of land in Palestine to settle the Jews to protect from future harm. Unfortunately, the people of Palestine were forced out of theirs home to protect the Jews. This happened in 1948. In 1967, the Arab world decided to take back their lands by launching on offensive on the Jews. They would had succeeded if not for the American intervention. The Jews actually captured Golan Heights of Syria, Gaza Strips of Palestine, the West Bank and Sinai Peninsula. Sinai was later returned to Egypt through the peace agreement and in exchange the Egyptian recognized Israel\u2019s right to exist. My point is that land was never belonged to the Jews. NEVER. Only the Jews themselves claimed those lands belong to them. Even the United Nations and Allies never said those lands belong to the Jews. So I don\u2019t know where you have been reading your history books but you are fucking ignorance as hell. You can\u2019t change fact.

Now that he has 34 felony convictions they still don't care. Now that his 3 other felony cases are evaporating because of the election, they're elated.

He tried to lie a pandemic away, rather than do his job \"Gone by Easter...\"\n\nDuring his 1st term, we saw a massive spike in hate crime across the US, and an equivalent growth in militant extremism. His comments in his one debate with Harris, produced an explosion of threats that paralyzed Springfield, Ohio, based on his racist lies. Yet, he did nothing to calm that volatile situation, he just doubled down on the hatred and chaos. That's all he does.

In recent years, [the bonus you get from incumbency has been growing smaller, but still offers 2-3 points advantage](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-was-incumbency-worth-in-2018/).\n\nYour approval ratings have to be *really* bad for it to be worth it to the party to sacrifice that incumbency bonus. The only time it's happened in the era of the modern presidential election was in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson performed badly in the early primaries and his approval ratings dipped into the mid-30s over his handling of the Vietnam War, and he decided not to continue running again. (Worth noting that a mid-30s approval rating was basically unprecedented in 1968, and Johnson spent most of his early presidency above 50% ... nowadays both Trump and Biden have spent most of their presidencies hanging out in the high 30s.)\n\nAlso because of the benefits of incumbency, it's basically impossible to win a primary against an incumbent president. This has never happened, and because it's so impossible, usually the only people who even try are cranks. The closest a Democratic candidate has gotten to winning a primary against an incumbent president was [Ted Kennedy's challenge against Jimmy Carter in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries).\n\nSo are there politicians out there who could probably outperform Biden against Trump? Yeah, absolutely. But they didn't beat Biden in the 2020 primary, and they didn't bother to run against him in the 2024 primary because they knew they'd lose. So they're completely unproven in any kind of actual electoral situation.",

For those of you who are supporting Kamala, yet believe it will be Kamala/DNC's fault if Trump wins, how is it that you all are turning a blind eye to the fact that polls from late 2023 and early 2024 showed even Biden ahead of Trump when people were asked who they'd vote for if Trump was convicted on the J6 charges? I mean, if Biden was ahead of Trump in the instance where the latter is convicted on J6, it's clear that in that scenario, Kamala would win in a landslide even picking up states like Florida and Texas in addition to sweeping all of the swing states. However, SCOTUS is the reason to why Trump ended up escaping accountability prior to the election which is why I say that it will be their fault if Trump wins, and I just can't understand how even Kamala voters are turning a blind eye to how early polls have proven that Trump would have zero chance if he was held accountable for what he did on J6.",

It was blatantly obvious that any federal prosecution of Trump would get bogged down in the courts so waiting until last year to get them moving set up a situation where it was highly likely everything would get delayed until after this years election.\n\nThirdly it's ultimately the voters that are responsible for Trump. Without their support the GOP would've ditched Trump after the attempted insurrection on 6 Jan 2021.\n\nHowever depending on how you look at it you could just as easily blame the Democrats for creating the situation in the first place. They were the ones who decided in the mid-1960's to splinter their White working class base by jumping into the culture wars on behalf of minority grievances and then in the late 80's-early '90's they abandoned them economically as well to serve Wall Street.\n\nSo you could just as easily say that if the Democrats had not abandoned their White working class base, who had given them all their power in the 1930's-1960's, that Trump would've never gotten anywhere near power in the first place.",

One of the main planks of the GOP platform is cutting a ton of regulations on businesses, as has always been the case. Both parties cater to big business and the elites to a certain extent at this point. They also both care about \"the little guy\" to a certain extent.\n\nIt's well known that the Democratic Party has seen a gradual shift in its voter demographics over a period of decades. The proportion of Democratic voters who are non-college-educated whites has been on a steady decline for more than 70 years and was overtaken by college-educated whites in 2020. As they got more support from college-educated whites, that led to more support among wealthier white-collar professionals and certain big businesses owned by those college-educated whites. That gradually changed who they catered to. They still have a lot of support from non-college-educated nonwhites as well, even more than college-educated whites, so they aren't only focused on white-collar professionals and big business, but they do tend to be more focused on issues that people living in cities care about while ignoring some rural and small town issues.\n\nHere's a pretty good article on it: https://manhattan.institute/article/the-rise-of-college-educated-democrats\n\n> Isn't it harder to sell the argument that the GOP doesn't care about the little guy when it seems that the only people who support him are, in fact, the little guy?\n\nI wouldn't call Elon Musk or Miriam Adelson \"the little guy.\" They support him.",

Further, my point was never that none of the wealthiest people in the world support Trump, it was that it is a lot harder to sell the argument that the GOP is the party of big business when every big business is lining up behind the democrats.  Additionally, the claim that a billionaire has led the party for the past 3 cycles isn't wrong, but that kind of falls flat when there has been a lot of discussion and news cycles surrounding democrats claiming he is not worth anywhere close to what he claims.\n\nLook at the spat that's occurring at The Washington Post right now.  People are livid with Jeff Bezos because he decided to endorse no one.  He is being raked over the coals because he didn't oppose Trump.  Not because he is supporting him, but because he thinks that it will help journalistic credibility if the Post endorses no one.  There is no one being pilloried because they traditionally support the GOP but have declined to support either candidate this cycle.  People are even trying to rehab Dick Cheney's public profile because he opposes Trump. Dick. Fucking. Cheney. A person who the left views as a war criminal who gives absolutely no shits about the rights of Americans is being celebrated, not because he recognized he was wrong to do the things people hate him for, but because he is opposing Trump and people think that will help beat him.\n\nLastly, to your point about Trump being a billionaire.  He has significantly more money than Romney and, yet, the entire campaign against Romney was centered on the proposition that he was an out-of-touch, elitist, extremely wealthy individual (EDIT: AND IT WORKED SPECTACULARLY).  That was never the case with Trump, which you would think would have been a pretty good line of attack against him.  Now, you could argue Clinton was not a good messenger for that attack given her wealth, but still, from the beginning of his candidacy, every institution and powerful business has opposed him.  Even Elon's support of him is more likely because the democrats keep dicking with his companies and refuse to acknowledge Tesla's success because their employees are not part of the UAW.  Prior to the Twitter fiasco, democrats loved Elon.  It wasn't until he bought Twitter, stopped letting liberal politics dictate how its content is moderated, and exposed how much the past owners had bent to political pressure from left leaning politicians that he became persona non grata in the democratic political circles.",

For example, the oil and gas industry is backing Trump. Same with the coal industry. Same with certain segments of big tech, like Larry Ellison and Oracle.\n\n> Look at the spat that's occurring at The Washington Post right now. People are livid with Jeff Bezos because he decided to endorse no one.\n\nThey're livid because they think billionaires have too much influence and this is just one more instance of it. The editorial board of the Post wanted to endorse Harris. Bezos stepped in to stop it. Bezos isn't a journalist. He knows nothing about what journalistic credibility is. Him sticking his fingers into the editorial decisions of the Post is what's going to sink its journalistic credibility because now everybody is going to wonder if he's intervening in other aspects of the Post's journalism, like which stories to run.\n\n> People are even trying to rehab Dick Cheney's public profile because he opposes Trump.\n\nI don't think anybody is trying to rehab Dick Cheney's profile. Various people thanked him for endorsing Harris and putting party over country. They can thank him for doing a good thing for once while simultaneously recognizing that it doesn't make up for all of the bad he's done.\n\n>  Prior to the Twitter fiasco, democrats loved Elon.\n\nNot really. They started to sour on him around the time he called that guy who rescued the kids from the cave in Thailand a \"pedo guy\" because he criticized Elon's ridiculous submarine idea. It all went downhill fast from there.",

However, when it seemed that he was finally going to face accountability for his actions following the DC Circuit opinion in early February that shot down Trump's dumb immunity claims, the conservative justices on SCOTUS interfered and did everything possible to ensure that Trump escapes accountability for what he did even going as far as to reverse the DC Circuit opinion and actually grant him some immunity.

These investments will be exempt from taxation under IRC \u00a7501(c).\n(3) Ten years prior to eligibility for Social Security benefits, the funds shall be transitioned from the SP 500 into U.S. Treasury bonds to reduce risk and provide stable returns.\n\nSection 4: Amendments to Existing Laws\n\n(a) The Internal Revenue Code \u00a786 shall be amended to include a new subsection stating:\n\"Social Security benefits received under Title II of the Social Security Act shall be excluded from gross income for all federal tax purposes.\"\n(b) The Social Security Act shall be amended to incorporate provisions authorizing the investment strategy outlined in this Act.\n\nSection 5: Enforcement Provisions\n\n(a) The U.S. Treasury, in coordination with the IRS, SECA, and FICA, shall oversee the establishment and operation of the Social Security investment brokerage.\n(b) Annual performance reports shall be submitted to Congress to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nSection 6: Funding Mechanisms\n\nThis Act requires no additional funding, as Social Security investment operations shall be supported through existing Social Security tax revenues.",

Harris is way better for freedom of speech.\n\nDemocracy:  Harris appears committed to maintaining the ability of the American people to vote and to my knowledge will respect the results of elections.  Trump has said that 'you won't have to vote anymore' after electing him, and after his loss in 2020 he continually claims that he won, started a smorgasbord of schemes of varying levels of legality that ultimately resulted in a mob attacking congress as they certified the election, getting several people killed.  Trump's rhetoric causes Americans to not believe that their vote matters and that there is massive election fraud which is damaging to our democracy because it isn't true.\n\nIndividual Liberty: Harris herself owns a gun and says that she won't be taking anyone's guns away, which is more or less Trump's position.  On abortion however Trump wants to take away women's individual liberty to make that choice for themselves and have their State Government make that choice for them.  Harris wins on individual liberty.\n\nWar / Diplomacy:  Harris has been involved in support for Ukraine which I believe we should continue to give (and increase, if anything).  \n\nTrump was an international catastrophe for the standing of the U.S. among nations. He cozied up to dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un while getting into pointless fights with our NATO allies. He made wild promises like he would make Mexico 'pay for the wall' (Mexico did not). When MBS had a hit squad dismember a U.S. Resident (Kashoggi) Trump helped sweep it under the rug. He withheld military aid to Ukraine for personal reasons (turns out, military aid was really important there!) to try to get political dirt on his opponent. After the Kurds helped us by fighting and dying as our ground forces against ISIS, it took all of one phone call from Turkey for him to completely and utterly abandon the Kurds in Syria. Much like the Mexico wall thing, he has claimed that he could 'end the Ukraine war in one day', which is ludicrous on it's face and of course he won't say exactly what he would do (I assume he'd probably just abandon the Ukrainians).  \n\nInflation:  Biden / Harris have been getting this under control.  Trump's plan for massive tariffs (which are a big tax on American companies and ultimately the American consumer) would most likely increase inflation dramatically and make it a problem again.  \n\nI'm out of time so I'll leave that as my argument for now.",

Both candidates took a light stroll to nomination this year let\u2019s be honest , the public had no say which is a huge issue. Someone like Kennedy had a higher favourability but the democrats didn\u2019t even hold a primary in which for him to compete. The media talks to one side of the aisle in an inflammatory and callous way, I watch all the partisan news on social media and tv and it\u2019s just designed to be a spectacle, they say the exact same things about each other - it\u2019s actually not just dystopian, but also patronising , because it\u2019s taking away the fundamental right of Americans to select the best president to run the country. \n\nSince I never have the chance to ask democrat voters. Do you feel second hand embarrassment when Harris doesn\u2019t know what to say when her teleprompter turns off, or defaults to saying the same political rhetoric in interviews whilst avoiding the question? Or is it that you feel that Trump is MORE of a danger than she is? Do you in fact just not feel she is a danger because you think it wouldn\u2019t be her running the government, but rather the deep state? And are you fine with not really knowing who is running the government? \n\nMy criticisms of Trump centre mainly around his appointments in his last term, his lockdowns, and his inability to stand up to pressure from within. Here are my criticisms of the democrat party:\n\nThey are the side of war, censorship, racism, 3 letter agencies, diabetes, over medicalisation, celebrity endorsements, main stream media, aesthetics over substance, mass immigration, fentanyl crisis due to lack of boarder control, concealing the presidents health and saying there\u2019s no need for a primary (Russian level lack of democracy), and then putting in the most unsuccessful candidate in the 2020 primaries, pretending the deep state didn\u2019t interfere with elections in favour of the democrats despite them admitting they did, still pretending the covid vax stopped transmission despite the fact it didn\u2019t (it also didn\u2019t stop you getting sick) , claiming the west has no part to play in the Russian Ukraine invasion and simultaneously pretending that Harris will be much better than Biden whilst she\u2019s said she\u2019d have done nothing differently. Don\u2019t forget when 60 minutes edited her answer, arguably to boost her campaign, which would be election interference alone. Both parties are obviously involved in election interference, both the dems are more of a big money machine, so it\u2019s more them. \n\nUhhh that\u2019s all I can think of off the top of my head but again I do genuinely believe both party\u2019s suck I whole heartily believe Americans need a third party to be able to vote for - because it would make dems and reps have to work a lot harder .

The president does not run oversee or design the election, but no meaningful evidence of voter fraud in the last election was ever found. What do you expect either candidate to do on this topic?\n\n\ndemocracy/ individual Liberty: This is an extremely broad topic, what specifically do you mean?\n\n\nWar/ foreign diplomacy: Trump has consistently refused to say how he will \"end wars in 24 hours.\" It sounds like a ridiculous promise more than anything else. Harris has not given some unrealistic promise about bringing about world peace, but her resolutions to stand with our allies and not let powers like Russia do as they please is at the very least realistic. Trump has claimed that there were no wars while he was President, and maybe that's true, but that statement kind of exposes the flaw in his methods: he effectively threatened and bullied nations into compliance, which may be an effective short term strategy, but we're currently living in the long-term consequences. Say it works, he effectively blusters and threatens russia into withdrawing from Ukraine entirely (unlikely at this stage) what happens when his term is up? Do we have to elect another president with the exact same attitude? How long until those threats are no longer effective? After a certain point, someone will test them and then we have an actual war. Harris' strategy of continually supporting Ukraine financially keeps American soldiers from being on the frontlines, unlike in Afghanistan. Trump's \"strategy\" would make that inevitable at some point or another.\n\n\nInflation/costs: Harris has laid out plans to force companies to end price gouging, a major contributor to oversized inflation. Trump's plan is to encur tarrifs which are historically proven to increase inflation dramatically, and every major economist agrees with the assessment that while both plans drive up national debt massively, Harris' plan does so at a drastically lower rate than Trump's (to an estimated 17 trillion dollars).\n\n\nHealth: Trump has no plan. He said in the debate he has no plan. Harris has plans for how to reduce the cost of medicine and how to improve healthcare access.\n\n\nEnvironment: Trump wants to roll back what enviornmental protections we have, not improve upon them. Harris largely wants to continue the ones we currently have.\n\n\nCulture wars/ Racial tensions: Sadly, not something the President can directly address, but Trump's rhetoric has not helped in this at all.",

The party doesn't have the capability of running their own primaries in every state.\n\nKeep in mind that voters don't directly choose the nominee when they vote in primaries. They're actually electing delegates to represent their state at the national convention, and those delegates are the ones who actually pick the nominee. Elected delegates pledge themselves to cast their vote at the convention in a way that \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,\" so if the candidate they're pledged to withdraws for some reason, then the delegates have the responsibility of using their own best judgement to cast their vote for a different candidate that they believe their voters would want.

Also, Biden endorsed Harris. Both of these combined made it an easy decision for his delegates to decide how best to represent the people who elected them.",

Possibly, yes. Certainly, nah. One would hope though.\n\nAs for the other part of your answer, I think it's a pretty good take. I didn't consider that senility might be the \"thing\" that I was picking up on. Which actually makes perfect sense. I had described it as \"simple\", or a child-like quality. Said that I felt bad for her, or at least like she was somewhat vulnerable, essentially. So... that checks out and is... I think I'm able to get my head around my reaction to seeing her, speak and move, behave, whatever you would characterize that as. \n\nIt could also be the case, and not run contrary to your pointing to her having been public for years. Because, after all, these things are progressive and by definition, functions of time.\n\nRegarding my \"judgement\", look, true the sample size is small. And certainly, anybody can be shown selectively in a way that misrepresents them. But in the context where I saw her appear, these are not 'enemy camps', or 'unfriendlies', or really adversarial environments in any way, is my assumption, and I'm pretty confident that I'm not mistaken in thinking that. Like these people hate Trump and they are happy to hate him and not deny it, and it's their right to do that, and I support that right. But the enemy of my enemy is my friend, therefore I must conclude that they have this woman's back 150%, and so I had trouble making sense of the exposure she was being given. But I think you are correct, whether or not you meant it this way, but it's an 'age thing'. There was definitely some degree of senility, or age related dementia. \n\nIn terms of what that means, if it matters, is related, not related, factors is, is irrelevant... I have no idea. And it doesn't matter what my opinion is, if I even had one. But I'll add one more judgement to the pile, just for good measure: it likely did not occur to me, the age factor, because damn!

That would be such an utter betrayal by the liberal justices.  The conservative justices helping Trump delay the trial and ultimately win the election (polls have shown that Trump is in deep trouble if he's convicted in the Jan. 6 case by the time of the election) isn't surprising at all, but the liberal justices doing so as well would be beyond baffling, and they would've betrayed our country and our democracy big time if Trump were to win as a result of this.\n\nIt would especially break my heart if Justice Jackson betrayed us to the point where Trump is re-elected and we become a dictatorship because one, she was appointed by Biden who's the candidate that's going up against Trump again, and two, her being confirmed onto SCOTUS was really special to me, and she became my favorite justice on the bench.

Now, as adults in our thirties, we still hang out, but things between us are different.\n\nDan was always a shy, quiet guy, not exactly introverted (likes company of people but is never the center stage). Was kinda average at school, but got better over time and actually went to study and get a degree, so definitely not a dumb guy. I feel like he is extremely apolitical and has no strong opinions kn anything besides basic stuff like \"murder bad\" or \"rape bad\". He undoubtedly has a heart of gold and I feel like he intuitively knows good from bad.\n\nMike was, like me, the \"smart kid\", really loud, opinionated, good grades. Looking from today's perspective, that's where similarities end. Over time, he became very conservative, very religious, probably not very racist but pretty homo/transphobic, a sucker for Russian/Chinese propaganda. I OTOH became very liberal and left-leaning. I am very supportive of queer people, I kinda struggle agreeing with the non-binary/genderfluid/they/they/neopronoun and man-over-bear stuff, but I am very pro gay marriage and trans people transitioning, and I despise the Russian/Chinese propaganda. I am also irreligious and for stricter separation of church and state. Mike falls for rightwing propaganda like \"Netherlands has a pedophile party in Parliament\" and \"The Government pays 10000 for trans people transition surgery in Germany while our people hunger!\"\n\nMike and I both value friendship and helping friends, but I feel like I can not stay friends with him when a lot of people I care about are asexual, bisexual, possibly trans. I can't stay friends with someone who feeds me lies instead of debating based on facts. I am not happy about it, but whatever.\n\nI fear for Dan, however. Dan and Mike are likely closer than Dan and I am. One reason is that I went to study/work abroad, and rhe two of them hang out more often. I am grateful to Mike for being a great friend to Dan, but I fear what will happen if shit hits the fan and the left and right need to fight it out. I fear their friendship will end if Dan ever turns out to be gay/trans/finds a trans partner. And if not - I fear Dan and me drifting appart if he takes on the more conservative stances.\n\nAt the same time, I don't feel as close to my other liberal friends. We hang out and help each other in need, but I kinda feel it is superficial. If we are ever away, it is hard for them to contact me first and almost all communication is initiated by me.\n\nMy liberal friends and I have nothing resembling the friendship Dan and Mike have. And while Dan is not cinservative himself, I feel their friendship examplifies what I am trying to describe. As hateful as rightwingers/conservatives are, they are pretty close as long as nobody turns out gay or dates someone trans. Meanwhile, while my liberal friends are all for love and communism, they are pretty weak friends. \n\n\nBefore I realized this discrepancy in the \"amount of friendship\" I offer them and they offer me, I would have gladly given my kidney for all of them, and even now, I would consider it. But I honestly do not believe my liberal friends would give a kidney for me. Meanwhile, I believe wholeheartedly Mike would give his kidney for his conservative friends and even his life for Dan, and Dan would likely reciprocate.\n\nI know this is a lotta rambling and I base this on my personal experience, but it is what it is.\n\nThanks!!",

These three very talented people will be my eyes and ears, and I will get done what they suggest. It will again be, like The United States of America itself, The Golden Age of Hollywood!\u201d\n> \n> Trump\u2019s announcement comes four days before his inauguration in Washington, D.C., and as wildfires have destroyed thousands of homes and buildings in Southern Los Angeles. Many businesses are struggling to recover, and the cost is estimated to be around $250 billion. The domestic box office in 2024 was also down from the year prior, as the Hollywood release calendar took a hit from the 2023 actors and writers strikes. Last year\u2019s revenues were $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019, the last pre-pandemic year, which reached $11.3 billion.\n> \n> Stallone, Gibson and Voight have been vocal Trump supporters in recent years. Stallone introduced the President-elect at a Mar-a-Lago gala in November, calling him the \u201csecond George Washington\u201d; Gibson voiced his support for Trump and slammed Kamala Harris\u2019 intelligence ahead of the 2024 election; and Voight spoke in depth about his admiration of Trump in a Variety cover story last year.\n> \n> After being blacklisted from Hollywood for years after antisemitic comments, Gibson returned by directing the Oscar-winning film \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d in 2016 and has an upcoming action movie, \u201cFlight Risk,\u201d starring Mark Wahlberg, out on Jan. 24. Stallone has recently starred in the Paramount+ drama \u201cTulsa King\u201d and co-wrote and produced the upcoming Jason Statham action movie \u201cWorking Man.\u201d Voight most recently appeared in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis\u201d and the biopic \u201cReagan,\u201d starring Dennis Quaid as President Ronald Reagan.\n\nhttps://variety.com/2025/film/news/trump-sylvester-stallone-mel-gibson-jon-voight-ambassadors-hollywood-1236276088/\n\n...with one poster making this comment:\n\n> I work in hollywood. We\u2019re screwed \ud83d\ude2d\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1i2xfra/trump_names_sylvester_stallone_mel_gibson_and_jon/m7ic771/?context=3\n\n...and another poster making this comment:\n\n> Sounds like laying the groundwork for McCarthyism 2.0\n> \n> Ronald Reagon cut his political teeth on giving testimony to the House Un-American Activities Committee ratting out suspected (or lacking evidence fabricating) communists in the film making industry.\n> \n> Every accusation is a confession. Trump wants to blacklist progressives and likely even eventually liberals from Hollywood.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1i2xfra/trump_names_sylvester_stallone_mel_gibson_and_jon/m7idc2n/\n\nThe thing is, almost entirety of Hollywood these days are against Trump, meaning that Hollywood itself might cease to exist entirely if Trump does something like that. In fact, based on those comments, do you guys think:\n\n1. Hollywood will cease to exist entirely due to most people working there getting blacklisted?\n\n2. Hollywood itself relocating to a foreign country in order to avoid prosecution and/or the second Red Scare?\n\n3. Films that promote diversity or so to get banned entirely and films that are in production like **Avatar: Fire and Ash** to get scrapped completely?\n\n4. Anime films, Indian films, Chinese films, and so on will start becoming highest-grossing films of all time including in the United States as they fill in the vacuum?\n\n5. People who used to be working at Hollywood will move to countries like Japan to continue their careers?\n\nWhy or why not? Remember, both comments have at least 3 or 4 upvotes.\n\nP.S. Considering that Supreme Court says that Trump can do whatever he wants as long as it's an official act, wouldn't it be possible that Trump will give out an executive order to get rid of \"progressives and liberals\" in Hollywood entirely?",

Of course, I think that kind of claim is very likely to be blown out of proportions at best, but Trump supporters might not care about that and believe anything that Trump says. I mean, conservatives could claim moral superiority by saying that they don't have a single child rape scandal attached to them whether that's true or not.\n\nBesides, as I've said before, Supreme Court said that Trump can do whatever he wants as long as it's an official act, so, at least in theory, Trump could give out an executive order to get rid of \"pedophiles\" from Hollywood and replace them with his supporters and make studios like PureFlix the biggest studio in the United States.

And if the people start realizing his main campaign processes aren\u2019t being achieved, this can absolutely be one of the many arenas he chooses to dig in on to further distract people.\n> \n> That\u2019s why I say, things are incredibly fragile. Way more fragile than people are willing to believe\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1i322xb/trump_is_making_mel_gibson_jon_voight_and/m7kpw8m/",

If Trump said \"everyone in Hollywood is a pedophile\" would that stop *you* from watching a movie? I doubt it.\n\n>Also, what about these comments?\n\nA bunch of random comments with nothing to back them up. For all you know, these are Chinese bots just trying to sow discontent and feed into people's paranoia.\n\nRemember how SNL relentless made fun of Trump and Trump constantly complained about it? Well, what did he do about it? Did he get SNL \"blacklisted\" somehow? No, they're currently celebrating their 50th anniversary.\n\nWhy do you think this time will be so dramatically different?\n\nBecause of the comments from people who think Trump is going to round up Democrats, immigrants, and the disabled and send them to *death camps*? Why are you giving any credence to comments that are either foreign bots or someone having a psychotic break?",

                            "body": "> Why do you think this time will be so dramatically different?\n\nWell, there was this article about Democrats possibly working together with Trump and/or Republicans:\n\n> **Resist or Coexist? Democrats Rethink Their Approach to Trump and G.O.P.**\n> \n> Elected officials across the party are engaging in a balancing act, signaling they have heard voters\u2019 demands for change while grappling with when to oppose Donald Trump.\n> \n> For much of the past decade, Democratic politics has revolved around opposing Donald J. Trump.\n> \n> But as he prepares to return to the White House again on Monday, some Democrats are exploring a different approach: carefully calibrated stabs at the idea of coexistence.\n> \n> In some of the nation\u2019s most liberal bastions, mayors and state officials are emphasizing quality-of-life problems close to home \u2014 and insisting they want to work with the incoming administration.\n> \n> On Capitol Hill, dozens of Democrats voted with Republicans to take a harder line on some undocumented immigrants, and Democratic senators released a video declaring that \u201cwe are not here because of who we are against.\u201d\n> \n> And prominent Democratic governors are highlighting areas of potential agreement, while also signaling that they have some policy red lines. As Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan put it in a speech on Wednesday, \u201cI won\u2019t go looking for fights. I won\u2019t back down from them, either.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cMy job is to try to collaborate and find common ground wherever I can,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said in an interview after laying out her approach to Mr. Trump in remarks at the Detroit Auto Show. \u201cThere will be moments where we can\u2019t, and I will have to be on the other side, but I\u2019m not going into it with that mind-set.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cPeople are exhausted,\u201d added Ms. Whitmer, a leading Democrat from one of the nation\u2019s most crucial battleground states \u2014 a place, she also noted, that both she and Mr. Trump have now won twice. \u201cThey want leaders who can solve problems and make their lives better.\u201d\n> \n> Taken together, a new and difficult Democratic balancing act is coming into view, as elected officials across the party try to show that they have heard the electorate\u2019s demands for change, while grappling with where to oppose Mr. Trump and how to talk about him \u2014 if at all.\n> \n> In tone and emphasis, it is a sharp departure from the brawling mood of resistance that characterized much of Democratic politics over the last eight years.\n> \n> Partly, that is an acknowledgment of political reality: Republicans are set to control all of the levers of power in Washington, and Democratic officials across the country will need support from the federal government.\n> \n> It also reflects how the anti-Trump fervor that was manifested in mass protests and shaped popular culture has given way to political disillusionment and burnout in left-leaning circles, at least for now.\n> \n> And while Mr. Trump lost the popular vote in 2016, some are grappling with the fact that he narrowly won it in November, in part by cutting into Democrats\u2019 traditional constituencies. A Gallup poll last month found more Americans approving of Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of his transition than at around the same time eight years earlier, though those numbers still significantly trailed other recent presidents-elect.\n> \n> \u201cBy winning a second time and by winning the popular vote, Trump now has greater legitimacy than in 2016,\u201d said Miro Weinberger, who during Mr. Trump\u2019s first term was the mayor of Burlington in Vermont, a famously progressive state where Republicans made surprising gains in the fall. \u201cThat is causing deeper reflection this time about the ways in which Democratic governance is failing.\u201d\n> \n> Of course, Democrats stressed in interviews, Mr. Trump, who will be the first felon to serve as president and whose re-election bid was opposed by some who worked with him most closely last time, has yet to take office.\n> \n> Once he does, the policies he and the Republican Congress pursue may well prompt the kind of broad backlash that propelled Democrats to many of their victories over the last eight years and create new pressures on elected Democrats to oppose him wherever possible.\n> \n> Honeymoon periods never last, and for Mr. Trump \u2014 an exceptionally polarizing leader in a closely divided country \u2014 it could be especially short.\n> \n> Efforts to check Mr. Trump are also already underway from a range of Democratic state officials and advocacy groups, especially in blue states, while Democrats from more conservative areas, too, have cautioned against over-reading the election results.\n> \n> \u201cMy takeaway is there is not a clear mandate, and that the people of eastern North Carolina, in particular, want us to come to Washington, D.C., and work for them,\u201d said Representative Don Davis, a North Carolina Democrat who won a district that also supported Mr. Trump.\n> \n> Democratic energy more broadly will not be dormant, lawmakers argue, if Republicans threaten the social safety net or target abortion rights. The far-reaching crackdowns on undocumented immigrants Mr. Trump has proposed also have the potential to create wrenching scenes with unpredictable political reactions.\n> \n> \u201cIf this administration and Congress attempts to institute a nationwide abortion ban, you\u2019re going to see that type of protest happen again,\u201d said Representative Susie Lee, a Nevada Democrat who won in a district Mr. Trump also captured in November. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re moving into a period where everyone\u2019s just going to, you know, sit back and let horrible policies like that be enacted.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIt\u2019s picking those areas where you have to hold firm, but without making it every single thing, a knee-jerk reaction to everything that comes out of the administration,\u201d Ms. Lee added.\n> \n> The fissures and dilemmas around how to do that are already coming into view, especially on the issue of immigration.\n> \n> Last week, the House passed a bill targeting undocumented immigrants charged with nonviolent crimes for deportation, with support from Republicans and nearly 50 Democrats.\n> \n> Representative Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat who opposed that measure, said he worried that some in his party were misreading the lessons from Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid, which included a promise to carry out mass deportations.\n> \n> \u201cThe first election, everyone thought it was just a fluke, and they felt like, you know, it wasn\u2019t where the American people were at,\u201d Mr. Frost said. \u201cThis time, there are a lot of Democrats that are worried that this wasn\u2019t a fluke, and this is what people want, the most extreme parts of his agenda.\u201d\n> \n> He warned against that interpretation, arguing that many Americans simply voted for Mr. Trump \u201cbecause he was effectively able to make this a referendum on how people feel about the economy.\u201d\n> \n> But Mr. Frost, who also described his party\u2019s messaging challenges, insisted that he was not in Washington \u201cto just resist.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cYes, we will be resisting and pushing back against parts of his agenda we disagree with, 100 percent,\u201d he said. But he added that he would > also look for areas of potential cooperation with Republicans, though he was skeptical of how much good-faith negotiating Republicans would be willing to do.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019m keeping an open mind for sure, but people can\u2019t blame me for coming to the table with an eyebrow raised,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not there to work.\u201d\n> \n> Representative Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat from a more competitive district, has in some ways laid out a similar approach toward Mr. Trump.\n> \n> He offered to travel to Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida home and private club, for negotiations concerning removing the state and local tax deduction cap. And he said in an interview that he would work with anyone, including Mr. Trump, to \u201cmake my community more affordable, more safe and more free.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cIf he\u2019s doing anything counter to those goals, I will fight to the end of the earth,\u201d Mr. Ryan pledged.\n> \n> Just don\u2019t call that resistance.\n> \n> \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the real world thinks about it that way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re thinking about their lives. They\u2019re thinking about putting food on the table, a roof over their shoulder. They don\u2019t want to hear the sloganeering.\u201d\n> \n> Misgivings about that r-word are not limited to House members from competitive districts.\n> \n> In 2017, Rabbi Sharon Brous, the prominent leader of a synagogue in Los Angeles, addressed the Women\u2019s March on Washington, describing the awakening of a \u201cspirit of resistance.\u201d\n> \n> Eight years later, Republicans are on the cusp of fully controlling Washington, crises abound abroad, Rabbi Brous\u2019s city is burning, and the political left, she said in an interview, has \u201cbecome so fractious, differences of position and perspective have become almost existential.\u201d\n> \n> At a moment that demands new relationship-building and more local organizing, she suggested, the word \u201cresistance\u201d feels less resonant now.\n> \n> \u201cI don\u2019t want to be lazy with language,\u201d said Rabbi Brous, who gave an invocation at the Democratic National Convention last summer. \u201cI want us to speak about what we\u2019re actually trying to do, what we actually believe in, and where can we unite?\u201d\n> \n> For former Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who lost in November but outran Vice President Kamala Harris, the answer to that is clear: advocacy for working Americans, many of whom have drifted away from the Democratic Party.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell my former colleagues, \u2018Resist,\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t resist,\u2019 \u2018Use the word resist,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMy mission is to make the Democratic Party the party of workers, like we used to be.\u201d\n> \n> He added: \u201cIf we start doing that and we make that contrast \u2014 \u2018Who\u2019s on your side?\u2019 \u2014 you know, whatever the other things that party activists, party office holders do, is just less relevant.\u201d\n\n(Continued in the next reply)",

For a long time, I believed the Democratic Party championed these principles. But lately, I\u2019m confused and honestly, a little disheartened.

How is that different from the discrimination we were trying to stop? I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t still work to do, but this approach feels counterproductive\u2014and, frankly, unfair.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fight against fascism. Of course, no one wants fascism, but the way it\u2019s being fought raises some questions for me.

I\u2019ve even seen people labeled as \u201cNazis\u201d just for having a different opinion. How is calling someone a Nazi, without engaging with their argument, a meaningful way to fight fascism? Isn\u2019t silencing people and avoiding debate exactly what fascists do?\n\nAnd here\u2019s what really confuses me: Why does any mention of government efficiency get such a visceral reaction? I thought we all wanted a government that works better, serves people more effectively, and doesn\u2019t waste money. But instead of real conversations about how to improve things, it feels like there\u2019s more energy spent enforcing ideological purity than fixing actual problems. Why isn\u2019t there more focus on making sure public services work, reducing bureaucracy, and holding institutions accountable? Shouldn\u2019t that be a non-partisan issue?\n\nI guess what I\u2019m struggling with is this: where\u2019s the logic and consistency? I want to see genuine, thoughtful efforts to improve things, not just ideological enforcement. I want to hear real debates about how to create fair opportunities for everyone\u2014not just for groups who fit into a particular narrative. I feel like the focus has shifted from solving real problems to performing ideological purity tests, and I don\u2019t understand how that helps anyone.\n\nI\u2019m not writing this to attack anyone, but to ask: where are we going with this? I want to believe that we\u2019re all still working toward fairness and equality, but some of these methods feel like they\u2019re doing the opposite.

Now not everyone or every effort to increase diversity is doing this, but it absolutely does happen.\n\nTake Ketanji Brown Jackson. When considering who to nominate to the Supreme Court, Biden said this:\n\n>\"While I've been studying candidates' backgrounds and writings, I've made no decision except one: the person I nominate will be someone with extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity - and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court.\"\n\nHe explicitly said that only black women would be considered to fill the vacancy left by Justice Breyer. Biden only interviewed black women for the position. This was not an instance of looking at the top people and *then* taking diversity into account. It was making race and gender prerequisites to even be considered.\n\nOr look at the official bio for LA's fire chief:\n\n>Creating, supporting, and promoting a culture that values diversity, inclusion, and equity while striving to meet and exceed the expectations of the communities are Chief Crowley\u2019s priorities, and she is grateful for the opportunity to serve the City of Los Angeles.\n\nShouldn't it be meeting and exceeding expectations while striving to create a diverse culture? You know, put firefighting first, then try to make it diverse and inclusive, not the other way around.\n\n>Censorship, deplatforming people, shutting down any opposing viewpoints\u2014these feel like the tactics of authoritarianism\n\nIt is. The left absolutely screwed up in ceding debate to the right. Not ceding *a* debate, but just ceding the realm of debate. Cal State cancelled a Ben Shapiro event because some students and faculty objected to his views. You know what Shapiro does during the Q&A of his events? He let's people who disagree with him jump to the front of the line. They want to deplatform him while he extends his platform to people who disagree with him. It's completely ass backwards.\n\n>And here\u2019s what really confuses me: Why does any mention of government efficiency get such a visceral reaction? \n\nThis one I can sympathize with the left on. Sure, everyone wants efficiency. But it looks like when the right talks about efficiency, they mean cutting government services, not making them run better. I don't trust that Trump and his team even has the skills to make things run better. Start with something small and show me a proof of concept demonstrating they can make a system run better, and maybe I'll think they've got a leg to stand on.",

Are you watching FOX News or something?\n\nYou've got a good explanation from u/Moccus for why you're wrong, but I'll expand on that. DEI initiatives NEVER make race the single deciding factor in hiring practices. They do not advocate for hiring unqualified people (as the President and Republicans have been insisting), based on race, gender or other categories.\n\nThe idea is that when you look at your pool of qualified applicants for a position, you also look at their peers and coworkers in that job environment. Are they all white men? Are they all black women? If they are, there is likely selection bias involved in who is being hired, and a DEI program tries to balance that. And race isn't the only consideration in DEI initiatives. They also consider whether a given working environment is hiring veterans and qualified disabled people. \n\nThere's a well known story about the downtown post office in San Francisco during the 80's and 90's. There were Affirmative Action complaints filed insisting that there were discrimination patterns in their hiring, because around 80% of the people working in the building were black. None of those complaints made it to court, because the Justice Department lawyers assigned to review the hiring practices there found that white applicants were being hired as often as black candidates, by percentages. There were more black employees there, because a great deal more qualified black people were applying, than white people. \n\nToday's DEI programs would want to figure out why there were so many more black people applying there than white, and address that (again, looking for selection bias). That's one of the reasons it's a smarter effort than the quotas set up by Affirmative Action programs. \n\nYou're always going to have an inaccurate understanding of any social issue, if you listen to the people who are opposed to it, and assume they are arguing in good faith, without examining the issue yourself. Do you believe Republicans when they say that Democrats support abortion \"Up to, and even after birth\"? Do you believe Republicans who insist Democrats support LGBTQ+ rights, because they support pedophilia? Maybe listen to what the Democrats are actually advocating for, before letting their opposition define them for you.",

Instead of fostering equality, it feels like we\u2019re enforcing a system where opportunities are denied to some people simply because of their race\n\nNobody is suggesting making race the defining factor in decisions. The idea is that after you've narrowed down your pool of candidates to a small group of qualified people, then you start taking diversity into account. The first and primary factor is finding somebody who's qualified. Diversity is secondary.\n\nThe issue with just ignoring diversity completely and trying to be race/gender blind in decisions is that there are things like unconscious biases, people who get jobs due to their connections who tend to be the same race as them, women who don't feel comfortable entering certain educational programs because it's so male-dominated, etc. You can claim you're race/gender-blind and still end up with a completely white male workforce due to these factors.

They don't believe that it's possible for government to work effectively, so there should be as little government as possible so that its ineffectiveness is limited.\n\n> Why does any mention of government efficiency get such a visceral reaction? I thought we all wanted a government that works better, serves people more effectively, and doesn\u2019t waste money.\n\nMostly because \"government efficiency\" is often code for cutting vital services and privatizing, which a lot of people disagree with.",

Anybody believing those types of things today is almost certainly going to be a supporter of the Republican Party. Do you think African-Americans should vote for the party that accepts those beliefs right now over the party that used to accept them but doesn't any more?\n\n> racist LBJ in the 1960s\n\nEven if he was racist, he and the Democratic supermajority in Congress oversaw a huge expansion of civil rights protections for African-Americans: banning discrimination in public accommodations, ending Jim Crow laws implemented by racist state and local governments, creating federal voting rights protections to prevent racist governments from abridging the voting rights of African-Americans, etc.. All of that was a huge victory for African-Americans and something they had fought hard for. It's not buying votes to do something good for your constituents. Of course, the end result of LBJ doing all of this was that those segregationist Democrats you were mentioning earlier gradually abandoned the Democrats, and the Republicans welcomed them with open arms.\n\n> \"bought\" the black vote with welfare money which destroyed the black family unit (sending thousands of black men to prison)\n\nIt isn't welfare money that's caused black men to go to prison. It's a combination of poverty (a side-effect of racist policies from before the 1960s) and bad drug policies starting with Nixon's War on Drugs (Nixon was a Republican FYI).\n\n> Why does the black race think they \"owe\" the democrat party, rather than the party of Abraham Lincoln?\n\nThey don't owe the *Democratic* Party anything. They vote for Democrats because they trust them to have their interest at heart more than the party that openly welcomes white nationalists into their ranks. The party of Abraham Lincoln doesn't exist any more.\n\n> Doesn't this explanation seem logical?\n\nNo. Like I said, the abusers left the Democratic Party and joined the Republicans after the Democratic Party decided that giving African-Americans civil rights protections was the right thing to do. African-Americans aren't clinging to their abusers by voting for Democrats today. They would be if they followed their abusers over to the Republican Party.",

Kamala on the other hand doesn't really have much baggage, and the ones she does (the border, fracking) they explicitly asked about too. January 6th for example, was the second time the Capitol got penetrated by a hostile force. The first time was *British troops back in the War of 1812.* And the mob that did it was his fans, and he took his sweet time to order them down. \n\n2. It's a meme floating around the alt-right against Haitian immigrants which recently arrived to Springfield OH, and he said he saw it on TV. There is literally no factual basis behind that, and the city itself said it wasn't true. (which is in a Republican state). It's fearmongering from conservatives.\n\n3. Trump simply lied more than Kamala, that's why they fact-checked him more. And they fact-checked him on egregious shit that has no basis in reality (pet-eating, killing babies after they're born). He actually lied a lot more and didn't get fact-checked that much. [Here's a breakdown from ABC](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fact-checking-kamala-harris-donald-trumps-1st-presidential/story?id=113567997). One side is an actual convicted felon, and the other a normal Democrat politician. One side's just worse than the other with the truth.\n\n4. Laws are passed through Congress. The Democrats need to control both the House and the Senate, and only controlled both for two years (2020, 2021). In that time, they actually did pass a lot of laws, but they only had a slim majority in the Senate, so the more liberal stuff was stonewalled by a few Democratic senators (which were much more conservative than the rest). The Dems also did try to pass a bipartisan border bill, but it was killed in the Senate because Trump wanted to keep the border an issue for the election, and his Republican allies in Congress followed suit. \n\n5. More number? If you're talking about stuff like \"millions of illegal immigrants coming through the border\", then he used more numbers cause he made it up on the spot. \n\n6. She plans to undo most of the Trump Tax Cut of 2018, which lowered the corporate tax rate and the general tax rate, including the top 1% of earners, reducing federal revenue and adding $4.6 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. [Harris wants to raise the corporate tax and tax on $400,000+ households to pay for all the stuff she's suggesting.](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/27/trump-harris-tax-cuts-00175441)\n\n7. Idk, that's the network's choice.\n\n8. The unemployment rate now under Biden (4.2%) lowered from its high point during the mid-2020 COVID recession (14%). He also gave stimulus checks during that time of crazy unemployment. The world's still recovering from COVID, which fucked up the global economy. Add a war in Ukraine, a major food producer and Houthis attacking supply routes, and yeah, grocery prices are higher. [The US though recovered much better compared to other countries. ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68203820) \n\n9. Use Ground News if you wanna see an aggregate of all networks and their headlines. IMO the way the media can lead is how they can *spin* the truth, not on whether something actually happened or not. \n\nLook, I know it seems like Trump's comically incompetent to Kamala, but we're used to people from both sides being somewhat in the same realm of sanity. This ain't the case anymore. The media isn't painting Trump to be an idiot, no one forced him to say the pet-eating line*.* People attack him by *simply quoting him back*. He said he lost the 2020 election \"by a whisker\" in an interview then claimed he was sarcastic a few days later. He is an actual criminal felon, convicted by a jury. Efforts to try and make Trump more reasonable and equal to Kamala honestly isn't really based on reality. \n\nWay I see it, the guy who was complicit in an attempt to overthrow the government is more likely to be a liar than the entire media apparatus having a conspiracy to pull him down.",

Why?\n\nBecause as VP, she doesn't have any real power, so no, she doesn't have any ability to do it now.\n\n> But where will the money she says she will give these people come from?\n\nShe would probably say that it will come from tax increases on the wealthy, but more than likely it will come from the same place as the money that replaced the revenue that was lost from Trump's tax cuts, i.e. additional government debt.\n\n> Prices of everything were lower (in my experience) when Trump was in office compared to Biden.\n\nPrices tend to rise over time on average because the Federal Reserve targets slightly positive inflation. It would be odd and likely concerning if they were lower under Biden than they were under Trump. It would indicate a severe economic recession had occurred, so people probably wouldn't be pleased about the situation.\n\n> Kamala claims it was the opposite.\n\nSource?\n\n> Who in the Biden economy is benefiting from him?\n\nReal wages have gone up significantly for the lowest-wage workers over the past few years, outpacing the rise in prices. It's the middle who has mostly been hurt because they just get the cost of living increases that don't outpace inflation, and they don't have enough investments to benefit from the rise in the stock market.\n\n> I'm from a low-income house, so does that mean rich people benefit from a democratic economy?\n\nThe rich find ways to benefit from the economy no matter who's in charge.\n\n> Where can I go to find the truth? I don't know who is actually telling it?\n\nLook at a lot of sources, preferably high quality sources like academic journals and raw data. Read them. Learn to understand them. Identify the discrepancies and figure out why different sources say different things. Draw your own conclusions. This takes time and effort, but it will get you to some semblance of the truth, and you'll start to notice when the media and/or politicians are omitting context and twisting facts.",

            "body": "> Why were a bunch of the questions directed at trump so specific and had negative underlying tones?\n\nA few things. One is just that Trump has said a lot more bizarre and troubling things; he and Harris weren't at all on equal footing in those regards. Another is likely bias form the moderators.\n\n>Why did Trump make such a weird claim about how immigrants were eating people pets.\n\nBecause it's been on social media and probably some conservative news outlets and he didn't bother to find out if it was true (there's no evidence that it is). He should have just stuck to the impact of our high immigration numbers. Springfield, OH is a city of 60,000 with 15,000 Haitian immigrants who arrived just in the past couple year.\n\n>The moderator fact checked Trump, but not Kamala.\n\nBecause Trump says more outrageous stuff and things that are more easily called out as obviously untrue. Harris also had her share of untrue statements, but they're less outrageous and more difficult to parse. She should have been called out for the \"fine people on both sides\" and \"bloodbath\" comments though as both were obviously mischaracterized and that fact is well known to the moderators.\n\n>Why hasn't Kamala done anything she claims she will do? She has the power to do what she says she will do now, but hasn't done it yet. Why?\n\nHarris herself has very little power. But, Trump really should have brought up that point at the start, not in his closing remarks. Then just reframe it as \"why hasn't *your administration* done this?\" rather than specifically Harris doing it, to avoid the quibble over Harris not being President, but she is the #2 in the administration.\n\n>Why did Trump use more number when talking and Kamala didn't?\n\nTrump likes numbers more, and likes saying bigger and bigger numbers. 21 million, but probably even more than that! Harris tends to avoid specifics, I think because she hasn't developed a lot of clear policy goals and she likely didn't want to get bogged down in details during the debate.\n\n>But where will the money she says she will give these people come from?\n\nSame as every Democratic proposal, taxing the wealthy. But I don't think she's broken down the numbers anywhere. And FYI, the money for small businesses would end up being very little. It's a tax break, so it would only end up going to share of small businesses that actually turn a profit and wouldn't help those struggling to reach that point.\n\n>Why did the woman moderator have way fewer questions than the guy?\n\nWho knows. They may have divided up their duties, such as one focusing on asking questions and one focusing on taking notes. We don't really know though.\n\n>Prices of everything were lower (in my experience) when Trump was in office compared to Biden. Kamala claims it was the opposite.\n\nI don't think Harris ever claimed prices were higher under Trump than under Biden.\n\n>Who in the Biden economy is benefiting from him?\n\nUnemployment is low and the stock market is booming. So, people who would otherwise be unemployed are benefitting, and so is anyone with investments in the market (and this includes things like retirement savings, so it's a lot of people).\n\n>Where can I go to find the truth?\n\nThat's going to vary based on the specific thing you want to know about.",

Being arrested for a crime doesn't necessarily mean you're guilty of that crime. Imagine getting arrested for an assault that you didn't commit and then getting deported on top of that. If they actually committed a serious crime, then they'll eventually end up in prison anyways when they get convicted, and ICE can come get them at their leisure. I don't think many people oppose the deportation of people who are convicted of serious crimes.\n\nHouse Bill 10 also contained some school voucher provisions that Democrats opposed, so it wasn't only controversial because of the immigration stuff.",

Illegal immigrants who risk deportation if they ever end up in police custody would understandably try to avoid any and all interaction with the police. An entire community of people who never report crimes to the police and never give witness statements is bad for the overall safety of the entire city. That's part of why there was pushback against this law. It was taking away the ability of local authorities to decide what policy was best for the safety of their city/county.\n\n> Should New Jersey not contact New York to let them know they've got you in custody?\n\nThe difference is that there generally aren't whole communities of people living in the same area who are all wanted for crimes in the next state over, so you don't have the same safety concerns where entire neighborhoods who won't talk to police.\n\nAlso, I don't think being deported to another country is comparable to being driven to the next state over to deal with a low level warrant.  It's easy to come back to New Jersey from New York once the warrant is dealt with. Not so easy to come back to the US once you're deported.\n\nAnd no, I don't think police in New Jersey should bother telling New York they have somebody who's wanted for a low level misdemeanor in this scenario.",

It can even get you shot and killed by police as we learned in the Justine Diamond case. Report domestic violence against you and they could very well decide you're the aggressor and arrest you. Report that you were attacked by some guy on the street and you fought back and they could decide you both should be charged with battery. There could be a clerical error at the court that results in a warrant that you don't know about, so as soon as you report a crime and the police take your information while interviewing you, they have reason to arrest you. These are all unlikely, but when you're facing deportation, why risk it?\n\n> And that bike thief is facing more severe penalties than you might think.

It's balancing the interest of enforcing every law against the overall public good. It's a crime for minors to drink, but in places like college towns where underage drinking is rampant, it's common to have a policy of letting the crime go when a drunk teen calls for medical assistance for their friend who drank too much. If we insisted on arresting every teenager we caught drinking, then we'd have a lot more kids dead from alcohol poisoning because their friends were too afraid of being arrested to call for help. Are we giving those teens free crimes?

If Putin had invaded at that point, then he would have reminded everybody that NATO isn't obsolete and serves a very important purpose.

And what is your objective metric for determining if a country is \"good\"?\n\nNorway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland are all countries with substantial socialist programs, a high level of personal freedom and a high quality standard of living. All of them have healthier and happier and safer populations than the United States. They have quality education free for all citizens and high quality healthcare for free. By most standards they would be considered \"left\". \n\nA better divide in assessing how well a country runs (focusing on the quality of living of its citizens) is looking at whether it is run democratically (including republics) or as an authoritarian state. Those countries of \"latin america\" you refer to, may be \"left\", but they're run by authoritarian governments. Russia is very much a right-wing authoritarian state, and largely a miserable place for most of its citizens. Authoritarian states are usually oppressive and abusive, catering to a small segment of their population.",

Their primary focus is around people's material wellbeing, not their rights.\n\nMoving on, I'll preface the next bit by saying I don't know much about the histories of Latin American countries, so I'm just going to offer a hypothetical to point out what could be a problem with the question.\n\nDuring WWII, Britain had to engage in rationing. Rationing is a policy that could be described as \"making sure everyone has enough\" (in terms of material goods, primarily food). But, post-war Britain with no rationing was much better off materially (including in terms of food). But if countries that engage in rationing are meant to make sure everyone has enough, why are people in countries without rationing so much better off?\n\nI think the flaw here is obvious, and it's because the question is sidestepping why a country would engage in rationing in the first place. Only countries with very scarce resources have to ration; countries with abundance do not. No surprise that countries with abundant resources are better off.\n\nI don't know if it's the case with the countries you have in mind, but I think a good place to start would be to look at just the underlying economic conditions in those countries before adopting socialist policies.",

Probably not but I think that kind of national identity is why birthright citizenship is a big deal to people.\n\nIn terms of why people think it's \"restarting the Holocaust\", it's pretty obvious Trump only wants to get rid of birthright citizenship because he hates illegal immigrants. The worry (and I'm not saying *I* think this will happen) is that Trump will push all of these different plans for rounding up and detaining immigrants under the guise of deportation, determine that due process takes too long and either use imprisoned illegal immigrants as a labor force or just straight up find reasons to kill them. Getting rid of birthright citizenship just means there's less legal headache to get to the detainment part, because rather than a potential family of 2 illegal parents and a child citizen, you can just say there's 3 illegal immigrants and throw them in jail.

I certainly hope that's not the case, but I've seen too many extreme case scenarios in recent years.\n\nAlso, could China start sending troops to Ukraine to help Russia after seeing North Korea doing such thing? Why or why not? If not, what's stopping them even though their economy is powerful enough to withstand global sanctions and actually cripple the entire world economy in return while their economy is left completely unharmed similar to how Russia's economy is apparently growing exponentially despite sanctions?",

So for that reason, I don\u2019t think their (currently) very limited involvement is enough to shake people\u2019s stances on the war and American policy there. If it escalates, that could be a different story.\n\nHowever, for some of the reasons you mentioned, I agree that this hurts Biden the most. On the Democrat side, they\u2019re reviving 2016-2020 arguments about Trump essentially cozying up to dictators like Putin and Kim. That doesn\u2019t resonate with people as strongly as it did then, and voters typically blame the government in power when times are tough. For example, the Biden administration has already taken considerable heat from voters about the deaths during the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Israel/Palestine conflict, and war breaking out in Ukraine in the first place. And, yes, many people will likely feel that NK wouldn\u2019t have gotten involved if Trump talked with them.",

The \"qualified\" part was the first and most important criteria.

It wasn't the most important.\n\n> Everyone is a secret Republican\n\nI didn't say everyone was a secret Republican. I said \"independents\" are almost all actually Democrats and Republicans who don't want to label themselves as such for whatever reason.\n\n> which is why the person who won the independent vote won every election in the 2000s\n\nResearch shows that there's a correlation between political engagement and how people choose to label themselves. The most engaged voters will identify themselves as either Republican or Democrat. These are the most likely people to show up to vote every election. Then you have the \"independents\" who still have a strong preference for one party or the other. They're less politically engaged and therefore less likely to vote, but when they do vote, they vote for the same party pretty much every time. They don't swing back and forth between parties from election to election based on who can persuade them. Then you have true independents, who basically just don't care about politics and rarely vote.\n\nThe winner of an election is typically the person who can get the best turnout from their base. If more \"independents who are actually Republicans\" are convinced to show up and vote than \"independents who are actually Democrats,\" then the Republican will probably win. That means the Republican ends up winning more \"independents.\" It doesn't mean there are a bunch of people who are planning to vote but can't decide who to vote for.",

Fair to say a bunch of them have probably passed or are no longer capable of voting after almost a decade.

The number of delegates is proportionate to the state's population, so California will get more than Rhode Island.

When he dropped out, that means that these delegates' votes were now unpledged, and hypothetically, they could support anyone. The party, though, obviously wanted to avoid a chaotic, divisive situation where everybody was fighting over the nominee at the convention--and the delegates tend to be faithful party members who don't want that either. So two things happened--first, Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris and said he wanted her to be the nominee, and second, Harris started calling up the state delegations to see if they would be willing to vote for her instead of Biden. Once enough states said they would transfer their votes from Biden to her, then she became the de facto nominee.\n\nIt would obviously be better if there had been a chance for voters to vote again--but primaries are a lengthy, expensive process, and had already occurred once this year. There was just no way to arrange anything like that again in just a month. And in such a short time period to campaign, Harris would have ended up the nominee anyway--she had a huge advantage in name recognition (and money), and it would have taken another candidate months to build a campaign that could compete with that.",

He can just send a letter to congressional leadership and stop the whole thing.\n\nIf there's proof that Biden is incapable of doing the job and is refusing to step down, then Congress is free to do its duty to impeach and remove him for endangering the country. It's significantly easier to do that than to forcibly remove a president via the 25th Amendment.",

What do you say about that if he's mentally fit why isn't he sitting at the head of the table answering questions instead of his wife answering questions says he sits her drooling. I do not know the exact procedures but it is in the Constitution when the president is not fit for duty the vice president is constitutionally ordered to step up and take over. \nAnd yes he was in situation where he wasn't prosecuted because after a lengthy 5-hour interview it was decided that a jury would never convict because he would be seen as a nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory. This is the $345 page report when they're trying to convict him handling classified information like an elderly man with poor memory which is illegal and which means that he is not mentally fit to be in the situations anymore if a president of the United States cannot handle classified material that he can't be president either and constitutionally the vice president was supposed to step up and take over the job. She want to take back your statements about being mean a liar cuz I looked this up as I was writing it nothing I said was a lie might not have been exactly correct according to you but you didn't offer anything else as solutions to prove me lie except for you said so. If you and your right mind whatever you want to call that think that Joe Biden is mentally fit to be a president you have a problem with your own mental capacity. Two and a half years ago I could look at him and I could tell that he was in a no state to be the president of our country. He looked lost all the time he's fumbling his words he reminded me my grandpa when he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I mean for Christ's sake the man had his wife in on top secret confidential meetings and she was answering all the questions and making all the statements what he sat there literally drooling. And by the way that is illegal too she was not elected in at all she's got no top secret clearance I don't think and she's no business being at these meetings when the American public doesn't know. It's against all laws and if Kamala was a competent person she would have been the person to do it but no she decided she wanted to be president so she did not do her constitutional duty and step up and do what she supposed to do. And that is another reason why she should have never been president. Have a great day though. Hope you have a great career calm people liars for no reason",

When a president is no longer mentally fit to handle his duties you're supposed to step up and take over the office.\n\nShe can't. The moment she tried it, Biden would send a letter to Congress disputing that he's not mentally fit and he would instantly be back in office. It's not a viable plan. The 25th Amendment is for situations where the President is literally unconscious and can't do anything, not for situations where the President is a little slow. It doesn't work that way.\n\n> And yes he was in situation where he wasn't prosecuted because after a lengthy 5-hour interview it was decided that a jury would never convict because he would be seen as a nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory.\n\n1. Being seen as a nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory isn't the same thing as being mentally incompetent to stand trial. The prosecutor was predicting that the defense lawyers would try to get the jury to see him that way in order to garner sympathy. He wasn't saying that Biden is definitively mentally unwell.\n2. That's not why he wasn't prosecuted. He wasn't prosecuted because the prosecutor lacked sufficient evidence to prove that a crime occurred beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecutor listed off the pieces of evidence he had that indicated a possible crime, and in every case, he pointed out a possible alternative explanation that would indicate no crime had occurred. That's reasonable doubt, so the prosecutor essentially said that a jury shouldn't convict him even before he talked about the \"nice elderly gentleman with a poor memory\" thing. He brought up the \"nice elderly gentleman\" thing to point out that if the defense got a jury to view him that way, then they would be even more likely than normal to look for the innocent explanations, making it even more difficult to get a conviction.\n\n> This is the $345 page report when they're trying to convict him handling classified information like an elderly man with poor memory which is illegal\n\nIt wasn't illegal, which is why he wasn't prosecuted.\n\n> if a president of the United States cannot handle classified material that he can't be president\n\nAgreed. Somebody should tell Trump to quit. He can't handle classified material.\n\n> and constitutionally the vice president was supposed to step up and take over the job.\n\nOnce again, she can't. The President would stop her because he's still conscious and capable of sending off a letter to Congress.\n\n> She want to take back your statements about being mean a liar\n\nNo, you're still lying.\n\n> And by the way that is illegal too she was not elected in at all she's got no top secret clearance \n\nThe President is the ultimate authority on who can receive classified information and who can't. If he brings her with him to classified meetings, he's essentially granting her the right to hear what's said, and nobody has the authority to question that. The President's daily schedule is classified, and the First Lady generally has access to that.\n\n> It's against all laws\n\nNope. Not against any laws.\n\n> and if Kamala was a competent person she would have been the person to do it\n\nShe can't. Not possible.",

If that definition applies to any illegal immigrants, it's not many, and like most crimes, treason requires intent. Unless you can show beyond a reasonable doubt that an executive order was created with the intent to help some subjects of a foreign power we're at war with get into the country more easily, then treason isn't going to apply.\n\nSecond, there are no executive orders that specifically allow illegal migrants into the country. Illegal migrants are coming in regardless of any executive orders that exist. The only thing executive orders do is set priorities for enforcement, which is a recognized power of the executive branch of government (known as prosecutorial discretion). Law enforcement resources are finite and will never be able to catch and prosecute every criminal out there. The police could spend all of their time trying to catch every jaywalker, but that would take resources away from enforcement of other far more serious crimes. It's the same with illegal immigration. We could devote all of our resources to catching every illegal immigrant who was brought here as a child through no fault of their own, grew up here, is fully integrated with our society, etc., but that would take away resources from going after illegal immigrants who are here to commit crimes via gang or drug cartel activity.",

The political parties are private organizations and have a lot of freedom when it comes to picking their nominee.\n\n> Did she take on all of his votes?\n\nBiden endorsed her for the nomination when he dropped out, effectively instructing the delegates bound to him to support her instead, which I believe all of them ultimately did.\n\n> Or am i mistaken that no type of votes have happened yet?\n\nThe official vote happened almost 2 weeks ago to ensure compliance with Ohio's ballot access deadline.\n\n> I saw some poll saying kamala is at 50% something and donald is noted as \"45%\" not sure what they are referring too and if that means RFK is the remaining 5%?\n\nPollsters call up a bunch of people and ask them about who they plan to vote for in the presidential election. The vast majority of people indicate they're either planning to vote for Harris or Trump. The remaining 5% are either planning to vote for one of the other candidates (RFK Jr., Jill Stein, Cornel West, Chase Oliver, etc.) or they don't have a preference towards any candidate and are undecided.

Actually, Republicans used to be the left-leaning party back during the Civil War era. \n\n> \"I'm objectively right, and if you don't see that, it's only because you're stupid.\"\n\n> You genuinely don't believe it's possible for someone intelligent to ever, in good faith, not agree with, in *your* own words, \"liberal ideology.\"\n\nI never said that. You are using the term 'liberal ideology' interchangeably with other terms and are making up an argument as a result. By proper definition, 'liberal ideology' means that you are willing to consider viewpoints outside of your own and accept change, which is a matter of stubbornness rather than intelligence. The leftists that you are generalizing may actually lean conservative, which I can agree with from experience.\n\n> \"anyone who disagrees with my political ideology is stupid and uneducated\"\n\nTo restate, it's not your political ideology but the Republican party specifically. The current party is corrupt, controlling, and downright harmful to society. There is enough evidence to prove this through the blatant lying, corrupt SCOTUS, incompetent Congress, and plans such as Project 2025. Have you also noticed that it's never the Democrats who are involved in scandals? \n\nAnyone who supports the Republican party is either uneducated & brainwashed, a controlling member, or has some sort of screw loose. That is a fact. I'm a centrist. I don't have a 1-dimensional political bias, but here I am voting primary party for the first time because I am absolutely terrified of what Republicans will do if they take over the government. \n\nIt's one thing to lean right or be conservative. It's another to support a corrupt political party. Have you noticed all of these former Republican politicians, including Dick Cheney, are now openly endorsing Kamala? \n\nAs I said, try fact-checking or asking for evidence from a Republican. They are either going to reference propaganda / opinion article, make up some bs, or go silent.",
