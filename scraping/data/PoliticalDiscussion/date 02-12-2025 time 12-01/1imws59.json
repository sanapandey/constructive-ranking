    "selftext": "Basically, imagine that a new bill has been made into law. Some people are furious and so they get enough signatories to demand a referendum be held on the bill. If the voters approve of the bill, it remains a law, if they don't, it is repealed. Different places have different rules on whether or not the law is provisionally valid pending the vote or not, and how many signatories it takes and how long they have to collect them, in the 23 American states with them it varies from 1.5% in Massachusetts to 15% of the ballots in the last election, and usually 90 days to collect signatures from the end of the session. Switzerland is a prolific user of this mechanism, and in Switzerland, there is no such thing as a court finding a law unconstitutional, the people alone decide whether or not to uphold a law or not.\n\nIt could also be incorporated into the way it combines with an executive veto. Iceland's president's veto over bills takes the form of referring the bill to the population to vote on whether or not to sustain the bill. This has been used a couple of times, notably in the Icelandic debt crisis where voters were referred a bill on a restructuring plan and was massively defeated with 98% of the voters opposing the bill with 62% turnout. In Argentina, if the president vetoes a bill, and the congress can't get 2/3 support in both houses to override but can get majority support, the bill goes to a referendum for judgement. You think this is a good idea?",

While the idea of working across lines is less common than it used to be, we have good evidence for that claim like how we can track legislators by how often they vote the same way as legislators of other parties, it is far from dead.\n\nAnd more importantly, you made it so that you were being critical of a mechanism without honing in on what actually is the underpinning of the mechanism.

This wouldn't be a popular vote, this would be another chance for money to influence policy.\n\n  \nAlso, not many controversial bills are independent bills.  They're small parts of larger bills.  The omnibus spending bill is a favorite among congressmen for sneaking random BS through.  Are we going to allow the public to veto the entire US federal budget?  \n\n  \nAnother problem is the logistics.  Would we have to schedule a special election every time a controversial bill gets passed?

Low turnout (like that 62% in Iceland) can make results unrepresentative, and complex legislative issues might get oversimplified into yes/no votes. A better approach would be to require a higher signature threshold (maybe 8-10% of registered voters) and implement a mandatory waiting period of 120-180 days before the vote to allow for proper public education and debate. This would help prevent knee-jerk reactions while still maintaining the democratic check on legislative power. The Argentina model seems particularly balanced since it only kicks in after regular legislative processes have been exhausted, though you'd want to specify a minimum turnout requirement to prevent a small minority from making decisions for the majority.",
