Other than a brief moment in 2011 with Occupy, the 2014/2020 BLM protests, and the women\u2019s march at Trump\u2019s first inauguration there have been little protest movements. Why did they happen so much more in the early 1900s and the 1960s? Are people less educated now than back then despite access to better resources? In general I just am confused why there is so much apathy when something such as a general strike involving tens of millions WOULD be so effectual? Is it organizational issues? ",

They are spread pretty evenly across geographic regions. As far as demographics go, more women vote than men do, so your non-voters are more likely to be men, who broke much more heavily for Trump. But younger people are also less likely to vote, and skewed more towards Harris. \n\nAt the end of the day, 90M people is just a *huge* number, and large numbers like this will almost always just skew towards the average.",

We're coming into Trump's second administration with high inflation and many feel they can't put 3 meals on the table. Lots of Americans are basically saying \"fuck all\" and want cost of living to be controlled. Rather than revolving around Trump, I think its more productive to see what Democrats did wrong on messaging in regards to the economy. Personally I think Democrats were screwed either way because of the \"soft landing\". They were implementing the right policies but continuing the status quo when Americans feel its not working is a recipe for disaster.",

One third of eligible voters saw what was happening in this country and still couldn't be bothered to take 5 minutes to vote. Also the fact that turnout was even lower in 2024 than 2020 is the reason Trump was able to easily win this time.

The democrats are afraid to upset the oligarchs because then their opponents have an easier time winning.\n\nAnd things like the coal wars were people standing up and risking death because they were already risking death and had almost nothing to lose. Americans will not stand up until things are untenable, because even when things are bad, most Americans are aware that it's a comfortable, easy sort of badness. There are enough social and work protections in Europe that they can afford more readily to stand up at 'I don't like this', whereas most Americans are hanging on to their welfare by a thread and know there's basically no safety net, so they don't stand up until it's 'I can't live like this'.\n\nLook at the protests after Floyd. People all over were protesting because they had the actual time and resources to do it. There are a lot of people who would gladly protest all of what's going on now all of the time. But most of the people who could go out and protest during pandemic vacation work 50 hours a week in a right to work job. When they have to choose between activism and making sure they get to sleep under a roof, or that their children get to sleep under a roof, they'll choose the latter",

Call him a stupid name and let it gain traction. Compare him to a ridiculous cartoon character and edit a photo to put his face on that character. Point out the ridiculousness. We have to do this in a way where people who voted for him see it and feel silly for supporting *that*. And it shouldn\u2019t even take that much for these people. They\u2019re the same ones eating up his dumb nicknames for Democrats. Bonus points if you\u2019re also artistic and can draw up your own caricature.",

Throughout history mass protests have been launched by literally destitute, beaten, starving people. \n\nLots of work for stagnating wages hasn't drained so much life from the American people that we can't find time and energy. That's naive and, frankly, demonstratively untrue considering the US has seen many shapes and sizes of mass demonstration in recent memory, from Roe v Wade to Floyd and more.\n\nWhat's happening is a few things. \n\n1. Optimized oligarchy. This comes at the expense of everyone underneath the ruling class, but we are not starving, the vast majority of us are housed, and we more or less get to enjoy day to day freedoms unless we're in a very small marginalized group of people. While a lot is objectively terrible, we're more comfortable than many and that doesn't lend itself to an uprising of the masses. \n\n2. Apathy. For better or worse our government is designed to stagnate, our elections are in many places a mere formality, and our system is ill equipped to facilitate rapid meaningful change. Most people are not politically informed enough to understand how to facilitate that change, and would still rather see a 4 year cycle through than burn the Constitution down and start over. \n\nThe stark divisions of state and federal powers also mean a lack of concentration, less bang for your buck. \n\n3. Manpower. We're pretty much divided down the middle, with smaller fringe pockets begrudgingly hopping in bed with people who prefer to live within the Overton window.\n\nFor every person who fights against something, someone else will defend it. For every boycott, someone else will buy 2. For every vote against, there's a vote for. And these lines have largely been drawn already. There's few minds left to change, and certainly not enough to tip the scales in your favor, whether that be democratically, via revolution, or something else.\n\nThese aren't universally hopeless or unchangeable necessarily, but they're nonetheless real and massive roadblocks to the type of action you're asking for.",

Resistance was quite on the tongue when he first got in, why is it seemingly less now?

That WAS their backlash against the status quo. I'm not sure why you think they'd be inclined to protest him over EOs they largely seem to approve of. Actually, now I'm seeing conflicting results w/ some saying his approval ratings are low, some high. But I think it's safe to say we're far from the point where enough of the US population is upset enough to take action.\n\nIt might appear otherwise just looking at reddit, but this is a concentration of very left-leaning people. It is very much not representative of the general public- hence, Kamala is not POTUS and Trump is.\n\nWe're only two weeks in, and I don't know that people's lives have been disrupted enough to spark a revolution. I know there is a general protest planned for Feb 5th at all the US state capitols (and maybe worldwide). Turnout at those will be interesting to see; I can't imagine they'll be as big as the 2017 Women's March but I could be wrong.",

I honestly don't know. A lot of Americans don't see the value of these agencies due to years of mistrust in the government fueled by Trump, COVID, and anti-establishment rhetoric.

Furthermore, the end of certain types of segregation meant Black people of all classes were no longer together-limiting the accessibility of organizing. Then later policies like the war on drugs further decimated communities. \n\nThe labor movement has also been severely weakened over time by chipping away at policy in favor of corporate interests. \n\nOur nation\u2019s history is taught in such a way in K-12 that students don\u2019t learn all the work and strategy that went into organizing. They graduate high school thinking you can randomly protest and sing kumbiyah to achieve change. They don\u2019t even learn the true stances of the leaders of these movements.

People on the left thought they were doing enough by voting, when the right has been building power all along. \n\nSo basically, we allowed the strongest organizers and the groups they come from to be killed off and weekend.

I was just about to reply to this nonsense when CryHavoc3000 so unceremoniously deleted them, luckily I habitually have multiple tabs open so I was able to get screenshots of how utterly nonsensical this persons argument was.\n\nThe Constitution ensures Rights and Due Process to anyone in the country. It doesn't say you cannot deport someone, it just ensures if you want to deport someone, you have to follow the Law and give them Due Process. We don't do arbitrary roundups in the USA. We don't just go around slow-rolling a van saying \"Wow, he looks mildly brown, must be illegal!\".. and immediately put them on a plane. That's not legal. \n\nAlso, I'm not sure about your comment about \"violating international treaties\". I'm not aware that other countries can dictate who or how we let people into ours or what protections we give them. Inside our country it's our rules. Our rules (the Constitution) say that everyone gets Rights and Due Process. \n\nThis is why the USA is \"the land of opportunity\". The idea that everyone gets the same Rights and Due Process is one of the underlying foundations created to try to help ensure everyone has opportunity to thrive and exercise their freedoms. It doesn't say \"ONLY legal citizens get X-things\". It says everyone does.",
