    "selftext": "Edward Snowden has been in the news recently. The Senate Intelligence Committee is conducting hearings to review the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard to be the Director of National Intelligence. In these hearings, there have been some intense exchanges regarding Edward Snowden. \n\nGabbard acknowledged that Snowden's actions were illegal, and she committed to preventing any such leaks in the future. However, she declined to call him a traitor after multiple Democratic senators demanded that she do so. Some Democratic senators seemed to feel that her sympathy for Snowden should disqualify her for the role. \n\nIn light of these hearings, it leads one to wonder, what are the Democratic views towards Edward Snowden and the mass surveillance program that he revealed? Is there widespread agreement among Democrats that Snowden is a traitor? Does the Democratic Party broadly support the surveillance programs? \n\nEdward Snowden says that he was inspired to leak the information after watching James Clapper deny the existence of these surveillance programs. How do Democrats feel about previous attempts to hide the existence of these programs? \n\nThe Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee seemed to have strong negative feelings towards Snowden. Is this a bias of the Senate Intelligence Committee? Or, is this a feeling that Democrats hold generally? \n\nWhat is the Democratic position on mass surveillance programs? Is this view consistent with their views in previous decades? Or, have the views of the party changed from what they were during the George W. Bush administration?",

However he's repeating and amplifying Russian propaganda and talking points. Shortly before the Ukraine invasion, he blasted Biden on Twitter for his \"lies\" about Russians building up troops on the Ukraine border, and it was  clearly a harmless training exercise where all the troops were simply getting ice cream.\n\n\nIf he can't live in Russia without being a Russian asset, the question becomes when did he become a Russian asset. Was it after he moved there? Because if the answer is no, then we need to ask if he was a Russian asset before his leak.\n\n\nI fall into this hole, where I want to believe Edward Snowden had to release this data as a matter of principle, even if it meant he couldn't live in the United States. But the second he's in Russia, all of a sudden he's willing to compromise to maintain status / freedom. His noble intentions only seemed to last long enough to damage the United States. I'm not saying he should have done the Chelsea Manning route, but the fact that he is inarguably posting Russian talking points raises a lot of questions.",

He was living in Hawaii, earning amazing money, had job security and was in the prime of his life.

A lot of Americans assume we're talking about the CIA when we talk about classified programs and such, but the NSA (largely involved in signals intel) has a budget 10 times larger than the CIA. \n\nThere are a fair number of countries that don't have extradition treaties with the US. Snowden likely picked Russia because it's industrialized and his programming skills would be marketable there. Russia certainly saw giving him sanctuary as a black eye for the United States. \n\nI don't really see his choice of Russia as being anti-American. If you look at a list of non-extradition nations, they're largely smaller, poor countries that could be easily bullied by the American State Department. His only reliable choices were Russia or China, and there's zero chance he could have gone to China without being (forcibly, if necessary) made into a state asset. It's worth remembering when he first fled the US, he went to Hong Kong. Likely he tried to broker a deal, but didn't like what he was hearing. \n\nIf Snowden had stayed in the US and allowed himself to be arrested, he very certainly would have gone to prison. There's a decent chance that he could have been pardoned at some point after that, but going to Russia and becoming a Russia citizen has made that almost impossible.",

There are differing reports on whether Russia wouldn't let him depart without a valid passport or whether Cuba (his next destination en route to Ecuador) was refusing to let the plane land in Havana if Snowden were on it, but either way, the passport problem wasn't exactly unpredictable. He knew it had been revoked already, and it was highly likely he was going to get hung up somewhere on the route.\n\nIt was also self-inflicted in the first place. Snowden could have gone straight to Ecuador or another country with no extradition with the US *before* he leaked the papers, and then leaked them once he was already safe. Deciding to leak them from HK--and then staying so long in HK after leaking them (over two weeks after his identity became public!)--was a big risk that was never necessary. \n\nI don't think Snowden was trying to end up in Russia, but it also pretty clearly isn't a situation that he was worried enough about to make *any* plans for how to avoid it. And hindsight suggests he should have been.",

Reality Winner did something very similar (in that they were both civilian contractors who leaked classified material, but not in the scale of the leaks), and only served 5 years. I can't think of any other equivalent situations, but the messy, hyper-aggressive and compromised way the government went after Ross Ulbricht (for his Silk Road website and a bunch of other antics, like murder for hire, etc.), could be a clear justification for why Snowden fled the country. \n\nSnowden's situation in Russia, having become a citizen, probably looks a great deal worse to most Americans since the invasion of Ukraine, then it did 4-5 years ago. I can't help but wonder if Snowden would have gone somewhere else, if he had known Putin would start that war, and Russia would become an international pariah state.",

Mostly, the protection act let \"whistleblowers\" keep their jobs or not be demoted. but even that isn't really protected. But the process is the punishment. Whistleblowers, who follow the law, still face \"punishments\" through the process. They won't be fired, but they can be suspended without pay while the process plays out. Which is one way they disincentivize \"whistleblowers\" but claim they're protected. Whistleblowers aren't protected in any meaningful way, just on the surface. \n\nThe other problem is that there are ZERO protections under the espionage act for anyone who discloses information to the public. According to the government and the law, no matter what the government has done or is doing wrong, they get to protect there ass under \"national security concerns\" and we aren't allowed to hear about it unless someone falls on their sword, like Snowden. \n\nAssume that you're a government employee and you found out that the government was shooting American civilians in the head everyday who they determined were domestic terrorists and threats to national security. For you to be \"protected\" you cannot inform the public. So in effect the government is fully in control of government wrong doing regardless of any public interest under the EA if they says its a national security threat. There is no public interest exception under the EA regardless if you take the \"right\" steps. Legally, there is no \"right\" way to inform the public about government corruption under the EA.",

Progressivism still falls under the umbrella of liberalism, and started as a reaction *against* far leftism in the years after the Gilded Age. People like Teddy thought that corporations that were good for people should stay, while bad ones should be trust busted, and that ethos still remains. There's still private ownership. \n\nCommunists aren't walking around calling themselves progressives. Calling each other a liberal in communist circles is an insult. Most communist sects don't even like other communist sects and have *wildly* different interpretations (see MLism vs anarchism), so of course some have fringe positions like supporting Russia. Ask the furthest left anarcho communist what they think about Putin, tho.\n\nProgressives aren't posting in /r/sino. The conflation of the two movements is done on purpose to make progressive seem wildly left, and that just isn't the case",

                    "body": "> I find it interesting that after that hearing, the questions you are concerned about are the views of the democrats and not the views of Tulsi. She had bold words supporting Snowden before but conveniently shed them at this hearing. \n\nI definitely noticed that. Its funny when the headlines are mainly concerned with her declining to call Snowden a traitor. But, in reality, she backpedalled quite a bit in her previous support for him. It makes you seriously question her sincerity, either before or now. \n\nI figured reddit is generally unfriendly to Trump. So, if I asked about the consistency of his appointees, mostly everyone is going to say that all of his appointees are obviously full of shit. So, that didn't seem like a worthwhile question. \n\nBut, I'm more interested in how the Democratic party is framing the discussion of Snowden and surveillance. From how the Democratic senators were talking, you might get the impression that the Democrats uniformly view Snowden as a traitor, and that this perhaps means they support the surveillance programs. I'm wondering if people support this framing and view it as representative of the Democratic party's overall feelings. \n\nThere's also a discussion to be had over whether the Republican party is tacitly backing down from their previous support of surveillance and condemnation of people like Snowden. But, I figured I'd try to keep the discussion more limited in scope.",

I personally think he could have explored more ways to get the information out to the public without risking the compromise of unrelated programs. He seems to have tried a few minimal things to raise the issue internally at the NSA and then jumped straight to fleeing the country with the data.\n\n> What is the Democratic position on mass surveillance programs?\n\nDemocrats are pretty much universally opposed to domestic mass surveillance programs.",

U.S. Cyber Operations & Hacking\n\n* The NSA was involved in extensive cyber espionage, targeting not only foreign governments but also corporations and international organizations.\n* Operations included hacking Chinese universities and telecommunications companies, including **Huawei**.\n* The **Tailored Access Operations (TAO)** unit was revealed as an elite NSA cyberwarfare division that specialized in hacking foreign networks.\n\n# 2. Foreign Surveillance & Espionage\n\n* The NSA spied on leaders of allied countries, including German Chancellor **Angela Merkel** and Brazilian President **Dilma Rousseff**.\n* **EU diplomatic missions** and the **United Nations** were also under NSA surveillance.\n\n# 3. Cooperation with Foreign Intelligence Agencies\n\n* The **Five Eyes Alliance** (U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand) worked together on mass surveillance.\n* British intelligence agency **GCHQ** tapped into fiber-optic cables to intercept global internet traffic through programs like **TEMPORA**.\n* NSA provided Israel\u2019s intelligence agency with raw, unfiltered intelligence, including private data of U.S. citizens.\n\n# 4. Corporate Collusion with the NSA\n\n* U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft were **complicit in PRISM**, a program that gave the NSA direct access to user data.\n* Telecom companies such as Verizon were **forced to hand over phone records** of millions of Americans to the NSA.\n\n# 5. NSA\u2019s Economic and Industrial Espionage\n\n* The NSA **spied on foreign corporations** and economic summits, such as **Brazil's Petrobras** and the **World Bank**, contradicting claims that it only targeted national security threats.\n\n# 6. XKeyscore & Global Internet Surveillance\n\n* **XKeyscore** allowed the NSA to **search and analyze vast amounts of internet data**, including emails, chats, and browsing history of people worldwide, without a warrant.\n\n# 7. Undermining Encryption Standards\n\n* The NSA **deliberately weakened global encryption standards** to ensure its ability to break into secure communications.\n* The agency worked with companies to insert **backdoors** into software and hardware.\n\n# 8. U.S. Drone Strike Targeting via Metadata\n\n* Intelligence gathered from surveillance programs was used to **assist in drone strikes**, sometimes leading to misidentification and civilian casualties.\n\n# 9. The Boundless Informant Program\n\n* A global surveillance data analysis tool used by the NSA to track and **visualize the extent of worldwide surveillance operations**.\n\nThese revelations showed the NSA\u2019s reach extended far beyond counterterrorism and exposed how deeply government agencies were intertwined with global surveillance, cyber warfare, and industrial espionage.",

In general I think Obama was one of the greatest American presidents the United States has ever had. Like many historians I put him in the top 10. However his administration's treatment of whistleblowers was awful. His administration weaponized the Espionage Act more than any other administration up until that point. \n\n2)The people saying Snowden should have \"used the proper channels\" aren't being serious. He did try to use the proper channels. He tried to use the proper channels when it came to the new media, and he tried to use the proper internal channels when it came to the intelligence community. And he was rebuffed at every turn. \n\n3)If Edward Snowden is going to be considered a bad person because he \"broke the law\" then you're going to have to include a lot of people on that list. Martin Luther King Jr broke the law for a greater principle. Muhammad Ali and many of the anti war activists during the Vietnam War \"broke the law\" when it came to the draft because they didn't want to fight and unjust war. Getting philosophical here, St Thomas Aquinas famously stated that an \"unjust law is no law at all\". So we have no business giving legitimacy to laws that are unjust, whether its laws around race in the case of MLK, the Vietnam War, or Mass surveillance that literally violated the privacy rights of American citizens guaranteed by the U.S Constitution. \n\n4)The people saying Snowden is a \"Russian asset\" are just engaging in Mccarthyite slanders. Snowden, while in Moscow, has criticized Putin on a number of occasions. One of the first criticisms he gave of Putin was Putin's own mass surveillance policies\n\n[https://time.com/68036/edward-snowden-vladimir-putin-nsa/](https://time.com/68036/edward-snowden-vladimir-putin-nsa/) \n\nHe also critiqued the corruption of the Russian government \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/29/edward-snowden-describes-russian-government-as-corrupt](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/29/edward-snowden-describes-russian-government-as-corrupt)",

It seems as though, in general, our Democratic reps have done very little to look into or push back against mass surveillance programs. What I take from this is that most Democrats are supportive of them, or at least not strongly opposed to them.\n\n\nOverall, while I think that the Republican party is very dangerous, in that it is supporting an actual con man/would-be dictator/robber baron with all its energy and resources, and as such, definitely represents the greater of two evils, *Democrats seem to be in office primarily to collect a paycheck and not to do their jobs of representing the public interest.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's what I think, and I could be wrong, because I'm not the most informed person, but given how things are working out, that's my impression.\n\n\n*I should add that this is at least partly because they have to spend half their time fundraising just to hold onto their seats, although I would imagine it gets easier the longer they've been around, which is a problem in and of itself because it means staid old-timers dominate both houses, and it's difficult to get motivated, new people and fresh ideas circulating in Congress.

When the Rosenbergs supplied the Soviet Union with atomic secrets, they were tried, and executed, for espionage, not treason.\n\nIn this instance, Tulsi Gabbard was correct. Given that, Snowden would be subject to punishment if he ever returned to the States. Note that I am not addressing the issue of, was it the right thing to do, just the specific issue of treason. Even though I'm a democrat, I don't speak for the opinions of other democrats. I hate to speak against democratic senators; but I suspect that it had more to do with opposing Gabbard than anything else.",

But he did not take the steps as outlined within the bounds of the job and clearance.  There is no evidence he materially engaged with NSA legal or the Inspector General, who could have handled the issue within the bounds of the law.  If that had been done, and not resulted in any action, that would be a different manner, but the only evidence he tried was a question to NSA legal about how they interpreted their authorities.  So he was thinking about it, but chose to mass dump intelligence information rather than follow protocols.  That's the problem.  He was given a very high level of trust, and he abused it, placing assets, methods, and information at great risk.    \n\n\nVice did a very long and detailed article, and if one actually reads it, rather than the headline, you can see that Snowden thought of himself as the main character.  He made claims that were well beyond anything that could be proven.  He may have had the issues in mind, but his interactions with others did not raise the real issues.  His concerns that the law didn't protect him were shown to be false, the latest law didn't, but previous laws still in force did, he either just threw that out to raise smoke, or didn't bother to look. \n\n[https://www.vice.com/en/article/exclusive-snowden-tried-to-tell-nsa-about-his-concerns/](https://www.vice.com/en/article/exclusive-snowden-tried-to-tell-nsa-about-his-concerns/)",
