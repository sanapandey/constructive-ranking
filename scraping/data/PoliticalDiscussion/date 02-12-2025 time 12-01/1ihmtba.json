    "selftext": "Just watched [Frontline\u2019s Trump\u2019s Comeback](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/trumps-comeback/), and it really digs into how Trump\u2019s political brand was built through PR, reality TV, and media influence. *The Apprentice* played a huge role in reshaping his image, turning him into a decisive business mogul while downplaying his bankruptcies and financial missteps. The documentary also covers how he\u2019s used the press to his advantage for decades, from planting tabloid stories to commanding nonstop coverage in 2016.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first politician to shape his own narrative, but his ability to dominate media cycles, even through scandals, raises bigger questions about how much perception outweighs reality in politics. In an era where social media and 24/7 news drive engagement, does branding matter more than actual achievements?\n\nCurious to hear others\u2019 thoughts: does the documentary change how you see Trump\u2019s rise, or is this just how modern politics works?",

Her first speech as a candidate was purely policy focused. But the media took up trumps message of \"She has no policy,\" and everyone ran with it. If they're just going to ignore it, you have to change tack, and that's when she switched to pure \"Trump is bad.\" The media absolutely screwed her, ignoring her when she gave the people what they asked for and mindlessly repeating and sanewashing Trump.",

There's probably some truth there, but as with many large societal shifts, the change in news delivery probably isn't a result of one single factor. \n\nThe legacy networks (ABC, NBC and CBS, for you young 'uns), largely saw their hour of news broadcasting each evening as a public service. They made their money from their prime time entertainment programming, and did not expect their news to turn a profit. This means they had no stake in sensationalism, the opposite, they were very concerned with being viewed as respectable, reliable and apolitical. \n\nTed Turner had a different vision when he founded CNN in 1980, the first 24 hour news network. He thought news could be profitable. In the early days, CNN had a news broadcast that lasted 3-4 hrs. When it ended, they would just loop it and start over. Then when something \"breaking\" happened, they would interrupt the loop to give fresh reporting. Being able to instantly start broadcasting live, was the beginning of the drift towards sensationalism. \n\nAround that same time, a drive-time radio DJ named Rush Limbaugh noticed that his ratings went up and he got more calls from fans, the more he talked about politics. So he switched to AM, became entirely political, and managed to convince a certain subset of Americans that white men were an endangered species in this country, despite white men visibly controlling all levers of power in the US. We had partisan media before that, but never this blatantly or this popular. \n\n When Limbaugh became big enough, Newt Gingrich, then Republican Speaker of the House, had a brainstorm. He made friends with Limbaugh, and the two of them regularly consulted each other on what Rush should be talking about, what messaging they should be pushing all week, and then Gingrich would do the Sunday political talk shows, and echo the same narrative. This level of collusion between a political party and national media, was new. \n\nRupert Murdoch saw this happen, saw how effective it was and how easily right-wing supporters were engaged by outrage over culture war issues, and weaponized the whole trend by starting FOX News. FOX did regular news coverage, but in it's prime slots replaced that with pundits telling people what the news meant, and how to feel about it. People loved it. \n\nCNN tried to compete by changing it's \"all news, all the time\" ethos to include following news segments with panels of pundits of various ideologies, all arguing about what the news meant, what was important. This paradigm helped change news from just information, into the clashing, bickering, hostile environment we live in today, and helped legitimize the idea that fringe political views were just as legitimate as anything in the normal political spectrum. \n\nYay.",

His own party literally forced him to drop out and ousted him. Threw him out to the dogs. The most popular president of all time was thrown out to the dogs by his own party...\n\nThen he was up against a supposedly popular VP who happened to be a woman of color, who dropped out of the 2016 election due to zero support. A VP who never had positive ratings. A VP who was never actually well liked. I mean, a freakin beer can would have won against either of them tbh..\n\nBiden is the sole reason why Trump won. He refused to drop out due to ego, and then when he was FORCED to drop out, he demanded Kamala to be the nominee - because otherwise all the donations wouldn't have counted. So DNC put her up and forced an unominated person up for president whom NOBODY voted for.\n\nDNC for some reason ousted RFK and he switched sides... RFK was a moderate dem anyways but I 100% believe that if DNC had allowed RFK to be the nominee, he would have wiped the floor. Trump won because most people actually hated biden and NOBODY every liked kamala lol... democrats fucked themselves over hardcore.",

To believe, as many Enlightenment thinkers did, that humans are essentially rational and given the freedom to choose their own laws and leaders they would rationally choose what was in their best interest, was to drink the Enlightenment Kool Aid.

            "body": "I didn't watch this nor will I but, does it really matter though? Most millionaires and billionaires have several failed ventures that failed and/or went bankrupt but yet, they are still incredibly wealthy due to their main business/venture. Trump had a lot of failed ventures yes. But is he not still a billionaire even after all of those failed business's? It takes failures to become successful. \n\nAnd yes, I know he has part of his success to thank his father for but, did he not make it even more successful and maintain that success? \n\nTrump is an egotistical monster - and by monster I mean he's a \"go-getter\" and wants to be the best there ever was in anything and everything he does. Ironically, he was asked in an interview decades ago if he'd ever run for president and he said no, he wouldn't. \n\nThe vast majority of reality TV shows are not something people pitch to companies but rather the other way around. Chances are, CBS (or whoever tf it was, but it 100% wasn't FOX) went to Trump and asked HIM if he'd want to do a reality TV show. Of course he's going to say yes... What egotistical billionaire wouldn't say yes? \n\nThe irony though is at the time he had that show, he was a registered Democrat. There is zero chance CBS, ABC, NBC, etc... or any other major news outlet would have offered a Republican a TV show. FOX doesn't and never really has had TV shows so they don't count. Well, Family Guy and a few other adult cartoon shows lol.. \n\nTrump won in large because the MSM unintentionally convinced Americans to NOT believe a single thing the media had to say. The MSM did quite literally nothing but berate, bash, discredit and trash him, and focus on him for literally the last 8-10 years, specifically the last 4 years for some weird af reason.\n\nMost people saw through this and began to wonder... Why is the media constantly trashing a man who didn't do a bad job as President? It's like when a shady salesman is saying and doing everything possible to convince you that they/he is the best and ONLY person to buy from while bashing everyone else. It's like if you go on a date and the other person says all of their ex's were \"crazy\" and it was NEVER their fault. Get's the gears churning... Just not in the direction you think or want them to churn. \n\nConstantly blaming him for things he didn't do, wasn't responsible for and spun up stories to make it seem as if he was and that biden was the victim in all of this. The media so obviously covered up for bidens SIGNIFICANT mental decline and pretended everything was peachy, even though the dumbest American alive could clearly see biden was out of his damn mind...\n\nidk, I actually think the MSM is a major reason why Trump won. People aren't stupid but the media tried to assume that we were by lying and covering all of bidens enormous fuck ups and calling them \"gaffs\" or whatever. No, we saw him on live television and it was beyond obvious he was suffering from dementia. \n\nBut yes, the media has more, if not full control of who wins elections. In this case the media has full fledged ousted themselves as being unreliable, bias and straight up liars and to never be trusted. \n\nUp until the actual election, every single \"poll\" conducted showed it to be neck to neck. \"political analysts\" kept saying it was too close to make any type of guess as to who would win. etc etc etc... But the thing is, is that that was all bullshit. The election was not even close to being \"neck to neck.\" Democrats were shocked and I think republicans were equally as shocked tbh as I honestly think that republicans thought they were going to lose.",

Trump's achievements do matter a lot.\n\nOne of Trumps biggest bases of support are evangelical Christians.  None but the most blind see their relationship with Trump as anything other than transactional.  They just feel that they can no longer express their faith in the public square or articulate it to others.  So they back a guy who they perceive can fight for them and protect them from atheists and liberals, even if it disgusts everyone outside their group.  And Trump has won many victories for them that are not propaganda.  Just look at the overturning of Roe vs Wade.\n\nBranding matters but it's the underlying cultural and political dynamics that drive what sort of branding people are actually receptive to.",
