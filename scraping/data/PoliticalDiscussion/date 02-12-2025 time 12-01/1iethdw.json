    "selftext": "Much has been said about President Trump's tendencies toward authoritarianism, his desire to be a \"dictator,\" etc. Comparisons between him and Hitler are not uncommon. For example, former Secretary of Labor accused Trump of being a \"neofascist\" in\u00a0[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/24/trump-fascism-what-to-do).\n\nAnd so, I'm curious how members of the subreddit feel about the possible future of the United States. You can credibly argue that the State Department's move to reportedly n[o longer issue passports to transgender Americans](https://19thnews.org/2025/01/transgender-passports-state-department/), or the recent bill out of Tennessee which would c[riminalize lawmakers voting against Trump's immigration agenda](https://www.newsweek.com/tennessee-bill-would-prohibit-voting-against-trump-immigration-policies-2023749), are authoritarian in nature. Another example could be what is happening to\u00a0[those who investigated Trump's alleged crimes.](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5119963-trump-administration-forces-out-fbi-officials/)\n\nI could give more examples, but I think I've summarized the situation well enough.\n\nAnd so, do you think the United States is at risk of an authoritarian takeover? How do you feel about the doom-posting many on Reddit are doing, saying another Holocaust is imminent.\n\nOne point to start from: a recent political science paper has found that democratic backsliding is frequently followed by a \"U-turn\" towards more democratic governance.\u00a0[Read here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2024.2448742#abstract). Could that be the United States' future?",

These were her bullet points to look out for.\n\n* **Strongman Leadership & Authoritarianism** A single leader or ruling elite consolidates power, often disregarding democratic norms. Institutions that provide checks and balances are weakened or dismantled.\n* **Disregard for Truth & Manipulation of Reality** Leaders use lies, conspiracy theories, and propaganda to distort facts. The press is labeled as the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d to undermine independent journalism.\n* **Exploitation of Nationalism & Division** Extreme nationalism is used to rally support, often by scapegoating minorities or outsiders. Society is divided into \u201cus vs. them,\u201d where certain groups are demonized.\n* **Encouraging Violence & Suppressing Opposition** Fascist leaders condone or encourage violence against political opponents and critics. Protests and free speech are repressed through intimidation or force.\n* **Corrupt Use of Power & Weakening of Institutions** Democratic processes, such as elections and judicial independence, are undermined. Loyalty to the leader is prioritized over competence and rule of law.\n* **Contempt for Democracy & Individual Rights** Fascists see democracy as weak and inefficient, advocating for stronger, unchecked leadership. Rights such as free speech, privacy, and assembly are restricted.\n\nI don't understand why people keep using hyperbole when talking about fascism. Everyone can see it but so many are afraid to admit it because they don't want it to be true. We are there.\n\nI think it would be harder to prove that we aren't in a fascist state.",

It is never very difficult to tell which way the wind is blowing.\n\n\"It is safe to assume, however, that fascism is imposed on the people, that it actually goes against their basic interests, and that when they can be made fully aware of themselves and their situation they are capable of behaving realistically. **That people too often cannot see the workings of society or their own role within it is due not only to a social control that does not tell the truth but to a \"blindness\" that is rooted in their**\n\n**own psychology.** Although it cannot be claimed that psychological insight is any guarantee of insight into society, there is ample evidence that people who have the greatest difficulty in facing themselves are the least able to see the way the world is made.\"\n\n**THE AUTHORITARIAN PERSONALITY,** Studies In Prejudice, T.W.

Praise came from Churchill and then Roosevelt, and even from critical minds such as Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. In the 1930s it was too soon to see how much of the boasted prosperity and apparent progress consisted of bluff; despite the warnings of the exiles Nitti, Sforza, Sturzo, Salvemini and Rosselli, many of those who remained in Italy had by now changed their minds.

They had four years of trump campaigning. I don't know why we even allowed Biden to campaign. Secondly choosing the vice president as the presidential candidate was severely tying your arm behind your back. The very definition of the vice president's job is to back the president up at public events... The epitome of showing a united front. \n\nSo having someone who literally cannot speak out against what Biden is doing because her job is to back him up on his place makes her campaign incredibly fucking hard. Not to mention that she had almost 4 months to campaign. 4 months compared to 4 years... it's no contest",

Couple of hundred thousand people maybe even tens. \n\nDemocrats should be very careful of the causes they edspouse vs the ones they want to truly fight and die for - and make sure that those are actually worth it and supported by the majority of people in the country. Because government is supposed to be representative of the people. And if the Democrats take a holier than thou stance on many issues, like they did in the past election, vocally championed issues  that most of the people don\u2019t give a damn about, they\u2019ll be out of power and they can sit there and bemoaning their moral superiority, while being totally powerless to do anything about it.",

In fact, for every potentially controversial subject I have found the only way to navigate to the truth is through brutally objective means. \n\nThis means finding out exactly what fascism really is.  And it's not just one thing.  Depending on which model you use, it can be anywhere from 10 to 20 things.  But all of them have very clear threads.  \n\nI made a list of the big ones, I think over twenty characteristics, and rated both administrations on a scale of 0 to 3 for how much they aligned with each characteristic. \n\nI added up all of the numbers and found that the Trump administration overwhelmingly aligns with fascist ideologies. The Biden administration aligned with some but it was somewhere around 20%. \n\nThere are blatant examples that all fascist regimes share that the Trump administration has somehow gone out of its way to replicate or adhere to or maybe just naturally gravitate towards.  In essence, fascism really is just using ultra-nationalism to get away with nasty shit.  So right off the bat ask yourself which party is ultra nationalistic.  I don't think I would ever characterize the Democratic party as being ultra nationalistic.  In fact they get shit on all the time for not being patriotic or American enough or whatever.  Who are the ones carrying around enormous American flags?  \n\nThe other characteristics involve things like being anti LGBTQ.  Would you say Democrats are anti LGBTQ?  Also there is an intense chauvinistic masculine attitude.  Also there is the rejection of modernity.  The cult like worship of a strong man that claims to be the only one that can fix the problems.  The scapegoating of groups of people, demonizing them and dehumanizing them through propaganda.  I mean... The parallels are uncanny.",

When I looked into this after it happened I recall that they did indeed violate the first amendment by suppressing free speech which is an absolute notch in the belt of fascism. The degree that they went, and again this is from what I remember, was mainly trying to prevent COVID misinformation. And I remember them getting in deep shit for it. But that story was suppressed in a lot of the legacy media. \n\nOf course the big thing would be suppressing Hunter bidens laptop. And I forgot how involved they were in this. I know that the FBI had the 51 signatures saying it was likely Russian propaganda, which turned out to be false. But on its surface it definitely seems like blatant government overreach, going against the Constitution, and an act of fascism.  Doesn't make them fascist, but it is an act.  It makes them look like a bunch of dicks and makes it easy for people with an agenda to play whataboutism.\n\nBut what I found is that there is a multitude of characteristics that must be met in order to call someone or some organization fascist. Politicians can be corrupt all day long but that doesn't make them fascist. They can do shady shit, participate in overreach, shit they can even form a goddamn oligarchy. But that ain't it.  That's just corruption.  \n\nWhat we see now is, incredibly, almost like they are TRYING to check every single fascist box in record time.  And for anyone not to see this is maddening.  I'm convinced 90% of conservative commenters just straight up have no idea what even fascism means.  They think it means authoritative behavior.  Which in that case congratulations everyone is a fascist now. Which means no one is. And I guess that's their goal.\n\nEDIT:  Nevermind, they didn't get in deep shit...I must have fallen for the bullshit.  The supreme court threw out the claims that they pressured Twitter and Facebook or anything else.  And this is coming from a court that Trump packed.\n\nEDIT 2:  JFC the laptop thing wasn't even real either... Yeah a bunch of ex intelligent officials (some working as contractors to CIA) made a letter which says they weren't sure but it LOOKED like Russian propaganda.  Biden administration didn't censor shit.  FBI warned social media companies earlier to watch out for Russian propaganda so Meta and Twitter suppressed the story while it was being vetted.\n\nSo none of this was even true and I fell for it but it is enough for Trump supporters to make their dumb claims.

We joined because Pearl Harbor, but we were aligned with all of the allies before then.

Half of Europe ended up under Soviet control in the end and they almost certainly would have been fucked early on in Barbarossa if not for lend lease.\n\n>Trump in particular, want even more laissez-faire economics in the US.\n\nHe wants to gut regulations and cut taxes but he's not pro free trade. Between the tariff stick he's waving around and the parade of CEOs coming to the white house/mara Lago to suck his dick it's pretty clear He's going to use his power to pick winners and losers. I wouldn't call that a light touch from the government. Which leads me to:\n\n>**It controls investment, raw materials, rates of interest, working hours, wages. The factory owner still owns his factory, but he is for practical purposes reduced to the status of a manager.**\n\nJust like any other economic system the economies of nations that have gone fascist all play out a little differently from each other because of regional politics/resources/industrial capacity/devolvement/ ect. One of the common threads is a relationship between capital and the state where the owners of industry who play ball with the regime and get to keep their wealth are the ones who don't get purged. Fascist regimes use the rhetoric of economic populism to get the population behind purging \"elites\" but will let the loyal business owners/politicians rob the state blind.\n\nIt's not apples to apples but I think there's a fair case to be made that the Trump admin has fascist economic goals too.",

The US private military corporation has many such examples. From all political spectrums. Besides Albright was at least smart enough no too project. Just not, when it came to sleeping with Hashim Thaci. That was probably biological though.",

You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\u2019t want to act, or even talk alone; you don\u2019t want to \u201cgo out of your way to make trouble.\u201d Why not?\u2014Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\n> Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, \u201ceveryone\u201d is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re seeing things\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re an alarmist.\u201d\n\n> And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can\u2019t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don\u2019t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n\n> But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to\u2014to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n\n> But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes. That\u2019s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u201cGerman Firm\u201d stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\n> And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u201cJewish swine,\u201d collapses it all at once, and you see that everything has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\n> Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven\u2019t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.",

Nothing in the order allows somebody to change their passport sex *back* if they've already changed it.  To make the original change requires an \"Affidavit of Gender Identity\".  There's no creation in this order for an \"Affidavit of return to birth sex\" or anything like that.  There doesn't really exist a process for a trans woman to get \"M\" legally put on their passport.  And the order says they can't get \"F\" put on their passport.  That unfortunately suggests they cannot get a passport a tall.\n\nThink about it.  If you're a trans person who wants to escape the US due to the current administration's focus on persecuting trans folks, and you have a current license that reads \"Male\", what do you do?  You can't get a passport that says \"Female\" if your proof of identity has you as \"Male\".  And you can't get one that says \"Male\" because Trump won't let you.",

That happened under Biden. \n\nFollowing Europe\u2019s lead and no longer allowing the chemical or surgical castration of children is not a genocide on transgender. Kids can\u2019t get tattoos. They are not mature enough to give informed consent in anything as drastic as castration and vaginoplasty, mastectomies, or hysterectomies. \n\nTransgender have the same rights as any other American. \n\nRevoking DEI for federal employees means selecting those best qualified to do the job, regardless of what they look like. I was shocked to verify that the FAA did indeed put out a DEI hiring statement seeking to increase hiring in under represented groups, like those with serious psychiatric illness, for air traffic control jobs. There are people who have sued because they were turned down for traffic controller positions based on their skin color. Meanwhile, it\u2019s estimated we need 3000 more air traffic controllers to properly man towers. (At the time the DC crash happened, one controller was monitoring both helo and plane traffic. Contrary to earlier reports that the tower was understaffed, insiders said it was the usual staffing, and that managers gave one controller cover two jobs when someone needs to step away, for example. The normal staffing level at that tower is lower than it should be.) \n\nThen there was the LAFD Equity chief, a minority lesbian, who said in answer to concerns she couldn\u2019t carry someone\u2019s husband out of a burning building, that he shouldn\u2019t have put himself in that situation. She claimed people being rescued want to see someone who looks like them. No, we don\u2019t. I live in CA, which suffered so many fires. We don\u2019t care what skin color or who they sleep with. We just can\u2019t a firefighter who can physically get us the hell out of a fire or go hump heavy gear up steep hills to fight brush fires. What someone looks like doesn\u2019t have anything to do with being competent. \n\nDEI placed immutable characteristics over merit, and denied jobs based on skin color, in violation of the Civil Rights Act. \n\nAgain, a meritocracy is not a genocide on trans. \n\nIt boggles my mind how Democrats ignore calls for actual, literal genocide of Jews, from their side, but claim it\u2019s Trump everyone needs to worry about. There\u2019s only one country in the world with a movement calling for its destruction, and it\u2019s the only Jewish one. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/hSQavcggvmg?si=N4CsLWvru48L1iKs",

Just like everyone else, they\u2019re blocked from going into the opposite sex bathrooms, because penises in women\u2019s bathrooms, showers, locker rooms, and battered women\u2019s shelters are a safety hazard for the women who use them. \n\nA biological man with a penis doesn\u2019t have the right to go into a woman\u2019s bathroom. \n\nSince there\u2019s no way to gauge sincerity, a person\u2019s character, check pronouns, or verify if there was surgical transition, some areas allowed people to use whatever bathroom they identified with. \n\nIt resulted in rapes like at Loudoun High School. \n\nHeck at my own son\u2019s soccer game years ago, a guy, dressed as a guy, who looked like a guy, walked into the girls\u2019 bathroom. Girls came out saying he was looking at them. The park employees said they couldn\u2019t prevent a man from using the ladies room since he said he identified female. When the dads came over, the man had left, but little girls said he took pictures of them. The cops eventually found him, but the memory card was missing from his camera. \n\nWomen have been told to shut up or they\u2019ll be harassed and punished, if they say they feel unsafe with penises in their private spaces. \n\nThat led to biological male inmates declaring they were transitioning, and getting transferred to women\u2019s prisons, where they raped and impregnated female inmates. When the female inmates had said they felt unsafe, they were told, you guessed it, to shut up. \n\nSo, no, gendered private spaces like public bathrooms and showers have always existed for women\u2019s privacy and safety. It was never a man\u2019s right to enter them. Reaffirming that, and ensuring those rules are followed, to protect women, didn\u2019t take any rights away from biological men. \n\nPeople can dress or act however they want to live their best lives. They just don\u2019t have the right to oppress women to do it. \n\nThe solution is the availability of single occupancy bathrooms for anyone who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable in a multi use area for any reason. \n\nHere\u2019s the incident at Wi Spa where a bio male who said he was transgender went into the women\u2019s changing room at a spa. He exposed his penis to little girls in there. A black woman complained to the manager, and was basically told to shut up, including by a man in line. After that, there were protests calling everyone who disagreed with penises in women\u2019s spaces a bigot. Well, the guy was a serial flasher. \n\nhttps://abc7.com/amp/wi-spa-indecent-exposure-protest-lapd/10994949/\n\nHere\u2019s the video from the woman\u2019s perspective. In other videos, you can see people in line getting mad at her and telling her to be quiet. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/2d6HGu8RT0k?si=Zq2I0RYoinhhfipq",

The solution is to provide at least one single occupancy bathroom, because there can be a variety of reasons why someone would want to avoid a multi use bathroom. The solution is not to expose women to rape, harassment, or violation of privacy by issuing blanket decrees that people can just use whatever bathroom they identify with. Of course abusers promptly took advantage of that access. \n\nIt is not true that the rape in Loudon occurred prior to allowing bio males in girls bathrooms. That was already happening before the board meeting to make the allowance official. The school already allowed him to use whatever bathroom he wanted. \n\nYour suggestion that he wasn\u2019t really trans is exactly the problem with blanket rules that allow people to pick whatever bathroom they say they identify with. There\u2019s no way to verify sincerity, if they socially or surgically transitioned, or if that person is a threat. Blanket rules would allow a bearded biker to enter a women\u2019s locker room by saying he identified as female or non binary. A woman at a battered women\u2019s shelter in Canada was charged with violating the civil rights of the bearded, tall, masculine man in boots who she was forced to share a bedroom with, because she complained she felt unsafe. That abused, battered woman got in legal trouble because she said she was afraid of the man with a penis she had to share a sleeping quarters with. \n\nOne should also consider that trans is not the same as sexual orientation. A bio male can identify as female, have a penis, yet still date women. That\u2019s a safety issue for women forced to share private spaces. \n\nFrom my perspective as a woman, women\u2019s private spaces like locker rooms and showers should be penis free, for safety and privacy. But only that, there are religions like Islam where a woman would be strictly prohibited from being anywhere near an unclothed male. Those women would be essentially barred from using women\u2019s locker rooms, rest rooms, showers, saunas, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of ironic that women are told they have no right to complain about penises in their locker rooms and showers, and that if they feel unsafe, it\u2019s their problem. The women\u2019s rights movement did a 180, prioritizing bio males\u2019 feelings over bio females\u2019 in their own private spaces and sports divisions.",

They were approved for precocious puberty. Side effects like loss of fertility, brain swelling, bone loss, seizures, aggression, and stunted penile growth even for those who stop and want to resume puberty are not at all run of the mill side effects. It proves they are not as safe as everyone\u2019s been told. Most sites on top of Google search engine results only list side effects like pain and swelling at injection site. \n\nWhy would you say a micro penis is not the result of puberty blockers. When preventing male genital development in puberty is exactly the purpose?  They are not telling kids that if they take puberty blockers, the only type of vaginoplasty they can get will require skin grafts, and will very likely have complications and require years of corrective surgeries? You don\u2019t hear any cautions on puberty blockers. It\u2019s all reversible, remember?  You don\u2019t get the same amount of time in puberty if you block it, and then go off the blockers and resume it. Some of that window is just gone. That is not getting communicated. It\u2019s reversible ONLY in the fact that withdrawal stops blocking gonadotropin-releasing hormones. It does NOT mean that 100% of the time you would have spent in puberty just resents. It\u2019s misleading wording. \n\nWhy would you say so many European countries banned puberty blockers after allowing them for so long? Did you read the CASS report? \n\nI mostly linked straight to sources. I included the academy of Pediatrics because, frankly, you are NOT going to hear downsides on blockers on any media sight that\u2019s not moderate or skewed right. When therapists can lose their license for not automatically affirming, or speaking out against these practices, and there is bias against publishing critical papers, the vast majority bandwagoned. \n\nI included the comment about Jazz because they experienced these side effects. Given how hard it was to dig out the previous sources, I unfortunately had no time to go through all the videos to find ones talking about how awful the vaginoplasty was. \n\nVaginoplasty is a whole other problem with this craze. \n\nWhen they tell kids how fantastic changing genders would be, they don\u2019t tell them that it puts them in the path where they may get surgery that castrates them, inverts penile and scrotal skin, before and after surgery electrolysis sessions removes the hair. That skin was not designed to be on the inside, so it gets infections and often smells. It\u2019s an artificial body cavity so their body will keep trying to close it forever, so they have to use dilators forever. If it does close, that skin lining the cavity would cause an abscess.",

Gender dysphoria has some people considering death. The drug's side effects are much more minor. \n\n\n\n>https://www.fda.gov/media/159663/download \u201cThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added a warning about the risk of pseudotumor cerebri\n\n\"Six cases were identified that supported a plausible association between GnRH agonist use and pseudotumor cerebri. All six cases were reported in birth-assigned females ages 5 to 12 years. Five were undergoing treatment for central precocious puberty and one for transgender care. The onset of pseudotumor cerebri symptoms ranged from three to 240 days after GnRH agonist initiation.\"\n\nSo: extremely rare + only happens to extremely young takers + shows up quickly and isn't one of the \"risks of long term use\" + happening to those taking the meds for the FDA-approved use case. Sounds about like what I said. \n\n\n>https://flboardofmedicine.gov/forms/Puberty-Suppression-Treatment-for-Patients-with-Gender-Dysphoria-Patient-Information-and-Parental-Consent-and-Assent-for-Minors.pdf\n\n>Waiver to take puberty blockers that declares they are not FDA approved for gender dysphoria, effects may be permanent, and may affect fertility. May cause aggression. May cause seizures. May cause fluid around the brain.\n\nIt's hard to trust Florida on anything. They're currently trying to outlaw everything related to trans people. \n\n\n> which are NOT FDA approved for gender dysphoria. They were approved for precocious puberty.\n\nBoth use cases are \"blocking puberty for a short- or long-term duration\". Blockers can be used for precocious puberty for years at a time. \n\n\n\n>loss of fertility\n\nThe risk is listed as this from your own link, which *really* seems quite a minor risk. I hope you're not suggesting people take a 30x larger dose than normal. \n\n\nLeuprolide may reduce male and female fertility. Administration of leuprolide acetate to male\nand female rats at dose of 0.024, 0.24, and 2.4 mg/kg as monthly depot formulation for up to 3\nmonths (approximately as low as 1/30 of the human dose based on body surface area using an\nestimated daily dose in animals and humans) caused atrophy of the reproductive organs, and\nsuppression of reproductive function. These changes were reversible upon cessation of treatment. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/211412/1/archdischild-2023-326669.full.pdf\n\n>Most sites on top of Google search engine results only list side effects like pain and swelling at injection site.\n\n\nIt's not OTC medication. \"Quick 2-second google reading\" has never been trustworthy for anything. What matters more is what a doctor would tell a patient. \n\n>stunted penile growth even for those who stop and want to resume puberty\n\nI can't find anything saying that this happens to people who stop and resume puberty. Kind of a key point. \n\n>Why would you say so many European countries banned puberty blockers after allowing them for so long?\n\nMy first guess is social conservatives speaking up. \n\n>Did you read the CASS report?\n\nYeah. Boiled down to one sentence, it says \"we think trans studies were low-quality and separately we're terrified of some other unknown unknowns, so, shut everything down.\" The Cass Review seemed to be unable to actually find a study that didn't say \"trans treatment thus far is neutral or positive for the patient\". Which I consider *quite* telling. \n\n\n>They are not telling kids that if they take puberty blockers, the only type of vaginoplasty they can get will require skin grafts, and will very likely have complications and require years of corrective surgeries? \n\nThat's a discussion to be had before SRS. SRS isn't a required step after taking blockers. It *would* be a discussion to have when getting off blockers, or moving from blockers to HRT, yes, sure, I agree.\n\nAnd besides, people who want SRS are generally people who will not be *happy* to go through the puberty of their birth sex. \n\n>When they tell kids how fantastic changing genders would be, \n\npretty ridiculous statement \n\n\n\n>they don\u2019t tell them that it puts them in the path where they may get surgery that castrates them, inverts penile and scrotal skin, before and after surgery electrolysis sessions removes the hair. \n\nThat's not \"a path\". Nobody who isn't *damn* sure that they've *been trans for a decade* is getting SRS. And it's not a requirement of being trans. Plenty of trans people just *don't* get SRS. They're not *pressured into* SRS. And it's not like people are expecting to *not* get castrated after they sign up for castration surgery. \n\nAlso this really has nothing to do with blockers.",

If Trump (or any leader for that matter) wants to do something and the courts say \"it's okay\" and the military/police say \"we'll enforce the rule\" then it's pretty hard to fight against it. Once you have the courts and military/law enforcement it's pretty easy to control elections as well. Mass civil disobedience and strikes can work but by that point you're attempting to end a dictatorship rather than prevent one from getting started. For non violent popular resistance to overthrow a regime you also need something like 60% of the population to agree with you and 3% willing to take to the streets to the streets and grind major cities and economies to a halt. \n\nAll of that said I think it may be harder for Trump to become an actual dictator that some imagine. The high ranks of the US military for the most part are comprised of people promoted out of competence rather than regime loyalty and there isn't a history in the US of coups. It's not enough to have one general who wants to be a part of the new regime you need A LOT of buy in. Trump is also famously bad at organizing things and planning. His SCOTUS nominees also ruled against his attempt to overturn the 2020 election which makes me think they're not about to hand him unconditional power either.

These are your SS, your brownshirts, your vigilantes. This is what I'm primarily worried about.\n\n2) The utter capitulation of legacy/corporate media - This was near-instant, and is unique to Trump's presidency. It bodes poorly for the ability of the opposition to coordinate and for everyday people to receive accurate and reliable information about what Trump is doing.\n\n3) Hegseth/Patel/Gabbard - These people are in government just to do what Trump wants, and his ability to control the FBI and National Intelligence Services against the safety and security of the United States, as well as to prosecute opposition candidates and the people who investigated Jan 6th, is extremely dangerous. Hegseth is a bridge between the military and the militias, which makes him especially dangerous.\n\nI would like to remark that no matter what anyone Trump nominated says in front of Congress, they are lying. We saw this with Brett Kavanaugh, and now literally anyone can say whatever they want to Congress (\"No, I won't pursue Trump's political opponents...\" and what have you), get in, and face zero consequences. Patel \\*will\\* do Trump's bidding; he has a long and extensive history of conspiracy theories and buys in to Trump's grievances.\n\n4) RFK Jr - This is a special case because his antivax stances are going to kill a lot of people, especially children, and Trump's own voters are uniquely vulnerable after the pandemic because they are also antivax. He's not so much fascist as just completely reckless and irresponsible.\n\n5) Undocumented migrants - This one we've seen before, and it might be a trial run for something worse later. Texas has already promised use of its land to build \\*ahem!\\* *camps* to house migrants. It's worth noting that citizens, including military veterans, have been caught up in ICE's dragnet.

Cabinet secretaries need to have a substantive grasp of the workings of their department, how it interacts with the government, and how policy affects people's lives. Very few of the current cabinet nominees have shown that understanding, except Marco Rubio. The nominees were not chosen for expertise, but for ideological alignment with the president. \n\nI understand that presidents will choose people that are ideologically aligned with their priorities, but the counterweight to ideological alignment is competence and knowledge. It's fine that the president selects nominees as a political favor, but the nominees need to also do their homework and show up to their confirmation hearings ready to show their understanding through substantive discussion.\n\nQuite simply, it's DEI for MAGA. It's the same critique that they have for DEI applied to an ideology.",

He has also claimed that immigrants who have committed crimes have \"bad genes\"\"\n\nWikipedia on his campaign:\n\n>\"As with his previous presidential campaigns, Trump's 2024 campaign has regularly espoused anti-immigrant nativist fearmongering, racial stereotypes, and dehumanized immigrants. In his rhetoric, Trump has blurred the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants, and has promised to deport both. Trump has repeatedly claimed that undocumented immigrants are subhuman, stating they are \"not people\", \"not humans\", and \"animals\". At rallies, Trump has stated that undocumented immigrants will \"rape, pillage, thieve, plunder and kill\" American citizens, that they are \"stone-cold killers\", \"monsters,\" \"vile animals\", \"savages\", and \"predators\" that will \"walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat\" and \"grab young girls and slice them up right in front of their parents\". Trump's dehumanizing anti-immigrant rhetoric regularly features details of young women allegedly killed by Hispanic male assailants while ignoring male victims. Studies find no evidence that immigrants commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans, and Trump has not provided any evidence to back up his claims.\n\nCourting the [alt-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right) to the point he made the person who ran one of their main media sites his campaign manager and chief whitehouse strategist\n\n>\"The alt-right (abbreviated from alternative right) is a far-right, white nationalist movement.\" - Wikipedia\n\nTrump himself references himself as a nationalist:\n\n>\"You know, they have a word. **It sort of became old-fashioned**. It\u2019s called a nationalist,\" he continued. \"And I say, '**Really, we\u2019re not supposed to use that word?' You know what I am? I'm a nationalist**\"",

            "body": "Lets go through the list ( TL;DR: ~Trump fits ~12/14 of Lawrence Britt's features of fascism)\n\n1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism \u2714  \nFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are\nflag symbols on clothing and in public displays. \n\n2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights \u2714  \nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases\nbecause of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of\nprisoners, etc.\n\n3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause \u2714  \nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious\nminorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n4. Supremacy of the Military: Kinda  \nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic\nagenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n5. Rampant Sexism \u2714  \nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more\nrigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\n\n6. Controlled Mass Media \u2714 (at least a large fraction)  \nSometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or\nsympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n7. Obsession with National Security \u2714  \nFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n8. Religion and Government are Intertwined \u2714  \nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and\nterminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies\nor actions.\n\n9. Corporate Power is Protected \u2714\u2714\u2714  \nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually\nbeneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n10. Labor Power is Suppressed \u2714  \nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely\nsuppressed .\n\n11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts \u2714  \nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other\nacademics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\n12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment \u2714  \nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even\nforego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption \u2714\u2714\u2714  \nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use\ngovernmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and\neven treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n14. Fraudulent Elections kinda   \nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even\nassassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media.\nFascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\nTheres nuance to each of these categories, 12/14 is as exact as \"a lot\" here. My take is we are in a oligarchic proto facism pretending to be a democracy speed running toward overt facism.",

The overuse of presidential executive actions starting with Ulysses S Grant. Up until his presidency, executive orders were used in rare rare occurrence with Lincoln only using 48 during a Civil War. Modern presidents have bastardized the principle, even in non-war times.  \n\n2. Citizens United - The fact that corporations have the same rights as human beings is not only ridiculous, this single ruling will lead to the end of America and its political system. It reinforces corruption at all levels of government and allows dark money. And don't get me started how both sides use it and hide their donors.\n\n3. Secret prisons and torture - The United States got caught having secret CIA and NSA prisons. They still use them and the very principles by which we stand on are null because we make exceptions for terrorism. Notice the language being used on college kids these days who protested in America and understand how dangerous these exceptions can be. \n\n4. Spying and Data retrieval - Its no secret the U.S. government uses private contractors to collect your data and uses it to keep tabs on individuals. Its technically not against the law when a private firm does it, and the government buys it off of them - I mean really, why does the government need anyones data - YEAH Fuck you CIA dude looking up my IP address. \n\n5. Israel - Its no secret they have their hands in all sections and layers of our government. This isn't a conspiracy theory when you have dual citizens serving at the highest levels of government. Imagine if a dual citizen of China or Russia was allowed to serve in our government. Don't worry, if you are Israeli, you can get away with it. \n\n6. AIPAC - same reasons above\n\n7. The King Presidential Ruling by the Supreme Court guarantees that no president will ever ever be accountable for breaking the law - We are screwed\n\n8. Supreme Court - Lifetime appointments - Imagine a world where you can take bribes and get away with it, without even being held accountable. When we talk about Russia corruption, the US is saying, hold my beer. \n\n9. Military Spending and Interconnectedness in Everything we do - There is a reason why the Pentagon cannot pass an audit. Because your money goes in the door and out the back to rich contractor companies that literally make money off of starting wars in Central and South America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and other places. That money was your free health care, your kids college funding being depleted, cancer research, the lack of hospitals in rural areas, the degrading infrastructure in this country, the lack of a cross country high speed train system, etc etc etc etc etc\n\n10 Trump - He is doing what he can because the corrupt government has allowed it behind closed doors. He is just doing it in the open. Welcome to fascism. It took us a while to get here, but he is just showing what happens when powers go unchecked, money buys access, and the little people stuck in the middle are fucked",

Therefore in anger they elected someone who promised to deconstruct some of these powers and didn\u2019t represent their status quo either.

Fascists can always take over, they have in America and elsewhere. Militarism and Imperialism, along with a power vacuum caused by Victoria's death led to the First World War, the Great Depression led to WW2.\n\nNo amount of owning guns stopped any of that from happening.\n\nThe Second Amendment (1791) and the English Bill of Rights (1689) have their roots in the philosophy of John Locke, it affords:- \n\n- keeping a standing army in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law;\n\n- Protestants may have arms for their defence suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law;\n\nSir William Blackstone described this right as an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defence and resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defence of the state.\n\nJust over 100 years later, James Madison in particular saw Militias as an answer and defence against a Federal Army, *\"It may well be doubted, whether a militia thus circumstanced could ever be conquered by such a proportion of regular troops.\"*, he said. He claimed incorrectly that the European Kingdoms were *\"afraid to trust the people with arms\"* (see the French Revolution). He said *\"the existence of subordinate governments ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition\"*.\n\nUltimately, the Federalists were forced to agree to the Bill of Rights to get the Constitution ratified because so many amendments had been put forward. \n\n>In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled that, \"The right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second Amendments [sic] means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government.\"\n\nAnd \n\n>In United States v. Miller (1939), the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment did not protect weapon types not having a \"reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia\".\n\nIt wasn't until 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) that the Supreme Court decided that the Second Amendment allowed the keeping of a weapon for self-defence.\n\nIn essence, the Founders had no intention of allowing what modern America has become. Their concerns were founded in protecting the states from the threat of a Federal Army, and somewhat concerned with defence of the homestead. We English were more concerned about the Catholics, for shame.\n\nThe United States Military was created by the world wars, the state Militia's evolved into the National Guard.\n\nIn modern America, Armed militia groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are literally leading the rise of fascism, and stochastic terrorism. It is absolutely clear this was not the Founder's intent.\n\nThe modern reinterpretation of the Second Amendment into retaining military grade weapons which go far beyond the needs of self-defence, lies in the NRA's Revolt at Cincinnati in 1977, turning the organisation from a gun safety and sport shooting organisation into a political advocacy group, because Republicans realised gun ownership was a wedge issue with voters.\n\nThe truth is your guns won't stop anything but burglars, and even having a gun in the home puts your risk of dying from suicide up to 70%.",

As a practical matter an armed populace has a completely different calculus on cost and effort to manage than a disarmed one. One will have a significantly higher cost in casualties than the other which can be rounded up with beat cops with guns, tear gas, and riot shields. \n\n>>In United States v.

The Second Amendments [sic] means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government.\"\n\n\n\nCruikshank said the same thing about the 1st amendment. It literally said the individual right predates and exists independent of of the constitution, however and what you seem to be ignoring here is that it protects those individual rights from government interference. It literally is saying that the 2nd amendment and 1st amendments protect an individuals right from federal interference. And the only reason they limited it to federal interference was to avoid applying the 14th amendment to the states. \n\n>It wasn't until 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) that the Supreme Court decided that the Second Amendment allowed the keeping of a weapon for self-defence.\n\nNo, what is said was that the 2nd amendment protected an individual right to keep and bear arms for *any* lawful purpose such as self defense. And that is the thing given the 2nd amendment literally describes it as an open ended as a right means that they are correct. Our society allows self defense so owning a gun to use in a self defense situation is within the purview of the 2nd amendment just the same as I can own ink and paper to write rings of power fanfiction under the 1st amendment. \n\n>The modern reinterpretation of the Second Amendment into retaining military grade weapons which go far beyond the needs of self-defence\n\nThe Miller case literally ruled that the 2nd amendment protects weapons that can bused in a military(militia) context. They erred in fact on ignoring that short barreled shotguns had been used in military conflict, but the standard they came to was that the kind of weapons protected were those that could be used in a militia and as you yourself notes the current militia is the national guard. So by your own reasoning there and the court precedent of the 1930s it would guarantee the same kind of equipement that the national guard can have. Or the gun control advocates can shut up about assault weapons and stop pressing the issue and that might leave intact the NFA and the hughes amendment. \n\n>The truth is your guns won't stop anything but burglars,\n\nIf it can stop burglars then it means it means coming into my house to seize me and others like me because a much more expensive prospect. You can knock over the strawman about it being about believing it means we can one man army vs the actual army, but the actual argument is that it makes the cost/benefit analysis a lot more expensive. \n\nBut I think you missed the point of my original comment which was to point out that the Democrats picking a dumb ass fight over weapons helped create this situation. And it was even to the point of irony that they were picking that fight while harping on the boogeyman(potentially real in this context) of a fascist take over. Yeah, I am not giving up my guns if you are going to harp on such a nightmare scenario coming to pass.",

First of all you are arguing from the ideal scenario for the professional soldier. It's not some battle that's going to occur in an open field or even a cleared street. It will be when they have to go into a house. And that's the thing it's expensive sending in soldiers to search homes of dissidents and insurgents. There will be attrition no matter how incompetent the insurgency or professional the soldier. But odds are in such scenarios the insurgent isn't going to be as bad as you portray nor the soldier as professional as numerous factors will be at play. \n\n>You have no real training, owning tac, and gnarly looking guns is not enough. \n\nJust having some firearms makes you orders magnitude more dangerous than the unarmed. The fact that they will need to send soldiers at all is an admission that the firearms have made their acts more costly in terms of money, time, and politics. \n\n>Which is another line of thinking that's been sold to you with enormous success. \n\nWhatever you have to say to justify in your mind that this is the result of lies rather than rational independent thought. \n\n>The Democrats have suggested that it's not a great idea to have mass availability of military grade weapons\n\nFirst of all they aren't military weapons. The actual military weapons have been restricted by the NFA since the 1930s and the registry for the full auto actual military weapons has been closed since the 80s. So that framing you are repeating is quite dishonest on the part of the Democrats. So I would say you are the one who has been sold a line of thinking by vested interests. \n\n>because these end up in the hands of criminals who use them to kill, \n\nPretty much most of their policies don't address that problem and seem more designed to antagonize lawful gun owners as they try to comport with those frankly useless and unconstitutional laws. \n\n>they've also suggested that mass killings are a bad thing,\n\nNobody suggested otherwise, but the issue is they don't provide actual solutions. The very fact that they still have the assault weapons ban as part of their party platform despite knowing for decades that it has no potential to save lives on a statistically measurable scale suggests their concerns are not about stopping mass shootings or saving lives. It suggests optimistically that they are operating on emotional surface level and ignorance, but more likely it's an intentional long term strategy to limit gun rights by using a nebulously defined concept that they can continually expand to more and more guns. Like how Colorado looks poised to ban more guns with detachable magazines. \n\n>Like every other major Western civilisation has.\n\nYeah, Brazil adopted those draconian gun laws, but still has the high homicide rates. Guess they didn't have the advantage of those other western countries in Europe/Australia who started significantly lower homicide rates before adopting their gun control. In fact I believe from the 90s to the mid 2010s the US followed the same downward trends as those other developed countries while letting the assault weapons ban expire, gun availability exploding, and most states adopting legalized carry of firearms. Perhaps the relationship between these low homicide rates and gun policy is not nearly as strong as some people try to assert.",

            "body": "Unequivocally yes. I really wish that wasn't the case, and until very recently I did think that the use of the word \"fascist\" was scaremongering and hyperbole. But then I thought, well, what IS fascism anyway? and decided to see what the experts thought. I read Robert Paxton's Anatomy of Fascism, and it was... bone-chilling, how much of this twenty-year-old book about century-old history felt like it was a description of things that happened last week. This is obviously a very dramatic thing to claim, so let me lay out some of the things I wrote in my notes. Tell me if any of this sounds familiar:\n\n- Fascism is not an ideology in the sense that socialism, liberalism, etc. are ideologies. Fascism is a means to an end, using whatever ideologies are available. This is why not all fascists fit neatly into the same part of the political spectrum, or are consistent with their own past beliefs.\n\n- Fascists make no attempt to hide their lack of policies. \u201cThe Democrats want to know our plan; our plan is to break the bones of the Democrats. The sooner the better.\u201d -Mussolini\n\n- Fascist regimes are not unilateral; they are coalitions of conservatives, nationalists, elites, and others, and there is frequent tension between them. Conservatives want a traditional-values top-down authoritarianism, while nationalists want to funnel all the nation\u2019s resources and structures into supporting the state; a more bottom-up approach. Elites, meanwhile, want to preserve existing power structures to maintain their own prestige. None of them can move against the others in force, however, out of fear of emboldening the left-wing opposition.\n\n- Fascist regimes are a never-ending Social Darwinist struggle for prestige among a coalition of allies, in the context of the collapse of existing power structures and the rule of law.\n\n- A fascist regime can be understood as a dual state: the \"normative\" state, where previously existing structures are maintained and laws continue to be applied, and the \"prerogative\" state, which is comprised of extra-legal groups who act according to the whims of the ruler and disregard the normative state. For instance, the regular German police force was the normative state, and the S.S. was the prerogative state.\n\n- The back-and-forth of the prerogative state and the normative state is one of the major causes of the most extreme forms of fascist atrocities, such as the Holocaust. The local militants' outpourings of hatred and violence (prerogative) were encouraged or at least ignored by the government (normative), while the government continued to use violent rhetoric that inspired the militants, as well as pass official policies to make the militants\u2019 violence legal and orderly.\n\n- Charisma is another important aspect of fascism; fascist leaders must necessarily have it in order to stoke the fervor of their people. It\u2019s also partly responsible for why fascist regimes have never been able to pass power to a successor: the successor inevitably does not have the same kind of charisma as their forebearer.\n\n- Fascist regimes can also be understood as \u201cpolyocracies\u201d-- governments ruled by a broad array of semi-independent \u201cpetty dictators\u201d always squabbling with each other, but ultimately subordinate to the leader.\n\n- Though they had legitimate disagreements with fascists, conservatives acquiesced to their wishes in nearly every case. Businessmen didn\u2019t usually want fascism as their first choice, but they saw it as preferable to socialism or an unstable market, so they went along with it.\n\n- Fascist economic policy responded to political pressure, not economic realities. For example, Mussolini changed the exchange rate between Italian and British currencies simply to make Italy seem more prestigious, despite the warnings against it from all of his economists. \n\n- \u201cFascist regimes functioned like an epoxy: an amalgam of two very different agents. Fascist dynamism and conservative order\u2013bonded by shared enmity toward liberalism and the left, and a shared willingness to stop at nothing to destroy their common enemies.\u201d (This one's a direct quote from Paxton.)\n\n- Fascism relies on a shared sense of headlong momentum into the unknown; without newer and greater obstacles always on the horizon, it decays into tepid authoritarianism. \n\n- One possible source of radicalization under fascist rule: the utter chaos of it all. Hitler in particular took as little interest in specific policies as possible; he gave speeches about his big ideas, then left his subordinates to figure out how to do them. This was made more complicated by the fact that they sometimes had overlapping jobs and jurisdictions, forcing them to fight and compete\u2013often with groups outside of the official government\u2013for his favor. More radical policies were rewarded with more attention from the Fuhrer, so the average bureaucrats had an incentive to become as radicalized as possible.\n\n- Many say that fascism was limited to the 1940s, and that the conditions that gave rise to it were unique to that time period, but a future resurgence of fascism would not necessarily follow the exact same path as the previous ones. \u201cSome future movement that would give up free institutions in order to perform the same functions of mass mobilization for the reunification, purification, and regeneration of some troubled group would undoubtedly call itself something else, and draw on fresh symbols. That would not make it any less dangerous.\u201d \n\n...and that's not even close to everything. Paxton's view is just one of many, but once he takes you through the whole history of early 20th century Germany and Italy, it's very hard to disagree with him. It's even harder to not see the parallels to modern day.\n\nTo some extent, I hate repeating this. People have been throwing around the words \"Nazi\" and \"fascist\" for so long that they've basically lost all meaning. I don't think any president in my lifetime hasn't had a loud group of people calling them the second coming of Hitler. But for me at least, this is not a reactionary opinion. This is not me finding a convoluted chain of associations between things people said on the news and \"omg this is literally Nazis.\" This is me taking a sober look at the words of people smarter than me and finding, to my despair, that they ring true.",

It also launches shortly after Trump was elected. Harrison Ford plays a power hungry president who transforms into a red monster.\u00a0 There was also an assassination attempt on Fords character which was cut from the movie after Trumps attempted assassination.\n\n\nThis is not a coincidence. The movie was originally called New World Order, after backlash, they changed it to Brave New World. Brave New World is a book published in 1932 by Aldous Huxley, about a dysopian future that draws horrifying parrallells to our world today.\u00a0\n\n\nBrainwashing is in your child's cartoons, your newspapers, your social media feeds, billboards and more. We are headed down the same road the Soviet Union went down the propaganda in North America is just as bad or worse today as it was in the SU.\n\n\nIf you want the Truth you need to follow the money.

And weaker. \n\nWe have become a society where we sit and wait and hope stuff just falls in our lap. No action. Why no action? Fear. We should not be a free Nation and at the same time feel dangerously unsafe for using our voices against what we find obviously detrimental to the people as a whole. That\u2019s not a free country but one that has been steered in the direction of oppression for all. \n\nWe as Americans have routinely picked one side or the other.

            "body": "The thing you have to understand about this is that the U.S. hasn\u2019t ever truly been a democracy. For a long time in its inception we were considered by the elites to be a \u201cnaturalistic aristocracy\u201d in which only the richest and most well known elites truly had a chance at becoming president. That\u2019s part of the reason why the first several presidents were all big name players during the revolution. There were checks and balances put in place to make sure aristocrats were kept in line, but they would be eroded over time. With the creation of parties we allowed oligarchical characteristics to seep in through the cracks. Over time two large parties emerged and dominated over all others and we slipped into an aristocratic duopoly with oligarchic characteristics. More and more private interest groups extended control over the political process, taking priority over constituents. This stayed that way until Ronald Reagan helped further radicalize the right, beginning what was at first gradual apolar politicalization. This would shift the Overton window further and further to the right over the years with the \u201cleft\u201d being more and more represented by moderate right wingers and the \u201cright\u201d being represented by hardliners, which was cemented post 9/11. A cabal of oil executives and interest groups wormed their way into the pockets of the Republican Party and were given oversight to wage war for profit. This affected the U.S. greatly and would push the Overton window even further to the right still with anti-terrorist/nationalistic propaganda being peddled regularly, and corporations being given Carte blanch to use money to buy politicians. Then the election of Barack Obama sealed the outcome of this discourse. The hardcore conservatives vowed they could never let something like a black man becoming president happen again and Obama, being a moderate conservative by most standards, failed to live up to his promises to the American people, allowing the government to continue to abuse and encroach its powers, making unnecessary concessions to Republicans, and most importantly, allowing a vacancy in the Supreme Court to be filled by Republicans. This would ultimately set the stage for Donald Trump to become president and extend his powers beyond the existing scope. Mechanisms put in place over the years were cut and he extended his power as far as our bureaucracy would allow. He would do incredible damage to the nation in this time, damage foreign relations, and even created internment camps for migrants and separated families. He subsequently lost his re-election and Joe Biden, another moderate conservative, would take his place. Joe would work to repair the damage done, often understating his positive policies while standing behind controversial ones, causing his base to lose faith in him and bolstering Trump\u2019s chances for re-election in the next cycle. During this time, powerful conservative interest groups would get together and make up plans for how to overwhelm the government and push otherwise unfavorable policies through rapid fire to seize full control of the government, not allowing for any of the checks or balances to refrain them from ratfucking the nation. We are now currently in the transitional period to a one party monopoly beholden to a central figurehead with technocratic oligarchic ties. This is not your classic Greatest Generation era fascism, this is a new form of fascism that for all intense purposes may evolve into something that is both familiar yet very different from classic fascism.",

You have orders telling the cdc they cant use the words sex or gender. You have an attorney general, in bondi, who already has moved to investigate things that have already been investigated, simply to erase crimes by conservatives.

You have a leader who flooded areas of southern California when he forced the release of water reserves in northern California (which are mostly reserved for farmers, for the hot season).

If you opt to circumvent this process and therefore become an \"illegal\" in any country, you are vulnerable to being deported. Even if you don't commit any violent crimes. Any thinking person should understand that if someone is willing to dodge the legal immigration process to get into a country, this reveals a mentality whereby an individual declares they are knowingly going against the laws of the country they want to live in. Trump is not the only person who wants the U.S. to be filled with hard-working, LAW-ABIDING, responsible people. Yet anyone who says this is being labeled a fascist. It is not logical. Too many people are using these terms, \"fascist\", \"nazi\", out of their true context. Enforcing laws does not make you a fascist.

Not to mention other inappropriate relationships, like Facebook \"settling\" with Trump for $25m, and every tech CEO making a trek to the White House to suck up to him. \n\nThat's such an egregious omission, I have to question the rest of your post. It leads me to believe that you did not post in good faith, and are simply carrying water for the guy who is moving us toward fascism. \n\nAlso, in all of your examples, we are moving toward those things. The Supreme Court made the executive branch more powerful than it ever was intended to be. \n\nIndividualism is being gutted as the current administration is basically saying Trans people don't exist and I'd be surprised if gay rights aren't next. My only question is where does it end? We'll see I guess. But the message seems to be \"conform or be punished.\" \n\nOP's question is whether we are moving toward Fascism. I think it's a clear yes. You're citing the specific definition of a fascist state, and dismissing the original question because we haven't quite reached that destination yet.",

Which is not the same thing \n\nSo are we moving towards fascism? Yes- we've removed DEI efforts from the system that benefits those who are better positioned to benefit from a system that benefits people who have had a historical racial edge. \n\n\nBUT that is also like saying that that deregulation is a step towards anarchy. Having a few closeted dog whistling fascist in the majority party does not make us fascist. Our policies are not nearly as severe and spelled out as actual fascism. \n\nWe were closer to being fascist under George Bush. The bipartisan support for outwardly nationalist ideals, with the \"nation\" pretty much implied as \"white people\". It was heavily implied fascism that pretended to hate racism and authoritarian- but it was very much a \"walk like a duck .. \" situation. \n\nUnfortunately people have short memories and looooooose definitions- but the reality of it is we are nowhere close to the levels of united support for authoritarian nationalistic government as we were in the few years after 9/11. We ACTIVELY were invading countries, putting people in REAL concentration camps, passing policies that gutted liberty, and questioning it would literally put you in a list where you risked detention. It wasn't talk, it wasnt a wishlist by closeted fascist with significant political resistance. It was real, material, and bipartisan. \n\n\nLike c'mon y'all, it's not great.

Almost nobody in America cared until the rise of fascism started to affect us directly. Now people are confused why Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and a bunch of other political parties *literally* founded by neo-Nazis including the AfD of Germany and the National Rally of France, are close allies with Benjamin Netanyahu, the ADL, and AIPAC.\n\nIt's like the classic poem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Came\n\n> First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out\u2014\n     Because I was not a socialist.\n\n> Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out\u2014\n     Because I was not a trade unionist.\n\n> Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out\u2014\n     Because I was not a Jew.\n\n> Then they came for me\u2014and there was no one left to speak for me.\n\nThe one glimmer of hope is that everyday Americans aren't purposefully genocidal. We're just ignorant and easily-distracted. Now that we realize how badly we screwed up by letting truly awful people take over our government, we're trying to fix it. \n\nSo to answer your question, unequivocally yes. The US is closer to fascism today than anytime since the Second Red Scare. The leaders who were supposed to protect us fell asleep at the wheel.

            "body": "First off, I think you're in exactly the camp I was talking about. Here you are exclusively getting your information from an organization dedicated specifically to lobbying against trans healthcare, an organization already known to spread misinformation. You could have found that out from even reading like the first couple sentences of their wikipedia article. THIS is who you're trusting to tell you what the science says, because they promise to only tell you what you want to hear.\n\nSecond, everything else that's wrong and misleading about what they've said:\n\n>Gender medicine is a relatively new field with a limited and shifting evidence base\n\nI already pointed out that trans healthcare and research has been going on in the US since at least the 1970s. They choose to describe it as \"relatively new\" because it's vague and makes it seem like a lot of these questions are up in the air despite being backed by decades of data.\n\n>a revision concluded that neither hormones nor surgery are of any benefit in terms of long- term mental health or suicidality\n\nWell no, if you read the correction text what it actually describes is that, ignoring that individuals who sought gender-affirming care vs those who didn't are not control groups of one another, you may not be able to predict the future use of mental health services related to mood, anxeity, or suicidality. However, you, the SEGM, and perhaps even the editors are forgetting about the \"treatment-selection bias\" where two treatments can't be compared well on efficacy when the determination of which treatment is used depends on the severity of symptoms.\n\nCitations 7 & 8 are also bunk. Number 8 is just a critique of one study they didn't like, couldn't get the critique letter published alongside the article or in the original journal, and instead had to get it published at a journal who publicly refused to retract a paper in support of gay-conversion therapy after *the author themselves* agreed with critiques that their methods were too flawed to remain published. Number 8 essentially argues that they just don't believe the sample based on a comparison to a completely different sample from a different study, and seem to be angry that the original authors didn't try to distinguish between conversion therapy and \"neutral non-affirmative therapy\" which wasn't the focus of the study.\n\nNumber 7 is from that same journal, and appears to link a Correction that's just a change in the licensing of the published article, but cite it as a \"Correction\" to make it appear that the original article was flawed. So if you still thought SEGM was just honest folks honestly arguing their opinion, I hope that serves as proof that they're willing to bullshit you by purposely misreading the research.\n\n>Describing puberty blockers as simply a \u201cpause button,\u201d \u201ccompletely reversible,\u201d \u201clife-saving,\u201d or \u201cevidence-based\u201d is untrue and misleads patients, their families and the clinicians responsible for their long-term health\n\nNone of the papers linked in the article leading up to this text are about the safety or efficacy of puberty blockers, so again, SEGM is just sorta hoping you'll be impressed by the illusion of due dilligence.\n\nI get that there are think-tanks and lobbying orgs on \"both sides,\" but c'mon dude. This all has to sound familiar, right? If you're at least in your mid 30's you remember when gay marriage was a huge fight. People trying to talk about gay genes and whether you could be born gay and all that, and these people were still trying to publish pro-conversion therapy articles until like the 2010's. If you think being gay or trans is just icky or scary, it'd be easier to just say so rather than contributing to the overall loss in trust in science and academia and increasing the amount of anti-intellectualism in our politics. It doesn't just hurt trans people, it's why we have a goddamn anti-vaxer in charge of the US's health care system now.",

            "body": "I\u2019ll just leave this here\u2026 \n\nPolitical scientist Dr. Lawrence Britt recently wrote an article about fascism (\u201cFascism Anyone?,\u201d Free Inquiry, Spring 2003, page 20). Studying the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia), and Pinochet (Chile), Dr. Britt found they all had 14 elements in common. He calls these the identifying characteristics of fascism. The excerpt is in accordance with the magazine\u2019s policy.\n\nThe 14 characteristics are:\n\nPowerful and Continuing Nationalism\nFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\nDisdain for the Recognition of Human Rights\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \u201cneed.\u201d The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\nIdentification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\nSupremacy of the Military\nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\nRampant Sexism\nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\n\nControlled Mass Media\nSometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\nObsession with National Security\nFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\nReligion and Government are Intertwined\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government\u2019s policies or actions.\n\nCorporate Power is Protected\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\nLabor Power is Suppressed\nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .\n\nDisdain for Intellectuals and the Arts\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\nObsession with Crime and Punishment\nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\nRampant Cronyism and Corruption\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\nFraudulent Elections\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2003 Free Inquiry magazine\nReprinted for Fair Use Only.",
