They loved to spend Friday night cheering for those kids and enjoying the general atmosphere of a big Texas high school game. And I gotta admit, I understand the appeal.\n\nMy wife and I went to join them at a game once. It was miserably cold and raining and our team was performing as poorly as the weather. We left after halftime, but my parents stuck it out. I had the game on the radio while we were driving home and listened as the game turned around and my school scored 28 unanswered points in ten minutes to win the game.\n\nSo you CAN get that feeling elsewhere, but the way baseball works, those last couple of innings can be wild, especially if your pitchers wear down and the defense changes up.",
