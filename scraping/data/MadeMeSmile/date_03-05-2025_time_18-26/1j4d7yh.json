I tripped on the way back and wanted to see how stupid i looked but I found this gem instead.\n\nAlso I know that the quality is terrible, it was recorded on an old security camera from atleast 75ft away in the dead of night with \u201cnight vision.\u201d Hopefully context makes it make sense despite the intense lack of pixels.",
