I really feel like going slow is more sustainable and gives your skin a chance to catch up along with the scale.  \n\nI've \"struggled\" with my weight most of my life.  Living in a body that I was not taking care of, and I was neglecting my health even if it wasn't impacting my day to day life like more extreme cases of obesity.  When you've had enough of the body your in, change it.  Slowly and then permanently.  \n\nAlso, it's 80% diet and 20% exercise no matter how you cut it.  It all comes down to how you nourish your body.  Good luck everyone!",
