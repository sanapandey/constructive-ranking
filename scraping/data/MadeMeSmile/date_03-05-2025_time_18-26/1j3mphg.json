He had won \u2014 they had won \u2014 a $22 million Powerball prize in the June 10 drawing.\n\n>Later that month, Cook and Feeney showed up at the Wisconsin Lottery office to pose with the big check and talk about their plans.\n\n>Cook, of Elk Mound, and Joe, of Menomonie, have remained close over the decades, even taking road trips together with their wives.\n \n>For upcoming trips, they say, they will upgrade from the PT Cruiser convertible they\u2019ve been riding in.\n\n>Upon learning of the win, Cook retired from his job. Feeney had already taken retirement from the fire department.\n\n>Choosing the cash option, about $16.7 million, the men each took home about $5.7 million after federal and state taxes.\n\n>The men have played Powerball since its introduction in 1992, and they made their pact that year.\n\n>Cook\u2019s ticket, bought at a Menomonie gas station, was the first Powerball jackpot winner sold in Wisconsin since March 2019, when a 24-year-old man from suburban Milwaukee won $768.4 million, the third-largest jackpot in U.S. history. \n\n>Wisconsin does not allow players to claim their prizes anonymously.\n\n[Source](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/07/24/longtime-friends-powerball-pledge-big-win-after-almost-30-years/)",
