            "body": "19 January 2025\n\n>Spotting a dog struggling to stay afloat in a icy Vermont river, Chris MacRitchie never hesitated:\n\n>He jumped into the frigid waters and waded over to the dog, gently pulling it ashore, where his wife draped it with a sweatshirt. The dramatic rescue on Jan. 10 in Berlin was caught on video by his son and was shared widely on social media.\n\n>MacRitchie\u2019s son first spotted the dog as they were going through the drive-thru of a nearby Dunkin\u2019. \n\n>When they reached the embankment of the Stevens Branch, a tributary of the Winooski River, the father of two felt he had no choice but to save the pooch.\n\n>\u201cIt was like one of those moments everyone probably has in their life like you\u2019re going to make a decision,\u201d MacRitchie said. \n\n>\u201cI felt I was obligated to at least try to fetch this dog out of the river, as I have two dogs myself, and I would hope someone would do that for them if they were in that spot.\u201d\n\n>The video shows MacRitchie \u2014 dressed in a T-shirt, sweats and boots \u2014 approaching the embankment as the dog struggles to get out. \n\n>He calls out to the dog, and his wife can be heard encouraging him to rescue it.\n\n>MacRitchie gingerly steps through the ice and into the river, audibly gasping as he wades toward the dog, which was on the other side of the frozen tributary. \n\n>MacRitchie lifts the dog out of the water and onto the icy embankment. He carries it over to his wife.\n\n>\u201cThe only real stress I had about it wasn\u2019t getting in the cold water. It was the depth. I did not know if it was 20 feet deep or it was 2 feet deep,\u201d MacRitchie said. \n\n>\u201cWhen I broke through and I got on my feet and it was like waist-high, I was actually relieved by that. In my mind, during the moment, I thought, \u2018OK this isn\u2019t that bad. Yeah, it\u2019s cold, but I feel this is a very doable situation.\u2019\u201d\n\n>MacRitchie called the dog\u2019s owner, Morgan Cerasoli, whose number was listed on the dog tag.\n\n>Cerasoli said she had been looking since Jan. 9 for her dog named Arizona, a 7-year-old mutt that had originally been rescued from the side of the road in South Carolina. She was heading to pick up her daughter from school, when she got the call from MacRitchie who said he had \u201cpulled a drowning dog\u201d out of the river.\n\n[Source with full story](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/01/19/mans-dramatic-rescue-of-dog-from-freezing-river-in-vermont-caught-on-video/#:~:text=Spotting%20a%20dog%20struggling%20to,encouraging%20him%20to%20rescue%20it.)",
