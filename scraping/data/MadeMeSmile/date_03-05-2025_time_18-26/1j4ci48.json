He and I were facing the stage.\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, i notice someone is not dancing. I look over and a woman and her friend were being kind of harassed by these two dude bros wearing tank tops and on some sorta drug. They were in front of the not dancing girls and backing into them overtly; obviously making them uncomfortable.\n\nI made eye contact with her and mouthed\u2026\u201dyou ok?\u201d\n\nshe shook her head no. \n\nSo i motioned left with my head and pointed  to my wife and the twins.\n\nThe two girls squeeze through and the guys try to follow and i cut them off with my best white guy dancing. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n it was supper pact and they couldn\u2019t casually dance or nudge their way over, so they stayed put. The ladies danced with my wife and friends. Me and my buddy continued holding hands.\n(joke) \n\n\n\nlater\u2026the wife asks me about the girl. she said she gushed about me saving the night and how fucking terrible those guys were being. \nThis shit happens to women so much\u2026I\u2019m not a white knight or whatever\u2026but i was glad\nto have helped in that moment.

Was chatting to some of my female colleagues and a male colleague came over and grabbed one of the girls by their waist and dragged them off to dance, whilst she was still mid sentence. I asked if she was uncomfortable and she said \u201cyeah\u201d so i grabbed the guys arm and told him to be more respectful.\n\nHe spent the next few hours slagging me off to my workmates and grabbed the girl again which i corrected him on again.\n\nLater on i was smoking outside and i get a text from another girl saying \u201ccan you save me from the guy, hes being really weird\u201d, so i stormed in and grabbed him by the collar, pushed him around a bit and said a few choice words. I left straight away bc i knew id end up swinging at some point, and most of the girls who were there left with me because they didnt want to be around him if i wasnt nearby. We all got ubers to our respective homes.\n\nI was worried it was going to result in disciplinary meetings because i got aggressive, but one of my managers came up to me a week or 2 later and told me he heard what happened and thanked me and shook my hand. Hes knows one of the girls who were being harrassed since she was young so is quite protective over her.  \n\nIt sounds like i made this all up now i type it out, but it is true lol",

I saw the girls were getting uncomfortable because he didn't understand they weren't interested, so I approached them and told them if they don't know what to do, come over and dance or talk with my gf and me until the guy goes away...they came to us in a few minutes and the guy disappeared. They were probably reassurred because I wasn't a lone guy too, but had my gf with me. \n\nIdk, I don't see what you or I did as \"white knighting\", anyone who has a sister would probably be aware what can happen and glad there was someone able to offer some help.",

He's still a huge star for a reason. Because he hasn't really been controversial. He seems like a legitimately nice guy. But who knows I guess. He is an actor.",
