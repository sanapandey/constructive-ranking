It started with orangutans, spread to all apes and eventually I stopped visiting any place that had animals and was not a rescue or sanctuary of some kind. \n\nI have never seen an ape that looked remotely happy in a zoo. And the orangutans would often turn their backs or hide if they could. It made me feel gross and I would tell my kids they don\u2019t like us bothering them so we won\u2019t. Let\u2019s go look at some cool emus or something. Haven\u2019t been to a zoo in decades now.",

None of them can be released to the wild. \n\nZoos are more than just a place for the public to gawk at animals. Most people know Zoos exist as public education about wildlife and sustainability. But they are so much more! They are a place for animal rescue and rehabilitation. They conduct all kinds of research on animal behavior, genomes, etc. They DNA type all animals that, when one is ready to start having offspring, it is paired with as compatible partner as possible to grow the gene pool (in this case, compatible = as different as possible because differences are better). And, some animals actually get enrichment from the people visiting! \n\nZoos are wonderful places that exist",

It doesn\u2019t matter for me at this point in my life as I live in SE Asia and the zoos HERE are horrific places of incredible abuse and neglect. I have lived here for over 20 years now. But even when I go to Europe- which is often- I don\u2019t go to zoos there and the last time I was in the states was in 2016 and I have no intention of returning, so for ME, zoos are absolutely a thing of the past. \n\nI grew up outside of Cincinatti. The zoo there is known for their breeding programs. But I also know they breed and then ship adult animals off to other zoos so they can breed the new babies. They are supposed to be doing all this wonderful stuff, but they are just breeders. It brings in a ton of money because everyone loves to look at the cute babies. They are not picky about where their adults go and they *are* accredited. I knew many people that worked there in various jobs. It wasn\u2019t outright abuse but it certainly was not the place it claimed and still claims to be.",
