Not the usual: \"help mom's cancer\", or \"help us score this touchdown\", the usual me, me, me that his in-box gets inundated with. You, if praying, are saying \"hey Jesus, I don't care about Mee-maw's hip replacement surgery...how you doin' ?\"\n\n\nIf you're not praying, and just super explatively interested in my mental health; then, yeah. I'm good. Thank you for asking.\u00a0",

Also, perhaps I should have been less blunt with the 'reddit armchair expert' comment.\n\nA good way to be able to discern what is AI is to look at a bunch of actually AI generated video, and even try to make it because that makes you familiar with what it looks like and what it's limitations and telltale signs are. For example many shots and expressions and angles of the same person will show clear distortions and inconsistencies in the face and expressions, but there's other signs too.",
