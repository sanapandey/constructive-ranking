The kid jumped into action to protect the dog from something it didn't understand the moment danger became present. That dog is likely more important to that kid than 99% of people in his life.\n2. If the *black RAM truck* going down the road ended up in a serious accident because a child ran into the road to protect their dog, maybe the dipshit driver in the *black RAM truck* should have been paying attention to the road and slowed down when they noticed there's children playing with dogs on that street. Believe it or not I've never ran over a child or a dog, probably because I pay attention while driving.\n3. If you run over living creatures in the road out simply out of convenience, I can't feel any empathy for you getting in an accident. There's a shitload of deer in my area and when they jump in front of my vehicle I slow down, honk my horn, and flash my lights. I don't plow into them full speed because they're in my way and it would annoy me to do anything else. That is psychopathic behavior.\n4. You're analyzing life and death as if it was a math equation. These are thoughts that can only be made in hindsight by people who weren't there. Life is not a trolley problem. You don't get time to consider the logistics and mull over the best outcome in your head to minimize the amount of harm done to all parties. Fight or flight kicks in and you either act immediately (even if it's illogically) or do nothing at all.\n5. They're literally a child. No shit they didn't rain man calculate the best possible scenario in their head. How dare they not sit there and do nothing so they could watch their pet dog, their best friend in the world, get smashed by a dipshit in a *black RAM truck*. I wouldn't have done what he did! That's bad impulse control! What a stupid child! That child needs to be taught a lesson! I'm smarter than this child!",
