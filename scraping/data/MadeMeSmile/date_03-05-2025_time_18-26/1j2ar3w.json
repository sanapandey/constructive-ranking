His range was enough for them to recognize him as a normal/smart/compassionate guy and not a corrupt/serious politician who doesn't share the same world understanding that most people do. \n\nI honestly think that most places might be better off if we had that sort of audition to get a feel for a person and decide who we think is a good, honest, hardworking, smart person capable of doing good in the office rather than some BS divisive 1v1 PR campaign to portray the idea of a person that doesn't even quite exist under it all. \n\nBut to Zelensky's greatest credit, he really did make a difference. I think the world (and definitely Ukraine) would be in a much different and worse position by now if any other leader happened was in his position.",

Whether it be bots praising Trump and downing anyone who is against Trump, to now where there is massive amounts of straight up, clear as day, Pro-Russian Propaganda on TikTok. The goal is likely to flood it so much, mixing with comments of those who ACTUALLY believe the BS (making the bot comments more credible). It\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nReminds me of an experiment. I forget the exact details but it was something like this:\n\nA group of 10 people are called into a room. An extra person, the one who leads the study, holds up a piece of paper with a shape on it. Let\u2019s say it has a triangle. The study leader holds up the paper and asks everyone 1 by 1 what shape they see. Unbeknownst to the tenth man; all 9 other individuals are in on the study, and they\u2019re all instructed to give the wrong shape, and they all give the same wrong shape. The questions gets asked of the first person, \u201cWhat shape do you see?\u201d And the first person answers, \u201cA circle.\u201d Clearly and obviously wrong.\nThis continues 1 by 1 all the way to the tenth individual (who is unaware everyone else is in on the study). The tenth individual is asked the same question\u2026 and he responds the same as all 9 other individuals: \u201cIt\u2019s a Circle.\u201d Perhaps this person was questioning himself. Perhaps he was afraid to stand out from his peers. Maybe he didn\u2019t want the extra attention, or for others to judge him poorly. \n\nThese Russian bots are acting as the study leader and the other 9 individuals who were placed to answer wrongly to gaslight the 10th individual. Converting individuals who are unbeknownst to the setup, and having them parroting along with the rest. \n\nThe only way to combat this is to speak up for truth. To not let individuals sway you from what is right. Explain to others the difference in a triangle and a circle, although it may be clear to you. Calling the ones who get fooled \u201cstupid idiots\u201d won\u2019t make them agree with you even if they realize they\u2019re wrong. \nI\u2019ve found I have massive amounts of common ground with people who voted the wrong way. \nWe can agree on basic things.. we\u2019re human after all. 99% of us want love.. we want to be safe\u2026 most of us just want what\u2019s best for the country..\n\nI\u2019m 23 now, but I remember back when I was 10 or so.. the adults consuming videos that promoted hate towards others who were different. It was nothing compared to now, but that\u2019s how it is, it ramped up slowly. People have been consuming hate and lies for over a decade.. they\u2019ve been tricked. At least the ones I know have been. I know that\u2019s not who they are, but who they were told they had to be if they wanted safety, or love, or enough money to feed their family with, or a future for themselves and their country.\n\nThere are a few who love hate, who love spite. And they are so loud. But most of these people are just lied to and have been for so long\u2026 we have to connect with them as if we care, because we should care.",

Trump knows he's done a shit job and is continuing to do a shit job. He likely will never say it out loud, and maybe hasn't even totally processed it as a self-defense mechanism or something, but I'm positive he knows. He knows Zelensky is the better man, and that makes him angry. Instead of trying to become a better leader and person, though, Trump wants to prove Zelensky isn't any better than he is.\n\nMaybe I'm off base. Thankfully, I'm not in that man's head, but that's my first thought as to why he specifically seems to hate Zelensky even aside from sucking Putins dick.",

After that came the Cold War.\n\nKey moments to read up on, during the Cold War, if you're interested: Berlin Blockade (1948); Korean War (1950-1953); Cuban Missile Crisis (1962); Vietnam War (1955-1975); Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979-1989)    \n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, relations between Russia (under Yeltsin) and the US improved. But it took a bad course again, after Putin took over. (2008 War; 2014 Crimea)  \n\nThe US stood with Ukraine, since the Russian invasion began, until very recently at least. This means aid and weapons for Ukraine, sanctions for Russia.\n\nAs for the present: \n\nThere have been allegations of Russian interference in US-elections since Trump ran vs Clinton. If you missed it, it was almost surreal to watch. The guy literally asked for Russia's help during the campaign, to \"release her e-mails\".   \n\nThere were also rumors about Trump's visits to Russia and acts, that could lead to him being blackmailed, but these are not objective facts, so I won't digress.   \n\nSo yea, to the question as to why Trump/MAGA sides with Russia, considering the international history of not just these two countries, but international relations in general, you have to answer it yourself. The reason is most likely one, that is very selfish and unbecoming of anyone \"serving\" their government on that rank or anywhere close to.",

He\u2019s not siding with either, he just knows the war needs to stop. If we were to fund Ukraine again, more life would be loss, the war would escalate and USA gets absolutely nothing back.

The ones that don't fall for it see reality for what it really is. Trump is a disgrace, and Zelenskyy is admirable. Trump is a coward who ran from war, and Zelenskyy is a hero who ran towards it.
