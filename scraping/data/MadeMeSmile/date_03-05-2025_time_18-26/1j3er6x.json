Just a lack of proper socialization or them being babied (sweet talk, petting) when they show fear can cause or worsen these issues.\n\nAlmost all my clients will speculate that any behaviors like these from a dog mean it must have been abused, but usually that's not the case. He might have been mistreated but he might just have been stray and hasn't learned to trust people. Sometimes a long time in a shelter can really shut them down psychologically, it's a stressful and depressing environment for them. \n\nI'd be interested in more context from whoever took the video. His weight looks really good, looks like one scab on his head but hard to say what might have caused that. Have definitely seen adoption videos where at first the dog is really timid in the new home and doesn't come out for a long time.\n\nIf the dog is willing to be handled I would personally have gotten him out on some walks well before that to  give him some physical and mental stimulation to help flush out that fearful state. The presence of other dogs also really helps speed up the adaptation period.",

I\u2019ve helped socialize dogs in a shelter with some guidance from a trainer, and then simply experience with dogs all my life. I can\u2019t guarantee success in your application or your dog\u2019s reception of this advice.     \n     \nI adopted a dog almost exactly 4 years ago that had a bunch of health issues and was very timid and fearful of the world. I have a video from about a week after adopting her of the first time she plays with a toy and I\u2019m basically crying through it.           The thing that helped the most was simply staying calm and patient and letting the dog deal with their fear through exposure at their speed. Sometimes that meant her turning around and not addressing her fear for awhile, but if whatever it was became normalized enough they\u2019d eventually get curious enough that curiosity would overwhelm their fear. At that point it was helpful to have treats around.      \n       \nFor me, it boiled down to lots of slow, calm support. I didn\u2019t say anything, I just stayed present, mostly still, maybe extended a hand low with my palm up, with a treat if it seemed helpful or necessary, and then patience. She was scared of people, sounds, some household objects, etc and now it\u2019s basically down to storm sounds, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to fully help her overcome. She never barked much, but now she\u2019s confident enough to be more vocal.      \n       \nTL;DR if the dog is afraid of a piece of furniture, sit down near or against it and just chill. If it\u2019s afraid of a person that you\u2019re around regularly, sit with that person and soothe the dog with touch and/treats if they\u2019re willing to approach. These solutions are not fast, but they are relatively \u201ceasy\u201d if you\u2019re patient. It\u2019s habit-forming by simply being calm and re-assuring with your body language over the course of hours/days/weeks/months until things are normalized. Issues with socialization around other dogs is more complicated and definitely requires a trainer aiding in person to understand the specific needs of your dog.",

We had a puppy 20 years ago, and he didn\u2019t know what to make of his first thunderstorm. I made a point of not acting differently or giving him extra attention, but I could tell the thunder was confusing him and making him anxious, so I went to the back door (which is almost all glass panes top to bottom) and looked out at the rain. He followed a minute or so later, calmly sat at my feet and watched the rain with me, and never had a problem with storms after that. \n\nBut then we adopted an adult dog a couple of years ago who was absolutely terrified of thunderstorms. I tried being calm, but then I read something \u2014 I wish I could remember where \u2014 that recommended comforting scared dogs, and that it doesn\u2019t make them feel like they\u2019re being rewarded for being frightened.\n\nAnyway, this dog panicked at the first hint of a storm or faint sound of what we weren\u2019t even sure yet was thunder, and he\u2019d hide under the sofa or behind the toilet in our hall bathroom until hours after the storm passed.\n\nSo I started going in the bathroom when he\u2019d hide there, and throwing him treats and petting and praising him.\n\nNow he\u2019s still not happy about storms, but he won\u2019t hide. He\u2019ll follow me a lot, so he\u2019s a bit clingy, but he\u2019s acting much less fearful \u2014 he\u2019ll even go outside while there\u2019s thunder in the distance now. I guess now he trusts me more than he fears storms \u2014 not quite the same as not fearing them, but at least he can feel safe enough without hiding. \n\nSo in my limited, non-professional, dog-owning experience, the lack of positive reinforcement prevented my puppy from developing a fear of storms, but petting and attention got my fearful adult dog to work up some courage and stop hiding.",

The moment he spotted the crate I\u2019d set up, he darted into it and it was the work of about 10 days before he was comfortable coming out of it, particularly with me in the room.  He and his litter had been living wild, but I don\u2019t believe there was any actual abuse just an extreme lack of socialization.  They were about 5-6 months old when they were picked up, so they missed out on a good chunk of that early critical socialization window.\n\nA friend of mine had adopted one of his litter mates and one thing that really helped that first week+ was when his brother was brought over to my place.  My pup would forget his fear, leave his crate and play with his brother almost as if the humans weren\u2019t there.\n\nHe\u2019s still pretty fearful, but it\u2019s no longer debilitating.  He\u2019s shy around new people and in new situations, but is scared around small children and boxes (which may, after all, contain small children).  He deals with his anxiety by hiding behind me, so I ended up replacing his crate as his safe space.",

After a few weeks it got less and less to where she would see a leash and get happy because it meant outside zoomies time (2 year old Jack Russel Terrier).\n\nThis though, I actually Googled \"Dog came out of crate after 11 days\" and found some articles and apparently this dog was just found abandoned in the back yard by neighbors.  Previous owners just left him behind.\n\nThe good news is, this is a little outdated of a video and not only is he coming out, but the rescue place that has him now, can actually give head scratches and such and one video showed it dozing while having his head on their lap.  They said that he's still pretty terrified of humans but is showing a little more trust day by day.  People who do this to animals is some of the vilest of the vile.",
