When they're kept in the city or suburbia, it prevents them from living the life they're supposed to live. They *want* to be outside and patrol for predators, then chill with their flock once they've checked everything out. They will roam for hundreds of acres to chase off predators. \n\nUnlike every other kind of working dog, livestock guardians were bred to function independently from humans, because they spent months in the mountains with their flocks during the summer months, with only occasional visits from the shepherd. They are strongly independent and need to be able to live out their instincts. They don't have a prey drive so they are not satisfied with things like fetch and tug of war, and in fact it's considered a serious flaw in their breeding if they *do* chase anything other than predators.\n\nDue to their independent nature, they are not interested in learning tricks or doing obedience. They are highly intelligent but are not the typical companion dog. The only way for these dogs to have proper stimulation is to be outdoors with animals to guard.\n\nI grew up on a farm and we always had Pyrs for our livestock. They sleep during the day and patrol constantly at night, barking almost nonstop. Definitely not a dog for if you have close neighbors. \n\nThe crazy thing is that out of all livestock guardian dogs, Great Pyrenees are actually the easiest personalities to manage. Less common breeds like the Kuvasz can be rather feral and standoffish. They have not had genetic and behavioral dilution for show breeding the way some Pyrs have. Nowadays you can tell a huge difference between working Pyrs and show Pyrs just by looking at them. Really rather sad how working breeds are no longer being worked.",

                                    "body": "I just wrote a big giant rambling essay, sorry. I just love talking about these dogs and my life on the farm since I miss it terribly. Anyway:\n\nWe have to remember that wolves evolved to go several days at a time without food. Their digestive tracts are short because they don't need to digest cellulose from plant matter, but they have huge stomachs that enable them to gorge themselves when they get prey. By contrast, animals like horses evolved to constantly graze and therefore have relatively small stomachs but extremely long and involved digestive systems. \n\nThat being said, dogs developed a limited ability to digest plant matter during the process of domestication. Along with that, they lost some of the ability to go without food for long periods, since humans were feeding them. \n\nThe answer to your question? I can't say for sure, because I've never encountered that type of shepherding. Our dogs always had as much food as they could eat, whenever they wanted it. \n\nMy best guess is threefold. First, the shepherds would feed the dogs when they came out. Second, the dogs probably put on weight over the winter, when they were living with the humans, and burned off the extra weight during the lean summer months. Third, livestock guardians absolutely will kill predators that threaten the flock, and their bodies would be a source of food as well. \n\nUsually it doesn't come to killing because most predators run away upon confrontation and the dogs don't chase any farther than they have to in order to protect the flock. They are defensive. If they ran off after, say, a coyote to kill it even after it was no longer a threat, then they'd be wasting energy and leaving their flock defenseless. But sometimes there are predators who make it a fight, at which point the dogs don't back down. Their instinct to protect their livestock is so strong that they'll even confront predators like brown bears (grizzly bears). If it is a single dog, that's a death sentence. In areas with dangerous solitary predators like that, you need at least three dogs so that they can tag-team. They still won't kill the bear, but they will harass it and exhaust it enough to get it to go away. If you live in an area where there are dangerous *pack* predators like wolves or lions, then you need more than that, especially if the flock is large. \n\nMy Pyr would come back with his white fur turned pink from blood. It came from fighting coyotes. None of it was ever his\u2014 their thick fur and especially the neck ruff protects them\u2014 except for a nick on his ear or muzzle here or there. Coyotes are mostly harmless to livestock guardian dogs, even if there are several of them. Still, it's a good idea to have at least two dogs if they are responsible for a lot of animals in a large area. Pyrs will also teach puppies how to behave around livestock, even if the puppy isn't a Pyr. You're out of luck if you have a puppy with a strong prey drive, but regular breeds will learn that cats, horses, chickens, even the pet cockatiel are all *off limits*. \n\nDue to show breeders fucking up the gene pool you'll get the occasional Pyr who, while purebred, chases other domesticated animals, usually chickens. Chickens are the most common victim because they always run in terror, thereby encouraging the dog to chase. It's very sad because chickens can die of heart attacks when they get too scared. A badly bred Pyr will go after cats too. All of this is completely, totally unacceptable and if the dog does it even once, it means that it cannot be trusted as a livestock guardian and must be rehomed. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find a home that can cater to the rest of the dog's needs while also not having anything around that they'll chase.  \n\nPyrs are best used for protecting flocks of sheep, goats, chickens, etc. They will chase off even small predators like raccoons, who are creepy fucks and will murder every chicken in sight just for fun. Their presence also keeps barn cats safe, who otherwise go missing (ie eaten by coyotes) with alarming regularity. \n\nYou get a certain amount of animal casualty in whatever group you have, especially when they're without human supervision. Lambs or goat kids that die shortly after birth, animals that eat the wrong thing and are poisoned, animals that are attacked by predators and die in the attack or of their injuries later. I'm not sure if Pyrs in that unattended situation would eat the corpses of the animals they're protecting. In a well-bred livestock guardian, their instinct to protect their animals supersedes everything else. But I do think that, if hungry enough, they would eat the corpses of predators. Domesticated dogs don't usually eat things like roadkill even if they drag it around, but they might if they had to fend for themselves. We had a coydog (that we found in a shelter; never breed coydogs or wolfdogs!) and she was the smartest damn animal I've ever seen in my entire life. She also would walk right up to roadkill and start eating it like it was Thanksgiving dinner, even though she had a full bowl at all times. She was markedly different from dogs in behavior, and she was only half-coyote! One night she disappeared and we were devastated. There was a coyote pack that we'd heard howling in the distance and we hoped that she'd gone to join them. One day, an entire year later, she showed back up on our front porch like she'd never left. It was such a celebration that I got to stay home from school. And that night, she left again, with the howling coyotes far off in the distance. It was like she decided to stop by and let us know that she was okay. \n\nIf you are looking to protect cows or horses, donkeys or mules are a more effective measure. They will stomp the everloving shit out of canid or felid predators. You have to be careful letting dogs around guard donkeys because most of them do not give a fuck if the dog is a pet. If it's in the pasture, it's stompin' time. They will pick up the predator with their teeth and shake them with extreme violence, kind of the way that a dog will shake their heads during tug of war. Other times they'll pick up the predator and \"throw\" them, easily a dozen feet. However, the level of hatred varies from donkey to donkey, with the less domesticated donkeys usually being the most murderous. \n\nLlamas are sometimes used with cows because they also hate dogs. However, they're not a match for larger predators so they're really only for if you have a problem with the occasional coyote picking off a weak newborn calf or the like.",
