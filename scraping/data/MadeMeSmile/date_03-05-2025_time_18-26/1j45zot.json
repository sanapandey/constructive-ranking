I got my two recent from a cat rescue and just paid the fees and did the paperwork and since they already had their shots/were fixed they came home the same day.  The only reason I haven't been able to take home a cat the same day in the past is because I always adopt from a shelter or rescue and they insist they are fixed before they come home to prevent the cat overpopulation from getting worse.  What kind of reference did they need?  People to say they have seen you with animals and you seemed good with them?  Why would it take two weeks?",
