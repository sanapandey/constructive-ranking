            "body": "Conan is just a nice guy. If you'll indulge a short personal story:\n\nWhen my partner and I got married our friends and family put together a nice video of well wishes for us. While watching it for the first time we were shocked to suddenly see Conan O'Brien pop up chatting like he had known us for years, teasing us, and wishing us the best in all sincerity. A close friend who had previously worked on his show had talked him into doing this after telling him about a bit about us. We've never met the man in person. This was years before Cameo existed and clearly the two of them just thought this would be a hilarious thing to do. He was genuinely warm and funny and it's certainly something I won't ever forget.",

He's always doing things to make people feel appreciated as part of Team Coco and beyond.\n\nMy sister lives on the west coast and our family is all on the east cost and her birthday was only a week ago. She spent it low key and I really felt upset that she didn't get a big celebration. That worry was put to bed when she sent a video of Conan and team singing her happy birthday. Taking time out to do the little things while everything is ramping up for the Oscars. I know my sister feels appreciated and it makes it easier knowing she's working for someone who is genuinely a good person.",

It's the type of professionalism and expertise that I hope to develop one day.",

This was during the height of his run on Late Night and she was absolutely floored.\n\nEvery story I\u2019ve ever heard about him paints him as the friendliest, most down to earth guy with a passion for shocking and messing with people.",
