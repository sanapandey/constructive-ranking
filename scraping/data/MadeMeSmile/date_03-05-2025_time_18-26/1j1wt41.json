Russia views this as a existential threat they're fighting not a economic rival. I wanted Ukraine to push them back, I've donated and tried to support them best I could and still will. But as a nation it isn't worth ww3 over this. This logic is exactly why we made a DMZ in Korea instead of nuking a line between China and Korea and steam rolling Korea. Enough was enough. If Europe wants to lose a entire graduation class AGAIN so be it. We're still reeling from GWOT and for what it's worth yeah Europe responded to our article 5, then abandoned us, under performed in many aspects and held it over us. I do not want to fight Russia.

Generations of poorly educated people, reduced social mobility and increased inequality, fewer protections for people from exploitation, unregulated \"press\" spewing misinformation uncontrollably, and a steadfast refusal to bring your political system up to date - hundreds of years ago it was state of the art, now it is weak and vulnerable to exploitation and manipulation.\n\nThis is not even a partisan issue. The inactivity in the face of warnings that the system is ripe for exploitation were completely ignored, for decades.\n\nYou have a country of indolent, lazy, poorly informed losers who can be easily ruled by fear, and are not educated enough to participate in a democracy, through a constant erosion of their understanding and their rights, for decades. \n\nYou're right to be ashamed, America was a great, visionary country.

You\u2019ll also run in to the problem of private European businesses having the option to buy up Canadian. \n\nWealthier countries pay huge amounts in to memberships, to assist poorer nations, which is great but Canada will lose a lot of money through this (along with another housing crisis) - for example a few of the poorer nations receive over \u20ac250m more than they contribute, which I know Canadians will be pissed about; we\u2019re such a wealthy country that we will be a main contributor by a large margin. \n\nAlso, Canada will be at the mercy of multiple governments on the other side of the planet. Which impose targets, laws and legislation which are EU-wide and don\u2019t always work for individual countries. \n\nI think North Americans have a very rose-tinted view of Europe as this liberal haven of societal tranquility; some few places really do feel that way. However, all of that to say: Canada has multiple military and trade alliances with Europe, which can be nurtured and changed to help everyone, without being at the mercy of the EU, so Canada doesn\u2019t really need to join.\n\nFor the record, I loved being in the EU and marched/protested against leaving the EU.

Military personnel are so closely linked that our people can use it as a path for immigration, can move between each others countries, particularly within the \u2018CANZUCKesphere\u2019. \n\nMembers of the EU have paid into that alliance for decades. You seem to think Canada can just join the EU and immediately put their hand out and get what they want, with absolutely no downsides; this is a very naive view. There are sacrifices to be made and Canada will pay a substantial money to the EU - I don\u2019t care about this, I like the idea of helping Europe but I know a lot of Canadians won\u2019t like it, because they\u2019ll feel it in their pocket. At this point in time, those who know a lot more than us have decided isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nYou seem to have a very strong bias towards joining the EU, which I think is why you\u2019re ignoring all my other points and focusing on the immigration issue that I brought up, as a means to throw out any form of debate. \n\nSo, I\u2019m at work, so I\u2019m not going to have time to find some numbers for you. You can check the latest census, for immigration numbers. If you also compare those to the European census on European populace, who retire to nicer European countries, then you will get some idea of how much we immigrate. Now, take in to consideration that Canada is an extremely desirable place to live, with some of the most liveable cities in the world, according to a worldwide census and public opinion polls (I believe Calgary was number 3 last year). \n\nOk, so that\u2019s a lot of info, but hold on to that. \n\nThere are currently thousands of EU residents who are beings sent to their home countries, many of my friends also have to go home, because of the new immigration laws - so this is another large group who will also come back in. \n\nNow, factor in the immensely dense populations of Europe and consider that some of them currently don\u2019t have a good quality of life. 720million people live on the continent of Europe and many of those people have families and recent ancestors in the EU, meaning many of them can gain an EU passport, we\u2019ve already seen this happen with British citizens, after Brexit. \n\nNearly 500million people live within the EU, all of them (and their companies) will have instant access to Canada, via freedom of movement within the EU; if only 0.25% of them choose to move to Canada, thats over 1.2million people. \n\n0.06% would be over 320,000 people, and that\u2019s if no more ever choose to emigrate again. Canada couldn\u2019t even handle 200,000 in one year. \n\nSo, put all that together with the moving habits of Europeans, the census\u2019 that I\u2019ve mentioned etc. I am fairly confident that even more than 0.25% will choose to move to Canada. However, I am willing to accept that I am wrong. Immigration is only one of the problems. \n\nIf you believe that there are only upsides to joining, I think that you are being willingly naive.",

Particularly in light of what\u2019s happening down south. \n\nWithin the EU, 1.4 million people immigrated in 2024. It was almost always for jobs or education. It is highly unlikely that because of our COL and because just the general cost of coming here, that we will see a huge influx of EU citizens. Will we see some? Of course. But we\u2019ll also see it go the other way. \n\nI have never once said it\u2019s only an upside.

Europe has a migrant problem and Canada has lots of space, just not enough infrastructure to support large scale immigration.

Then I immigrated to Canada when I was a kid, and grew up here as a millennial only to experience the same themes in the \"1st\" world nations now coming to head.\n\nRead [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Sovereign\\_Individual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sovereign_Individual) a few years ago when Brexit was taking place and that was a tipping point for me.\n\nRecently read [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790601-when-the-clock-broke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195790601-when-the-clock-broke) and came to appreciate how the Clinton/NAFTA/Private Equity (Romney's, Bain Capital, Wall Street et al)  years broke Middle white America's back.  The rage simmering from that time climaxed with the Obama year's to the brain rot today.\n\nIt's fascinating plotting these points, but sure does suck living at the end result times.  As a teenager entering University I sincerely thought we were close to realizing Karl Popper's Open Societies.  It's ironic so many \"immigrants\" leave their nations because they are oppressive societies only to vote Right in Canada / US based on closed minded single voter issues like sex education, abortion, LGBQT rights etc.  \n\nI'm sick of red herrings like woke/DEI and want class issues addressed.  Obama was a massive failure in this regard and I hope current generation understands the Democrats enabled this for corporate handouts.",

China has a relationship with Russia, and its more and more Russia depending on China than the other way around.  So China will likely lean a little on Russia in exchange for the Mineral deal -- of which theyll probably give Russia a small cut, in exchange for giving Ukraine some security guarantees.\n\nAlso, Turkey is already actually standing by Ukraine with a lot of military aid.  And Turkey somehow has the ability to do whatever it wants, Turkey could care less if Russia doesnt like it.  Russia does not want to tangle with Turkey, I see Turkey moving more into Ukraine and Russia will stay the hell out of wherever Turkey moves in.\nFor those that are surprised, Turkey is lowkey been punching way above its weight for a while.  To the degree that, when Russia wanted to save its forces in Syria from retribution when Assad finally fell, they dialed up Turkey and begged Erdogan to call his Syrian rebel friends and make sure Russian bases were safe until Russia could pull eveyrbody out ASAP.\nErdogan complied, and now Putin owes Erdogan a favor.  Which Erdogan will call in whenever he sees something he wants, such as security guarantees from Russia if Turkey ends up winning the right to Ukraine's minerals.",

It isn\u2019t much, yet, but even a handful of Republican politicians are backing away and gently/politely/lightly condemning how Trump treated Zelenskyy and how Trump is a bit too friendly with Russia. It may be too much to hope that more politicians find their spines.\n\nAs for everyday U.S. citizens, a significant portion of the population get their news from propaganda or are the types that just keep their heads down and try to ignore everything outside their immediate circle. One potentially positive thing about the breakneck speed that Trump and Musk are tearing everything apart is that our pain will come sooner rather than later, and the more U.S. citizens hurt the better odds of us putting the brakes on it and reversing course. So many people lack empathy so they need to either personally feel the pain or at least personally know someone who is in pain.",

Sorry, didn't realise they were part of the attacking force. Wouldn't have raised all that propaganda and sent the military out there if I'd known. Yes of course I'm answerable to my electorate, why do you ask?'\n\n\nSo an awful lot of the time, one country will just refuse to be drawn into a conflict that they seemed very, very interested in before, and some diplomats might go on holiday and eventually a country on the other side might decide to change their plan or strike a new compromise that seems oddly unambitious. Lots of documented occasions when that country has remained neutral but accidentally left a few aircraft carriers just off their coast in case somebody should find them and use them without permission.\u00a0\n\n\nNot so many documented cases of that the other way. Which is good, because it would raise all kinds of hell if we hadn't always been fully committed to our allies in each of the very well documented intelligence briefings shared with, let's face it, 3/4 of the world in various top secret agreements.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI don't think there are many old countries whose closest allies are always the ones explicitly on the same side: there are definitely countries that have made some inexplicably sudden decisions just after France has had top secret talks to which it definitely was not invited.\u00a0\n\n\nBut I would be very surprised if, in 2025, being a trusted ally meant being able to attend emergency meetings at the last minute and be photographed prioritising a collection of Western in-group members when you were booked to attend your country's Inverness. Independence day / show of unity with the local Muslim population (it's Ramadan, and a lot of Muslim communities need unwavering public support at the moment) / daughter's 18th birthday / weekly Baltic Nations Putin Appreciation Night.\n\n\nI say this with all the insider knowledge and special wisdom you'd expect from a random redditors, but I do know for a fact.\u00a0\n\n\nLoads of countries have open secrets as trivia that the locals all seem to know but has been written down. And you'll remember it every couple of years when that country does something really weird at the Olympics or their President makes an embarrassing mistake or any flights going near their country are oddly expensive for 3 days a year and nobody can ever say why.",

He faces \"corruption\" accusations by the same people making a deal about him not having a specific kind of attire. Does the suit have to be italian for Vance's needs, or does it just have to be silk?

Europe also liked this, after two world wars on its continent. Military research programmes were cancelled at request of the US, arms manufacturing kept to a minimum.\n\nDependency on Russia was mutual for the money it brought them. It gave us peace  for decades, let us not forget that either.\n\nThat balance can change. Russia now says it must, and Europe I think agrees with the US that it should. Our interests are diverging, as shown by recent wars in Iraq, Libya, etc. And we're better positioned geographically to defend our own continent.\n\nThere is no \"hiding behind the US' skirt\" in any of this though.",

My personal guess is that Putin simply flatters his ego and asks for favors. Trump has repeatedly expressed his idolization of dictators. He wants to be one, being remembered as rich and powerful as a result. Putin knows this and knows to take advantage of it.\n\nThat said, if any threats of any type are involved, I would assume that they are the kind that makes Trump aware of the ease with which certain people could inflict harm on his favorite child.\n\n> It\u2019s probably a good thing for all nations to be less dependent on the US, but it\u2019s not so good for the US. Why did Trump agree to it?\n\nDo you believe that he cares? At this point, he signs any EO that hits his desk.\n\nAll he really wanted is to escape prosecution/jail and become king. The former has been achieved, the latter is in the works thanks to the Project 2025 folks.",

My dad would go to the cinema in drab and grey post war Wales and watch films about American teens with hot rods hanging out in diners, listening to records on jukeboxes, and it seemed impossibly glamorous and unobtainable. The USA was the most revered country in the world then and by a long way. He watched the moon landing in complete awe - an achievement that was impossible for a European nation. \n\nHow far the USA has fallen is hard to comprehend. I was due to visit Florida in August - a trip we have now cancelled and with relief when we did so. My wife is from South America and with the weird happenings with air traffic control there and the uncertain political situation cancelling made sense. Not even to mention the fact that we were due to stay with my wife\u2019s aunt, who somehow is a massive maga/Trump supporter DESPITE spending years as an undocumented immigrant from Colombia before getting citizenship and actually voting for Trump in November. This is genuinely crazy to me. When I asked my wife\u2019s aunt why she liked Trump she said \u201che is a religious man\u201d!\n\nFor most of the 20th century the USA was the best country in the world.

You can talk about the ethics of it or if that money would be better spent on American citizens - I\u2019d agree with that personally. However, the point of spending all that money is by design and it is how the US has managed to get their way in the UN, EU, NATO and other global bodies. Does it benefit the average American citizen? Probably not that much, but I don't think the architects of that system had the average American in mind. \nThey just wanted to play empire catch-up with Britain and France (and they surpassed them). \n\nAlthough it\u2019s not all sinister or useless.

So yeah Americans will align. We don\u2019t need this war right now. We can\u2019t support so many countries. But since yall don\u2019t trust Russia, plan B is to continue fighting because there\u2019s no trust in a treaty being kept by putin? What is this logic? So instead of trying yall just want to continue fighting? You\u2019ll never trust putin so I guess this war never ends and I guess America has to always continue fighting? wtf \ud83e\udd23",

Which parts of your country would you be willing to give up for peace? Which people would you be happy giving up on?\n\n3) Putin has demonstrated that he cannot be trusted, many times.

WW2 should have shown you that appeasement doesn't work. \n\n5) You're not in a war, there are no Americans there, no boots on the ground.

Pro Russia sentiment is mostly tolerated by the MAGA movement to further their other goals but if it comes down to it, poll after poll have shown Republicans still mostly don't trust or like Russia.\n\n\n\nIt's worrying and definitely something to keep an eye on, but we aren't at or even particularly near the global crisis point yet.",

Putin only puts up with him because Trump sort of does what Putin finds acceptable. \n\nThe problem within the US as I see it as an outsider is that the democrats are stuck in their ways and aren't addressing the issues why people voted for Trump. Around the elections we got to see a lot of journalists asking random people who they would vote for and why. And this is exactly what they've said. They don't like Trump and he has certain ways of doing things they don't like, but at least he's addressing and willing to take action on those topics. Whereas the democrats just didn't touch those topics and only repeatedly shouted 'democracy is at risk!'. Yeah that's not going to win you an election.\n\nI see the same happening over here. A rightwing party won and they're making a mess out of it. But the left is nowhere to be seen to take action on those topics. So even if this coalition blows itself up the next election a lot of people will still vote right because they're at least willing to tackle those issues.\n\nBut back to: this is who will be fighting. Yeah good luck with that. They all have their own vehicles and weaponsystems and the majority aren't compatible. So the only way this will work decently if they finally start with setting up a European Army that uses the same equipment.",

(who the fuck knows what trump's thinking) comes into Ukraine like the first Gulf War and sets up an extensive air campaign for weeks or months, then rolls troops in.\n\nThis scenario was BEFORE Trump and Vance decided to be dipshit auto salesmen .",

One fight is in their backyard causing a humanitarian refugee crisis while the other would be on the other side of the globe. Regardless of a debate about the morals/ethics, Does anyone really want to go to war with China for Taiwan. If it\u2019s just TSMC foundries that make Taiwan so valuable, why not just incentivize building foundries elsewhere? But That strategy is already underway: CHIPS act. It seems that the US is planning for that eventuality. Is EU really going to bleed for America\u2019s rivalries? \n\nEU may not agree with Chinese strategy regarding Taiwan on principle but turning a blind eye on Taiwan in exchange for peace in Ukraine (and therefore Europe) while cutting out the rot that is the US from NATO would be a strategic win for EU.",

You'll need a lot of time for travel within Canada. Driving across just Ontario takes a little over a day, minimum, and that's if you start early and end late with little stops in between.\n\nSo keep in mind how much traveling from place to place will eat up your vacation time if you wanna see a few provinces. Unless you're planning to fly, but domestic flights here can get pricey. Not sure what Via Rail is like, though.",

You know, like switching from barbecue sauce to ketchup on your ribs. \n\n\nFor centuries, the US had a pretty sweet setup: good neighbors up top, good neighbors down below, and a whole lotta ocean keeping the bad guys at bay. That\u2019s a defense strategy that any tactician could admire... simple, solid, hard to beat.\n\n\nBut now? \n\n\nWell....... things are getting trickier than a penalty kick in a tornado, thanks to Trump driving a wedge between us and our friendly folks up north. Couple that with Canada eyeing Europe like a free agent looking for a new team, and suddenly, we've got EU bases just a snowball\u2019s throw away. Which makes that whole 'The US is virtually untouchable' thing, a part of the past. We could be heading straight for the history books fellas... And let me tell ya, I love history, but I\u2019d rather keep this chapter unwritten.",

Who can do anything about the 'general unhappiness'?\n\nThat's why you get the feedback from Europe and others that it's not enough - there's no message, there's nothing to stand behind, there's nothing a leader can join. The whole message is too vague.\n\nWhy this is important is because you can arrange large protests - Occupy Wallstreet, BLM, Womens March. But this one - what do you (they) want to achieve? Everything very unclear.\n\n  \nNow, you asked what you can do, what we expect you to do - Crystalize a message, whatever you want to achieve and then protest until you achieve it. That's how you make things happen - Boo outside the white house until he can't stand it anymore. Following him around on his golf courses, egg him whenever he sits in a vehicle. Show him that he is not wanted and you want him to resign. That's the message: \"RESIGN NOW\".\n\nBut if you all go home at 18:00, it's not dedicated enough. Please, have a look at all the large protests the last 15-20 years, see what people do and what they achieved.",

They are trying to organize more everywhere, but it\u2019s just been very challenging to get people in the same place. Most people are at least an hour or two from dc, with a majority of the US population several days drive away. And we are all an afraid of being killed, because our leaders have made it clear that it will respond to perceived threats with force. So the benign protests have been all we can do thus far. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Americans are very independent people as a whole who do not take lightly to someone taking away our power as individuals, but the proverbial well has become so poisoned and we are so out-gunned that every move we make must be careful to ensure we aren\u2019t killed. Especially those of us who are queer or otherwise members of minority groups. We have targets on our backs and are very afraid. \n\nI feel so badly that other countries have to worry about the threats here, but it just breaks my heart to hear we aren\u2019t doing enough and that our efforts aren\u2019t being seen.

Up to a million people are dead as a result of this invasion. \n\n- Once Trump was re-elected, he changed Americas position and cut off aid to Ukraine, favored pro-Russia propaganda about the causes of the war and the path to ending it. He called Zelenskyy a \"dictator\". \n\n- Last week he, JD Vance and his cabinet had a now viral meeting with Zelenskyy at the White House and attempted to humiliate him to the extent he would prematurely sign a ceasefire agreement that doesn't guarantee Ukraine protection from further Russian aggression and expansionism. \n\n- In response, European nations (and Canada) are rallying around Ukraine, and discussing forming a military alliance that excludes America. This video is the coalition leaders displaying their solidarity with Ukraine to the world.",

The Russians have nothing in the tank, they're tuckered out, they're done.\n\nThe American citizenry, who voted for trump by majority, have been fighting terrorists for 20 years. They have a lower standard of living than you. They are less healthy than you. They drive to work before the sun comes up, and come home after the sun goes down and cannot afford to eat anything but cheap slop that makes them sick and fat. They can't afford a house, they can't afford to start a family, there's no walkable places with nowhere to meet others and the places there are there's crazy people who'll hurt you.\n\nThey pay for a good chunk of the NATO alliance that protects everyone INSIDE of it. When the entire continent was a pile of bricks in 1945 it made sense to do all the heavy lifting. It was good for American industry (mainly because everyone's industry was destroyed).\n\nRussia has a gdp the size of Texas. China, not so much. China flattens the micro chip producer of the world Taiwan, we're all screwed. We're gonna need every single Bradley sitting out there in the desert, and probably more than that when a million man force tries to land on the Philippines. We don't have that, WE are screwing over the Filipinos. Or the Taiwanese, or whoever.\n\nWhen Americans hear about people richer than them, healthier than them, happier than them. More free than them nicer cities than them are sticking their noses up at them, who aren't even properly fully outfitting their own military and we help in all our security and that they want us, on top of all of that, to pay for tons more military equipment and to land it on your shores, and drive it past all the nice rich, healthy, fulfilling, developed, at ease people and through all your countries to their neighbors RIGHT NEXT to them who we all know are being blown to pieces while you frolick around chasing butterflies, they see you as a bunch of dickheads.\n\nIt makes them feel like they're seen as nothing but a goblin slave army that eats slop and pays for and pushes everything along for the benefit of everyone else, and does the bidding of everyone else. They pay for a lot, a LOT of NATO. You are right next door to YOUR neighbors, they've been getting blown to pieces. And we still see you building like, a tank per year. And drip feeding them just a little to not collapse while you chase butterflies and it isn't a good look for a lot of people in the states.\n\nThe Americans want you to rise up next to them, maybe point to this or that, show US up. Make US look bad, in the best way possible.\n\nIf you're not scared of Russia and their 1960s equipment you need to go into the red with your own equipment, send them A LOT to gain back their land if that's what you want. That will take a long time to re Stock. Maybe a few new military equipment factories because you're already underpowered at your current power level. At the speed you produce currently , it'd take YEARS to rebuild. But they're driving around in 1960s equipment, so what are you scared of?\n\nAnd the fact that you have so few factories, with such a slow production speed is a YOU thing. It took America from a pre war army in 1941 to 1943 to get spun up to an enormous fighting force. Putin blitzed in four years ago and we all thought they'd last a week. There's no excuse (for the Ukrainians, not us) for you.\n\nIt's time to help your neighbors before their entire country is a giant crater, or there's a catastrophic collapse in the front and you are seeing cellphone videos of masses of men (your age) being shot facing a wall and dumped in mass graves in every Ukrainian city.\n\nBuck up and SAVE THEM",

How did we the dickheads react?\nNow Ukraine, a country you swore to protect, asks for the help it was promised and its elected leader gets disrespected and extorted?\n\n\nI'm going to agree on something. We have to stop depending on the US, starting now. Your elected leader has proved his word can not be trusted, and that he is not an ally at all. I don't mean the USA's common people, I know first hand that most of them are decent people and I feel touched by the amount of them just under this post that feel enraged about last Friday, but Trump is acting more like an enemy than an ally lately.",

The deals he makes are also kinda basic thug strategy. He threatens weaker players with tariffs or whatnot if they disagree with his sometimes outrageous demands. Everyone can make deals like that. \n\nHe seems to want the world to see the USA as a major power again, one to be respected and maybe even feared, but he's kinda stepping on a lot of toes along the way.

But you represent a group, and as a representative you need to hold a standard for others to follow, not only those within the same political group as you but especially for those who aren't. Things look grim right now, but you have to understand where these people are coming from if you ever want to change their viewpoint, for even the smallest chance that things will look better in the future. You're never going to convince anyone of anything if you come storming out of the gate saying things like \"I'm not going to be nice or civil\" because you're only giving them exactly what they expect from you. \"Oh, did you hear that? Liberals don't care about being nice or civil anymore. They literally admit it! How could anyone side with them when they stand for nothing but being evil and ungodly, truly the work of Satan himself!\" -this is what conservatives will view not only you, but the entire party you represent as if you continue this method of approaching topics, which includes how they will view me as well. Again, I know it's difficult, but you have to stay strong and think, it's exactly what these people don't expect you to do. As a representative of my party and me as an individual, I'm asking you to be more logical in the way you approach ideas and speak about topics publicly.",

So stop being afraid and stop them.\n\nThe \"they will kill us all if we rebel\" is the same excuse germans and others used when nazis were in power, and because of that they ended up killing 10 million people. They feed on your fear, you are more people than them in numbers. Use the numbers.\n\nI don't know how much more clear can I be. It is that or ending, down the line, in concentration camps for migrants. Or them hurting political dissidents, gays, women, people of color and so on...why? Because reasons... You decide what matters to you most, your future and the ones of your children, the freedom you always talk about all of the time, or how nice the assholes in your country think you are towards them, because what else can you do, while they destroy your lives.\n\nThe instability is already happening, you decide if it lasts a short time or a long time. And if it ends up lasting a long time you are gonna be left alone for the foreseeable future due to becoming backstabbing traitors to your allies.\n\nPD. Revolutions have happened in every country in the world at some point. Yours was so long ago you have forgotten how to even massively protest, which is a basic human right everywhere around the world. And if in your country is not, then you live in a dictatorship. \n\nFfs, even Iranian women were protesting knowing full well they were gonna end up, in the best of cases, in jail and in the worst dead, because no one gives two shits about them. And they still did and do it anyways because they are fighting for their rights.",

Zelensky broke first and so far as I can tell, he just wasn\u2019t interested in staying on point, getting the deal done, and then moving on to negotiate security guarantees which Trump clearly communicated they would do. \n\nVance did not help. The reporters did not help. But from where I\u2019m sitting, Zelensky screwed this up and Trump surprised me by affording him a very long leash for 50 minutes. Spare me your unrealistic lack of nuance please.",

As a result, he threatens to leave and now all the EU countries are banding together to contribute to Ukraine more substantially so the US isn't shouldering all the weight. \n\n\n\nIn Canada, Trudeau was talking about sending seized personal Firearms of Canadian Citizens to Ukraine as part of their war effort. The Canadian Government spends <1% of our GDP (NATO standard is 2%) on defense spending and we sent Ukraine all of our Ammo (which wasn't much) because the idea was the USA will shoulder the weight. Why is it ok for us (Canada) to do that to our ally in the USA and Ukraine? Now, realizing that the USA was all that was keeping WW3 at bay is when we all started getting together to support Ukraine more. I feel like this is a win for Ukraine with more immediate (proximity) support from the EU, the USA, as they are not shouldering all the weight, and even Countries like Canada who are being strong armed into spending what we should be on our armed Forces (for context, our military equipment, ammo supply and people are falling apart and are not functional, literal laughing stock of NATO). \n\nPlease let me know where I am wrong on this, trying to learn so please be respectful",

Why can\u2019t we expect other countries you know to pay a fair share ? Why do other countries get loans against their payments? Why is America the only country that didn\u2019t ask for any money back? Like people really think America is a charity. And it has been. Why does it have to be this way? Can we help our country first? We have problems here. Ukraine isn\u2019t a higher priority than helping Hawaii or California citizens but yet it is. \n\nIt\u2019s just sad that people hate this just because of trump but also are completely cool with the uneven payments from other countries.

Maybe it had something to do w the meeting w a few Trump hating democrats just before the meeting w Trump, maybe not.\nOne thing is for sure, Zelensky will be back to meet w Trump to sign that deal.. Why you ask?\nBecause if the EU really could stop this they would have by now. That can\u2019t. They won\u2019t.\nIf they could shame on them for just coming to the table now.. This is 100% for show and nothing more. If I was a Ukrainian I\u2019d be beside myself angry w Zelensky, the entire EU as a whole, and Canada honestly..\nWhy is Trudeau even there? What the fuck is Canada gonna do?\nAgain downvote if you want, I\u2019m no Trump fan but he is not wrong on this..\nInstead of American troops on the ground in Ukraine (which is what Zelensky wants as well as allowing Ukraine into NATO) Trump had a solution that made sense for America which is the ONLY country that can get Ukraine out of this\u2026",

Him trying to garner support globally is not a disservice to them.    \n  \nCan't look at the event as being caused by just one guy, especially when he's only been present for the latter third of it.\n\nI'm curious, how do you feel about Putin in all this?  \nOver 200,000 Russians have died due to this invasion, by your logic wouldn't he be just as culpable?",

Europe will develop its own defence over time. Every nation will increase efforts to source elsewhere and trade away from the US dollar. It will take a generation, but this is really bad for the US long-term and absolutely fantastic for China and Russia.\n\nIt won't take long for China to create its own technology equivalents of everything that comes out of the US and these actions are only accelerating by splintering existing alliances.

The DOD is clearing out the old barn and better yet, restocking the shelves with cutting edge tech.\n\nLindsey Graham himself said that Ukraine was the perfect ally because not a single US Soldier has been killed. Ukraine have been fighting this war with foreign weapons but also with their own blood, a huge and important thing to remember. \n\nEurope is taking the lead on the humanitarian front too, there are 7 million displaced Ukrainians, \\~200,000 are currently in the USA.\n\nTrump and Vance have their heads in the sand, the USA helped convince Ukraine to give up their Nuclear Arsenal, then Russia broke their word and invaded Crimea, then they negotiated peace and a ceasefire, which Putin broke again and invaded, again. \n\nSo Zelensky, tries to advocate for his people, to say that there is no \"peace\" with Russia and that they only respond to strength. And he gets kicked out of the Whitehouse for it.

None of these economies can support Ukraine without the US, as they have all let their militaries go to hell under the US umbrella. Russia invading Ukraine was a horrid, disgusting thing to do but to continue this course is a losing game for everyone. Eventually Russia will grind up Ukraine and nothing of the Ukraine will survive. An immediate cease-fire (if Russia will even agree to that at this point) would be preferable this continuing this was of attrition, which Ukraine will eventually lose. These useless leaders will continue to throw their surplus military equipment at the Ukraine meat grinder in the faint hope that those extra Leopards and F-16s will finally turn the tide of this war.

This possibility is exactly why the USA does not want to discuss security guarantees like this. Notice how trump said Zelenskyy is gambling with world war 3? This possibility of other countries coming to russias side militarily in response to nato is exactly what he\u2019s alluding to.",

As it was easier to believe in obvious untruths than to act on their own behalf.\n\nThe munich conference of 1938 and it's immediate fallout is a Lehrst\u00fcck in what happens if we don't stand our ground in the face of upcoming disaster: when the Agreement was signed everyone knew that Nazi Germany would not serve it's part of the contract. They had shown they wouldn't several times in the past and nobody opposed them fearing war, when at the time the great war could have been avoided as Germany was weak. When they rearmed the demilitarised Rhineland it would have been not only reasonable but legally binding to push them back. France and England did not. That gave them the time and resources to prepare their attack on Poland, Denmark, France, the Balkans and the Soviet Union. Millions died because nobody dared to point out the obvious, fearing a then loudly barking dog that would soon become a rabid wolf ravaging Europe.\n\nWe won't let that happen again. We can't make concessions to Russia as that clearly would put every other country in its proximity on their dinner table, losing their statelihood, their souveregnity and - we've seen that in the occupied parts of Ukraine: Their existence. For the Russian leadership genocide has always been and still is integral part of their modus operandi. Nobody is safe, except his stance is strong enough to withstand.\n\nIf ~30-40% of Americans who voted for Trump are contempt with surrendering theirselves, their freedoms and their democracy to the will of a small elite of hyper rich want-to-be kings it's their good right to do so - even if said President is a Russian asset. But we will not accept being called warmongers just because we're planning our defense against powers that want us removed, marginalized, unempowered because they fear our universal values that don't care about political alignment on the left-right axis. Human rights, equality, freedom are the foundation on which this union is built and it is consensual between all democratic political factions and parties that are part of it. The only ones opposing that are the ones that want to destroy and undermine that foundation for their personal gain, for power that's unchecked, for autocracy instead rule of law.\n\nAs of 2025 that not only includes Russia but also the United States of America.",

I may disagree wholeheartedly with your assessment of this conflict, but I entirely acknowledge that your experience of what war is will be truer than mine. And, not necessarily by the same token, but perhaps prompted by it, I'd like to apologise if I lowered the tone. I feel your argument was disingenuous and insincere, but I understand that you're coming from a place I can't possibly empathise with, and I'm sorry that it's a place you are coming from - as I say, I can't imagine.\n\nI think, at a very high level, we both have the same fundamental principle but see the underlying mechanics totally differently.\n\nFor me, and the strong majority of Europe, the scars of fascism, expansionism and militarism cut to the core of our shared identity. When we see evidence (and on this I will not budge) of crimes against humanity - the murder of unarmed civilians, torture and execution of prisoners of war, bombing of nurseries and schools - we feel the echoes of the trauma that will forever mark this continent. And we also know how we got there last time - as a Brit, my country (alongside innumerable abuses and atrocities) will forever bear the responsibility for having tried to appease a warmonger whose word meant nothing, and for the consequences of what followed.\n\nSo when we see a war of territorial aggression fought on our continent, that bears those very same hallmarks, our terror is equalled only by our resolve to not make the same mistakes that led to the unparalleled horror that started in Europe generations ago. That is part of our European identity.\n\nThe US joined that conflict when the war spread, but was staunch in its support for the UK when it stood 'alone' against a militaristic power that had claimed Europe. To see our ally turn it's back on Europe now is, in equal parts, heartbreaking and terrifying.\n\nEurope will fight if it comes to that, but peace in Ukraine, in the way Washington and Moscow propose, is no peace at all for our continent, or the world.\n\nPutin didn't stop at Transnistria, Abkhazia, Ossetia or Crimea, nor will he stop at Luhansk and Donetsk. We know because it has happened before, and that bloodlust doesn't stay confined within continental boundaries.\n\nI hope we collectively recognise that before it's too late to stop, but it seems with every day that passes that that window may have already closed.",

I am very confident that he will be exposed by the Trump New Administration and another very smart successful Billionaire businessman who knows how to find the wasted money and over payments and corruption and theft and I hope that all of the thieves will be arrested and prosecuted and punished for their crimes and actions while working for the people of America",

Meanwhile, the American taxpayers, per Zelensky came up with $120 billion to defend Ukraine.  when asked to repay or at least guarantee the return of future financial support, Zelensky, the dinner theater Che Guevara imitator who can't find a suit, threw a fit.  therefore, The logical takeaway by folks who have done comparatively next to nothing to help, is to blame Trump.  it is like Mommy and Daddy are bad because they don't want to pay for the things you want and are completely unable and or unwilling to pay for. how unfair.  there's absolutely nothing anti-ukrainian in asking a nation to help pay a part for its own defense, particularly after it helped pay for its own invasion.
