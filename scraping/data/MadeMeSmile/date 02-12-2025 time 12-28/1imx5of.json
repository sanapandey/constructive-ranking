During a particularly very long and crappy day, at the end of another 16 hour shift, I found a little crocheted wormy friend on a shelf with a similar note. Sadly, the creator didn't leave any information of where to post anything, just said \"post on social\" (I think they were new to the idea and still workshopping the notes).\n\nAll I know is that my little wurmy buddy is awesome, made me smile, and is still on my keychain to this day.",

And one year a freshman happened to paste sticky notes with positive affirmations on all the lockers. And that day I happened to be having a breakdown in the hallway for whatever reason. So I saw one of the notes that said YOU HAVE WORTH, but this kid\u2019s handwriting slurred the capital T and H together, and so what the note actually said was YOU HAVE WORM. And seeing a note that said YOU HAVE WORM was so baffling and delightful that I immediately stopped crying and took the note with me \ud83e\udeb1! Still have it nearly ten years later! and I can always count on YOU HAVE WORM to cheer me up if I need it.",

Even though I was being polite and was asking normal questions like where is the Granda room located? Do you have restrooms on this floor? And using \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you\u201d\n\nAnyway, I came to the venue early so I took a walk outside before it started and got a snack at a gas station. Couldn\u2019t shake this lady\u2019s nastiness out of my head and could feel some anxiety and anger pent up, but I did the therapy thing on myself, counted to 5 and tried to put myself in her shoes. Instead of making it about ME I thought to myself \u201cthere\u2019s a chance she\u2019s having a really bad day\u201d and remembered how I feel when I have bad days and am forced to interact with people. So I bought a chocolate bar for her, figuring that might make her day. \n\nWhen I came back I gave it to her, saying oh! Thanks for your help earlier I got you this treat! and honestly she looked like she was going to cry. She thanks me profusely and I was like oh no it\u2019s totally ok! I was just going on a walk and thought about you. I could tell it really turned her day around.\n\nYou just never know what a small gesture can do to impact someone\u2019s day or even life.\n\nAlso it rubs off! I was so happy I made her happy I snuck out a bunch of chocolate wafers from the conference and gave them to the security guard, the janitor, the gardener, it was awesome.",

I used to work at a Starbucks then so I was walking to work one morning at around 3:45 am I imagine since that store opened at 5 and you had to be there an hour early. It was bitter cold and I only had a ratty jacket. No gloves, no hat. It was full dark and no one was in sight.     \n\nCrossing a road I came across a pair of mittens. They were machine not hand knit but they were dry, lined with microfiber, and had soft leather pads on the palms. They were just \u2026 placed there, one neatly on top of the other dead center of the road as if someone knew someone like me would come along. I looked around confident the person who dropped them would be just a block away- they were in *perfect* condition and still dry - but no one was in sight. I took the mittens.    \n\nIt was the beginning of the end of a long and dark time in my life. When I think about when the turning point was for me - when things got better - it was the mittens. I still have them. Wore them for years. They\u2019ve begun to unravel so a few years ago I designed and knit my own mittens to rival those.    \n\nI can\u2019t overstate enough how much.. idk finding something like that when I needed it most mattered.",

People who seem to have goals, motivators, agendas, etc. but here you are wandering aimlessly. The only thing you feel more than hopeless is alone. Then you stumble upon this, as you read the note, you clutch the bear then fall to your knees crying. \n\nAs you\u2019re, more than likely, squeezing the ever loving stuffing out of said bear while sobbing, you start calming down. Instead of blowing your nose, as you have no tissue, you are relegated to give a deep sniffle or two. But there was something different about that second sniffle. Huh, what\u2019s that? \n\nSomething triggered a feeling you can\u2019t process, let alone describe. It\u2019s a feeling you haven\u2019t felt in so long that you don\u2019t recognize it at first. You feel warm inside. On top of that, it\u2019s as if you almost feel a sense of security. What you do recognize is the presence of someone. Your head snaps left while simultaneously quickly surveying the immediate area, then whips right in the same vain. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d you ask timidly. \n\nUpon realizing you\u2019re still alone, you wonder, what was that? Where did it come from? You pull the bear in closer, squeezing in a hugging manner as you inhale the flood of memories come rushing back like a tsunami. The tidal wave of memories crash through the calloused shell you\u2019ve grown, your brain as you\u2019re instantly reminded of happier times. When mom and dad still loved each other, when all you seen was good in everyone you came across. You remember a homemade Cookie Monster birthday cake on your birthday. Then there\u2019s the smell of freshly baked cookies tickling your nostrils when you walked in the house after getting off the school bus at the end of your day. \n\nThat\u2019s it, the trigger, it was the smell of apple cinnamon, potpourri. The dried out stuff on every coffee table, side table, counter you name it. You remember the dried out flower pedal looking stuff that your parents told you not to touch. At this moment you\u2019re almost \u201cugly crying\u201d as you take off running. Only this time you\u2019re running to something.  You have an agenda, a motivator, a goal, and most importantly, a sense of purpose.\n\nWhomever crocheted that bear, is not only a hero but they are an inspiration as well. Thank you very much OP! I\u2019m literally posting this and looking for a crochet class, or a crocheting teacher. Preferably a sweet older lady that enjoys baking regularly, with potpourri on her table!",

I hadn't left the house for a while at that point & was super nervous. On my way i found a bright orange crocheted butterfly with a similar note, sounds corny but seemed like fate. The butterfly lives on my tree in my house (it's a small wire framed tree with light up flowers, kind of a glorified lamp lol). I have lots of things that hang on there which mean something to me & I see the butterfly daily :)",
