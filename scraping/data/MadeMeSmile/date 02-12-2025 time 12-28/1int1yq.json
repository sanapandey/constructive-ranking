What started as playing around turned into something we're proud of. Fast forward a bit and this morning we had our single play on 88.1FM in West Michigan, marking the first time any of us has ever been on the airwaves.\nMaking this happen accompanied by the sounds of some of my longest friends means everything. Very good morning.",
