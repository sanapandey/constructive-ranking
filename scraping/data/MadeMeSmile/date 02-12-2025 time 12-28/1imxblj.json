During the 3 years, long expedition Laufer gathered 143 photographs, however, there is no information on how he acquired them because there is no evidence that he took the photos himself. There is also no explanation of who is the Chinese man in the photo and why he decided to strike a pose like that. However, some people speculate that when a man was asked to pose for a photo, he wasn\u2019t aware of a western tradition to keep s serious face during the process.\n\nFor around 100 years since photography was invented, smiling was a rare occurrence. It only started to become the norm In the late 1920s. You may wonder how this sort of tradition was born. Well,\u00a0there several explanations. Some people argue that poor dental hygiene led people to smile less. And while most people could afford to have their photo taken probably once per lifetime, they didn\u2019t want to go down in history by showing a toothless grin.\n\nOther\u2019s say that the time it took to take a picture is to blame. However, it\u2019s only partly true. While the very first cameras did, in fact, had a very long exposure time, some of which lasted around 8 hours, things swiftly changed. By the 1850s and 60s, the exposure time was shortened from hours to seconds, so people didn\u2019t have to stay in the same position for hours, and capturing smiles became easier.\n\nBut probably the most plausible reason is that people early photographers followed the footsteps of painters. Back in the day, many portraits didn\u2019t show smiling people, so it didn\u2019t felt natural to allow people to smile in the photos too.",
