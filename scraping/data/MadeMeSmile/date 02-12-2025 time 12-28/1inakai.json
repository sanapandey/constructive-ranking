I\u2019d rather my child be seen for what he can do and the happiness my child brings than a list of medical issues. \n\nBut here we go\u2026\n\nWhat you are referring to here is the burden component. That the inspiration only comes from a place of pity and condescension. (That\u2019s simply not true.) The \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do it\u201d and \u201cGod gives exceptional babies to exceptional parents\u201d I\u2019ve been told constantly. Borrowing copy from religious scripture and motivational speakers who overcame adversity, etc. I understand that can be grating for many, and I agree it was more difficult on me when I wasn\u2019t as accepting of the condition. Parents hate pity. I know when my baby had tubes coming off his face I felt the pity in the room at my older child\u2019s birth parties. I hated going but I couldn\u2019t hide. My inability to deal with comments and looks was because I was not as accepting and ready to educate, and not the other way around. People generally are just trying to be well meaning and have natural curiosity. I am not going to roast people for saying the wrong thing or cry about it later. I\u2019d rather they acknowledge my child\u2019s existence than be concerned to engage.\n\nI understand that sometimes parents get upset about infantilizing. But for me personally, I welcome the focus on his strengths and abilities and the joy he brings to everyone in his life. I don\u2019t think it makes him \u201ca baby\u201d as he has aged. My child is happier than most kids and spreads joy everywhere, which I know can be a stereotype with other conditions but hell I am celebrating he\u2019s happy in world where most people are bitter and self absorbed. He can really get a dance party going and doesn\u2019t know a stranger. \n\nNot to get political here, but the proposed cuts to Medicaid and DoE that supports disabled children and adults are a threat. I don\u2019t want others without my means to let their kids rot away in institutions because they can no longer provide for them. We need people who see them for their value-add to society beyond economic because without allies we can\u2019t get care that improves their lives and outcomes. And with the rise of eugenics and attempts at erasure of others with differences in the air it\u2019s more important than ever that people see the love and bond a special child can bring to a parent and the world. Like this child in the video who has more challenges than mine. My child is wonderful and a life worthy of life just like this child and not just because of \u201cwhat he does for me.\u201d \ud83d\ude44 Our child is a part of our community and a hell of an inspiration and joy and deserves space in this world and all we can give him. That my child has taught me a thing or two has been a privilege that I will not apologize for\u2026EVER.",

They said to not look at the condition and to instead look at the value the child brings to those around them. You wouldn\u2019t write that paragraph if someone said their  healthy baby being born inspired them to be a better person.\n\nYou\u2019re the one who is looking at the kid as a disability rather than a child with that dumb ass thought process.",

However please realize you are going to be biased by the negative experiences. As part of advocacy in a needs-based system is a parent that must speak to the hardships and negatives to doctors, school, insurance etc. to advocate for what they need. In those situations yes, you can\u2019t sugar coat it. Telling parents in that context when they say they need help that they don\u2019t and should be grateful and blessed is condescending. In that context my child has to be reduced to the pages of diagnoses and support needs as it\u2019s part of that process. My child needs a wheel chair because xyz. My child needs an off formulary medication because abc. My child needs this in his IEP or therapy/nursing support because of a long list of limitations. I would never tell anyone they are \u201cblessed\u201d by any hardship situation. I know how hard it is. I advocate like hell. Any special need parent who cares at all is going to be overwhelmed and face hardship. I do most days. But that\u2019s one hat we wear. I wear my child positive hat whenever I can because it\u2019s hella important he knows how loved and valued he is and that\u2019s he\u2019s not a burden and that we are proud of him and he\u2019s welcome and included. All that extra work, time and love builds compassion in all of us. His diagnoses, surgeries and hospitalizations aren\u2019t what make him who he is. As a parent we celebrate all the light and love he brings. Being grateful for my son, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m telling others to they need to be grateful and that it\u2019s not hard. I am glad you clearly care about your job and want advocate for these kids we need more people like you, but consider the multiple hats parents may be wearing when they have to code switch from disabilities and needs to get resources to abilities and child first positivity. I also spend more time trying to be positive for him because they see and understand it\u2019s hard. No one in my life is telling me it\u2019s easy.",
