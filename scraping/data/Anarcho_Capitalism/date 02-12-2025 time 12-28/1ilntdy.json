In many if not all of those a certain degree of the state is considered necessary, and therefore so are taxes. \n\nSo unless you want to argue that the only form of Libertarian possible, to which I'll disagree before someone snarkily tells me they do, is the Ancap one, then saying you want some taxes doesn't automatically make you a no libertarian. You need to measure the scope of taxes, and make a subjective opinion if said person is or not a libertarian based on said taxes.",
