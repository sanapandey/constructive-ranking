Was told that my statement was a neo-reactionary AnCap talking point and they rebutted that the PATRIOT Act could be repealed. Nothing but silence when I pointed out that it's been 20+ years and no one has repealed it. People tend to only see things in the short-term and never bother to see anything further past tomorrow because everything was fine yesterday. The lackadaisical approach of \"nothing ever happens\" is what has allowed this slow descent into political madness that when it finally just falls off a ledge, it will take most everyone by surprise.",

Going \"anyone who wants any form of a state is a statist\" is a great way to have no one listen to you. \n\n> Trump is more \"libertarian\" than any elected US president of my lifetime. \n\nDude, Trump is a straight up authoritarian, thinking he's not... I can see your problem where you don't understand this spectrum.  \n\nALSO, What \"Libertarian\" means, IS the definition of the word, you can't just change it as you want.  But because he's using force to do all that \"Libertarian\" work, means he's just an authrotarian.  Maybe tear down what the Left likes, but already is putting a \"Faith Office\" in place.  Shit that's growing the government, just in HIS direction. \n\nTrump ain't Milel... You need to understand what he really is, and not just what he said.

If you vote for candidate C, you\u2019ve indirectly just taken away a vote from candidate B(meaning candidate A now has a vote extra), because voting for candidate C has as much impact as not voting whatsoever. Now, if you don\u2019t prefer A or B, voting C or not voting at all is practically the same. If you vote just to vote, yeah sure go and vote C, but you\u2019re not making any difference",

It\u2019s the entire reason the country was designed how it was. \n\nAlso you do understand that 55% of the debt under Trump is directly attributed to a global pandemic correct? Providing comparisons without considering this important key point is rather deceptive. \n\nI find some areas of hope with Trump during long interviews he\u2019s given. He\u2019s specifically been open about how last time he was in office he didn\u2019t have much of a clue what he was doing at first since he was new to politics and took most of what the people around him said and took their guidance. \n\nIt\u2019s pretty evident so far this term isn\u2019t like his last. He\u2019s working quickly to shake things up which is what the country needs. We can\u2019t continue down a path of endless government overreach, propaganda, incredibly reckless spending policies and the eradication of American culture through government sponsored mass immigration and expect our country to continue to survive as a somewhat free society. \n\nWhile Trump isn\u2019t an ideal leader or who I would ever want in ordinary times, this isn\u2019t ordinary times. Our country is deeply fucked. You are seeing the pendulum swing.",

Tariffs are not ancap sure, but y'all act like before Trump there weren't any tariffs as if he is bringing them back from the 1800s\n\nTariffs are a tool to determine where shit is made.  Shit we make and we export gets tariffed.  That's why nothing is made here.  Not to mention we pay for China's global shipping.  That's how China gets shit to your door cheaper than it cost you to ship something across the state.\n\nSo if you like free markets evening out the tariffs is about the next best thing.  Yes it's going to be painful but that's what you have to deal with when you're fixing bad policy.\n\nTaking the guns first.  You're just dumb.  His supreme court appointments were pretty great and his executive order bump stock ban was perfect.  In the US you can't bring something for a court to judge if there are no grievances.  He made the absolute weakest case for the government.  The backlash was probably the most libertarian outcome ever.  The end of Chevron deference.  Basically unelected officials like the ATF can't just interpret a law to be whatever the fuck they want.  Like holy shit that's amazing.  We got fucked for decades because people cared about what people said and felt over results and actions.  While his actions were admitted eye raising... The result was outstanding.  In business and politics you don't get what you want directly.  I don't think he expected it to be such a win but I do believe it was intended to be a win for the gun owners overall.\n\nTaking over gaza... Gonna be straight here.  No way to spin it.  As Rogan said Trump says a lotta wild shit.  Going to wait and see how it plays out. \n\nThe panama canal I'd rather control it than the communists.\n\nWar on drugs this is just going to fail on its face.  Probably the worst thing on the list.\n\nWarrantless FISA spying... I stand corrected, but still this is a Bush Obama thing.  He should end them but I have little hope \n\nThe border thing.  Yeah might not be the most libertarian approach, but we're not setup for open borders.  \n\nYou know what else isn't free markets.  Public indoctrination camps.    Alllthe welfare etc. \n\nLegalize drugs and get rid of public schools and any public assistance what so ever... The border takes care of itself no fence needed",

However, enacting retaliatory tariffs in response does not actually help those manufacturers and does harm US consumers who now pay higher prices for the goods they buy. \n\nThe idea that domestic manufacturers will just switch and start producing those goods that were previously imported instead, while possible, still makes people materially poorer. That's just economic fact. \n\nTariffs may be preferable to the income tax, depending on how they were structured and the rate, etc., but they are almost always going to be used as additional revenue stream, not as an alternative.",

The cheap goods from overseas are in part subsidized by our taxes.  This is a big problem and not free market. Not to mention now more money stays in the economy.",

It's that domestic producers can only produce so many things, resources devoted to making product A cannot be simultaneously devoted to product B. So, if domestic manufacturers shift their capacity (in whole or in part) from whatever they were doing to now manufacturing things that used to be imported, it makes Americans materially poorer. Because they now have access to fewer goods than they did previously. \n\nThis is not even mentioning the domestic producers who use imported components in order to make their products.

The enemy of my enemy is my friend in this case. If Trump manages to tear down significant parts of the federal government, it will really cut in to the slush fund enjoyed by the socialists. A long term win. \n\nAlso, people cry about tariffs, and tariffs are bad. But there is no \u201cfree trade\u201d in the world. So-called \u201cfree trade agreements\u201d are just a set of negotiated tariffs and limits. So Trump threatening his own tariffs because he doesn\u2019t like the trade policies of other countries isn\u2019t any less \u201cfree market\u201d than what we have now.\n\nOffering the people of Gaza an alternative to living in a shithole ruled by a gang of terrorists could be seen as free market. Trading one piece of land for another.\n\nAs for the Panama Canal, giving it away was stupid. But the treaty gives us the right to defend it. We perceive a threat, we have the right to move in per the freely negotiated agreement.\n\nI\u2019m still hopeful about gun policy, but it\u2019s clearly not a short term priority for Trump. I hope his sons have his ear on this issue.\n\nTrump didn\u2019t invent the war on drugs or FISA. He doesn\u2019t have choice on how to prosecute them. We\u2019ll see how that goes, but I doubt much will happen there. The war on drugs is still reasonably popular, but we might make progress on weed and mushrooms. War on cartels is another issue. They are actively engaged in murder and slavery. Any action against them is justified.",
