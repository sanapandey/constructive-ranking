    "selftext": "The federal government is spending 7.19 Trillion per year right now. If we cut it back to 5.19 trillion, that would bring us back to\u2026 2020 levels. How is that ok? How is that the stated goal? At that point the spending and debt had exploded to unacceptable level. Two Trillion will barely put a dent into the problem\n\nHere\u2019s the Federal Spending over the years:\n\n1980) 0.524T\n\n1990) 1.157T\n\n2000) 1.735T\n\n2004) 2.176T\n\n2008) 2.823T\n\n2012) 3.595T\n\n2016) 3.750T\n\n2020) 5.603T\n\n2025) 7.118\n\nHere\u2019s the Federal Debt over the years\n\n1980) 0.864T\n\n1990) 2.907T\n\n2000) 5.734T\n\n2004) 7.071T\n\n2008) 9.799T\n\n2012) 14.903T\n\n2016) 19.316T\n\n2020) 25.733T\n\n2025) 36.471T\n\nAnd here\u2019s the total government spending (Federal + State + Local):\n\n1980) 0.844T\n\n1990) 1.927T\n\n2000) 3.132T\n\n2004) 3.961T\n\n2008) 5.444T\n\n2012) 6.161T\n\n2016) 6.699T\n\n2020) 9.281T\n\n2025) 17.786T (!!!)\n\nWe went from spending $3,456 per person is the U.S. in 1980 to spending $50,261 PER PERSON. The government is spending over $200,000 per year for my family of 4. How much value am I getting from that spending? They can buy us a house every year if they wanted to. Want a waste\n\n2T at this point is a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s not fixing anything here. We need major surgery. We need to go back to 2000 levels at least. That\u2019s 3.265T when you adjust for inflation, and which would be an almost 4T cut. And that\u2019s just the federal level. We need another 14.5T cut in total government spending (would be 12T cut after inflation). The states have to do their part. \n\nOn the flip side, anyone saying that cutting 2T will mean the government can\u2019t function\u2026 um, I direct you to 2020. Going back to that isn\u2019t that big a deal. Stop complaining liberals!",

Spending shouldn't be the only metric, it should actually be on entire agencies -ELIMINATED- because like cancer, if you don't remove it entirely it WILL come back.",
