Well what if instead of the state owning the means of production, only local governments owned them. After all, the municipalities are much more capable of focusing on their citizen's needs instead of the state, and news media wouldn't be state propaganda (though the local government can have its own propaganda) and if a citizen didn't like where he or she lived, they can just move to a different town, which could potentially incentivise the towns to innovate.( I know this is technically called municipal socialism,) But of course we all know how bad socialism is, so I want to know what the logical conclusion of this form of socialism is?",

While govt officials and their families would live like kings.\n\n\nIn some cases, the local governments may sell out the land completely to foreign investors and take all the money for themselves and move permanently to a different country which doesn't have socialism.",
