Furthermore Fauci is an immunologist, he has a background in the field which he advices in, he does not own any companies which is in conflict of interest. Obviously it would be problematic if, lets say fauci had a lot of stock option in moderna or pfizer and then adviced on that. Lets look at musk then, he actually wield political power to shut down agencies, he froze fundings to federal workers who where approved by the congress. Now maybe he musk did somethings that is beyond his power, but the power elon musk seems to wield is akin to a vice president atm.  In addition I would say its problematic that elon musk who is the individual who receives the most government spending with his monopoly in the space sector, is really not the right person to review government spending. That would be like fauci owning pfizer, and not just advising, but deciding which vaccine company for the government to use.",
