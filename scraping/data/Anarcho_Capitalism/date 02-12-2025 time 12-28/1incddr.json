Even that taxi service might be cool. Even if I don\u2019t want a self driving car, it would still reduce traffic and reduce bad drivers. So now I care about his projects. He\u2019s got my attention\n\nI suppose the difference is that I always thought he was competent. The left went from worshipping him to being convinced he\u2019s satan. The propaganda works on these people, and it works hard. \u201cForget all other programming. You now hate him. Make up your own reason.\u201d\n\nGotta admit tho, the fact that he\u2019s causally fixing the government because they are getting in the way of his dream of colonizing Mars is just insane. He\u2019s doing this so casually as his focus remains on his companies. Legend",

So, documents can be stored in the best condition and maintained. I've been to a salt mine that is still active. They also store tons of documents there. It's a very common practice. Yall are acting like this is some foreign idea.\n\nShould this be the only method of storage and extraction, no. Most of this stuff should be duplicated digitally. However going all digital will be a detrement. We have seen it in the consumer market how everything going digital has made almost everything go to shit. You really expect the government to be efficient in its use and ways of digitizing stuff and keeping all the digital files maintained. That would require all new protocols and a lot of time and money to figure out how to even go about it. The only reason this is an issue is because Elon is trying to lay off more than 10,000 people at a time.",
