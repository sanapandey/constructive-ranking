That will give Trump the power to imprison totally legal immigrants without granting them a trial. And the fact that you magats are totally ok with that really shows that you don't mind big government oppressing people as long as it's the people you don't like who are being oppressed. \n\nTrump threatened to imprison Mark Zuckerberg for life. That isn't just empty words. As the one overseeing the executive branch Trump has the power to follow through with such threats. And Zuckerberg has since bent the knee to Trump. So Trump threatening Zuckerberg with life imprisonment is really the equivalent of someone putting a gun to your head and go \"do as I say or else...\". \n\nAnd threatening to shut down TV broadcasters, when such a threat comes from the president of the United States isn't just mere words or thoughts. It's a real threat that can have chilling effects on free speech. \n\nThreats like these absolutely make Trump an authoritarian leader. But again, most of you magats don't seem to have a problem with big government oppressing people and using coercion to get their ways, as long as it's not conservatives who suffer as a result. \n\nSo at least be honest enough to admit that you absolutely love big government as long as they're oppressing the right kind of people.....",
