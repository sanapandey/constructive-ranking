Given this I am taking them to court as of today. \n\nIf anyone would like to know how this capitalist company abuses their employees and traps them into a slave type contract I will gladly share what I can as these large rental companies need to learn money isn't worth a human life!",

There are a lot of garbage companies out there, but the entire ancap idea is the ownership of your own labor.  You are in a bad situation? Find a new job that treats you better, for every awful and bad company there are another 10 great ones.  Because it turns out treating your employees and your customers well is a great way to stay in business.",

Wish I was some Amazon rainforest tribal person and no concept of money.\n\nAs much as work isn't slavery because you can quit, the fact is you need money somehow in our society, or that of pretty much anyone connected to the internet and able to read this. Usually that means you need some kind of job working for someone else, not for yourself or your family/community.",

You receive money which you apply to your life in a logical way.\n\nThere is always a system and a hierarchy. Capitalism just happens to be the best known one. It is empirically better than socialism and communism. People just think the dualist system we have now is capitalism, but it's not. In real capitalism you'd have much more money and it would be worth more, so that you could apply the excess to causes of your own choosing instead of it going arbitrarily to where the technocrats decide.\n\nCompanies work by competition. They compete for resources and must charge a relevant price. You are a resource. If you can improve your worth to companies they will bend over backwards to accommodate you.",

It's the reason we have such nice things.\n\nMaybe in the future we will be so automated that people can decide to disengage with work all together but there would have to be a cost, such as not being allowed to procreate.\n\nAnyway we hack it we are all interdependent and selfish and no arbiter will do a better job than ourselves.",
