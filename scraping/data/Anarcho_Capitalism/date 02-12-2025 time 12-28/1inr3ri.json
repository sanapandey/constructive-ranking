It's a disingenuous approach by godless people who only worship at the altar of subjugating others to get the other side to unilaterally disarm. \n\nIf I have to play the government game then I choose to elect warriors that will fight against the internal lust for power that is the essence of government over a coward that rolls over on inapplicable principles so they can grift without the media being mean to them.",

But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.  \n  \nIt is obvious that Jesus is arguing for a non-violent form of resistance. \"Kill 'em with kindness,\" if you will.  \n  \nBut it isn't a good understanding to say Jesus is advocating \"rolling over\" when people bully you.  \n  \nUsing the mile example. Roman law said that a soldier on a road had the right to demand free labor from anyone, and force a civilian to carry his bags for up to a mile. So by \"volunteering\" to walk 2 miles, what are you doing? You are making it appear as though the soldier is breaking the law. The soldier is only allowed to force you to go 1 mile, and if he says, \"but the guy *volunteered* to go two miles!\" - no one will believe him. So you are going to get that guy in trouble. And the Romans were not *kind* when disciplining their soldiers.  \n  \nAnd the cheek example: note that it said slapped on your \"right\" cheek. Then offer the other. In other words:  \n\"Ohh. You just hit me with your left hand. That's your weak hand. *Give me a real hit.*\"  \n  \nIn other words, if you understand the context of the society they lived in, most of these things Jesus is calling for is begging for the other person to break the law. This is a call for a stiff spine and just defiance. It is saying not to retaliate, yes, but it is doing so in a way that is even more damaging to your \"enemy\" than hitting back would be.  \n  \nSo yeah. I advocate turning the cheek.",

The state has unlimited funds and power to contort the evidence against you with no ramifications.
