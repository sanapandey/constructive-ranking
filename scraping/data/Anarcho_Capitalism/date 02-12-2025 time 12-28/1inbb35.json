Think: _The New Jim Crow_\n\nIt was and still is a valid critique of American society. A valuable conversation to be had. Also applies towards discrimination and injustice towards LGBT and autistic people.\n\nBut then lazy do-nothing politicians, journalists, and lawyers hijacked this valid point and usurped it into an ideological/cultural/political war in which they assert moral superiority in order to claw at money and power without having to earn it (by, say, making good decisions, being trustworthy, or producing values for society).\n\nBasically the same thing that Religious Funadmentalists do (if you don't agree with our stance and \"donate\" money to our cause then you're evil), but instead of a toxic theistic ideology, it's a toxic humanistic ideology. And instead of church and state being separate, the Woke Parasites are embedded throughout the Governance and Propaganda apparatuses.\n\nThat's the difference between Woke in the original sense and the \"Woke Mind Virus\"",
