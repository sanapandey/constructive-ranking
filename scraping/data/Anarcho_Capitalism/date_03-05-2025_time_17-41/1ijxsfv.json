What beavers can and will do though is beaver stuff, like building dams that alter water flows and all of the surrounding habitat.  This will of course change the wild game in the area and make areas potentially inaccessible for hunting.\n\nBeavers are also rodents, and if left unchecked, will reproduce as most rodents do.\n\nThis is basically the short version of it.  Beavers do beaver stuff and then people get big mad.",
