If you search Politico you will see two options for Politico LLC. It will auto select both of them because they have two LLCs associated and the system recognizes that it is the same company.\n\nYou can see each pay contract, what it was for, what specific government branch it came from etc. If you scroll down the results you can get a graph of total payments by year. That's where you see the 8.1 million for last year.\n\n3 - The payments ramped up from thousands to millions in the last 4 years. (see the graph I directed you to above.)",

That's probably ~1-2 teams per federal agency running data analysis, so I doubt that this being a grift is the best case scenario, and I reckon that the likely cause is either\n\nA. This tool is worth 8k and the grift is people saying it's government inefficiency\n\nB. This tool is massively overpriced for everyone and the government is a run by schmucks who won't switch to cheaper or more effective methods (as they are one to do.)",
