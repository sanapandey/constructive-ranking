    "selftext": "I just read something that truly boggled my mind. A 15 year old male had someone send a doctored message saying he was going to kill himself to the police, and under the 2009 mental health act they were allowed to forcefully take him from his home to a mental institution. Now this sounded horrific to me, and a few people also pointed out how horrible it was. But most people defended it, and stated how it wasn\u2019t that bad and that the act saves lives whilst downvoting people talking about it being an abuse of freedom.\n\nWhen are we going to stop them? When are we going to stand up and make our world free? \n\nI\u2019m still a young adult. So I have plenty of time ahead of me to work towards a freer world, and I have my own plans. But I\u2019m curious what all of your ideas are for helping bring this into reality? What are you doing to help",

There could still be anonymous tips, just not with such actions, maybe a little investigation first.",

Some families don't want to handle it, and a patient should be able to grant explicit permission for intervention if they want to. Common examples would be schizo disorders who do fear theu may harm themselves or other during an episode. And I mean explicit permission, a clear voluntary contract, no implied or coerced cases like seeing a mental health provider often includes. ( I personally think suicide is the most inalienable right that exists, but it should be considered in sound body and mind. )\n\nFunny quote applicable to the last part: \"Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined\" - popularized by Alan Watts.  Chew on it, implied consent..",

At the very least information given for situations like these should have to come from a vetted source. I\u2019m okay with a wellness check and even them insisting on seeing the child to ensure safety. But not brute force and certainly not taking someone away who doesn\u2019t want to.",

The 72 hour hold should be replaced with an intake on the record, ideally on site too. A cop can never be trained enough for it, so it should be a social worker role but higher degree.  72 hours is a long time to deprive somone of freedom for nothing.\n\nAnother issue with just referring to the family is the family can be the ones doing the false reporting.  Then what?",
