So we decided we had to counteract their soft power with our own by giving them tractors. Not tractor factories but tractors. They last about 10 years, which was long enough for previous subsistence farmers to have boom crops and lots more kids. Then the tractors broke down.... There was a massive famine because they were suddenly less productive again. That the problem with perverse incentives and trying to help people. Essentially the biblical adage of teaching a man to fish instead of giving him a fish.",

No, animals don't loose the ability to hunt, their skills may dull which will  make their survival more difficult when they stop getting fed, but as long as they are getting fed by humans they will stop hunting, which is what was actually said. If you give a bum money they will not loose the ability to be productive, they will just not need to be productive until the money runs out, just like we could say about any living organism.",

The fundamental fact is that poverty is simply the condition of being close to zero in terms of resources. Right now, I am closer to zero than an oil rich Saudi prince. If we were both teleported into the Sahara with no belonigs whatsoever, we would both functionally be near zero (we still have arms, legs, a brain, the last meal we ate in our body, body fat, body hair etc). However, he might have a slight *advantage* due to potential familiarity with desert survival, having grown up in an arid environment, and likely some good desert survival genetics giving him a slight leg up. Conversely, if we were placed in a forest, I would likely have the *advantage*, and he would be closer to zero because I have some basic knowledge of surviving in that setting.\n\n*advantage* is just another word for wealth.\n\nThe key point is that *wealth* is both transient *and* relative, not poverty. Poverty is always zero, and whoever is closer to zero is who you genreally feel sorry for. Poor people in America have it much better than poor people in Tuvalu, etc. Under the right conditions, I could be \"richer\" than a Saudi prince, because wealth is ultimately contextual and based on subjective value systems. Fundamentally however, in a survival scenario, value it is determined by how useful those assets are for survival. In an environment where immediate survival isn't a priorty, then value becomes a bit more subjective. But fundamentally it is tied to utility in sustaining life. At birth, we all start with nothing, and we all leave with nothing. Wealth is merely the measure of how far one moves away from anbd towards zero in the interim.\n\nSo providing someone with a fixed, reliable income (whether money or necessities) creates dependency. It's the classic proverb  \"Give a man a fish, and he eats for a day; teach a man to fish, and he eats for a lifetime.\" When survival becomes too easy, effort diminishes. It's like a pet python that spends its entire life in a cage, doing nothing. Why would it exert itself when its needs are automatically met? Its instinct is to minimize waste, and when a major source of energy expenditure (the search for food) is removed, so is the incentive for action.",

Even in a no human world, there IS another type of 'state or private enterprise' stopping the rabbit from freely and safely eating all the greens it wants, and that is its natural predators. The hawk, the fox, the cat, the snake, pretty much anything that hunts small animals. This is WHY the animal is quick to take a human handout, and become dependent on us, instead of being 'free' in nature. I see the state and private enterprise in our world as human 'predators'. Yes, I can't live in a random field I don't own, but that is not a force of nature, but because modern predators stop me. This is basically the same as if I were in an ancient tribe of hunter gatherers, and the alpha male wasn't letting me have any mates. If I'm not strong enough to become the alpha male, then its no poon tang for me, just as surely as a State one or zero child policy ! I find this a poor argument for welfare being different from feeding the animals because the mechanism is exactly the same. I avoid my world's predators by getting in the public housing cage and taking the handout, the mechanism and the result are very similar between the rabbit and the human, even if the human might be more self-aware of what is happening. Rather than handouts, I would prefer if there were some open land people could freely build on, if they have no other options. Lets say a version of free WiFi for land, LandFi. Maybe taken from government land, which I consider an obscenity that the state owns ANY land it doesn't use, because reasons (probably the reason is stealing it from Native Americans). Its not a perfect solution, but its better in my opinion, than creating a bunch of fully able bodied, but now dependent humans.",
