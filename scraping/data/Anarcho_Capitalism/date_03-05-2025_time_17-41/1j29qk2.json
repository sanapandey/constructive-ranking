If this medication can help a certain set but harm a different set, the consumer has to be privy to that information. And if weed and sunshine and being off social media would actually help most rather than medication, let that be the help for people rather than just feeding corporate machines.",

I'm just claiming that physicians are trained to evaluate evidence and are skeptical towards pharmaceutical industry as well.  Generic SSRIs and cheap medications like lithium are used when indicated.)",

So, the question is, is there any data on this?  I could beleive that out of all the pysicians on the planet, one is being duped and over prescribing.  \n\nIs that unreasonable?  If not, at what point it is?  2?  10?  Percentages?  10% 20%?   I don't know.  It's just made up numbers.\n\n>For what it's worth, I've never seen a physician be anything but skeptical of pharmaceutical or device reps. \n\nThis is the concern.  That they think they can apply this skepticism and not get duped because their opponents are not that clever.  Its like the magic trick.  You stare at the cup and when its lifted, you can't figure out the trick.  You know there is one, but you are not a magician.

That its easy to fool skeptics.  Sometimes easier.  I don't know if he talks about it below, but it was always a cautionary tale he wanted to get across.  That IQ is not a shield against skilled tricksters.\n\nJames Randi: Scientists Fooled by a Match Box Trick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbwWL5ezA4g",

For some people they get extreme side effects right from the beginning though, and I have to wonder how many studies throw those completely out since they can't complete the whole study term on the drug.\n\nEither way, pills should be the last result, not the first line of defense how they are being used. Yes, it's a lot harder to go through CBT/DBT, adjust diet and exercise, but it's a lot more effective without side effects. Quick solutions are almost never the best ones.\n\nThe way the state protects these major drug companies sickens me. FDA has all the data from studies where the drugs failed to do what they claimed and/or had too serious of side effects, and they just let them submit new studies for the exact same drugs. \"Just keep making new testing parameters till you win\" seems the opposite of science, let alone protection for consumers. But you say one thing to the average statist and they tell you \"trust the science\" and make you out to be a crazy conspiracy theorist.",

The SOCRATES and PRISM studies are both meta-analyses demonstrating long-term efficacy compared to placebo, as is the meta-analysis in *The Lancet* from 2018 with Cipriani et al.  All show that they're generally well-tolerated in the long term. Meta-analyses incorporate randomized controlled trials and are considered the best type of evidence we have.  The NESDA study is a 10+ year longitudinal cohort study demonstrating that they're generally well-tolerated without major long-term safety risks.",

When a company is selling a product, they are HIGHLY motivated to put that product in a good light, if they get sued later, the losses are too small to really dent the profits they already made.  \n\nFor the NESDA study, I'm not finding much on how that study might support SSRI use, so far one analysis by those with heavy conflict of interest (paid by big pharma) concluded that peopel taking SSRIs in the study mostly conformed to the current accepted standards for prescription of SSRIs, but nothing on quality of outcome.  Plus study participants were probably well vetted just to be in the study anyway, they were likely not the general population, can you show me where NESDA supports SSRI use?  \n\nFor the Cipriani study, the standardised mean difference for the difference in rating scale scores was 0.3, which suggests that while SSRIs may show a statistically significant difference from placebo, the clinical relevance of this difference is questionable. IE the benefit found was tiny and unlikely to make much clinical difference.

They also included unpublished works which is questionable behavior.  \n\nThose are the 1st two of yours I dug into and so far, the data is still minimal IMO, can you provide an actually really good study or two that directly supports your argument?  I'm actually open to seeing real data, I have no pony in the race ,but so far I've just not seen any such data, when I dig I find a lot of subterfuge and vague not to the point arguments instead.

Regarding the Cipriani study, although industry-funded studies were included and that's a relevant bias to consider, that doesn't necessarily just invalidate all studies funded by them.  The conductors of the meta-analysis were not industry funded, used independent studies too, and used statistical adjustments to correct for such bias.\n\nA 0.3 SMD is modest, but with that level of statistical power, still statistically significant.  Regarding clinical significance, psychiatrists aren't just recommending an SSRI alone for depression or anxiety, but recommending lifestyle changes and therapy as well.  They don't claim it's a slam dunk cure, just that it's been demonstrated to be helpful and better tolerated than older antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants.  Of note, the SMD was larger than 0.3 for the subset of patients with severe major depressive disorder.\n\nThe NESDA study (mixed independent and industry-funded), is a longitudinal cohort study and therefore much more limited.  It is aimed at showing more long term tolerance rather than efficacy.  It showed that they were generally well-tolerated but suggested some side effects to consider.  This is consistent with how they're prescribed and used, being selectively chosen based on each patient, titrated, changed, and discontinued if necessary.",

Psychiatrists push these out like candy, I suspect because they get kickbacks. There's no other reason. The amount of kids who get diagnosed with ADHD and force fed Ritalin or some other drug for it is astronomical, and most times the kid was just being a kid. They didn't sit still at a convenient time for their teacher at 10 years old or younger. Taking those sorts of drugs, especially religiously, as a young kid is going to fuck you up and put you on a pipeline of trusting pharmacology to solve everything. When things don't feel right as a teen/young adult, which I'm sure all the strong meds as a kid didn't help with, why wouldn't they first consult a doctor or therapist who can refer them to a psychologist? Natural remedies or hard work to improve the situation have never even been suggested to them in a serious way. It's \"anti science\".",
