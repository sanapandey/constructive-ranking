    "selftext": "Creating a free-market anarchist society involves establishing a system where voluntary, non-governmental entities provide services typically managed by governments. Throughout history, various instances demonstrate non-governmental provision of such services, offering insights into how modern technology can facilitate the development of anarchist societies in new countries or private cities.\n\nHistorical Examples of Non-Governmental Provision of Services:\n\n1. Lighthouses in 19th Century England: Traditionally considered public goods, some lighthouses in England were privately funded and operated. Private operators charged fees to ships for their services, demonstrating that even critical infrastructure can be managed without direct government intervention. \n\n\n2. Mutual Aid Societies: In the United States, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, mutual aid societies provided services such as healthcare, education, and financial support. These organizations were formed by communities to support their members without relying on government assistance. \n\n\n3. Contract Cities: Lakewood, California, incorporated in 1954, pioneered the \"contract city\" model by outsourcing municipal services to private entities. This approach allowed the city to function with minimal direct government involvement, relying instead on private contractors for services like policing and infrastructure maintenance. \n\n\n\nApplying Modern Technology to Establish Anarchist Societies:\n\nAdvancements in technology can facilitate the creation of societies where non-governmental entities provide essential services:\n\n1. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): Blockchain technology enables the formation of DAOs, which operate through smart contracts and decentralized decision-making processes. These organizations can manage resources, enforce rules, and provide services without centralized authority, aligning with anarchist principles. \n\n\n2. Commons-Based Peer Production: The development of open-source software and collaborative platforms exemplifies how communities can collectively produce goods and services. This model reduces reliance on centralized institutions and encourages voluntary participation. \n\n\n3. Mutual Aid Networks: Leveraging digital communication tools, communities can organize mutual aid networks to provide support during crises. These networks facilitate resource sharing and collective problem-solving without government intervention. \n\n\n4. Parallel Polis: Inspired by the concept of \"Parallel Polis,\" individuals can create alternative social structures that operate independently of the state. Utilizing technology, these parallel institutions can offer services such as education, security, and dispute resolution. \n\n\n\nImplementing Anarchist Principles in New Societies:\n\nTo establish a free-market anarchist society in a new country or private city, consider the following steps:\n\n1. Legal Framework: Develop a legal structure that recognizes and protects voluntary associations and contracts between individuals and organizations.\n\n\n2. Infrastructure Development: Encourage private investment in infrastructure projects, such as transportation and utilities, through public-private partnerships or entirely private ventures.\n\n\n3. Security Services: Promote the formation of private security firms or community-based policing initiatives to maintain safety and order.\n\n\n4. Dispute Resolution: Establish private arbitration and mediation services to handle conflicts, reducing the need for a centralized judicial system.\n\n\n5. Social Services: Foster the growth of mutual aid societies and non-profit organizations to provide healthcare, education, and welfare services.\n\n\n\nBy drawing on historical precedents and leveraging modern technology, it is possible to create a society where non-governmental entities effectively provide services typically managed by governments, aligning with free-market anarchist principles.\n\n",

            "body": "I hate chatgpt, it's always presenting self defeating arguments for whatever topic it's meant to support. For example....\n\nLighthouses in 19th century Britain were not entirely free from governmental involvement, and still relied on the state.\n\n>In Britain, lighthouses were privately owned, and the right to collect dues was by warrant, either from a local authority or the crown. The abuse of these licenses led to foreign ships fearing to seek refuge on the south coast of England for fear of being boarded with demands and to the loss of a number of ships, most notably the Dutch merchant ship Vreede in 1802 with the loss of 380 lives.\n\nThe city of Lakewood contracts their services out to the county of Los Angeles, so that still relies on government services. \n\nI don't see how chatgpt helped the idea for an anarchist society, this seems counter productive. Sometimes I wonder if it's intentional.",
