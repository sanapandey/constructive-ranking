            "body": "That\u2019s generally how traceability works. There could be other parts and records that tell you where the money are sent and to whom. You are not sending money just nowhere. \n\nA good analogy is - the barcode of the product sold is not on the receipt when you go to Target. You see on the receipt that it says \u201cwater 1l\u201d you don\u2019t see \u201c wafer 1l 7644837459\u201d. So you don\u2019t know, which bottle exactly is sold in this transaction but you know that 1l was sold. Would adding the barcode increase traceability-probably. Is anyone doing it - no because it is not needed. But then you make an audit on the Target store and you say - we know 19923l of water we\u2019re sold in 2024 but we don\u2019t know which waters exactly. Which overall might improve the process, but it does not mean that the previous Target management was not tracking water bottles sold.\n\nNote that they also say - it was optional for these records. Which means it was optional on a db level. Which is now dbs works. And then they say - often left blank, but they never say how often. It might be left blank for 1%of the records for a total of 4T or it might be left blank for 70% of the records for a total of 1B. So it is required in some parts of the system for larger expenses and left optional for expenses that are still not available in another db or have a different number in a different db and the records are connected through a different number. This is generally how db administration work when you have system build over the decades and you try to maintain compatibility between them.m\n\nFor example there is a system that provides TGA number and you fill TGA numbers. Then a new db is build in a different part of the government that has TSA numbers so you start maintaining tsa numbers. All the previous records that had TGA numbers will have their TSA numbers blank and optional. So you make an audit and you are \u201c there are millions of records that have TSA optional and blank\u201d which is true but you are not making it clear why and notice how you leave it to the reader to conclude that they are blank because\u2026\n\nHope this is helpful based on my few decades in running companies and products that are using databases.",

It might be for 95% of the records for a total of 100m or for 95%of the records for a total of 3T. What we know for sure is that their are not equally distributed items on average. \n\nNotice how the post does not talk of how much of the budget is without a category. It never says a budget of 3.9T is not appropriate categorized or 50m. It was 2s for them to extract the right information but they were malicious or incompetent enough to extract it in a way that it does not say much and leaves it up to you to decide.\n\nThis is also a DB. The post implies that there is fraud committed but you don\u2019t commit fraud on a db level, because dbs are transparent and they keep records., they are backups. You always have some demoralization in a DB. For example there is no mandatory TAS column in this table, but there are other tables and other columns like which department got how much so if you know how to join tables you will have 99% of the answers. And if you still don\u2019t have all the answers there is a contract on its way based on how much money you are willing to spend to get these answers. Making a column mandatory might improve transparency but usually it does not, because there is a reason why this column is not mandatory. So what ends up happening is that you make it mandatory and people fill it will value \u201cothers\u201d. \n\nI get what they are trying to do - make people believe that there is a problem and a person you can blame, in this case the government employee, and that they have an easy solution that only they could implement - we make a db column mandatory. And the reason why we know they are not trying to improve anything or increase transparency is because if they did they would show what other fields are in the db, what is the scheme of the db and the column on the tables and will try to measure the impact of this DB improvements. The other posts they are making are making even less sense. Did you read the one about the social security and the 220 years old people?",

He even said openly \"I'm not going to be right about everything\", but then continues to not retract, correct, or clarify when he's fucked up. Any admission that letting go the guys that manage our nuclear weapons because \"Energy Department\" cuts sounded sexy, but you didn't realize it included some actually important fucking functions? They don't care. They want people bought in, confident, so if they say they need to take total control to \"weed it out\", suspend the judicial powers, people will buy in.\n\nAin't a goddamed human being in the world that I think should have that kind of power, even the ones I feel most fit to handle that, and none of them have any interest in any kind of seat of power.",
