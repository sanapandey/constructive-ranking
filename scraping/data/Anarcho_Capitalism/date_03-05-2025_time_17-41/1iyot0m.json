I had actually forgotten about that fun fact.\n\nWe see Selena crying over illegals being deported but she wasn't outraged when Obama deported 5million illegals and put children in cages.\n\nAnd also during Obamas presidency he had dropped the most bombs on various third world countries like Syria (Trump took the lead during his first term) and yet we gave him a Nobel peace prize?! \n\nIt's funny how every president does the same shit regardless of the aisle its on, yet people are so married to their parties, they only find a problem with it when the other guy does it.\n\nEverything is gay and retarded!",

Without vigilant, bottom-up pressure from the public, Trump could easily be worse on some issues than Harris would have been.",

In addition there were concerns that Zelensky was actually pro-Russian.  He even offered to strike a deal with Russia and allow the regions to have their own elections and respect the outcomes.",

But are somehow inept at managing and suppressing insurgency in Iraq and Taliban in Afghan that we were knee deep in fighting in those exact same years. Or in the inability to get the Ukr leadership to take the Ru invasion seriously leading up to 2022.\n\n\nAnd to manage Ukr so well right under the noses of the neighboring Russians who speak similar language, share some culture, and have been deeply infiltrated in Ukr leadership since Lenin's conqueroring and genocide. To convince the mass of Ukrainians to leave Russian thumb of oppression and enforce the Constitutional amendment to gain EU membership (the point of the protests) that was passed years earlier. And to achieve this management across multiple presidential and parlement elections. What a super level psyop to manipulate all of this!\n\n\nIts fascinating the cognitive dissonance of CIA and govt in general being super competent and imbeciles at the same time depending on the needs of the narrative.",

His commitment to engaging with global adversaries through conversation rather than isolation resonated with the Committee.\n\n2. **Nuclear Disarmament**: He advocated for a world free of nuclear weapons, including efforts to renew arms reduction negotiations with Russia and strengthen non-proliferation treaties.\n\n3. **Outreach to the Muslim World**: His June 2009 Cairo speech sought to mend U.S. relations with Muslim-majority countries, promoting mutual understanding and partnership.\n\n4. **Climate Change Advocacy**: Though early in his presidency, Obama signaled a commitment to addressing climate change as a global priority, aligning with the Committee\u2019s broader peace and security concerns.\n\n5. **Symbolic Encouragement**: The Committee explicitly stated the award aimed to bolster his initiatives, acknowledging the challenges ahead. They viewed it as an endorsement of his potential to foster peace, rather than a reward for past accomplishments.\n\nYes, it was premature.  \n\nObama and Trump are not exactly the same.",
