They want to implement mandatory medical treatments until it's their bodies being subject to the state. It's a clinging to the status quo, a mindset where big daddy government is the one that solves problems and gives you permission to do things.\n\n True freedom, and the risks and pitfalls it carries with it, scares the shit out of most people, and i believe in part this is an inherited mindset passed down by survivors of the depression and their children. The risk of starvation back then was very real, and the government was seen by many as the great savior after the depression and WW2. Undoubtedly government and non state actors have capitalized on this through various mass influence campaigns and public education to make the perfect statist middle class we know and love today.\n\nThe good news is that it seems like a segment of society is beginning to slowly wake up, especially in the last 3-5 years. You gotta be patient, but things always gravitate to AnCapism on a long enough timeline- it's the natural entropic state of things in balance and we will return to it eventually.",
