    "selftext": "I have this thinking game of trying to put myself in different social status and think about stuff differently. Then it strikes me that for the people who operate the country, not the government, but the people that owns the government, taxation (especialy the income tax) is really just a refund to them. The government put those money in the their bailout, helping them destabilize foreign government so we can move our capital in the make more money, purchasing our own weapons to send to others for wars. The average people are the real theft who takes money away from their profits. \n\nSo I got curious of how tax works in self-claimed \"capitalism\", \"socialism\" and \"communism\". Compared to communist China, where most workers pay no income tax to 3% (mostly because workers don't make high enough to be taxed in higher bracket) and pays no property tax, the US has a extremely high income tax (or should I called refund to the wage provider), not to mention the European.
