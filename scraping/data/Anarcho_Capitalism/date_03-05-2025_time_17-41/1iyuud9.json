Napolitano is probably more worried about whether decentralization or constitutional limits work better and not whether the state should be torn down.  I mean, he still uses the Judge Honorific as a means of legitimacy or appeal to authority within a system he critiques.  He likes the prestige that comes with \"Judge.\"",

Why would anyone go around doctoring such a thing?\n\nGiven the minimal effort you put into the submission, your overall level of animosity and condescension, you seem like just the type to doctor something like that.  \n\nIt's probably not fair to Mises to associate you and your behavior with them even though your posting their content.  \n\nOverall it highlights an interesting issue.  Trying to mix a statist like Napolitano with Mises and having a angry fur ball like you spreading the message, I wonder overall how much the message was served.",
