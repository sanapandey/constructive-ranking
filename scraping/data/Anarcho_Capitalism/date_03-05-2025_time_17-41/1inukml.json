If people continue to equate Trump with Libertarianism it will hurt the image for years to come, it\u2019s not a good look. He\u2019s done some good, but I don\u2019t see the tax cuts happening, which is the really big thing that most people could get on board with.",

And by \"social\", I don't mean going around spouting ideology at people, I mean working to create decentralized institutions capable of doing the things that people currently turn to the state for.\n\nFocusing on the political side of things, and working to cut programs people are dependent upon before we've developed non-political alternatives, will just turn people against us, make enemies out of people who should rightly be on our side, and create an authoritarian backlash.\n\nMaslow's pyramid is real.  If people are relying on the state in order to eat -- even if they acknowledge that their dependence diminishes their autonomy -- threatening to cut those programs will still turn them into tooth-and-nall defenders of the state, because hungry people will pick food over liberty.

Tariffs are taxes levied against your own citizens when they make purchases from overseas.  The government of Argentina disappearing wouldn't make all of the businesses in Argentina disappear, and Trump could still attempt to tax Americans for buying their products.",

If it didn't work, well all he lost was one plane trip and a few days of schmoozing.  Milei is not going to win every battle, but hopefully he will still win the war.  This tariff thing might also push Argentina more towards Brics again, it will be interesting to see how this pans out. One thing about the last 4 years is that the USA has pushed a lot of foreign allies too far and they are distancing themselves and Trump seems to be just making it worse.",

Ours will possibly be some of the highest in the world now that Trump is further raising them.  Many of the countries with very high tariffs are in Africa.   \n\nTrump's main complaint has been the trade deficit which has nothing to do with tariffs.  It's when we import more than we export. But a lot of that is because our country is wealthy and buys and consumes a lot.  And also because our country is wealthy, our dollar is strong and that means goods from other countries are cheap when buying with the dollar.  If those other countries were also wealthy, there'd be no more savings and we'd probably not import nearly as much.  \n\nAlso the importing country business pays all tariffs so it just hurts American businesses. Now I have to pay tariffs to import my agate stones. Biden already cranked up tariffs to Brazil where I buy a lot so it's not like I can just buy from another country instead.  All the countries are tariffed highly and I, the american business, pays all of them.  The other country is indirectly hurt due to me buying less due to me having to raise prices and selling less.",
