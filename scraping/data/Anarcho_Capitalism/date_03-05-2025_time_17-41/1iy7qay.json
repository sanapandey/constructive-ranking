I'd say de-coupling the dollar from the gold standard is a form of de-regulation. And in the 1950s and 1960s taxes in the US used to be extremely high actually. After the 1970s there were massive tax cuts, much more global free trade agreements were negotiated, and there's been a ton of banking de-regulation, weaking of union rights, antitrust laws etc. etc. \n\nChina has obviously benefited from adopting more free market principles since they were a hardcore communist country, which is also pretty bad. But in the US the seperation of productivity and wages happened largely because of the neoliberal policies and de-regulation that happened under Reagan and the Presidents after him.",
