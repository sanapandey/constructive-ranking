The point is not having to look over your shoulder while doing them.\n\nI despise when, for example, you bring up police misconduct or how they abuse they powers and people respond that if you're nice, don't make problems and fly under the radar, they'll let you pass. It's not about getting a pass. It's about not having to have one.",

Plus everyone who can probably already works outside the law, and things are just getting worse.\n\nI recently openly refused to participate in state census for example. 2 different censors came, and 2 times I talked with them and explained to them it shouldn't be the case that I'm forced by law under threat of a fine to answer a survey. I believe people should do that kind of thing more often, tell them what they're doing is an agression, that it's not okay, instead of lying and hiding and cheating the system to pay less taxes but never saying anything.",
