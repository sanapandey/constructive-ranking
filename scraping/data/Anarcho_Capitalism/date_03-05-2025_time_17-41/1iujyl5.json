It\u2019s splitting hairs but the USDS still exists separately from DOGE so I would call it a new office, or at the very least a new office within an existing office.\n\nRegardless tho, it would be amazing if Elon or Trump followed through on actually shuttering departments and shrunk government spending but I don\u2019t have much faith that they\u2019re going to do anything other than shuffle around how we spend our money, generate much more debt and skyrocket inflation even more. Hopefully I\u2019m wrong tho.",

Normally independent agencies in the executive are at arms length from the president to avoid corruption and appearance of impropriety.\n\nFBI spied on Trump as a part of a legal investigation that wasn't started for purely political reasons, something people apparently cannot comprehend, I guess if you worship the guy it's difficult to accept he's a criminal, idk. \n\nMass firing and then staffing the DOJ and FBI with loyalists isn't normal whatsoever. Especially when you put a literal Qanon nutjob as FBI director, someone who is plainly not qualified. Same for 2nd in command, dude has never even held a leadership position and is a known MAGA podcaster and *has called for a violent crusade in America,* which is extremist behavior that should be nowhere near the government.\n\nIt's quite clear the intent of putting people like this in control of our internal federal police is so that they will obey any order no matter how unlawful. Since last time Comey, who swung the election against Hillary by reopenning the emails investigation yet hide the russia investigation from public eyes, was apparently not enough of a scyhophant for Trump's taste last admin.\n\nHe's actively politicizing the internal police. And no, they were not politized before, it just so happens Trump commits, flagrantly a lot of crimes. Like attempting to steal an election with a fake elector plot. Or intentionally keeping top secret documents for 6 months after the FBI has requested to send them back. Not exactly something other presidents commonly try to do.\n\nIt's incredibly how quickly MAGA accepted open corrupt abuse of power and criminality as totally acceptable for a President. I have never seen a political movement become so thoroughly morally bereft so quickly in my life.",
