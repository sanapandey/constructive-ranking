It's like the Marshall Plan.  It's difficult to say exactly how it benefitted us financially, but it was a massive benefit against the Soviets and opening up new markets for US products.\n\nThe Belt and Road initiative will replace it (and likely be better in the long run for a number of countries).",

I've definitely seen that present in other areas of life though where you have these people who everything they know is either out of a book or from theoretic discussion without any of it being put to the test in real applications. These types should not be looked to with respect or to learn from. I think they have a place in society, often coming up with innovative ideas, being thinkers, but their ideas need run through the filter of practical use before they are given any weight or trusted. Some ideas that sound great end up being a dumpster fire when put to the test.",

You're radicalized and emotional enough that you're trolling subreddits of people you dislike just to get in internet fights, it's not like I'm gonna write you a 300 word political post that will abruptly change your perspective. We both know that you closed the door to a productive political dialog immediately with your hostility and racism, it was a deliberate choice you made.\n\nThe best thing I can do for you is, again, to encourage you to disconnect from it all for a while. This clearly isn't good for your wellbeing. You might find when you come back that you're actually an effective communicator when your mind isn't clouded by real-life frustrations you aren't dealing with, and you've achieved the distance necessary from a silly forum to not become immediately emotional.",
