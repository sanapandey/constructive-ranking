And I don\u2019t know anybody that\u2019s denying that on the right or the left. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know anybody that doesn\u2019t think we should do things to prevent waste. Suggesting otherwise it\u2019s just another talking point from politicians to their more gullible constituents, as opposed to actually fixing things.  I mean if you can trick you\u2019ve constituents to think it\u2019s the other party, then you don\u2019t have to fix it.\n\nOften claiming there\u2019s waste is a trick to actually promote corruption. Good example, we heard the right talk about 1200 pages of regulations for cabbage and they were going to fix it! What they did was get rid of the regulations for polluting water and Air saving their donor\u2019s money and never did anything about the cabbage regulations.  \n\nWhen a company decides to cut they spend some time planning they don\u2019t decide Monday morning to walk down the hallways and randomly fire people. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on today. They accidentally fired nuclear fuel safety people and they were in such a hurry to delete them from the system, they had a hard time finding them to bring them back. That is stupidity and incompetence. I guarantee you we\u2019re not hearing but the tip of the iceberg of incompetence. \n\nWhen they claimed that all these thousands of people were 150 years old receiving Social Security, they were too ignorant to understand how the program worked and that when data was missing it defaulted to year 1855. There\u2019s no 150-year-olds receiving Social Security benefits, more incompetence and by the way, incompetence? Is waste! \n\nWe\u2019re a huge country with a huge infrastructure and a government to run it, it takes a lot of effort to change direction you\u2019re not going to find out you change direction toward an iceberg or you started a tsunami right away and I might hope that a lot of MAGA are on the ocean when the tsunami hits, but it\u2019s going to get everybody not just a fools that put the incompetent people in power.",

Is there any character left on the right anymore or are you all just Trump or musk sycophant or Christian nationalist, not loyal to America? \n\nInspector Generals (IGs) have uncovered and reported on many issues in government agencies, including fraud, waste, and abuse. \nExamples of IG findings: \nFBI: Misuse of national security letters\nDepartment of the Interior: Corruption related to lobbyist Jack Abramoff\nHealth care: Widespread fraud\nHHS: Fraud, waste, and conflicts of interest in grants and contracts\nMedicare and Medicaid: False claims, kickbacks, and medical identity theft\nNursing homes: Abuse and neglect\nDoD: Patient safety concerns, adverse health effects for trainees, and security controls\nCIA: The CIA was unable to provide the military with actionable intelligence before deploying troops in Afghanistan\nIGs also make recommendations to improve government agencies. For example, IGs have helped return billions of dollars to the U.S. Treasury. \nHow IGs operate\nIGs issue reports, including audits, investigations, and evaluations. They also issue semiannual reports to Congress. IGs may also investigate allegations of criminal activity and refer them to the Department of Justice.",

I\u2019m willing to bet that we have wasted more money putting on a show by incompetent Trump/mask sycophants than they\u2019ve actually saved. Like using military planes that cost 800 K per flight sending people back to Guatemala or the cost for security to send Trump and his friends to the Super Bowl so they could leave before halftime. Or driving a lawnmower around the racetrack like dictators like to do. Or firing an entire department deleting all their info and then scrambling to try to find contact phone numbers because it turned out what they did was important. Stressing out Air traffic controllers with threats of termination, like they don\u2019t already have a stressful job, probably leading to this rash of airplane crashes. \nLike the king has no clothes, princess, we can see you. And Trump\u2018s polls are dropping like a rock the worst the nation has ever seen\u2026 probably that quarter of a billion musk spent the last month buying Trump, spreading lies, those people are figuring out they were lied to.",
