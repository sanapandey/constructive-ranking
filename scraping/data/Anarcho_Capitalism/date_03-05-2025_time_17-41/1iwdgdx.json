But it is only ridiculous to the extent that one restricts oneself to the traditional economic definition of socialism, which states that it is an economic system where the state is the owner of the means of production.\n  \n> This definition should in my view be updated to present circumstances. Today states do not need to directly control the means of production to control every aspect of the lives of individuals. With tools such as printing money, indebtedness, subsidies, interest rate control, price controls and regulations to correct supposed \"market failures,\" they can control the destinies of millions of human beings.\n  \n> This is how we arrive at the point where, under different names or forms, a good part of the political offers generally accepted in most Western countries are collectivist variants. **Whether they declare themselves openly communist, or socialist, social democrat, Christian democrat, neo-Keynesian, progressive, populist, nationalist or globalist. In substance there are no real differences. They all hold that the State should direct all aspects of the lives of individuals. They all defend a model contrary to the one that led humanity to the most spectacular progress in its history.**",
