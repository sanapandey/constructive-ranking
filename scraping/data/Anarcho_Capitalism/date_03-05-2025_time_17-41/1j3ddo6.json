This is one of the reasons that Communists tend to have such inane talking points, because they use words like money, state, capitalism, etc., to define ideas that nobody else is using them for.\n\nYou're free to use any word to try and convey anything you like but there are superior ways to go about communicating than others.\n\nTo define government for example, don't use a dictionary. Use a logical method of breaking down an idea into its fundamental constitute parts, and then compare those parts to like-things to see if they match.\n\nFor example, what does government do? It provides services. But be careful not to define government as a system of which provides services, because companies provide services too, so if that's all you're going off of, then a government and a company are synonyms for one another.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself, what does a government have that a company simply does not? Well, in order for a government to be a government and not a company, it needs attributes of which set it clearly apart. One such attribute would be that it is a force monopoly, but that's not good enough either because there are many governments in the world, so all of them can't ONLY be a force monopoly, since monopoly in this case would mean to have ALL of the force, which is simply untrue.\n\nTo be more precise, a government is a relative force monopoly. Since it can provide services like a company can, it has similarity to a company, but its ability to hold a relative force monopoly sets it apart from the idea of \"company\". So let's say that you had a society in which you had a government and you had Amazon, but one day Amazon is realized to suddenly have a greater monopoly on the use of force than the government previously did. Now, Amazon is no longer a company by the very essence of the idea itself, it has become a government and the entity that used to be a government simply no longer is.\n\nImagine cartels in a third world country where the government cannot stop the cartels because the cartels force is greater than that of the \"governments\". In those areas, the cartels are actually government and the idea that people use the word government for is actually a misnomer.\n\nYou are always free to use force to stop people from initiating actions of which violate the will of others. So if someone tries to murder, rape, enslave, destroy property, defraud, and more, you can use violence to protect yourself.",

If I want to piss on the womens toilet seat I\u2019m going to do it, if I want to sit in piss and rip some shit in the men\u2019s bathroom I\u2019m going to do it. \n\nReality is it should be practiced more that bathrooms get cleaned more regularly and that there should be more bathrooms. Reason I started going piss in the women\u2019s bathroom was because the mens constantly had the worst IBS foul smelling shit every hour on the hour. Then I learned women like to play with blood the same way shit gets on the walls. Both suck, I\u2019m going to piss where I want",
