Moving to neighboring Arab countries would represent a large improvement in situation for the vast majority of Gaza\u2019s residents. it is not an ideal solution or even a good one but it\u2019s hard to deny that if done peacefully it would be an improvement over Palestinians being trapped in little more than a refugee camp that is permanently at war with its much more powerful neighbor that regularly bombs and invades them.\n\nPeople who are actively having a genocide committed against them tend to desire to leave. I was using his frame not reality. Unless you think for the majority of Palestinians death is preferable to leaving a refugee camp.",

The PA governs the West Bank, Hamas governs Gaza. The PA would prefer to box out Hamas and be the ones negotiating, but cannot do so with limited presence and support in Gaza. In point of fact, the PA is viewed as corrupt by many in the West Bank (and in large part that charge is true). But the PA is very useful for Israel because it allows the Israeli government to outsource security in the West Bank to the PA, so Israel is unlikely to push for new leaders in the PA. \n\nThe status quo works for both Israel and the PA (and to some extend works for Hamas too). So there's this weird delicate dance where everybody knows things are unsustainable but no one wants to stop the music either. \n\nThe simple reality is the conditions Israel wants are things no Palestinian leader could ever agree to (we're talking about concrete things like specific land tracts and borders, water rights, and arable land, etc.), and the things they are willing to give up, Israel already has or has a close enough approximate that giving anything else to obtain it is only marginally beneficial. There's no win-win scenario here, someone has to lose. And both sides believe that if they wait long enough, it'll be the other one who will. That's why no deal gets done.",

They were forced out when a bunch of Arab countries decided to declare war on Israel to commit genocide on the Jews and asked the Gazans to make way for their tanks. Those that didn't comply and remained there, are full Israeli citizens now, and their descendants. After Israel won the war for their survival, they decided not to allow those cooperating with attempted genocide to have Israeli citizenship. Shocking decision, right?\n\nAlso let's not mix that land with the much bigger amount of land that Israel either purchased or homesteaded outright. For eg. the land under Tel Aviv is under no dispute, yet somehow leftists think it used to be Arab territory too.",
