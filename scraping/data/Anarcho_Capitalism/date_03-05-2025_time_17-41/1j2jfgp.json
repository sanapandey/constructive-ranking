That isn't suicide: it is war on behalf of a political elite.  \n  \nC) If \"Ukrainians would rather die,\" then why did Zelensky negotiate terms for an end to the war within weeks of the war starting? Why did Boris Johnson tell him to reject the peace deal? If Ukrainians want this, then why did the US spend hundreds of millions of dollars overthrowing the previous administration?
