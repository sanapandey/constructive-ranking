Most people had to toe the line in fear of various forms of reprisal.\n\nBut just like after the death of Stalin, or the collapse of the USSR, people were finally able to say what they really thought about the old leader or the old order.\n\nAnd suddenly everyone realized that everyone else didn't like any of shit going on either.",

The \"moderate\" Dems and neocon GOP basically told them -- stay in line on Covid, on Internet censorship -- or we'll let the left destroy your companies.\n\nMusk was the only one with the courage (or the autism) to stand up and defy those people while they were still in power. But that doesn't mean this isn't still significant. This is a huge morale blow to the left.\n\nClip in question: https://x.com/MikeBenzCyber/status/1877850144667779583 (He's talking about Zuck here in reference to Zuck's memo about reducing censorship on Facebook, but I think a lot of it applies to Bezos as well).",

There is a big difference between some Youtubers and leaders of very large companies that rely on direct consumer spending. Was he concerned for the well being of Amazon and his personal wealth?
