Hers has announced closure due to federal funding freezing on Medicare in Arkansas. His is at risk.  They also have a child with Down Syndrome and the facility where their child receives his therapies have warned that they will likely be closing due to federal funding loss. \n\nI am trying to understand the anarcho-capitalist perspective on how these scenarios would pan out ideally. What are your thoughts? \n\nAlso note: if there is a better forum to ask this question, please let me know! TIA",

I didn't make the kid with down syndrome and those people in the senior center why are their families not taking care of them? There is the issue, we off loaded the responsibility of taking care of individual responsibilities onto the government and then the government takes other people's money using force to pay for it. \n\nExplain to me how that is fair.",

The resulting \u2018GovCorp\u2019 - a society run as a business - can then be regulated not via the \u2018voice\u2019 of its citizenry - there will be no democracy - but via their ability to \u2018exit\u2019 as consumers in a free market for governance. \n\n>\n>The corporate structures of GovCorps are to be embedded within Yarvin\u2019s Patchwork model, which envisions the world divided into small, autonomous territories or \u2018patches,\u2019 each governed independently as a quasi-sovereign city-state. Under this system, each patch operates as a self-contained entity with its own policies, laws and societal norms. Governance within each patch is offered as a service, with citizens acting more as customers than as members of a community. Yarvin argues that this model creates a form of competition among patches, where territories vie to attract residents by providing desirable policies or services. Rather than engaging in the democratic process to influence governance, individuals express their preferences through a consumer-like choice: they can \u2018exit\u2019 a patch if they disagree with its policies and seek a more compatible governance model elsewhere. This transactional approach to governance reduces the citizen-government relationship to one of mere loyalty, devoid of democratic accountability. In Yarvin's view, democracy is supplanted by a form of corporate-style authoritarianism that diminishes the role of public participation.\n\n>\n>Peter Thiel\u2019s backing of J.D.
