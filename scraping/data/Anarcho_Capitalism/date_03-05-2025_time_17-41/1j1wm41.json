You mean to tell me someone who is AG had the files for a week, made fucking binders and didnt realize that wasn't all the data? The fucking binders said PHASE 1 on them so she at least knew there was more data right?\n\nAlso, the binders said right on them \"The most transparent administration in history\"\n\nWhen the government is printing you a binder of blacked out bullshit from 8 years ago that's calling itself the most transparent government in history and is only releasing it through curated right wing grifters... that's a HUGE FUCKING RED FLAG.\n\nWhat a disgrace. Anyone who believed these people are fucking idiots.",
