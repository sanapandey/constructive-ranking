The part that says \u201call men are created equal\u201d?\n\nYes, it is an original christian idea that all men are created in the image of God equal. The idea that the state should step in to force this equality is a dystopian perversion of that true principle and is called communism.\n\n>She asks for compassion in every single one of your quotes.\n\nNo she didn't. That's just a straight up lie. She asked for egalitarianism and \"diversity\" she asked for \"unification\" but only under leftist principles. She asked us to deny reality to appease the emotional tantrums of trans activists who have worked themselves into the schizophrenic belief that their lives are at risk.\n\nBut you are fundamentally a liar, so you aren't willing to actually read her words.\n\nI have no problem with having compassion on the people who have butchered themselves because they were caught up in the evil sophistry of the trans cult. Compassion doesn't mean giving in to everything they ask. In fact, doing that is the opposite of compassion. It's more like indifference towards their own self destruction.",
