It was written by the Sumerian king Ur-Nammu \\(r. 2047-2030 BCE\\) or his son Shulgi of Ur \\(r. 2029-1982 BCE\\) centuries before the famous Code of Hammurabi was inscribed by the Babylonian king Hammurabi \\(r. 1795-1750 BCE\\).](https://www.worldhistory.org/Code_of_Ur-Nammu/)\n\n>Presenting himself as the father of his people, Ur-Nammu encouraged his subjects to think of themselves as one family and of his laws as the rules of a home. Punishments, except for capital offenses, took the form of fines in the same way a child might be deprived of a favorite pastime or toy for misbehaving. Ur-Nammu issued the code with the understanding that his people knew how to treat each other with respect and a fine for lapses would serve as a reminder.",

            "body": "We're a social species. Other primates and our common ancestors formed small bands that had a stable power structure: big guy with a harem, matriarch sorts out disputes, males banished to start their own bands. \n\nEarly hominids weren't too different. Due to long gestation periods and the fact that prey couldn't be effectively preserved, it became custom to share kills. The food would just go to waste anyway and there were members of the group that could not hunt and had to be cared for, so it made sense to continue to be social.\n\nAs extended families grew they became tribes and conglomerations of tribes would become chiefdoms. They were generally patrimonial and women would be swapped between tribes, formally becoming members of the new one.\n\nInside these organizations, the big man had power and you could call the government. When tribes met or crossed paths (they were nomadic) customs dictated various rituals like sharing meals or giving the right of way. You could call that government, too. \n\nThen agriculture kicked in and wealth became more immovable. It wouldn't do to constantly be fighting over the generator of wealth so everyone had to figure out a common set of rules for property and living together. That need gave rise to various things that are all effectively government in one form or another. \n\nIn animals it makes the most sense to favor and horde resources for one's kin in order of proximity. In humans this manifests as patrimonialism. However, social beings have to be able to know whether someone outside of their kin (or their kin themselves) will treat them fairly. From this arose the need to model the mind of someone else and may have led to our intelligence and need to communicate.\n\nWhen governments become large there is a tendency for patrimonialism to cause corruption. People want their kids to have as much as possible and care about others less, meaning those in power will make decisions that won't be good for society as a whole. Successful societies have driven out this tendency through various means.\n\nThe Chinese used an examination system to create a civil service based on merit rather than family connections. Europe, thanks to the Catholic Church giving women the right to inherit, broke the tribal structures in place at the time and crippled patrimonialism, allowing it to succeed. Janissaries and Mamluks did the same by making the ruling class slaves whose children could not inherit. And a whole lot of societies used eunuchs for the same purpose.\n\nI know that went long, but I just finished a book that deals with this topic: [The Origins of Political Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Political_Order). I found the beginning bits most interesting since it deals with how social systems worked and benefited us and our cousins in other species.",

This person may even hire every single employed person in said region if given enough time to build wealth and acquire more businesses. It's in this persons best interests to give the people he hires certain benefits, be it healthcare, housing, the list goes on.
