This is the kind of shit that we should show as alternative to public healthcare arguments.\n\n Literally they regulated them due to pressure from doctors lobby because prices were so cheap they had a regular salary like regular people so of course daddy government needs to regulate the free market to make them earn more and fuck everyone else.",

Fun.\n\n Universal health care (also called universal health coverage, universal coverage, or universal care) is a health care system in which all residents of a particular country or region are assured access to health care. It is generally organized around providing either all residents or only those who cannot afford on their own, with either health services or the means to acquire them, with the end goal of improving health outcomes.\n\nUniversal healthcare can be determined by three critical dimensions: who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered.[1] It is described by the World Health Organization as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship.[2] Then-Director General of the WHO Margaret Chan described universal health coverage as the \"single most powerful concept that public health has to offer\" since it unifies \"services and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way\".[3] One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health.",
