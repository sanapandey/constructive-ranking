It's a matter of selection bias; more of the ones who hated it are dead than the ones who loved it. \"There is no homosexuality in Iran.\" -- President Ahmadinejad",

What betters life quality among people is competitivity. Russia didn't become a super economically liberal country the moment the Soviet Union fell. Hell there are still sectors of their economy that they have NOT privatized yet, like telecommunication, transport, and even agricultural parts of the food market. \n\nRussia doesn't have a free Market, they have a state sponsored oligarchy. Still their current life standard is way better than during the Soviet Union, with that of famines and bread lines.",

It's also why situation in Poland, Czechia, Estonia etc. started improving quickly after 1989, while Russia went into chronic crisis. Anecdote - old Polish joke \"Soviets take coal from Poland, and in exchange Poland sends them meat!\"\n\nMid term - population was largerly financially illiterate. Modus Operandi for surviving in Soviet Block was \"as soon as you get the money, exchange it immediately for whatever goods that hold any value\". \n\nAnother anecdote from Poland - my Dad once got his salary and went to a shop. All shelves empty. He asks \"what's available?\" \"a radio and a violin.\" \"I'll take both.\" We still have the violin.\n\nWhen people got the shares of previously state-controlled businesses, they got rid of them immediately exchanging them for stuff. The future oligarchs - mostly both former and active intelligence personel - quickly sucked all of them from the market and monopolised it.\n\nLong term - the same people after they consolidated their economic influence went for political power. Yeltsin breached the rule of law for the first time after 1993 constitutional crisis, and relied heavily on a specific faction of security+oligarch trusts, and Putin was part of that faction.",
