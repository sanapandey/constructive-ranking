But they \"LOVE\" regulating their smaller competitors right out of the market. And if possible right into prison, where a tidy profit can be made off of their unpaid labour.\n\nOfcourse these regulations can be disguised as ethical imperatives. Because ultimately - who else in the depressed economies can afford to fund the research?\n\nAnother myth is that corporatism/crony capitalism is about amassing money.\n\nWhen in reality it is about power and control via the consolidation and reallocation of resources and resource potentialities. It's not at all the best way to even make money. Only the best way to disempower the already impoverished poorer people.\n\nThe link that both left & right economically minded states don't grasp is that the corporations fund the political parties. They vote with their wallets as to who & whom can even get elected in the first place. Whomever you choose Blackrock & vanguard are winning out of that not you. Their lives get easier not yours.\n\nIt's a massive case of: without gubbermenn', the bad guys would totally do what they are already doing anyway.",

I don't want to assume anything. But I think it is okay to have a positive reaction to seeing actual momentum in the correct direction.  \n  \nCould it go wrong from here? Certainly. But it could go in a good direction too. I want to celebrate the good, and speak against the bad. I think eliminating entire agencies is good. I think ending birthright citizenship is unwise (depending on how they do it). I think opening up information to the public is good. But I think creating new agencies, new powers, or weakening the rule of law would be bad.  \n  \nSo there is potential for a mixed bag. But I don't think we have enough information to say too many specifics about what's in the bag. \"Consolidation of power\" is the accusation right now, but if that just means we keep the military and several other rent seekers while eliminating half (or more) of the others, I think that would still be positive.

Limited liability can still be implemented via a complex set of reciprocal contracts, because the whole model of liability you're trying to apply here is vicarious, and you're trying to *extend* liability beyond the set of specific parties involved in the harm.  \n\nA lot of people think this way because they're conflating different concepts of \"ownership\" together: owning something in the sense of actually exercising control of its use or disposition vs. owning something in the sense of having a financial stake in an organization without actually having any control over the use of its assets.\n\nAnd if you're applying vicarious liability, then you have to figure out to whom you're going to extend that liability.  If you're using that conflated model of ownership, you'll say \"the owner\", but that party is only easily identifiable *because* of the formal structure of corporations in the first place.  \n\nSuppose we only had sole proprietorships, and no corporations.  Alice, Bob, and Charles want to start a business that they all have equal ownership of.  No corporations, too bad.  But what if they agree to pool their resources together, then name Charles as the owner of that pool of resources?  Except Charles would be bound by contracts that require him to pursue goals defined cooperatively with Alice and Bob, and to share his proceeds with them.\n\nIn that scenario, Alice and Bob are in the same de facto position as shareholders, and their liability is limited exactly as it is today, even where liability for torts against third parties is involved: because Charles is the only legal owner of the business, he's the only one a plaintiff could sue.  In fact, they might not even know Alice and Bob exist.   And Charles could *also* limit his liability, by assigning all of his *personal* assets to a third party, who might then nominally rent them all back to Charles for a penny or so -- those couldn't be touched to cover liabilities, because Charles doesn't legally own them.   \n\nSo we've just set up the \"constitutional monarchy\" version of limited liability, to match the \"republic\" version offered by a corporation: different form, same substance, except no positive law is involved.\n\n\n> Corporations fold all the time after an environmental disaster and the owners just cut their losses on those assets and move on,\n\nThe owners are not the responsible parties here.  The *managers* are the ones who are culpable in the damage, and they can and should be held responsible, whether civilly or criminally.  The \"owners\" are your grandparents' pension fund, your coworker trying his hand at online stock trading for the first time, etc.  \n\n> If shareholders held more responsibility for the actions of their companies, corporations would have higher incentives to act responsibly.\n\nIf the managers of the corporations were held better to account, we could also have higher incentives to act responsibly, without creating the insane scenario where the bank can haul away your car because you owned a single share of stock in a firm that defaulted on a loan.",
