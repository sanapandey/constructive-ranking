I'm happy because Trump is better than the democrats. I don't agree with the Republicans on pushing their Christian morals but the Demoncrats are in a whole different level of stupid. Some people are idealistic and can't understand that everything is relative.",

He might sometimes make a \"good will gesture\" that costs him nothing, like pardoning Ulbrich. I will eat my words if none of those things will happen.\n\nHe is as authentic as \"free speech absolutist\" Musk banning people for criticising certain politicians.

The latter is optimized by the opposite of this. \n\nThe overall tax rates when Europe was dominated by hereditary monarchies was 5-8%. The Arab gulf states are monarchies today and have very low tax burdens. So the reality seems to match the model.",
