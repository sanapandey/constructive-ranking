It's all public access, and it contemplates all end-point sales, be them supermarket chains, local convenience stores, etc. I'll quote a relevant extract from the report relating to your (extremely wrong) rebuttal:\n\n*\"... In the case of independent self-service stores, the year-on-year drop in December was 18.7% and 13.4% for the year. In the AMBA, a year-on-year drop of 23.9% was observed last month and 4.4% in total. Within the country, consumption fell by 15.6% and 17.6%, respectively for this segment.\"*\n\nYou're talking out of your ass.",
