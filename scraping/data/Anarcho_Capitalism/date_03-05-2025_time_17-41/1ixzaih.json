I feel like I'm finally understanding this ancap thing, but I want to hear your thoughts on my musings.\n\nMost of my close friends are liberal. Not extremely, but enough to where they are very dissatisfied with Donnie T.\n\nOne of em, a former Eagle Scout, started sending me videos (emotional instagram reels) after cuts were made to the National Parks. He started going on about how it's all over and now Yosemites going to be strip mined and turned into hotels and insinuated I don't like nature because I voted for DT.\n\nI told him I don't necessarily think the feds should be involved National Parks and told him that they could still be made state parks if you are so inclined. Also, I don't know, maybe if we ended our forever wars and foreign aid spending we'd have a little extra to spend on the National Parks. He sadly was not receptive to this and hasn't spoken with me since.\n\nThis got me thinkin' though, what if in Ancap society, (National and state parks no longer exist) a group of individuals who were so passionate about preserving Yosemite (or any other former park) got together and former their own private ranger group. That parts fine. But, what if they wanted to be armed and \"protect\" the space from anyone who wanted to strip mine it or build hotels or desecrate it in some way they deem unfit. How does that fit into AnCap land? \n\n",

If you want to logically understand if something is nonsense, ask yourself: If your neighbor were to do it to you and what they did was insane/immoral, then it is just as insane/immoral when the government does it to you.\n\nSo if your neighbor were to rob you through threat of violence so as to buy some land he gives you the rights to use (via their mandate, mind you), that would be both insane and nefarious. So when the state does it, nothing logically changes.\n\nNeighbor is just variable X, just as is government. There's no such thing as government, there are only people. Government is just an abstract idea, albeit a helpful label, but still an abstract idea. Government is just comprised of people, some of which believe they can rule over you because of the title they give each other.",

I don't think there are any minerals worth mining in Yosemite, or else some corporation would have already lobbied the government to make an exception for their company to do so by now. Since it is likely most valuable as a park (it's turnkey as a park right now, requiring little additional investment) , in an ancap society what would most likely happen is that the land would be bought and preserved as a park like it is now, except that the price of admission would go to the owners rather than to a government. The fair thing about this is that only those who want to use the park would have to fund it via admission fees.",
