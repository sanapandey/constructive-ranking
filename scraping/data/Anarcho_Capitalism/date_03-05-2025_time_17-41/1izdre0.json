            "body": "This has nothing to do with anarcho-capitalism, which is the replacing of the state with market-based institutions; especially of law, property, defense and production of public goods.\n\nHere's some suggested studying to learn what anarcho-capitalism is about-\n\n1. [The Problem of Political Authority](https://archive.org/details/problem-of-political-authority-the-michael-huemer/page/n1/mode/1up) by Michael Huemer\n\n2. [Machinery of Freedom](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Machinery%203rd%20Edn.pdf) by David Friedman\n\n3. [Price Theory](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html) by David Friedman\n\n4. Any other mainstream econ textbooks as far into the subject as you can handle with as much of the math as you can handle; but I do recommend starting with Modern Principles of Economics by Alex Tabbarok and Tyler Cowan.\n\n5. [The Calculus of Consent](http://files.libertyfund.org/files/1063/Buchanan_0102-03_EBk_v6.0.pdf) by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock\n\n6. Any other mainstream political economy texts or works, but I recommend Governing the Commons by Elinor Ostrom, and though not a book, [Mike Munger's intro to political economy course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEJy2f_EWBqX1yIF-VP1MJsgnYy8OLK7t&si=LEgVKe5rGO9-Qz4-) available on YouTube.\n\n7. Rothbard's [Man, Economy, and State](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market).",
