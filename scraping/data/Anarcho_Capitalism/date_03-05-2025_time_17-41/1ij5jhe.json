    "selftext": "So I'm not an ancap but I'm kind of fascinated by ancap logic. I know that not all of you are Trump supporters, but still the overwhelming majority of you all seem to be Trump supporters or at least believe that it's a good thing that Trump became President.\n\nYet ancaps pretend that they are anti-government, so I was just curious why most of you support a President who wants to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, the same law that was used to set up Japanese internment camps during WW2? Trump has made it official that he will invoke the Alien Enemies Act. This law was only ever invoked 3 times in US history, during the War of 1812, during WW1 and during WW2. It allows the President to indefinitely detain anyone over the age of 14 who's from a country that is considered to be engaging in an invasion of the US, or threatening or planning an invasion of the US.\n\nTrump has often claimed that illegal immigration is basically an invasion, and he's now declared Mexico's cartels as terrorist organizations. So once Trump invokes the Alien Enemies Act, which he has made clear he will do, then he could indefinitely imprison any Mexican national or whatever countries he deems hostile. Doesn't matter if they are legal or illegal immigrants, doesn't matter if they have commited a crime or if they are upstanding law-abiding citizens, and there is no need to even grant them a trial. Just as Japanese people in WW2 were detained simply because they were Japanese, just in the same way Trump could soon have the power to imprison people merely based on their nationality, including totally legal and law-abiding citizens.\n\nTens of millions of legal immigrants could soon lose the most basic rights and be imprisoned for no reason except for the \"crime\" of being of a certain nationality.\n\nSo do you think it's fair to say that most of you are actually extremely pro big-government and that you actually love big-government having the power to oppress immigrants? Or why do none of you see how absolutely batsh\\*t crazy it would be for Trump to have the power to imprison totally legal and law-abiding citizens and use the same law that was used for Japanese internment camps?",

Its really only a thing due to the size of the welfare state. Under true Ancap or at least small government, immigration could be extremely free flowing with essentially no restrictions. the problem comes in when there is financial incentives to enter the country illegally, or legally and financial problems for he citizens who pay for those things. \n\nThat's the only Ancap position that any genuine economist or writer has ever talked about within the Austrian economist movement.",

By that I mean, when you see all these examples of the absurd things USAID is funding, are they actually taking action to stop it, or simply saying \"Hey, look at what they're doing!\" and nothing more.\n\nI'm hoping there's actually action being taken to \\*stop\\* the nonsense(at least going forward), and genuinely reduce spending/taxes, in order to put that wealth back into the hands of its rightful owners, where it belongs.\n\n>Even if he were reducing bureaucracy, in what world does that justify deporting people by the thousands?\n\nThere's no good answer to this, but if you want the snobby philosophical answer, I'll bite:\n\nThe libertarian solution to borders is the same as the libertarian solution to everything: Property rights. In a world of \\*legitimate\\* property rights, nothing truly akin to an immigration crisis could ever really occur, because the property owners in charge of the relevant borders are going to be denying access to folks that are perhaps less desirable to have around. On the other hand, people who are particularly productive, industrious, or just generally good people are likely to be welcomed into any \"libertarian\" society with open arms, because we \\*want\\* to attract good, peaceful, and productive people to come live with us and produce more wealth.\n\nSo how does that apply to the real world? Well, in the real world, state controlled borders \\*have\\* caused an immigration crisis. We're hilariously bad at letting in actual productive people, while keeping bad people out.\n\nAnd for whatever reason, leaving aside the exact details, the Biden administration started actually importing people into the country in huge numbers, for whatever reason, I really don't understand what the fuck was going on there.\n\nSo now we have a government created problem, and there is no good solution. And bear in mind, since \"force\" is the only tool in the government tool box, that is \\*precisely\\* how they're going to try to solve the problem.\n\nI don't support mass deportations, but I also don't support mass \\*importations\\* on the part of the government. And there's no denying that some seriously awful people ended up coming across the border. A woman was literally set on fire and burned to death by some illegal on the NYC subway a few weeks ago.\n\nGangs literally took over apartment buildings in CO. Like that crazy shit really happened.\n\nLike I said, I don't have a good answer. The only answer I can give is \"This problem literally would not have occurred if you fuckwits listened to people like me in the first place\". Meaning government fuckwits, not you, obviously.",
