The controversy lies in whether the US made any positive contribution as Communism has proven to collapse on itself and the Carter Doctrine of sponsoring people like bin Laden were not just a mistake but unnecessary - Communism fails all on its own without sponsoring terrorism the world over. Further, the terrorism doesn't make people want to reject their oppressive government and embrace the loving arms of the US empire, but people see it for what it is - the US sponsoring terrorism causing people to set aside their differences with their government and embrace them. They would rather be ruled by a dictator locally than some terrorist sponsoring democracy that knows nothing of their lives and culture thousands of miles and an ocean away. But I respect that not everyone sees it that way, even if I think it is because people typically only consume the headlines of corporate propaganda machines and don't read better history books.",

I guess winning in the way you used to term must mean complete and utter victory aka how us smashed iraq, thats really not feasable for either side in ukraine since russia has spent all of their military for 4 years, and only occupied 20%. Russia cant probably get much more, and ukraine probably wont get a lot more land back. Both want to end it and both needs to play the cards correct to get as much as possible, sadly trump seems to be more on putins side in what i wouldnt even call negotiations, lets see how europe and ukraine respond but I doubt there will be peace on trumps terms, thats just not acceptable from ukraine.",
