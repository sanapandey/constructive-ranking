The closest comparison for the right might be when in 2020 many on the right were convinced they could get put in fema camps and forcibly injected with a nefarious substance.  NOw many dems fear they'll be the ones in the fema camps soon, this USAID thing is proof in their minds.  \n\nWHereas most of us on here are probably more worried right now about things like potential tariff wars and inflation which would suck but would not be the end of society, so from our perspective, it's hard to understand the utter panicked and illogical emotional response from on the left.",
