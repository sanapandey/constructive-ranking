Actual historians who\u2019ve studied this field their entire lives clearly state they weren\u2019t socialist. \n\n\u201cTo say that Hitler understood the value of language would be an enormous understatement. Propaganda played a significant role in his rise to power. To that end, he paid lip service to the tenets suggested by a name like National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party, but his primary\u2014indeed, sole\u2014focus was on achieving power whatever the cost and advancing his racist, anti-Semitic agenda. \u201c\n\n\u201cOver the following years the brothers Otto and Gregor Strasser did much to grow the party by tying Hitler\u2019s racist nationalism to socialist rhetoric that appealed to the suffering lower middle classes. In doing so, the Strassers also succeeded in expanding the Nazi reach beyond its traditional Bavarian base. By the late 1920s, however, with the German economy in free fall, Hitler had enlisted support from wealthy industrialists who sought to pursue avowedly anti-socialist policies. Otto Strasser soon recognized that the Nazis were neither a party of socialists nor a party of workers, and in 1930 he broke away to form the anti-capitalist Schwarze Front (Black Front). Gregor remained the head of the left wing of the Nazi Party, but the lot for the ideological soul of the party had been cast.\u201d\n\nThey touted socialism because they knew it sounded attractive to the suffering population and it was a way to get in power. They had zero intention of actually implementing it. \n\n\u201cIn April 1933 communists, socialists, democrats, and Jews were purged from the German civil service, and trade unions were outlawed the following month. That July Hitler banned all political parties other than his own, and prominent members of the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps. Lest there be any remaining questions about the political character of the Nazi revolution, Hitler ordered the murder of Gregor Strasser, an act that was carried out on June 30, 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives. ANY TRACES OF SOCIALIST THOUGHT IN THE NAZI PARTY HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED.\u201d",

The Nazis never intended to make society better, the people never owned the means of production, they never had any say in how anything is governed or produced etc. The Nazis were not socialists.

You seem to be conflating a lot of things in this convo. Because things are similar does not make them the same, even if it aids in trying to prove your point.

At least in a socialist state the goal is to work together to serve all people. Not just line the pockets of the 1% that want to see us divided and powerless to stay under their boot. Also, 99% of people wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the redistribution of wealth, that\u2019s why the capitalists at the top are terrified of it catching favor, and they toil day and night pumping propaganda at us to try and make us hate it.

I believe volunteerism is very valuable and we should use it as often as possible. But the main problem with capitalism, is the main goal is concentrate as much capital, property, and power over the economy as possible. Right now we have concentrations of wealth not seen before as in the past. Monopolies are the end goal, and after a certain point the public has no choice but spend their money at these businesses. This is a type of coercion which is what ancaps are so against. In my opinion, too far in any ideology is problematic. Too much government is bad, and too much capitalism is bad. Monopolies stifle entry in business sectors, and so does too much regulation and taxes. I think most of the public falls some where near the middle, and needs some kind of regulation. I\u2019m fully for much lower taxes, but think we need *some* regulation and social safety nets, as some people will act nefariously without some safeguards in place. I don\u2019t have all the answers. But think people working together has gotten the human race where we are today, and too much individualism will let the concentrated power at the top keep us divided, participating in class wars, and fighting together so they can keep their power. \n\nIm not sure how much further this convo can go but I do appreciate the mostly cordial discord and conversation.",

A lot of people just won't buy ebooks from amazon because of how they operate and this will probably make that even more so the case. Calibre with extensions and the old version of pc kindle makes it pretty simple to convert most kindle books and remove DRM, so I've just made a habit of that for a long time when I get new kindle books (mostly with free credits for accepting slower shipping with prime). This way I can easily read them from any device without all the headache of the kindle app. My number one gripe with kindle is not only can you not loan books, but you can't easily even share a device with another user, so if I want to loan somebody my tablet, I can't just make a separate user account for them to be able to access their own kindle books. It goes through and erases all my downloads if I sign out of my kindle account, and they only allow a family with 2 adults, I think with a one year wait to change, which is just unrealistic as hell in this day and age.",
