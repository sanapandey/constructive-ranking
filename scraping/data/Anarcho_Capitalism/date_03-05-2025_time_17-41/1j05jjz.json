            "body": "I don't think that anybody sane has anything against immigrants overall. When I came in Germany legally I received no help. I had to move in with a friend so I had an address, so I could register that I'm in Germany and so I could apply for a job. I found a job, and then I found an apartment for myself. Taxes are high, and I see minimum to no return from that. \n\nSo called illegal immigrants come to Germany, they are immediately put on social help, they receive any help they need, and if by some chance they are rejected, they can play a card that it is too dangerous for them to return to their homeland, and they will stay in Germany on social help, some of them will commit terrorist acts where they will kill children and people who pay their taxes (imagine this irony, 10 years ago they didn't want to send an Afghan dude back to his homeland because it was too dangerous for him because of Taliban. Last year this person did an terrorist attack in the name of Islam, where he killed an cop, think about it). Huge percentage of these people will end up on social help, and I think that immigrants now consist over 50% of social help receivers in Germany, and there are 16m of immigrants and 66m Germans, and in those Germans are counted immigrants born in Germany, and I would bet that a lot of them also use social help, but we won't get a study about that because they are considered to be German, even though if you ask them what they are, vast majority of them won't identify first as Germans (it is not like in USA, I worked with many Turks, 2nd - 3rd generation here, I have to hear one to say that he's German, nope, all consider themselves to be Turks). \n\nSo I know corporations are greedy and they are in on it with the state, but if you stop uncontrolled import of cheap labor force, you will force them to give higher salaries to local population, because who worked these jobs before? And if they can't, they can close, and we can look for new solutions. People could actually live from these jobs before, but now they want you to work for pittance. \n\nLet me make something clear, we don't live in anarchy, and we can't apply rules which we would create if we lived in a free society to the system in which we currently live.",

My father married an illegal immigrant (not my mother, they had divorced quite some time ago) at the time I was living with my father and attending college (outside of my native state, it was reconciliation with my father, who I had not spent much time with in over a decade at the point, more than an actual thing I needed to do financially). \n\nI contributed quite a bit to the household and encouraged my step-mother, whose family was also here illegally, to seek legal council. She did have to return to her home country but in the end we were able to get her and her family legal status. Eventually she even gained citizenship. All the while I helped her and her family. Her family has also been seeking legal status and at this point I'm proud to say they have it and a number if them are citizens as well. \n\nNone of this happened overnight but it did happen.",
