Trump inked several trade deals during his last presidency with strategic partners, but times have changed and the administration wants a better deal. They\u2019ll get it because of our consumption levels that other countries can\u2019t match. \n\nTo me, a better solution to immigration and consumer price spikes is to have an economically open border where US manufacturers escape high domestic wages  and move to Mexico which now has a lower labor rate than China and doesn\u2019t require the same hassles getting it here through the ports.",

They must have taken down her first speech from her office with the hammer and sickle and poster of Lenin on her wall because I couldn't find it for you, and the article didn't mention the 37 assassinations of her opponents before she won. Congratulations on your new love affair.

He expected them to just sit there and take it, he didn't expect them to retaliate. Now he has to backtrack and accept a few extra troops at the border so he can try to somehow spin this as a win. All he's achieved here is shown the US to be an unstable and untrustworthy trade partner.",
