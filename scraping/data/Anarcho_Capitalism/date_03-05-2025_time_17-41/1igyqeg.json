The idea that politicians get punished for making mistakes at the ballot box isn't true.\n\nAll of politics in any system is a bad feedback loop because everything is a binary of yes or no. We have to spend $100. I propose a budget that spends half on education, and half on healthcare. People vote no. Is that because education spending should be more than half or less than half? No clear feedback.\n\nBy contrast, the person who campaigned on shaking up the government, cutting waste, foreign aid, ousting career bureaucrats, etc. gets elected and wins the popular vote, the House, the Senate, and every swing state for the first time in 60 years\u2026 That\u2019s a mandate to do the things he campaigned on\u2014the opposite of career bureaucrats hiding and obfuscating their pet projects.\n\n>> Secondly, being accountable to the voting public isn't necessarily a good thing as many anti-democrats on this sub will tell you. \n\nSo the solution to \u201cdemocracy bad\u201d is to make elections meaningless? That clearly must be wrong.\n\n>>Voters have very little reason to be informed. \n\nThis goes back to my earlier point about poor feedback loops. But this problem will only become worse if people\u2019s vote translates into no change.",

It's not ours, it's the state's. That's why specific issues like this are never put to a vote, because it's not our decision to make. \n\n>In Ancapistan most of the incentives for illegal immigration would cease.\n\nOf course because there would be no illegal immigration only trespassing on private property, and the property owner would have the only right, rather than the state forcing a decision on the entire population. \n\nAnyways, I was just curious to see if you believe in shared ownership, which you seem to. I don't because it's dysfunctional and usually results in an 'owner' facing the consequences of not actually owning that thing(Sanctuary cities is a great example). This entire issue could be solved by abolishing public property and enforcing private property rights, but alas, that would be Ancapistan and Ancapistan does not yet exist.
