So I think it is this:  \n  \nWikipedia:  \n> The North Atlantic Fella Organization (NAFO, a play on NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) is an Internet meme and social media movement dedicated to countering Russian propaganda and disinformation about the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[1][2][3][4] It has been categorised as a form of information warfare.[2]  \n> In addition to posting irreverent commentary about the war and memes promoting Ukraine or mocking the Russian war effort and strategy (\"shitposting\"), the group also raises funds for the Ukrainian military and other pro-Ukrainian causes.[1][3] The representation of a NAFO \"Fella\" is a Shiba Inu dog (based on the Doge meme),[4] often used as an avatar and sometimes described as a \"cartoon dog\",[3][5] or a \"group of Shiba Inu soldiers\".[6]  \n  \nIf so, I half agree and half disagree. Yes, I agree that MMT is (in function) very useful to the power structures that exist, much like a meme group that is pro-NATO would be. But I disagree because MMT is about providing intellectual, theoretical, and academic justification to state policies, whereas NAFO is more about providing \"troops\" for the front lines of the information \"war.\"",
