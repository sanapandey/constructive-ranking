In the 60's and 70's the same things where said about the Vietnam War protests on College campuses and also the same things where said about the Civil rights protests. So it always just seems like what ever is being protested will be deemed wrong by the side in power. That is not a justification for destroying the rights so many have fought and died for. Also Trump has been going against the law his whole life and even now as president has defied multiple court orders in regards to how Doge is getting rid of people and programs so I have no faith that this man would respect the rule of law if given even more power to decide what is a \"lawful\" or \"unlawful\" protest.",

We can and should work to wean all of these things off of taxpayer money, but as it stands, removing \"federal funding\" from universities really amounts to pulling tuition aid and research grants from specific students and faculty members.\n\nTrump's approach here could create the bizarre situation where, for example, an aggressive protest intimidates students on a campus, and the resulting suspension of \"federal funding\" causes the students *who were being threatened* to have their tuition grants revoked.\n\nShould we remove federal involvement in tuition aid and research grants?

This effort is already failing, with those same employees being hired back by their agencies and the courts restricting DOGE from accessing records. Furthermore, the email that Musk had sent out was not sufficient and most federal employees who did not answer the email were not removed from their posts (because Musk does not have that kind of authority).\n\nTrump is an illogical individual who wants to strip the rights of his political opponents (as made clear by the post he made) because he wants to strengthen his executive power over the population; have his enemies fear him. Used Trans people and migrants as a scapegoat to further get the people of America to give him the green light for his agenda.\n\nIf Trump were actually libertarian, then he would not resort to threatening to strip the rights of individuals away because he viewed it as a threat to his ego/agenda.",

No chance there are orders of magnitude difference. I hope you\u2019re not just taking what Trump says at face value. The man may be the most prolific liar and bullshit artist of all time.",
