    "selftext": "(Disclaimer: I am nit advocating oir nor promoting this ideology, I'm just asking what you think would happen if it was led to it's logical conclusion?)\nSo this ideology is based around what I'm calling \"consumer unions\" in which the potential customers of a certain industry has some authority over how their products are made and this power is granted to them by the state. So for example, we know how the western games industry is run by activists who hate straight white men, who unfortunately happen to be the main audience for the kinds of games they produce. So what if gamers get together and form a \"gamers union\" whose able to regulate the games industry to their liking. They could force the companies to fire the feminist activists or get rid of the ladies in HR. They could make feminine female characters with big boobs and masculine male characters mandatory and could also require that each game be released completely finished (since the games being released as a buggy mess has been a problem and large parts are put behind paywalls). So what would happen should this system be led to it's logical conclusion?",

I mean we already have a more general concept of this kind of thing in like UL (not affiliated with the government and makes sure electronics are safe) and the BBB, but if instead it was lead by the consumers rather than a company that would probably result in better products. \n\nLike if car companies only had to listen to consumers and not the government, we'd have v8s in trucks and actual keys for ignition again.",

            "body": "It's just unnecessary, requiring game designers to do X, Y, or Z would limit creativity, especially from independent creators. Indie games would hurt the most, most people don't know the challenges of game design, so they would ask unreasonable things, games would take a longer time to come out, the game industry would basically crumble, many companies would just go out of business.\n\nA lot of games would feel samey, kind of like car regulations have made cars all look samey, and weigh 2 tons.\n\nAlso, on the reason it is unnecessary, people just don't buy the games they don't want to play. Letting the market decide is really close to what your describing, but it is voluntary program, and companies can pander to their current audience, or to new ones. They can also try out new things that people may not even think they want, that turn out to be great games.\n\nCompanies generally know what their consumers want, there's enough outcry for them to see that. Generally if you don't like something for what it is, it's because you're not the target demographic. \n\nSame goes for the new car market. The people buying new cars are willing to spend X to get Y, while people who buy exclusively used cars don't like where the car market is headed, but Toyota isn't going after the people that are buying their cars second hand, they are going after the people who are going to buy them off the lot.",

You're better off becoming a stockholder and earning a say in how they do business. We need less methods of force, not more.",

If you could organize enough people to patronize just one of the members of the cartel you could freak out the other members enough to lower prices and improve the product's quality to get their customers back, which would destroy the cartel.\n\n  \nOne of the dumbest things I've seen was a viral email that was going around years ago urging people to not buy gasoline on a specific day in order to show oil companies that consumers are super-duper angrymad at them. It was stupid because consumers would just have to buy more gas the following day, thus making up for the gas they refused to buy that day. A much better plan would have been to get consumers to pick one company and only buy from them from then on. Something like that would have started a price war between the companies.",
