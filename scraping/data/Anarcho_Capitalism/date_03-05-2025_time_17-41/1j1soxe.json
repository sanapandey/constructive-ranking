Now if you combine this sub and some of it offshoots you get like 400-500k people but it\u2019s safe to assume less then 10% are ancaps or close to it. Is this space just playground for 3 letters agencies and that\u2019s why it still exists? I mean every single sub on Reddit is nothing but pure leftist rage and nonsense, regardless of topic. Make it make sense. ",

People get downvoted for sure, but it is far less ban-happy than many of the other supposed freedom-loving subreddits I\u2019ve been a part of. \n\nI also think that anarcho capitalism isn\u2019t necessarily an easy point of view for the average person to wrap their head around if they\u2019re very used to seeing the state as a fact of life. Having groups like this with open discussion helps normalize the ideals.",

They exist because the tenants of Communism are untenable, statelessness and true equality cannot coexist, only statelessness and \"Godly\", or \"principled\" equality. To solve this as well as to address the fact that even they van see the pure evil of historically Communist states, they have tried to branch closer to, well, US. But they cannot understand what a lack of a central self determined authority would actually look like, and so they've jumped themselves through all kinds of hoops to explain how to remove the evil from a philosophy that has it baked into the core and still chase the fairytale which that philosophy espouses. \n\nThis fact I also submit should not be necessarily disheartening for us. People are feeling the pain acutely in this day and age. Now a quarter of the way into the century enough real world damage has been done for many average hardworking people to notice all around the world - and they have not been idle submissive sheep in the face of it. Argentina may not be on the path to statelessness anytime soon, but their president is one of us - do I need to repeat that again? Their president has literally openly declared himself as one of us. The people of the US have been so fed up with statism and entrenched politics they elected by simple majority an orange guy whose entire platform is and was \"fuck the establishment\". Not quite as sexy a step as Argentina's, but not backwards either. \n\nOur sub IS still populated by many of us, but simply attracting and turning more people to libertarianism, Minarchism, and on rare occasion true Anarchism is a worthwhile cause for our continued efforts. This has been and remains a bastion of upholding and advocating our principles, even when the rare genuine free speech we allow for on reddit is used in annoying ways by MAGA types and Socialists. \n\nDon't stop now, when our message has genuinely been changing minds and has genuinely been showing many people that there does exist a better way and that there is hope for a path forward if even half or a third of our suggestions are followed.",

He is not tackling the bureaucrats that refuse to issue reforms to the process of entering the United States legally. It is why most immigrants enter the way they do (which is in-terms of the statist: illegally).",

Sure yes, that\u2019s why strong protect the weak,but government only protect corporations that pay them and not the weak. They treat weak as give me more money token.

Society so wealthy that can tak care of all those less fortunate, got it? I just jammed most of ancap ideas into one paragraph, it may sound a little all over the place, but I hope you find at least some points that will make you think.",

This is not a function of governance but more of the human condition. I've argued against the death penalty, but I'm starting to come around for public referendums to bring the gallows out for politicians who do not act in good faith. Arguably it's easier said than done, but I think a 1 vote per constituant in their area could give them a fair chance to make their case to the people.\n\n>The only way is to dismantle the beast and let people be free\n\nGovernment allows for non-mob rule, every member in theory has a say through representatives in the legislature. A system without rules, anarchy, devolves into who punches harder or quicker. Get the Jesse James and wild wild West shit of yesteryear.\n\n>Why is it that we should have masters? Bcs there are weak individuals who need support? Sure yes, that\u2019s why strong protect the weak,but government only protect corporations that pay them and not the weak.\n\nThat is a false equivalency, we don't need masters we need leaders which is what government provides. The fact they bend to corporate interests is a newer phenomenon, and we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water because the water is full of shit. Government is corrupt, but it doesn't have to be.\n\n> in fact in free market you get checked by anyone anytime, you act bad you get punish, you don\u2019t get protection of government, bcs there is none to help you\n\nThis might've been true before globalisation and end game capitalism, but definitely not true now. Check Amazon, you'll buy the cheapest thing and it'll be by some brand qiyoo or some shit. If you don't like their product you can ignore qiyoo, but when you buy sansui it's really just qiyoo but you'd have no way of telling.\n\n>And in what kinda society you make the most? Wealthy one. So by default, you wanna have a wealthy society so you can make as much as u can.\n\nUh, I'd prefer happy society to a wealthy one personally. It's why I can be a progressive liberal, in a (somewhat) progressive nation, Canada. I've had a few windfalls and gladly paid my 48.8% taxes to the feds and province. I'd do it again if I know a single mother got her welfare and she is producing productive members of society that might be otherwise left to the wolves.\n\n>Society so wealthy that can tak care of all those less fortunate, got it? \n\nSo, let's entertain this for a moment... Which country is the most wealthy? How do they support their lower rung of society? It's not inherent that every man for themselves will lift their neighbors up and make sure they're fed. We're keeping our own family above water and will let bureaucracts take our taxes to make sure we have a strong workforce in the future for strong entrepreneurs to take advantage of strong government.\n\nStrong government should not appropriate all their time to appeasing the corpo oligarchy, but at the same time it seems like that keeps politicians in their chairs. They can pad their pockets and maybe Pat themselves on the back for \"creating jobs\", when really they're just giving tax breaks to Amazon so they can put in a fulfillment center, fill it with gig (read: slave) workers which doesn't help the local community. It probably likely worsens socio-economic factors in the area as now you get your delivery in 1 hr instead of leaving your house. You're not popping into McDonald's or Starbucks for a drink to browse the local shops, so all the money just goes to bezos and his broligarchy friends.\n\nUSA is closest to anarcho-capitalism in a successful country, afaik. And it's a failed experiment, especially now with 47",

I consider government straight up evil, you consider it unnecessary or the society won\u2019t work. That\u2019s the major difference we won\u2019t agree on. I  go further and say governments( yes people) don\u2019t represent majority anyone but themselves. They made the rules of governance and we have to obey. You are happy to pay taxes, I consider that extortion. You say government allows no-mob rule, I say government is the biggest mafia ever. Let me just a say one single example, who start wars? People or governments? 99% people are against war yet government just start one regardless so them and their corporations friends can make a fortune. \nMillions die, we all pay for it, but hey it\u2019s just unnecessary or..or what? There would be peace? Can\u2019t have that can we? Expand this to any government action and u see that the bottom line is money, nothing but money, people are expendable.

It sucks that countries go to war and government does it generally for their own interests. But I really don't see how removing government would change human nature? Maybe that's where we're at.\n\nI think we are almost a ying-yang type situation, I'm comfortable where I am, have grown from a single parent household using strong social safety nets for my mom fleeing an abusive relationship. In hindsight, why was her religious family letting this new mother fight the hardships alone? Maybe they, like me, feel they're too busy and want to help but figure big brother is taking care of her? In any case she found government subsidized housing, got 2 and sometimes 3 jobs and fucking worked her ass off. She did night school to educate herself more, and eventually found a job in the public education system as a special needs worker. \n\nI'm the product of public education, I use public roadways to get to work. I attended a public post secondary institution with government subsidy that made it affordable, and have had a very successful career. I look at my cousins, whose parents were as vitriolic as my father and of my 4 cousins on my father's side and their stories aren't mine but I consider them all trash of humanity, one in jail, one in an early grave and the other 2 don't have anything nice to say of them either.\n\nThe only difference I can see is my mom felt confident to leave a bad situation to give me a chance. She was able to do this not due to her large family, many of whom are successful financially, they could've stepped up to the plate. But she was able to raise me and I became a productive member of society because I was given what I needed to succeed.\n\nThat just doesn't materialize out of nowhere, I'd be a homeless drug addict if it weren't for government supports. Now I can brag I paid some of the highest percentage of my wages because I'm in that tax bracket.",
