    "selftext": "Requirements?\n\nMoral? Well..... This tend to go wrong. The more requirements we have the more things don't work out.\n\nWhat about.....\n\n  \nOur world..... Yap. Our world has what it takes.\n\n  \nWe need.\n\n  \n1. Countries don't attack each other. This is important. It's like the difference between early zhou dynasty where chinese are rich and spring and autumn period where chinese kill each other. \n\n2. Light government. Small government. This is important. It's like the difference between United States before big federal government and United States now.\n\n3. Some regions are fun for profit, like Prospera.\n\nSee, the way early zhou dynasty works is that almost everything is privatized. They didn't have joint stock corporations, that's invented by the dutch. Think of Moldbug with political and business dynasties instead of joint stock corporation. I prefer moldbug. But we are talking about a primitive government system where most people can't even read and don't have access to bitcoin, AI, internet, and so on. \n\nThe powerful feudal lords do not wage war against each other because they have a tiny governments on top of that, called the king. It's often translated as emperor but chinese words for emperor isn't invented till the Chin feudal lord unite everything under heaven, I mean, under east asian mainland heaven.\n\nHow do libertarianism works. We don't aggress other people's right, and then let the market decides everything right? But even that is a very complex concept. What is consent? What is a person's best interests?\n\nIf I have a girlfriend that I fuck many times and one day she put me on drug because she wants to have sex with me while we're on drug, is that rape? What about if the gender is reversed? You can read Danny Masterson case where a guy got life sentence.\n\nWhat is amount of child support? Should people just make business contracts or should the state decides amount of child support?\n\nEven among libertarians, we disagree. For child support case, for example, some libertarians would argue that the kids have right so child support can't be contracted before conception. So who decides? The government? Kind of weird for a libertarian to think that the government should decide that.\n\nIf even among libertarians we disagree, let alone with non libertarians. Should school be privatized? What happened to welfare parasites? Should we let them starve to death? Who pays for their corpse removal? What happened to poor people that can't feed their children? What about if they rebel?  \n\n\nSo Early zhou dynasty solve that in an even simpler way.\n\nInstead of the king deciding every single rules for every people, the king just ensure feudal lords do not attack each other. That's it. That make fiefdom effectively private property.\n\nThings go well for 500 years\n\nThen the feudal lords start calling themselves king and attack one another. Then we got philosopher like Lao Tze and Kong Fu Chu pretty much saying to go back to early Zhou dynasty. Kong Fu Chu is more like everyone has it's place and Lao Tze is pretty much governments do nothing and yet nothing left undone. Nothing here means very little or what's really necessary.\n\nTada.... Our planet now is like early zhou dynasty. Except for Ukraine and Palestine, countries don't attack each other. Countries are not privatized and not run for profit. \n\nThat's also how early US works.\n\nStates are like fiefdoms. People shop around for the best government like customers.\n\nBitcoin is like that too except that we don't even need government. So something like bitcoin would be great.\n\nThen?\n\nThen just let the market decides everything. If something like Prospera can be stable then others' will copy out of greed.\n\nNo need too much morality\n\nCompetition among states will keep tax laws. All other freedom can be gotten by shopping around.",
