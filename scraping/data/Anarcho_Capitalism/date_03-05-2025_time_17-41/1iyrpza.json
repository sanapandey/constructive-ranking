Thousands of members of the Catholic clergy were tortured and killed and many more fled the country or sought refuge in foreign embassies.\n\nAntony Beevor estimates the total number of people killed in Catalonia in the summer and autumn of 1936 at 8,352 (out of a total of 38,000 victims of the Red Terror in all of Spain).\n\nSo yes, I will stick to my assertion that the outcome of anarchism has the potential to be problematic.",
