Trump and Elon are about to expose our government as being one big illegal, corrupt Ponzi scheme.\"\n\nThe USAID bank is closed.

It's a start, and I'll take whatever we can get that shrinks the government\n\nAs to the auto-closing of DOGE, that's how *every* agency should be handled. The problem is, many agencies are established for a \"good\" reason, and then get morphed into these monsters once the target problem is solved. In fact, I believe USAID itself is one of those agencies. I believe it was started my JKK for the purpose of helping heal a post-war country (maybe Vietnam?), once that purpose was accomplished the agency just morphed into an arm of the CIA for overthrowing governments.",
