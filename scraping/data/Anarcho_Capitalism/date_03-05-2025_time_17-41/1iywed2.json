Obviously not even close to how much we pay today, but in essence you add all taxes (calculated by average income/spending, so it depends on which tax bracket you're in and what you spend money on).\n\nBasically all EU countries pay more in taxes than they get to keep. \"Free\" healthcare is not even close to being free.\n\nEmployer pays around 31% on each employees salary in \"social costs\".\n\nIncome tax around 30-35% for medium income households. Another 20% for each cent exceeding 60k per year.\n\nSales tax at 25%, plus extra tax ranging from 0-100% on fuel, alcohol, electronics etc.\n\nRoad tax ranging from around $100 to $4K per car per year depending on how new the car is and basically how big your engine is.\n\nThose are the big ones. Then there are hundreds of small taxes on basically anything you can imagine.\n\nSalary increases are very hard to negotiate, partly due to the social costs increase (besides salary costs) for employers.\n\nI \"only\" have to pay $25 - $50 to see a doctor though. Yay!\n\nSchools are declining in quality each year, police are extremely strained, people in semi-rural areas cannot get proper access to healthcare, there are people with cancer dying in queues because the healthcare system cannot treat enough people and people are in debt up to their ears.\n\nI love Sweden, and I think \"free\" education is extremely important but social democracy really isn't what the left in the US thinks it is.",
