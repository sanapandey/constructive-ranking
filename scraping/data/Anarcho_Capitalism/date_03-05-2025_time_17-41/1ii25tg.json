I have never understood when leftists want to push common ownership on everyone, when it clearly works best in a small high trust group united by a shared common goal. Everyone in society doesn't have the same goals, and that's the biggest reason why this doesn't work at scale. True collectivism is always a sham. Tribalism is in our DNA however. \n\nPersonally, I would plan on sharing my property with an ownership split amongst my immediate family in Ancapistan. Take care of my grandparents, have more laborers to farm. It would be possible without absurd property taxes on large amounts of land or zoning regulations.",
