I see no issue with holding them at a much higher standard that is befitting of their own perception of themselves. This one seems silly, to me more a case test. If there\u2019s a response, it would be a form of acceptance and constant for them to move forward with more outrageous comments. Is there a reason to suspect they will take this approach with citizens? Over the last 4 years or so, I\u2019ve seen plenty of \u201cright wing\u201d people posting videos of FBI agents or detectives knocking on people\u2019s doors to question them about their \u201con line\u201d comments. I would say that this might indicate that politicians might be subject to the same standards they apply to the little people. Is that a bed thing?",
