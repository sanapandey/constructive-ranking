Reliance on collectivism, hypocrisy, fervent belief in theft, wanting a totalitarian state, etc. \n\nAttacking something really personal like orientation, relationships, gender, clothing, beliefs on race, disabilities (psychiatric or physical) doesn't really accomplish anything other than pissing everyone off and further alienating everyone from a freedom and liberty oriented ideology. \n\nLike, how many prospective Libertarian/AnCap trans people have been turned away and pushed into the arms of the left because we met them with hostility?\n\nAt the same time, no, you don't **have** to associate or even be nice to anyone you don't want to. But damn, it really would help us in the long run if you did.",
