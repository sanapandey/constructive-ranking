                    "body": "This is the question at hand. \n\nWhat happened was hedge funds can technically short sell stocks that were bought with their brokerage firms. Meaning, you don't actually own any of the stocks in your 401k, or TD Ameritrade, or robinhood. Whatever brokerage firm you are holding your tendies. What apes discovered was that to own your stock you had to \"direct register shares\" or DRS under your name or company or whatever. Meaning, you're removing real actual share from their \"infinity\" pool / dark pools. Since then, the volumes have gone down and the big hedge funds switched to a \"sharing\" model where they can all drs from the same pot. \n\nSo, the actual shares had been reducing, but the hedges still have to pay the interest rates and every time a share is drs'ed - that's a share that is \"bought\". For lack of a better term.\n\nI eat crayons, and I'm regarded, but at this point the game seems to be... can apes stay regarded longer than the hedges. That is,  before the money runs out? Also, there have been several regulatory action around this. Korea no longer allows short selling and I think China also eliminated it. There was also a push for a cat system that is supposed to record all transactions but hedgefunds are currently suing the system. One thing is real. Gamestop is sitting on a pile of cash somewhere around 4 billion dollars and their management has made them profitable. \n\nThis is not financial advice.\n\nEdit: I think something like 50% of the float was locked at one point. I think they sold additional shares so not sure where we're at but drs'ing drives scarcity.",

Now, we may never see a company shorted so heavily ever again.\n\nAlso, shorting a stock doesn't cause bankruptcy directly.

They restricted the stock based on an inaccurate recording of a 385 million dollar wash trade in another stock. This is literally in the house committee report- there was a concurrent buy and sell, but apex only calculated one side of the trade, used that as justification to skyrocket the margin requirements for that stock and two others (GME and KOSS) which was then used as the justification by the brokers to shut down buying of those stocks.\u00a0\n\nRobinhood was just a particularly bad offender because even though the apex restrictions were cleared the next day, they continued to restrict GME for an additional week\u00a0\n\n>\u00a0Also, shorting a stock doesn't cause bankruptcy directly.

If you\u2019re dumping shares that don\u2019t even exist on the order books every day that causes the share price to decline, which means the total value of the company goes down, which severely damages their ability to raise money, forces them to take on more debt, and so on.\u00a0",

They do all the time. If you dump shares on the order book, the share price WILL decline. Declining shares will make it more difficult to raise capital. Inability to raise capital forces you to take on debt. Debt that you cannot service causes a bankruptcy. It\u2019s a direct correlation.\u00a0\n\nYou admit as much right here:\u00a0\n\n>\u00a0My point of view is that shorts suppress stock prices\u00a0\n\nThat means they can cause a company to spiral towards bankruptcy, especially if you\u2019re shorting the company so much that it\u2019s on the regsho list for an entire fucking year lol. That is not what shorting should be, this is not an honest bet against a company, that is straight up market manipulation.\u00a0\n\n>\u00a0and in the long run shorts get killed.\n\nThat is not a rule by any extent. In fact *most of the time*, the shorts do not get killed. Most of the time there is no sensational event that leads to a turn around, the company just dies. GME was a special case.\u00a0\n\n>\u00a0Either way, Robinhood specifically did some fucked up shit when it came to GME and nothing ever really happened to them. No new laws or anything.\n\nWell yes\u00a0Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, webull, etoro, the list goes on and on and on. They all shut off the buy button. Yes robinhood is corrupt as fuck but this issue was much more systemic and went way deeper than one brokerage\u00a0",

GME was on the verge but somehow, for some dumb reason I guess, people bought the stock. Why? Because there was value in Cohen's leadership. But GME wasn't going bankrupt BECAUSE of shorts, they were on the verge because they didn't make money. What changed was Cohen. Tesla is another example of a company that lost for a long, long time. What happened there? Elon invested everything he had and finally it broke through. How many short sellers lost their ass on Tesla? I just don't believe short sellers are this ugly, bad thing. They don't cause bankruptcies, bad leadership and products and companies cause it. If there is value in a company investors buy its just that simple.\n\nLook at Intel right now, they have been struggling a long time now. Their competition has them cooked. They have a 3% short float today but if they were at 100% you bet your ass Blackrock would buy them at 3 dollars a share and buy them all. And once news of that got out, others would buy too. And the shorts would squeeze.",
