Ukraine is completely different from USA in the sense that the authorities in Ukraine are always separate from the people, and people who do not belong to the authorities understand that the authorities are their enemy. this is due to some geographical and economic specifics of the territory itself, all kinds of invaders hang out here all the time. the last ones were Bolsheviks, who destroyed probably half of the population in the process of wars and famines. the current political system is essentially the same Bolshevik system after some plastic surgery. \n\n\n\nso the current president does not care at all how many Ukrainians will die and how, the Ukrainian government considers Ukraine as a resource, they prefer to keep their money and property in Europe and the USA, so they are not very concerned about what is happening in the country. naturally, this attitude kills the economy (and deprives people of the resource for protest), so they are not even very interested in robbing the population, but financial assistance from \u2018partners\u2019 is more interesting.\n\nall these negotiating grimaces should be seen in this way - their interests are reduced to the continuation of the war (since the war is an excuse for the complete elimination of civil liberties, which Ukrainians have gained too much since the USSR), and to receiving financial aid (a great source of pocket money for US and EU officials).",

They asked in Minsk 1 for NATO to stop expanding eastward and were assured NATO had no reason to expand as the threat it was fighting no longer existed.\n\nThey have noted several times since 2004 that the final red line before they would intervene was Ukraine applying for NATO membership, including the director of the CIA and Russian Ambassador informing the president of this directly in 2008. \n\nIt's the equivalent of an angry mob outside of your house being handed torches and pitchforks supplied by the police, and you call the police asking them to stop giving the angry mob torches and pitchforks, then the police just respond \"Well, they aren't doing anything, what's the problem?

This is a non-starter offer. Putin was never serious about it, and if hypothetically he was and Ukraine submitted to that, it would just mean that Russia would invade them again in 5 years and take over. You know like they did last time there was a ceasefire. Historically speaking, Russia is the bad guy. They have always wanted buffer zones around their country and they do that by taking over those other countries and areas and either installing puppet governments or just alt-right taking the land and fortifying it. It's because fundamentally speaking the Russians seem to be in fear of all of their neighbors. And it's been this way for hundreds of years. \n\nThe icing on the cake of this conflict, is that Ukraine found natural gas reserves that were significant in the east and planned on selling gas cheaper to Europe than Russia was. Making this ultimately an oil war for Russia and no different than the US meddling in the Middle East. \n\nAs for NATO, It is absolutely necessary to keep around when you have belligerent countries like Russia and China destabilizing the world for their own political gains. \n\nI include China because of their military forces. Doing weird shit in Africa. Oh and Chinese fishing fleets over fishing in other countries territorial Waters. Or even the Chinese Coast guard taking direct hostile action against Filipino Coast guard and fishing vessels. \n\nWe are watching a new axis of evil forming and yet too many people are distracted by Russian and Chinese propaganda.",

I think it may be the case that in order to avoid apocalyptic conditions, a swift response against Russia may be necessary. But I could go completely the other way as well. I'm leaning about 51% towards Swift response. Because from history, dictators usually just keep taking and taking until they are stopped, and appeasement strategy does not work. Didn't stop the USSR from expanding and it didn't stop not to Germany from expanding. So how is abandoning Ukraine going to stop Russia from being emboldened into attacking further neighbors of theirs? Right now we have the option to not follow the mistakes of the past. And as Russia is the aggressor, it would not be a violation of the nap if it's in the interest of Global Security to stop them.",
