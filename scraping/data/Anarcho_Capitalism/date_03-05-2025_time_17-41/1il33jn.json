Freedom of movement is quite literally one of the most basic freedoms in life. But many people here don't want me to be able to move freely around the glove unless they stop paying taxes.\n\nWhy should you paying taxes affect my freedom? Why are you holding me back? If you don't make enough money, get a better job, I don't know what else to tell you. \n\n\nLately, I've just been pretending I don't pay taxes. I mean, they come off automatically every pay, I've never actually seen that money. Was it really ever mine? Would I have been able to work the job I work and earn my living without all the people before me paving the way? Without the government building all the infrastructure to do it?\n\n\nSo I guess in the end my question is:\n\nDo you hate taxes so much and are you so selfish that you want to punish everyone else?\n\nMe, I wanna be free, even if it costs a little more.",

Even in the private sector who can go where is regulated, hence the concept of trespass. Illegal immigration is just national trespass.  Should we adjust the rules? absolutely. but that does not mean there are no rules, nor does it mean breaking the rules should have no consequences.  \n\n\n2) Illegal immigration is not politically neutral.  People push for it for reasons just like people Push against it for reasons.  Often it boils down to getting more power either way, and from what i've seen the people who push for illegal immigration are broadly against what i want.  On that vector in this current system that's often reason enough to oppose it.  \n\n\n3) Pragmatically, \"Just get a better job\" and \"Learn to code\" is just the modern equivalent of \"Let them eat cake\" because at best its a years long process and runs into real capacity constraints per the individual especially as they age.  Conversely taxes immediately boost earning potential and have positive knock on effects that result in increased earnings over time ceteris paribus due to economy wide gains.  This is part of why taxes are a deadweight loss to the economy.  \n\n\n4) while convenient this is the most insidious part of the american tax system exactly because you can be blinded to how much this is directly hurting you and you only see the total about once a year and usually thats paired with a refund which again obfuscates the real cost.\n\n5) this is a basic fallacy.  you can build the infrastructure without taxes, and in all honestly it would not be as overbuilt which is part of why so much of it is in disrepair.\n\n6) Taxes are a sign you aren't free so your conclusion is faulty",

Part of the privilege of those monopolies are defining terms and conditions under which goods and services can cross into those territories and what the penalty for violating those terms are.  In theory this is managed for the good of the society managed within the monopoly.  For lack of a better term, the monopoly owns the region.  This ownership is where the ancaps (rightly) chime in with the fact that they don't really own it for a list of great reasons.  Unfortunately we ancaps generally don't matter and nobody else cares especially when the guys with the guns say they do own it.  This fractals all the way down to (legitimate) private property.  It happened when abbot sent a bunch of illegals to martha's vineyard and chicago and those localities immediately started rejecting the busses.  Its the same as building owners not wanting homeless people loitering on their property to the point of installing spikes and other hostile design elements.\n\n2) Its ethical to remove trespassers.  Its ethical to create systems to discourage trespass.  People don't have a right to be on other people's property without permission.",

Those who restrict your freedom of movement are the ones restricting your freedom of movement, not the ones who resist those restrictions or refuse to pay taxes.\n\n>Do you hate taxes so much and are you so selfish that you want to punish everyone else?
