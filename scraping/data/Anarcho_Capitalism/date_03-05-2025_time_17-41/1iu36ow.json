Rectenwald wrote: \"Jewish 'elites' run the US\"---so what is his objection? That they're \"elites\"? Or that they run the US? If those are his objections, why does he feel the need to specify that they're Jews? Why not just complain about how elites run the US? \n\nHe specified \"Jews\" because he hates Jews. If he didn't, he wouldn't feel the need to point them out.  which means that his objection to these people are that they're Jewish. Specifying that *Jews* run the US indicates that he would have no objection to non-Jewish elites running the US. \n\nStop defending anti-Jewish hate.\n\nEdit: LMAO, I'm the one discussing in \"bad faith\" when the other guy keeps making comparisons to religions people voluntarily join, when anti-Semites see Jews as a race you're born into, hence why they point to anyone with a Jewish last name and say \"see? The Jews control the US!\" even if those Jewish people aren't religiously Jewish.",
