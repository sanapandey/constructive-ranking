The worst part is that their reasons are just classic leftist fallacies. It's like they don't know what libertarians defend at all.   \n  \nWhat's up with that?

Even too many \"ancaps\" here shit on them, not realizing that it's better to help people understand the logical endgame to minarchism than shit on them for not reaching enlightenment whole cloth.\n\nFrankly, you're better off here.  The sane ancaps here understand that libertarianism is big tent, and if we're going to argue purity with minarchists, maybe we should dismantle the 90% of the problems we agree on first before having that discussion.",

Minarchists really aren't bad at all. Problem is it's harder to define, since it's just \"the least state power necessary\" rather than no state, and people disagree on how much is actually necessary.",

I have a hard time imagining how the left will abuse some of his actions later, considering most of what he has done has recent historical examples...typically on the left that the right has not been willing to yield.  That said I'm not a sick-o politician who seeks out ways to destroy these things.\n\nThe best case would be for his actions to proceed through Congress, but going back to Washinton and the assembling of a cabinet the president has been where not through Congress the president can help model his executive branch...that was concerning then to Jefferson and should reasonably be established as a sign of reasonable thought,  The next guy can rebuild just as easy as he dismantles if funding won't change.",

You don't have to actually believe in anarchy to be part of the ancap stream. It's just an admition of consistency and also typically is correlated with less egalitarian (ie more \"right wing\") opinions. Don't misunderstand, ancaps are also libertarians and don't feel salty calling themselves that. They're the real libertarians, so to speak",
