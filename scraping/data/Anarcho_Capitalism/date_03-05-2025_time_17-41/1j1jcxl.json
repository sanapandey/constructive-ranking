    "selftext": "All their narratives are already incredibly annoying because they are so predictable. If it weren't so damn serious, it could be downright boring. They use the same tactics over and over again: They put forward a theory or name grievances that they themselves have created. People fall into fear and show acceptance of freedom-restricting measures.\n\nMany people who know that they are being lied to remain in a wait-and-see attitude due to the lack of alternatives or are presented with a supposed rescue based on the principle of hope.\n\nBlind activism by angry people is used to further their agenda, because they draw attention to what will be obsolete in the new order anyway. At the same time, those who explain the real causes can be criminalized and, if they remain a small minority, eliminated.\n\nCheckmate? No! The person who trusts his own perception is immune to all their lies. Their plans only become a threat when they are met with acceptance, passivity or a desire for new leadership by the masses. Unfortunately, in my opinion, this is still the rule.\n\nAwareness of their manipulation, on the other hand, makes all their \"offers\", which ultimately only create dependencies, unacceptable. Rejection requires the unconditional will to be free, which must be based on personal responsibility and result in action. There is no one right way for everyone, because such approaches only serve those who want to rule.\n\nUltimately, life also means giving meaning to survival. I have decided that I want to be free and do everything I can to achieve this. That actually sounds obvious, but unfortunately it is not in this system, because freedom has degenerated into an empty word, the true meaning of which many people shy away from, as if it were against our nature. Yet freedom is the only form of life that does not establish structural injustice and in which living beings can develop in all their perfection.\n\nI also wish from the bottom of my heart that all other people can live the way they want. Even if you see yourself as an individual, which everyone undoubtedly is, we are still connected to one another. I too was only able to make these thoughts and feelings tangible for myself and formulate them for others when I met people who felt the same way and gave me important food for thought in my process.\n\nAnd so I am not only incredibly grateful for that, but I am also grateful when I can contribute to it for others. Because even if freedom begins in your own head and heart, we only become free when everyone wants to be free. Freedom, happiness and love increase where you contribute to it yourself and so all my efforts, no matter on what level it will take place in the future, will serve these goals. There is no way back.\n\nYou, who are reading this now, have the right to go your own way. No one (!!!) can decide about you and your life. Be so worthy of yourself that you can love yourself and ensure your happiness. I wish you have people at your side who will increase this. You have the right to freedom.\n\nWith love in solidarity.\n(Unity and justice and freedom)\n\n*Translated from German*    \n*Original by Anti-Authorit\u0101re Aktion*",
