Norway's economy for example is 20% state-owned, and they're doing just fine.\n\nInstead of all their oil profits going to a handful of billionaires, they've nationalized much of their oil production and have used the profits to set up the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. That's a major reason for why Norway has one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios among wealthy countries and it offers them immense long-term stability.",

It is very difficult to accurately quantify how culture plays into quality of life and income. \n\nNorway also has a vibrant market economy.

Are you saying that the profits from the oil industry are directly distributed to the people, or are you saying that the government uses the profits to create and provide services like food production and healthcare? If the former then that is just capitalism with more steps (where government is a rent seeking middle man). Socialism would be the latter. If people are free to spend the money on themselves as they see fit then the calculation and knowledge problems are *not as* destructive. How much of the money does the government take off the top for themselves?\n\nIf the situation was that profits (and losses, and expenses, and liabilities) went to \"a handful of billionaires\" where would the profits go after they get it? Who provides the goods that they spend the profits on? My point is that it's not as if the billionaires would burn the profits so that no one could have them, they would be distributed to others through their purchase of goods and services from other businesses.",

If big pharma wants to sell in the EU they have to agree to a significantly reduced price. Guess who makes up for that lost revenue?
