The only port that wasn\u2019t frozen over in winter.\n\nRussia had taken Crimea from Turkey before the US gained independence from Britain, and the Soviets had given it to Ukraine in the \u201850s to quell internal tensions. After the dissolution of the USSR in the \u201890s, Russia leased the port from Ukraine.\n\nAfter the US-backed coup in 2014 that installed a NATO friendly government in Ukraine over the Russian friendly one, Ukraine terminated Russia\u2019s lease on the port. So Russia took Crimea in 2014 to maintain the strategic port. Bloodlessly, as it happens. Or almost. One person may have been killed. It\u2019s not clear.\n\nAlso at the time, the Donbas region sesceded from Ukraine and tried to join Russia. Russia said no, and the resulting war of independence killed about 50,000 people before Russia invaded.\n\nEdit:\n\nRussia invaded because Ukraine announced its intention to take back Crimea and Russia needed to shore up its position in Crimea.",

The key to good propaganda to push any side of an issue is that there is some truth present and the other side(s) are not presented or presented as a straw man.\n\n\u201cEven in Stalin\u2019s time there was collective leadership. The Western Idea of a dictator within the Communist setup is exaggerated. Misunderstandings on that subject are caused by lack of comprehension of the real nature and organization of the communist power structure\u201d - The fucking CIA [source](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A006000360009-0.pdf)\n\nThat is certainly not what our government publicly said about the Soviets lol\n\nWe all already know how violent and aggressive Russia can be and they did start the war, not including more details for sake of length of comment.\n\nThe US and Russia can be aggressive and underhanded to each other. It\u2019s more the reality of the situation. Aggressive empire vs aggressive empire",

This warrants the question. \n\nYou were the one who said Ukraine was completely sovereign, then you attacked your own strawman. \n\nCongratulations.\n\n>While it is obvious they aren't truly sovereign when the US and Britain are dictating to them when and how they can negotiate.\n\nSo Finland joining NATO was dictated by the US and Britain?

And we didn't see nukes flying then either.  Also, Russia isnt the biggest, they're 3rd after the US and then China.  And that's a distant third, not a close one.\n\n>I hope we're not forgetting all that Serbia/Kosovo craziness\n\nAh yes, when Russia nuked the world....oh wait.\n\n>especially Georgia where US \"trainers\" helped push them into actually invading Russia.\n\nAnd where Russia nuked the world....oh, nope.\n\n>I'd argue Georgia is what put them on edge and to be more proactive when NATO/USA pushed into Ukraine, although they did wait several years before reacting then.

There is literally zero chance at nuclear bombs being sent off offensively.  There were much crazier people before Putin and they didn't push the button.  These people arent suicidal, and the people that work for them aren't either.",

What you're saying is that they're going to launch nukes when not a single person has stepped foot on their soil.  The same argument was made during the cold war, and look, no nukes!\n\n>Government attracts the kind of people that have more ego than good sense.\n\nIndeed.  But governments don't launch nukes.  People do.  The order was received to launch nukes more than once during the cold war in error, and the commanders in charge refused.  The people in Russia are already against this war, their military is against this war, and you think that without a single soldier in their land those same people are going to launch nukes?  Come on man.\n\n>We've come extremely close before. More than once.\n\nNo, we really haven't.\n\n>While \"those\" people may not be suicidal, you have done a decent job of convincing me that you are suicidal, considering that you're denying this significant and obvious risk.\n\nNo, I'm denying your delusions and lack of historical literacy.",

I don't see how the destruction of the world can not be seen as the biggest risk of all.  I don't think NATO should be playing this game.

Nevermind all of the other USAID/state dept coups/lawfare regimes that have destabilized the world over the last 50 years, keeping everything on the edge of chaos throughout our entire lives.\n\nIt's probably worth noting that less than a decade after the USSR fell, the US was in talks with Russia about joining NATO. Clinton then bent the knee to all of the cold war holdovers at the CIA and state dept, and told Russia to get fucked. Those cold war holdovers will never let their rivalry with Russia go (I'm sure there are plenty of holdovers in Russia that view the US just the same). \n\nIt's wild how people can simultaneously recognize all of the communist regimes that were toppled by the CIA/state dept/USAID all these years, and then ignore the ones they want to blindly support - even when they happen here at home. The hallmarks are all the same, but apparently the political theater team sports agenda is too deeply engrained for some people to admit it.\n\nI'll never understand how some people can complain about the US being the police of the world, and then complain when there are active steps being taken to reduce that influence. Aggressive NATO expansion is what got the eastern bloc to where it is. Biden let the cat out of the bag two years ago when he said \"regime change in Russia is the goal.\" The US hates any country and leader that doesn't bend the knee to the IMF, USAID, NATO, and all of the *other* unelected self-appointed globocuck agencies - and makes it their goal to remove them from power.\n\nAt some point this shit has to stop.

This man is referencing anti-ballistic missile systems in Poland and Romania and then references how Putin made a false comparison that this is similar to missile systems in Canada and Mexico.  Anti-ballistic missile systems destroy missiles while missile systems do much worse... This is a false equivalency made by Putin (Thank you for forcing me to listen to this again.  The word play is disingenuous from this paid Russian actor.  I don't even care who this man is, he's clearly being paid in Rubles)\n\n> You really do sound like Lindsey Graham.

Yeah, there's arguments that democrat administrations tend to act neocon, but you need to understand that there was a reason why the natural gas company Burisma had 3 out of 5 board members be American (And one of them was Hunter Biden)...  Democrats were manually driving the development of Ukraine's fuel industry, because they couldn't be trusted to do it themselves.  They were going to be victims to being gobbled up like a pacman pellet unless we stepped in.  This will be the most necon position I will ever say in my life.  Russia fucking genocided them less than 100 years ago.  If you wave an alternative team at them, they'll salivate and take the chance immediately (especially against a country that seized one of the most expensive pieces of land on the planet due to the natural gas and oil, Crimea)\n\nUkraine is the abused wife of Russia.  If you saw an abused wife not seek help, would you offer it?  ( sorry if this sounds unhinged lol)",

I think often we see an abused wife go and seek other abusive relationships after leaving the original one because they are now so fucked in the head.\n\nI think we're getting too meta, though.  The fact remains that Ukraine was (is?) deep into a civil war with an eastern section (like Crimea) that didn't want to be a part of the same country as the western half.  From the outside looking in, it appeared to me that American involvement aggravated that side of this as well as the Russians. Referring to Ukraine as a singular entity doesn't seem particularly honest either.",

There's just one problem:  Most Ukrainian infighting, Crimea land grabbing and civil war (2014) happened after 2011:  https://www.reuters.com/article/business/ukraine-signs-shale-gas-deal-with-exxonmobil-idUSL5E7KU0UP/\n\n> Referring to Ukraine as a singular entity doesn't seem particularly honest either.\n\nThey're a people who were invaded by Russia and fought back.  What ever resistance exists in the Donbas region was likely installed by Russian intelligence agencies due to the value of eastern Ukraine being realized. \n\n Russia gave Crimea away to Ukraine in 1954.  I've heard some people make the argument \"Hey Russia had so many of their citizens in Crimea at the time so it was practically Russian\".  Can the US do that to Canada or Mexico?  Tijuana is a spectacle for US tourists.  We can seize it.",
