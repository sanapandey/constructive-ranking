To reiterate, yes, Hitler consolidated power by dismantling parts of the government and putting it under his control. The point in the comparison was not 'Trump did this, Hitler also did this, therefore Trump is Hitler,' or even to say that it's the same situation or that they're alike, it was to simply make the point that just because some parts of the government are being dismantled, doesn't mean that it can't be fascist or authoritarian.\n\nTrump and Elon are bulldozing through many checks and balances, firing the people who's jobs are to maintain it, or replacing them with their own people. Some of the agencies that Elon is going after regulate his businesses or have him under investigation. Elon's repeated intention for DOGE has been deregulation, which would obviously benefit him. I mean, all of DOGE's employees who are supposed to be doing the auditing are literally SpaceX workers.\n\nThen there's also stuff like Schedule F, an executive order aimed at converting tens of thousands of merit-based civil service positions into at-will appointments. This change would allow political appointees to dismiss these employees and replace them with individuals aligned with the administration's agenda. Something that DOGE was created to help with. The admin has even given financial incentives to federal employees to encourage them to quit, and issued another order forcing all employees to return back to in-person office work when a lot of them work at home far away, or the offices themselves don't have the space to hold all of those people.\n\nWhether the admin's actions could ultimately be interpreted as 'fascist' or authoritarian, I don't know. I'm just saying it's up for debate (authoritarian, or rather the general notion of the admin consolidating power and gaining it in some way, not fascist, that word is used too lightly), and that there's a nuance that shouldn't be dismissed but is.",

That's the AnCap way.\n\nI only left Trump out, because large scale property developers often owe a large portion of their success to being like early investors in Bitcoin.

I'm not dismissing your viewpoint and are willing to have a discussion with you on it, in fact I'm personally warming up to Libertarianism myself, but so far my experience with you guys has been entirely negative. I thought you guys were the reasonable one's willing to have constructive conversations.\n\n\nSaying, \"everyone interacts with the government, we're all corrupted by the government\" is a simplification that doesn't address my point. As a general statement, your comment is probably right, but when we get into the specifics, a large corporation shoving money into politics, buying out politicians and manipulating laws and regulations in it's favour, is completely different from whatever there would be for an individual citizen, particularly with regards to scale.\n\n\nCorporations aren't \"victims,\" especially the large conglomerates that commit harmful practices or push for laws that hurt people. You can propose getting rid of the government but the original point was that the corporations you listed are all corrupt, which is something you yourself conceded.\n\n\nYou were naming people involved in politics who gained their wealth in a corrupt manner, Trump is one of those people. I don't know why you left him out and named Democrats exclusively. It's obvious you have a heavy bias.\n\n\nI don't have Elon Derangement Syndrome, I was literally just stating facts. You obviously have not done any research on Elon's business history. I'm even willing to admit that Bezos and Zuckerberg earned their wealth, but out of all the billionaires you listed Elon is literally the only one who 100% didn't earn it.\n\n\nThe vast majority of the profit that both of his companies make comes from taxpayer money, not because he created a product and put it on the market and it did well. For specifically Tesla, back in the day the company was in trouble and was about to go under. Elon heard about a government package being given out to companies like Tesla who worked in renewable energy products. In order to get the package he camecuo with a lie. The rest is history.\n\n\nTeslas are trash and are bad for the environment. All that taxpayer money wasted for nothing. The dude literally faked being a pro in path of Exiles, he has the mental capacity of a child and seeks attention. Those are just facts.",
