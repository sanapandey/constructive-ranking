It's possible that this new 501(c) hadn't really done anything yet (hence the $100 rev.) but that it got the contract because of who was involved with the project. And then it's possible that they used the money to actually do what they said they were going to do. I don't know how likely any of that is, but it's possible and I'd like to see it ruled out by following the actual money trail.",

But seems unlikely IMO.  What seems to be happening is that a shxtstorm of this stuff is coming out, outcome of this one might get lost in the shuffle too, we'll see.  And IDK if it's possible to force these people to divulge their books to prove what they did with that money.  Seems what the dems are doing is finding a few plausible sounding answers for a few of these things coming out and are pushing those and just trying to ignore all the ones they do not have plausible answers for.  But I think the more comes out, there more of an uphill battle they have.",
