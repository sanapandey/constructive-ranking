Since I don't plan to visit this pipi-hole of a country any time soon, I can say that freely, but livin' there I would already be in prison, doing my part to fight racism!",

They should extend that same luxury to everyone.\n\nThe real problem isn\u2019t that one group is getting lighter treatment, it\u2019s that the government hands out punishment at all like it's a one-size-fits-all solution. Less government, fewer cages, fewer lives ruined over state-defined crimes.\n\nIf fairness is the concern, the answer isn\u2019t harsher sentences for more people. It\u2019s fewer sentences for everyone.",
