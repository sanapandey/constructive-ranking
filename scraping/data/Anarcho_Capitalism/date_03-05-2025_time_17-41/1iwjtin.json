First I doubt Musk wants to be checking JIRA, he wants you to make it easy for whomever is going to make decisions. And if people do not submit something at all, then they might expect to get cut first.  Also these little things give a quick synopsis to an outsider of what diff departments do in general.   People will typically, even if lying, put some stuff down that they were told at some point they are supposed to be doing but is their job in general important enough to be kept at all?  \n\nAn example is a friend contacted a school oversight department because she felt a local school was breaking the law on what they were teaching (a public school was teaching religion to 2nd graders).  So after much discussion and clarification, the workers at that department agreed the school was breaking the law.  But then the supervisor called saying that her department could not do anything or help in any way beyond that, they said she had to call other resources if she wanted anything to happen, but they could not tell her who to call either.   \n\nSo here we have a govt paid for department of oversight that first of all does not ever go to any schools or review anything on their own as far as we can tell, and if you bring issues to them, they can't actually help you with it other than just agreeing with you or not.  They also will not gather any info on their own or call any teachers or admin or ask any questions, you have to do all that and record it and bring it to them on a silver platter and then  if you do all that forthem, even if you are right, you'll get zero help.  So unless there is something they do that's useful that we don't know about, and those DOGE questions might help clarify that, then it's quite possible that department is an utterly useless waste of money and should be cut. \n\nOf course dems will cry that we are getting rid of 'oversight,' oh the horrors! But some of these govt departments don't realistically even do any of the things their name and title might imply and literally nothing will change if they are gone.  In this case it's possible the govt wanted to claim there was oversight on schools but the schools didn't want it, so the solution was to create an 'oversight' dept that was toothless and useless and flimflam the public with it.  Or maybe those workers were bought off or just too lazy to do their job, but either way, paying for it is a waste of money.",

If he gets a lot done before 2 years that looks really good, then control of house and senate will likely stay.

Especially since some of those workers have been ordered to go on administrative leave.
