Taxation would be theft if the government simply took money from your account without asking.\n\nRobbery is when a person uses force or immediate threats to take an object. Taxation would be robbery if the government showed up with guns and physically took your money on the spot.\n\nExtortion is when you're intimidated into handing over an object. Taxation is extortion when the government demands money under threat of fines, imprisonment, or worse.",
