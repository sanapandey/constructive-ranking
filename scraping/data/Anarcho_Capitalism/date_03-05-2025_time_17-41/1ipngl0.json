This government regulator will set standards for safety which may or may not be sufficient to make that product safe, but as long as you meet these minimum standards you'll pretty much be immune from liability on the safety front.  And hey, who's to say the industry they are regulating can't infiltrate this regulatory body through political donations, getting its own people in charge, or worse.\n\nWhen you promote the idea of a government regulator you are shifting the responsibility of the manufacturer away from its own customers and toward a government organization.

Battery energy storage is still an open problem. Also, we need affordable forms of energy. The EUs renewable push caused the prices to skyrocket. Cleaner, but deterministic generation options would be things like biomass, natural gas, hydro, and nuclear. We also aren't ready to abandon coal because of the huge unprecedented load growth after years of stagnation. \n\nAnd don't worry, shareholder pressure on publicly traded utilities is pushing for a greener energy future.",

A lot of infrastructure isn't worth building without insensitives from the government cause it's so expensive that it would take way too long to see any profits come back from it. I've worked at or with utilities companies pretty much my whole carrier and the only time I've seen a company doing a large expansion or upgrade of infrastructure is when there are government subsidies.\n\nThink of major improvements to infrastructure like credit card debt and maintaining existing infrastructure like bills. If you want to make an upgrade or expansion to your infrastructure you need to take on debt. But the more debt you have the more of your \"paycheck\" (profits) you'll need to put toward paying that off. Additionally you can only take on so much debt before risking going bankrupt. So you need to take on debt, pay the debt off, then repeat all the while making sure your profits keep up with the additional cost of having to maintain more infrastructure.\n\nCan companies do this without government subsidies? Yes, however this causes any improvement to our infrastructure to slow to a crawl and in some causes stops it entirely. Imagine having to wait years for a power company to provide your new construction home with power because the company wanted to wait until there were more occupied homes on the street before it was worth spending all the money on extending the line a few miles. Or just forever having shit internet cause the average person wouldn't be able to afford $2000 a mouth for internet which is what they would need to charge to make up for the cost of building the infrastructure.\n\nThis sort of reasoning falls apart when applied to other things like cancer research too. Like why would a company willing want to cure cancer when they make so much on the treatment? After all a companies job isn't to do what's best for its customers it's to make as many profits for it's share holders as possible. This is where a government that's not supposed to be motivated by profit and instead motivated by what's best for their voters comes in. They'll either force them to research a cure or provide them a good enough insensitive that they want to cure cancer over just treating it.",

Going back to the 1990s it set it's currency peg extremely low, and from then on would not allow it to appreciate, no matter how big it's trading surplus got. So an artificially weak currency is #1.\n2. Through very large grants and cash transfers. The US has begun to do some of that on a much smaller scale with the CHIPS Act for example (bcuz w/o subsidy, you can't get chip manufacturing, sad but true).\n3. Debt forgiveness. This is especially true of state-owned-enterprises, wherein the debt is instead offloaded onto taxpayers.\n4. Low or no-interest loans (much lower than the rates homebuyers have to pay for example). China's banking system is state-controlled, so it chooses credit allocation. The money supply creation in China since 2008 btw, makes the Federal Reserve look libertarian by comparison.\n5. The government refunds the cost of exporters paying VAT when goods enter foreign markets. Once again transfers from taxpayers, from households, to prop up businesses.\n6. Heavy industry enjoy discounted utility rates for water & electricity than the rest of the economy (a convenience shop or a household for example, would pay higher rates).\n\nNot a comprehensive list, but should give you a pretty good primer.",
