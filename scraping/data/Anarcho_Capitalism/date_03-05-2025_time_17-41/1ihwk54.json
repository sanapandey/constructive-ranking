I was 100% above board so it was all good but I was still nervous because I did my own accounting and it was quite complicated because I had moved countries and had to read up on double taxation agreements... Also I had done some freelancing on the side. I'm basically an expert in nomad accounting at this point. I've filed taxes in like 5 different countries.",
