The main one is that it's hard to argue that a more violent society is better in the main than a less violent one, so why not aim to remove violence from our lives and from our institutions?  Also, there's nothing to say that the conclusions you reach are necessary under any possible incentive structures.

I just don\u2019t trust that without regulations and worker protections, companies won\u2019t go back to doing just that. After all, they want to maximize profit. So they\u2019ll sacrifice the health of their workers and customers to do just that. Like cars or buildings are another big example. Say regulations are lifted.

Are there any domains where we don't need oversight? Let's say, do you think kids should be learning how to talk/walk under some regulatory framework? If not, then I would like to see what is common for those \"special\" domains. You can just list them, maybe we find the denominator together.\n\n>I just don\u2019t trust that without regulations and worker protections, companies won\u2019t go back to doing just that.\n\nDo you know anyone running a company who would do that? No person from my network is going to do so. Someone might try, but workers will run away and work for competition, don't you think?\n\n>After all, they want to maximize profit.\n\nIs this general statement for all companies or only for some? I can show you few counterexamples: non-profit organizations, charities, research, investments. I am running one company (employing 20 people) just for fun, I've been in red numbers for 25 years.\n\n>Like cars or buildings are another big example. Say regulations are lifted. So the company builds a janky car or building. But people don\u2019t find out because the cars seatbelt fails or the building collapses.\n\nHonestly, would you buy such a car, if you weren't sure seatbelt is working? Making 50k payment, without finding out such a critical information? Would you like to live in a house which might collapse? Would you be willing to pay let's say 1M USD for such house? Maybe you would, but I think it is clear that people don't want to drive dangerous cars, and live in collapsible buildings.\n\n>I\u2019d be curious what the pure ancap solution is to managing that sort of greed.\n\nFor houses: companies which would specialize in providing certificates. Insurance companies would definitely play big role here as such houses are quite huge expenses.\n\nFor cars: again, certification companies. Healthcare would be heavily involved as similarly to previous example, you pay for expenses of insured people, which will put a lot of incentives to make really sure your clients don't use such cars!\n\nAnd, of course, I cannot predict future (that's why we argue for free market!) and thousands of companies will try different solutions, 95% of them will fail, but those who come up with best solution, they will be most valuable to people in offering best protection in your car or house.",

            "body": "Yep. You've caught us celebrating a significant shift of the Overton Window and government reducing itself.\n\nHere's a breakdown of who you'll find here:\n\n**Autistic AnCaps** who can't stop performing purity tests, rejecting anything or anyone that's less than 100%. These folks are guaranteed to make the perfect the enemy of the good. They are useful sentry bots and sometimes even get into good discussions on the core ideology. But, beware their pathological need to shout down literally every libertarian, capitalist, anarchist, or philosopher you've ever heard of. They will definitely let you know which logical fallacies you accidentallied.\n\n**Libertarians.** Note the L. You know the types. They're natural contrarians, so there's simply no way they could be Democrats or Republicans... even though they definitely align with one of those parties' primary goals. These people like their statism with the woody scent of individualism. They like the style. They just can't engage in second order thought to understand the negative outcomes of their government schemes to violently control and steal from their neighbors.\n\n**Minarchists** who think that they're definitely different from the Libertarians because they have a better understanding of the evils of government... that they think they still need because <insert pet project(s) here>.\n\n**libertarians**. Note the l. These are the same as above but haven't yet heard the misnomer \"minarchist\".\n\n**Confused NeoCons** who have had ***some*** of their bloodlust slaked after 20 years of bullying goat herders and the present threat of war with nuclear states. I think they're only here because we don't ban confused idiots. \n\n**Displaced 2-Partiers** who seem to be on a journey of discovery and may end up becoming AnCaps... if they don't get trapped in a feelings-loop. A classic example of the so-trapped can be seen in the addled mind of Glenn Beck. Be kind to these people and try to explain to them how their feelings and supernatural beliefs don't excuse NAP violations.\n\n**Agorists** who would, once again, like us to remind you to stay away from their homesteads unless you have something to barter. \n\n**Actual Anarcho-Capitalists** who understand the only moral life is centered on voluntary association and non-violence. But, they understand the only path towards such runs through education and slow governmental change. These people sometimes accidentally praise Drumpf when he talks about little things like... closing whole-ass government agencies and literally reducing the size of the government's labor force. Angry morons often think these are Confused Neocons.\n\n**Angry Morons**. Previously mentioned, they're on the prowl for things they're angry about. They often play the role of Autistic AnCap, but only so they can shout down whatever angers them. Their stupidity frequently stops them from thinking through their positions to find paths of efficacy. They're the sort who might go into crippling debt \"because credit ratings are bullshit, man\".\n\n^^/NoTrueScotsman",

You know, good things.\n\n> How much would you wager that the vast majority of the folks who upvoted your post are actual Trumpers?\n\nI have no clue and neither do you. Quit the sophistry.\n\n> You think that it's irrelevant that MAGA/Trumpers/GOP have a strong incentive to imply principles are stupid things only autists would care about?\n\nThere's ideal and there's a path to get there. Autists dismiss the path. Angry morons have a problem with portions of the path. Idiots think that Trump is centered on that path.\n\n> Maybe you aren't a Trump cultists ... I'd wager the vast majority of your upvoters are. My message is for them. Enjoy your \"significant shift\" ... haha.\n\nI'm a pessimistic pragmatist. These aristocrats will never do all of what I want. They don't give a fuck about my principles. I wish they'd just go off into a mansion and fuck one another. But, they go to DC and fuck me. I celebrate when they fuck me less. I complain when they fuck me more. My first principle is not being fucked. After I'm not being fucked, I have room for other principles.\n\nIt'd be really cool if they weren't deporting productive, peaceful people who broke some lame \"rules\". I have no problems with them rounding up people who have committed classic felonies and \"sending them West\"... so long as it's done accurately with due process. I don't think that's happening. But, these same aristocrats tend to mass murder on the regular, so giving them plane rides elsewhere is a big improvement over the usual shit. Gangs who claim territory manage their territory. News at 11. Let me know if you have a way to get them to renounce their territorial claims...\n\nI'm here for 100% voluntary association and everything that entails. Call it whatever. \"Anarcho-Capitalism\" is a bit of a poisoned misnomer at this point. \"Voluntaryism\" has baggage. \"Libertarian\" is a useless term nowadays. People sound like assholes when they say \"Classic Liberal\"... and that never had a fully settled meaning anyhow.\n\nIf something isn't voluntary, then it's aggression and shouldn't happen.",

If moderators can tag people as neocons, trolls, terminal TDS suffers, minarchists, and maybe even Hoppeans versus Rothbardians, people could choose to block those they don't want to interact with.\n\nThis would maximize freedom in terms of freedom of association and freedom to not associate.\n\nRight now moderation is a complete condom-free fuckfest and all you can smell is the VD.

We are fully aware that there will be people that make horrible decisions, and that there will always be freeloaders and grifters. We understand that there will always be people that are poor. We know fully well that there will be people that try to take advantage of others, and those that will choose violence. Never, not one time, have I ever seen an ancap claim none of these things will exist in an ancap society. \n\nPerhaps you would be better off if you actually educated yourself on the subject before you begin to talk about it.",
