    "selftext": "The federal government is spending 7.19 Trillion per year right now. If we cut it back to 5.19 trillion, that would bring us back to\u2026 2020 levels. How is that ok? How is that the stated goal? At that point the spending and debt had exploded to unacceptable level. Two Trillion will barely put a dent into the problem\n\nHere\u2019s the Federal Spending over the years:\n\n1980) 0.524T\n\n1990) 1.157T\n\n2000) 1.735T\n\n2004) 2.176T\n\n2008) 2.823T\n\n2012) 3.595T\n\n2016) 3.750T\n\n2020) 5.603T\n\n2025) 7.118\n\nHere\u2019s the Federal Debt over the years\n\n1980) 0.864T\n\n1990) 2.907T\n\n2000) 5.734T\n\n2004) 7.071T\n\n2008) 9.799T\n\n2012) 14.903T\n\n2016) 19.316T\n\n2020) 25.733T\n\n2025) 36.471T\n\nAnd here\u2019s the total government spending (Federal + State + Local):\n\n1980) 0.844T\n\n1990) 1.927T\n\n2000) 3.132T\n\n2004) 3.961T\n\n2008) 5.444T\n\n2012) 6.161T\n\n2016) 6.699T\n\n2020) 9.281T\n\n2025) 17.786T (!!!)\n\nWe went from spending $3,456 per person is the U.S. in 1980 to spending $50,261 PER PERSON. The government is spending over $200,000 per year for my family of 4. How much value am I getting from that spending? They can buy us a house every year if they wanted to. Want a waste\n\n2T at this point is a drop in the bucket. It\u2019s not fixing anything here. We need major surgery. We need to go back to 2000 levels at least. That\u2019s 3.265T when you adjust for inflation, and which would be an almost 4T cut. And that\u2019s just the federal level. We need another 14.5T cut in total government spending (would be 12T cut after inflation). The states have to do their part. \n\nOn the flip side, anyone saying that cutting 2T will mean the government can\u2019t function\u2026 um, I direct you to 2020. Going back to that isn\u2019t that big a deal. Stop complaining liberals!",

Again I\u2019m sure they could have the same exactly military for a good bit less money, but I don\u2019t think we should be downsizing. Look at how Russia has performed in Ukraine. It\u2019s easy to think you don\u2019t need something and then you do and you wish you would\u2019ve had it. It\u2019s also easy to say we aren\u2019t in a conflict therefore don\u2019t need a military that powerful, but that\u2019s a fallacy because a bit part of the reason we aren\u2019t in a conflict is because our military is so powerful that countries don\u2019t test us. Furthermore, there are huge intangibles like global shipping lanes being secured by the US navy. It\u2019s hard to say how much of a payoff that alone is, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that even that makes the *entire* US military budget a net positive on the economy. There are some things like slowly forcing European countries to deal with their own defence more and more though that I would agree with. You wanna talk all your shit about healthcare and how much better your countries are? Okay, see how that goes when you have to fund your own military and can rely on us. But even that I have conflicting feelings about because again, it\u2019s quite possible that just keeping them afloat so they can focus on technology and commerce rather than military is again a net positive for us.",

This would over time lead to substantial holdings that function to reduce interest costs which are projected to exceed $ 1 T by 2026. This is already happening at a very small scale with a startup. Between wind, gas, and nuclear there is a lot of surplus energy (at night) that can be turned into Bitcoin for basically zero energy cost. This would also stabilize the chips race that is largely dominated by Chinese production if a domestic producer such as TSMC can manufacture locally. Cutting spending isn\u2019t enough given the substantial cost of carrying the current debt load and the multiple levels of protracted legal and geopolitical chaos that dismantling USAID and other institutions could lead to. Theas are potentially Pyrrhic victories that may or may not survive the current administration. Implementing Bitcoin mining could be a game changer but you\u2019d have to game out how it affects currency and treasury markets to avoid widespread monetary instability. You could also combine this with some of the other methods of \u201crefinancing\u201d current debt.

In fact, they have special contracts with energy companies, and are paying to get grids reenforced. Bitcoin mining in the private sector is going to revolutionize the energy industry. I don\u2019t believe that government mining would do the same. By definition, government operations are not efficient or innovative\n\nI think between tariffs, deportations, tax cuts, and regulation cuts, the economy will turn just in time for the midterms. That\u2019s why he\u2019s going at such a pace. Strict deadline now less than 90 weeks away\n\nAnd the economy needs to be fixed before interest rates can be lowered. Once lowered, housing become affordable, business start expanding and hiring again, and the debt can be refinanced to cut that 1T in debt service. So realistically you need an economic rebound within a year so that you have time to cut rates and let that take effect too. All before the midterms. Not a lot of time at all.\n\nWith that said, losing the house would not be a big deal. So long as the big things are passed before the midterms, you\u2019re good. You won\u2019t lose the senate, so you just pause the legislation and keep doing work through the executive branch in the last two years, like he is right now. Regardless, I think no matter what it would be difficult to lose the house with how unpopular the dems are rn. Especially if election reform is passed and fraud will be harder (and they lose their shady financing lol)",
