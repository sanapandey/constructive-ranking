                    "body": "In case anyone is bored and would like to critique what I wrote, it is a response to someone saying something about how they assume opposition to the Marshall Plan based on current foreign policy shifts:\n\n>Good because the Marshall Plan did nothing other than create a myth.\n\n>After the war ended, Harry Truman\u2019s popularity in the polls began to plummet, as did the prestige of government generally. The American people had made huge sacrifices to fight the war and now wanted curbs in government, which had been administering a centrally planned economy. Most of all, they wanted the foreign policy recommended by George Washington and Thomas Jefferson: trade with all, entanglements with none.\n\n>In the mainstream of thinking was Republican Senator Robert Taft, a hero of all free-market activists at the time. He demanded tax cuts, spending cuts, and an end to \u201cconstantly increasing interference with family life and with business by autocratic government bureaus and autocratic labor leaders.\u201d The Republican party swept midterm elections in 1946, taking back the Congress on a hard-core, anti-big government platform.\n\n>Truman had to do something big and he knew it. As Charles Mee reports, he needed \u201csome large program that would let him recapture the initiative, something big enough to enable him to gather in all the traditional factions of the Democratic Party and also some middle-of-the-road Republicans, and at the same time, something that would hamper the Republican phalanx,\u201d and establish him as a world leader.\n\n>The issue was right before him: foreign aid, funneled through the corporate establishment and cloaked in the rhetoric of opposition to foreign communism. Cynically, he would make good use of Russia, which only the day before had been our gallant ally in the war, and transform it into a monster that had to be destroyed. By stealing the Republican\u2019s anti-socialist rhetoric, Truman hoped to frazzle his opponents and make himself a hero on the world stage.\n\n>A little-known business group, founded in 1942 and called the Committee for Economic Development, was elevated into a think tank for a new international order\u2014the economic counterpart to the Council on Foreign Relations. The Committee\u2019s founders were the heads of the top steel, automotive, and electric industries who had benefited from the New Deal\u2019s corporatist statism. Its membership overlapped with the farther left National Planning Association, which was unabashedly national socialist in ideological orientation.\n\n>These groups understood that they owed their profit margins to government subsidies provided by the New Deal and wartime production subsidies. Faced with post-war peace, they feared a future in which they would be forced to compete on a free-market basis. Their personal and institutional security was at stake, so they got busy dreaming up strategies to sustain a profitable statism in a peacetime economy.\n\n>Corporate economic interests, then, overlapped with Truman\u2019s political interests, and an unholy alliance between business and government was born. They would use Europe\u2019s miseries to line their own pockets in the name of \u201crebuilding\u201d and providing \u201csecurity\u201d against trumped-up threats to American security.\n\n>Taking a leaf from the Roosevelt playbook, Truman bypassed the usual bureaucracy and established a new bureau\u2014the Economic Cooperative Administration\u2014to distribute the aid. It too was staffed by the heads of major industrial-corporate interests who stood to benefit at public expense. Paul Hoffman headed the group and passed out billions to well-heeled corporate powers. As historian Anthony Carew summarizes, the Marshall Plan \u201cwas in all major respects a business organization run by businessmen.\u201d (Hoffman later became head of the far-left Ford Foundation.)\n\n>Most of all, the aid was used for purchases at distorted prices by American tax dollars in the hands of European governments. The mad scramble for tax dollars was a disgrace to behold, creating a low point in U.S. business history. Time and again, Congress intervened to grant corporate America what it really wanted: restrictions that forced Marshall aid to go to purchases of American oil, aluminum, wood, textiles, and machines.\n\n>The aid was also used to directly subsidize particular firms in recipient countries, whether or not there were viable markets for their products. Instead, the firms received money because their continued existence would artificially support \u201cfull employment\u201d policies. And since American labor union groups were intimately involved in choosing who got the money, the lion\u2019s share went to companies with closed union shops, paradoxically restricting the ability of labor markets to readjust to new economic realities.\n\n>The result was the largest peacetime transfer of wealth from the taxpayers to corporations until that point in U.S. history.\n\n>A year after the Marshall Plan began sucking private capital out of the economy, the U.S. fell into recession, precisely the opposite of what its proponents predicted. Meanwhile, the aid did not help Europe. What reconstructed Europe was the post-Marshall freeing up of controlled prices, keeping inflation in check, and curbing union power\u2014that is, the free market. As even Hoffman admitted in his memoir, the aid did not in fact help the economies of Europe. The primary benefit was \u201cpsychological.\u201d Expensive therapy, indeed.\n\n>The actual legacy of the Marshall Plan was a vast expansion of government at home, the beginnings of the Cold War rhetoric that would sustain the welfare-warfare state for 40 years, a permanent global troop presence, and an entire business class on the take from Washington. It also created a belief on the part of the ruling elite in D.C. that it could trick the public into backing anything, including the idea that government and its connected interest groups should run the world at taxpayer expense.\n\n>And I bet you think government is supposed to be against corporations, not the instrument of their enrichment. Yet that is what happens every time the government intervenes in the economy.",

                            "body": "And followed up with this:\n\n>I just provided you with the \u201ctest\u201d.\n\n>The control element of destroyed nations that received no aid, and the nations that received substantially greater aid and compared them to the most significant Marshall Plan recipient, W. Germany.\n\n>The Marshall Plan fails the test.\n\n>But lets us look at more examples. Britain received twice as much aid as West Germany did, but economic growth in Britain dramatically lagged behind that of the Germans.\n\n>France, W. Germany, and Italy began their economic recoveries before they started getting Marshall Aid.\n\n>Austria and Greece received a lot of Marshall Aid, per capita, and yet their economic recovery only got under way as Marshall aid was being phased out.\n\n>Given that the UK received more Marshall Plan aid than West Germany, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that government grew more in the UK. The way the Marshall Plan was set up, for every dollar that you got in Marshall plan assistance, the government of the recipient country had to increase government expenditures by one dollar.\n\n>That is, the Marshall Plan mandated that governments grow in relation to a country\u2019s GDP as a condition of receiving aid.\n\n>But, when it comes to real economic recovery, the same principles applied in Europe as applied in the United States. Where we saw large amounts of economic growth after the war, in the United States, for instance, growth was connected to large declines in government spending and the repeal of many government controls from the war years.\n\n>There is, however, another component of the Marshall plan, and that is, as Hal Brands contends today, the necessity of \u201cthe deft use of economic tools for geopolitical gain.\u201d That is, the Marshall plan should be seen less as a tool of economic policy, and more as a tool of foreign and geopolitical strategy.\n\n>In this respect then, the idea of the Marshall Plan is really to buy loyalty from foreign regimes and to execute public relations upon foreign populations. But there\u2019s a problem here too. Given that the Marshall Plan didn\u2019t actually improve the European economy and given that the plan required the additional fleecing of the American taxpayer why not implement a plan to actually helps to both build goodwill and improve economic growth at the same time?\n\n>This, of course, could have been achieved by the adoption of unilateral free trade on the part of the Americans. While it\u2019s true that the Marshall Plan was part of a strategy to increase trade among European states, and trade in general, the tools used were the same that we see today: managed trade deals controlled by states and built upon an edifice of international bureaucracy. By necessity, plans like this always involved central planning to the extent that government planners pick winners and losers by designing trade agreements.\n\n>Unilateral free trade, however, offered, and still offers, a true laissez-faire solution. Imagine moreover, how the post-war world offered an excellent opportunity in this regard. The Japanese and European economies had been temporarily destroyed by the war. The US, meanwhile, was in an excellent position to offer, through markets, both capital and American consumers to the globe. Faced with free and open access to American markets, and with American firms prepared to invest capital overseas, the US had the chance to build greater cultural and economic ties with its former enemies and longtime allies in both Europe and Asia. The US need not even ask these foreign regimes to reciprocate. Opening up American markets to these foreign regimes would have made sense both geopolitically and economically. It would have offered American consumers access to less expensive goods, while also building new trade opportunity for foreign entrepreneurs. No redistribution schemes were necessary. All that was needed was for the US regime to embrace true, free, and open trade.\n\n>Politically speaking, this might even have been an easier sell than usual. Most industrialized foreign economies had been destroyed in the war, and the US was in a position to dominate the global economy. Was it really necessary to protect American markets anymore? The answer is always no, of course, but the case could have possible been made more forcefully at that time than ever before.\n\n>Unfortunately, that\u2019s not what happened. Guided by bad economics, and bad ideologies, the US was simply not prepared to embrace true free trade or free economies of any kind. The chosen path was one that afforded governments the chance to continue to control and direct markets, and to decide who gets what and when. That\u2019s always been a pretty hard deal for governments to give up.",
