I'm speaking for myself, and many other farmers I know that have farmed for decades without any government assistance, or insurance of any kind.

You can look up all the statistics you want, but I am living this experience and have done so for 30+ years and have met hundreds, maybe more, of farmers that live and operate their farms exactly the way I do.

            "body": "Small farms don't really have a problem, it's when you want to grow in scale that there are issues.\n\nThe biggest issue is soil health.  Without proper crop rotation and letting the soil rest, you can rapidly deplete any nutrients in the soil and end up with a bunch of dust.  The issue is, if you're at the break even point and need to not grow anything, you are in the red for a season or two, so the government offers subsidies to prevent this.\n\nThe second issue is that the crops we need as a society to eat don't always make the most cash or even enough cash to break even, so once again the government steps in to help.\n\nThe third issue is that, through no fault of the farmer, crops can fail and leave you with nothing.  Disease, pests, bad weather, not enough rain, too much rain, rot, fire, etc.  You can't just let the farmer go bankrupt because we as a society need to eat, so the government gives them a helping hand.\n\nFourth is getting outcompeted by mega corporations.  Say Monsanto wants to come in and buy up all your land to grow soy beans.  They can use their massive amounts of money to basically undercut any profits you make while only taking a slight loss, drive you out of business, and force you to sell your land either to the bank or to them.\n\nFifth is that you are constantly being forced to compete with people on the other side of the world instead of just other local farmers.  Faster, reliable transportation, refrigeration, extremely low cost labor in the third world, etc. all drive the prices of food, and therefore your crops, down.  Sometimes this reaches a point where you can no longer afford to continue farming.\n\nSixth is the cost of equipment.  It can cost nearly a quarter of a million just to put new tires on some farm tractors.  You still need to buy or rent the tractor, the plow, the drill, and about a dozen other incredibly expensive pieces of equipment, and keep them serviced and up to code.\n\nAnd a final big one that I can think of off the top of my head is government regulations.  The show Clarkson's farm is a perfect example of this and has actually turned the star of the show, once oblivious about the hardships faced by farmers at the hand of the government, into a voice for them at various events and protests in the UK.",
