                            "body": "Interesting, so the reason why liberals hate the tax cut is because it increased taxes on liberal states by reducing SALT deductions. That's one of the primary panty twists liberals got in because the tax reduction punished blue states that allowed the wealthy to make massive SALT deductions against their federal tax to fund all their progressive pet projects. \n\nI disagreed with the CARES act at the time and still do it was stupid. However, it was a bipartisan bill passed near-unanimous in the house and passed 96-0 in the Senate. While Trump signed it this was a bipartisan stupid that lead to the massive inflation during the Biden years. \n\nNow Trump is making substantive cuts to government and people are upset. However, it is needed we are running massive deficits, the debt-GDP is over 100%, and the policies during the last 4 year made things worse and then lied to our face about. The unemployment numbers are revised down 6 months after they are releases so they previous administration would get the headline and then correct the numbers when no one was paying attention. Inflation was manipulated to exclude items people actually buy because it made the year over year numbers look worse and its why Democrats lost in 2024. People's actual perception of the economy was different than the press releases put out by the government. \n\nLove him or hate him, before COVID the economy under Trump was doing well and real wages were up. The CARES act money printing wiped out all those gains, then the Infrastructure bill and Inflation Reduction Act ensured the economy would stagnate for normal people. Yeah the stock market is up (until you adjust for inflation and then the gains are not that great) and GDP grew but normal people felt none of that. You go to the super market and spend 100 bucks on one bag of food. Wages have not kept up with inflation and most people, if they stayed at their job, are making less than they did in 2020 adjusted for inflation. Inflation is starting to ramp up again because generally the effects of legislation on inflation lags 12-24 months so we should start seeing the inflationary impacts of Biden's infrastructure bill and injecting more debt into an over charged system. \n\nWhere I disagree with Trump is that he wants to lower interest rates. That is going to lead to more inflation as money is cheap it will increase the supply meaning more dollars chasing fewer goods. They are betting that economic growth will out pace inflation but I don't agree and fear we will see more inflation. \n\nWhat we need are tax cuts and spending cuts with increased interest rates. It will cause a recession for 6-18 months but it will burn out all the over leveraged businesses that are dragging the economy down and in the end create sustainable growth while reducing inflation. These businesses made bad bets and over leveraged themselves let them and their share holders pay the price.",

Alright, it's because lot of people and businesses coundn't work during Covid lockdowns so we had to support them. If people with jobs are blocked from working, somebody has to support them and that's federal government here. One can imagine increased spending being needed with natural catastrophes or active wars, it's not that unusual.\n\n\n\nHowever, after covid ended, there was no need to increase spending compared to pre-covid levels, and that increased spending also increased inflation. Even though the bill was named \"inflation reduction bill\", everyone said it was going to increase it and we're still having higher inflation rate than wanted, even with high interest rates that are taxing people and economy.\n\n\nThat's why not.",
