You need reconciliation to cut taxes so something needs to go\n\nAlso as a side note: I suspect that the reason republicans are raising the debt ceiling and reportedly planning a 4T deficit is because that\u2019s only on paper. Cut taxes for business and there\u2019s less revenue, right? But wait, that means business expand. They sell more because people can afford more. We get more foreign investment for factories etc. All the tax revenue is currently not included, so on paper there\u2019s a deficit. But in reality, we\u2019ll collect a ton more money than expected\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong. Maybe it\u2019s cope. And it\u2019s not like I want the state to collect more money. I want to just cut all spending and all the BS entitlements. But when literally half the country is living on the government\u2019s teat (direct and indirect employees, private companies with government contracts, NGO and \u201cnonprofits,\u201d welfare including social security) you can\u2019t cut it off cold turkey. It\u2019s too much of a shock to the system. You have to cut systematically and grow quickly to make up for it\n\nWe need 50M private sector jobs to make up for the full cuts. Real jobs, not the fake shit the government funds today. Can\u2019t create that all at once, but you can do pro business policies and cut as you grow",
