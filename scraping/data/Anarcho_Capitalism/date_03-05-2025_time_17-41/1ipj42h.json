Also Milei never cut out aid to the poor, in fact my understanding is he increased it a bit as he felt that the transition peroid might be rough and he wanted to help people with that. So he didn't cut the safety net and he STILL got all this shxt done, that's so so underappreciated and just goes to show what a total clusterfxck we are in. We've been sold a pack of lies about what is possible and what causes what which is infuriating but it's still good to know that the sad storyline they tell us is not actually true, we don't need to be stuck with the curent situation/",
