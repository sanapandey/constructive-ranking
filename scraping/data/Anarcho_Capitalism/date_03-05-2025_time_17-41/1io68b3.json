    "selftext": "It really doesn't make much sense. I can't think of a single justification that because someone has a majority share in a high market cap company, that they are somehow evil. I can't understand any of their logic behind this. Do they wish that all the modern conviences these individuals were involved in didn't exist or something?\n\n\nIt's just so confusing. Normal leftists brain rot makes sense if you just are unable to perform multi-step thinking which I'm assuming is a decent amount of the population. But in reality, it just seems like their own greed, the same thing they accuse billionaires of having, is the reason they covet the money of others who put in the work and got incredibly lucky. Maybe it's that they can't understand that life is simply inherently unfair. ",

I think the left hates them for the same overall reason, they just have different caveats, like they don't pay workers enough and pollute, cutting corners that would be less of an issue in a free market with more competition. They seem to think the solution is the make the market less free.",

More competition means more options for labor, but less market power for capitalists. \n\nNot having accountability for polluting shifts the cost of keeping the environment clean onto someone else.  Often requiring fiscal austerity (less freedom) in the aftermath than costs associated with prevention.\n\nAssociating environmental issues (like climate change) with the left is conservative propaganda. No one wants to drink contaminated water. \n\nBoth liberals and conservatives subscribe to free market capitalism. Everyone knows life isn\u2019t fair, but billionaires can gamble like drunken sailors, bankrupt the world economy AND get bailed out by the state.\n\nMaybe leftists hate billionaires because they make better socialists.  Billionaires make markets less free through consolidation, market power, and rent seeking.  They have no issues taking (freedoms) from others, but want to be free to do whatever they like.",

They say things like \"billionaires should not exist\", but give guys like Soros a pass because their politics is their penance.  Because he's part of their \"congregation\", they'd give Soros a pass even for outright fraud and corruption.\n\nContrast this to libertarians, we hold wealth to be morally neutral, and most of us hold even political affiliation to be morally neutral.  It's all about how you behave, not who you are or what you believe.  \n\nLeft-wingers especially hated the Koch brothers for being \"sinners\" (because they're rich) *and* refusing to repent for it by accepting leftist ideology, espousing libertarianism instead.  But if the Koch brothers had been proven to be engaging in fraud or corruption, you can bet libertarians would have been the first to call them out.",

Tariffs don't help any group except the government itself, and possibly a special interest (such as a car manufacturer) in the short term. If tariffs made a country better off by promoting local production, then surely no trade at all would lead to the most benefit. If foreign companies hurt our market by giving cheap goods and \"destroying\" our production, then surely the harm would be even worse if they gave us those products for free, instead of just for cheap.  \n  \nAny Pro-Tariff logic fails because it doesn't properly consider the counter factual. If American companies/workers stop producing cars, paper, and microchips, what will they do instead? If you lose your job, do you just stop working forever? No, you get a different job. You look for a job that gives you the best income possible given your skills, resources, and access to opportunities. If someone stops working at an American car factory for $45/hr, maybe they start working for Boeing instead making airplanes for $40-$50/hr instead. Or maybe they move into sales or project management instead. The thing that they do instead will produce more value for society than the cost of the product we started importing instead. So the car we buy is cheaper, and now we have another airplane (or whatever). So the net wealth of our society increased.  \n  \nWhatever happens, society as a whole (and the individuals in the long term) benefit if the trade happens naturally. Americans stop working in jobs where other countries have a comparative advantage, and they work in a field with their own comparative advantage instead.  \n  \nIt doesn't even matter if you are the better at producing cars than the foreign company. Even if you are literally the best plumber in the world, that doesn't mean you should be a plumber if you can make more money as an electrician instead (assuming that you would enjoy that work, of course). And even if you are a great electrician, that doesn't mean you'd make more money doing that if you were also a great entrepreneur. And so on and so forth.  \n  \nTariffs are bad because they distort costs and discourage people from doing things that are comparably more valuable. Trade is good. Trade increases wealth.",

Money flows to bank & government cronies.  \n\nThey in turn buy up all the valuable assets pushing up the price super high.  An asset that would have returned 15-20% is now only returning 3-6%.  Normal people cannot afford these assets (mostly real estate) and even if they can they are barely beating inflation making real wealth growth impossible. \n\nThe ownership class and currency controllers have access to *free* currency. This means that they can access highly leveraged loans structurally cheaper than \u2018normal\u2019 people\u2019s.  Buying a 5% return asset leveraged 5/1 at only a 3% interest rate means this favored group can make 13% return on their 20% down payment. Leveraged 10/1 they can make 23% return.  When they use the deposits of bank account owners they can make even more without risking their own assets.\n\nYou get the idea. Being the middle man in a fake currency environment creates a structural advantage for currency controllers and existing wealthy owners they extend this privilege to. \n\nIn the case of a large successful publicly listed corporation no the founder with 10% equity is not really the problem. It\u2019s the equity interests along the way that own or flipped the other 90% is the problem.  For every legitimate entrepreneurial $1 of profit rightfully earned there is $9 more of profit reaped by people who control the financial system. That $1 of entrepreneurial profit is not a feature of our system it\u2019s a much diluted consolation prize reluctantly awarded to the people who actually drive innovation and the economy.  \n\nSo (some) leftists don\u2019t actually hate what you think of as capitalism or billionaires, they hate owners of the system who secretly put their thumb on scale whenever real money is at stake.  \n\nTo put it another way our economy is a rigged casino and a \u2018capitalist\u2019 sympathizer of our current system is only observing the legitimate portion and not watching the cash leaving out the back.",

This is the Nanny State view of the world, where noble Government Guns and very high taxes are the only thing stopping the rich from increasing their pie slices by such despicable acts as saving and investing in creating jobs and businesses, and if only we put enough government boots on their throats, We The People could all just spend the billionaires money living better for today, and that will boost the economy, and make everyone better off, because nothing makes insanely great things and employs more people better than taking all the money away from our best entrepreneurs. \n\nSo if you want to take some people's stuff and give it to others, and this actually has happened many times in history, most of which are in retrospect seen as bad, you really don't want to visibly go full Seig Heil, you need to vilify the other, to justify the normally evil act of taking other people's stuff and giving it to your friends. Back in the day you could just call the rich Evil Greedy Jews, but that religious hate doesn't fly in polite circles after WW 2, so the new narrative is to blame the money itself as evil, kind of like the Monkey's Paw, or poison. A little wealth in someone's hands is good, but once it crosses a certain level, and the left has settled on 1 Billion, probably because most lefty politicians like Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi have SO MUCH MORE than 1 million, but because the number of billionaires is small enough that its easier to dehumanize them.\n\nThis is the Statist justification for a system with heavy taxes, its all about people paying their Fair Share. I've talked with many leftists, including my sister, that the government taking all this 'excess' money from the rich IS the primary purpose of government ! The fact that we have protection and laws is only an incidental effect of the goal of creating a fair world. Its hard to imagine that people think government having huge powers to take and spend our money is a good thing, but they do, which is how we got from a mostly libertarian founding to the massive Nanny State we have today.",

I hate the Tucker Carlsons and Al Gores.\n\nI hate a system that allows the wealth from one successful person to persist and accumulate and concentrate for his progeny, for generations, for dynasties, though that progeny might be completely without merit, with the only stop on that being that by the time we get to the grandchildren the family maybe becomes average, stupid & disfunctional, and ends up pissing it away. (Yes, I\u2019m looking at you Eric Trump). \n\nOur system taxes paychecks, income. For the most part it does not tax wealth (with a few exceptions like property taxes). Federal & state inheritance taxes are low. Gains from the stock market are untaxed until they are realized, muni bonds are never taxed at all (that\u2019s where Theresa Heinz, heiress to the Heinz ketchup fortune, keeps her stash, she doesn\u2019t pay a penny of taxes on it).\n\nThe working man is taxed; the rich man is largely untaxed, and he and his entire family tree can live off investment returns forever if they have any financial clue. \n\nI find that to be deeply unfair, that\u2019s the bit I hate.\n\nI hate that they can run for Congress as a hobby. I never had the spare time or money for that. \n\nI think by the time we\u2019re looking at the great-grandchildren, if nobody has a job, they should have been taxed down to 10%ers rather than still being 1%ers.",

They often influence elections and state officials to rig the game to their advantage (e.g. Elon Musk, or the oligarchy in Russia), sometimes they become one with the state and everyone else but them is fucked, as there is no equity and no free market either. \n\n2. The left points out the inequality in the distribution of resources. The left usually bases their worldview on empathy, they don't see a point of anyone having that much wealth while millions are starving or are crushed by medical debt. Some leftist don't oppose the very idea of a billionaire if everyone else has a chance at their best life and their needs are covered, but it just seems that this is simply not possible.\n\n3. Billionaires are extremely wasteful with their yachts and private planes, while the rest of the world has to suck up their pollution\n\n4. The left sees capitalism as an exploitative system, therefore billionaires by default exploit a lot of people to get to where they are, in many cases, they literally step over corpses to get where they are. Some are also unnecessarily cruel (like Jeff Bezos, where the Amazon workers face a lot of abuse, and have to pee in bottles).",

I think it's easier to point fingers to \"capitalism\" when you believe that a heavily regulated market with fractional reserve banking and fiat rather than sound currency is capitalism. It is not, it's a form of corporatism enabled by the monopoly of power the state has. If you can lobby regulators to create regulations, you can influence the market in your favor. I think a good way to think about this would be imagine you are playing pinball. You should just have the 2 paddles to keep the ball moving. But having regulations is like picking up and tilting the machine so you get a high score. \n\nThis is to say, alot of y'all's talking points, if you changed the wording slightly are fairly similar to ours. However, we do believe that since regulations and market control got us where we are at, that the solution is a freer market where anyone can start a business without the burdens of licensure, zoning, and taxes creating competition. Our issues stem, in our view, from an anticompetitive market. The solution isn't to make the market less competitive through centralized authority which can always fail, but rather make it more competitive.",

I also doubting the \"trickle down\" theory, with how much wealth is concentrated around very few individuals, i doubt that they produce as much prosperity as they could, the wealth primarily gives prosperity the already wealthy, it doesnt reflect anything on the society as a whole. And if there is potential for poverty to be reduced, but its not because of wealth greed, I dont think thats a good thing.

They are the true welfare kings and queens, often receiving faaaaar more in gov subsidies, handouts, bailouts, special deals, and tax breaks. They underpay armies of people, many of which are struggling to make ends meet due to the exploitation, to do everything for them since they typically can't do anything themselves like normal people. On top of this many of them are extremely totalitarian to the point of being fascist dictators with respect to their companies or the globe via the entire governments they can buy out with campaign funding. In this sense they're similar to the kings of old who had immense wealth and power, but it was all based on the luck of being born into the right family within a feudal system. The other ppint to make is that leftists are generally egalitarian in the sense that we want to improve lives of the people at the bottom of society or at least the middle more than making ultra rich even richer whereas our economy is designed to funnel money upward in basically every single way except for a handful of social programs and organizations. If we had some rules that basically said: once you reach 1 billion then every dollar after that is taxed 99.99% or some sort of asymptotic tax system, it's easy to see the billionaires would still be basically just as rich and powerful, but that money could actually be used to improve millions if not billions of lives. This is why many leftists including myself believe billionaires basically shouldn't exist in a good society",
