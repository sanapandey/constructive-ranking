I think giving presidents full credit/blame for budget issues doesn't paint a full picture, though.\n\nClinton balanced the budget when he had a cooperative Republican Congress. Trump ran up a big deficit when Democrat governors shut down the economy and Congress started spending like drunken sailors.\n\nBoth were horrible on monetary issues.\n\nI'd say Clinton was slightly worse on foreign military intervention, but they're both better than Bush/Bush/Obama/Biden.\n\nIMO it's close between Clinton and Trump, but I'd give Trump the nod, especially after what he's done the past two weeks.",
