But that\u2019s beside the point.\n\nYou benefit from engaging in a capitalistic fashion every time you decide what do to with your finite resources, such as buying groceries from the store, raw milk directly from a local farmer or a beer at the pub. Michael Malice\u2019s and Tom Woods\u2019 short video \u201c[The Politically Incorrect Guide to Modern Capitalism](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yq8F2dF9KUw&pp=ygU0VGhlIFBvbGl0aWNhbGx5IEluY29ycmVjdCBHdWlkZSB0byBNb2Rlcm4gQ2FwaXRhbGlzbQ%3D%3D).\u201d\n\nHow did this system become so centralized that now the very fate of 330+ million people is largely dependent upon the election (or not) of a single ruler? The truth is that 230+ years of voting is how we got here. If real change is desired, then it must be realized that the winner of EVERY election is government. The incentives of government ensure never-ending growth and centralization, like a parasite. This is how the status quo is maintained by ruling so-called \u201celites.\u201d\n\nThe powers that be hate the idea of a decentralized society that organizes organically from the bottom up through voluntary cooperation within a framework of private property rights (aka capitalism) because such a system is dynamic, ever-changing and wholly responsive to average people and fosters prosperity, peace and a sense of community. The eugenicists and depopulationists in power prefer a centralized society organized from the top-down through force which fosters division, impoverishes the masses and leads to wars among the deadliest gangs in the world called \u201cgovernments,\u201d all because it\u2019s far easier to control average people that way.\n\nThose that desire change need to come to terms with a handful of uncomfortable truths if our predicament is ever going to improve:\n\n1. [We can\u2019t vote our way to freedom](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n8ETV2MzHuY). We can rage against the machine by voting for the machine in a machine made by the machine.\n\n2. Despite it being better than other forms of government, it\u2019s obvious that [democracy inevitably leads to tyranny](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qrl8YorTa1U).\n\n3. Society can be organized one of [two ways; through forced participation or voluntary cooperation; through tyranny or freedom; through collectivism (fascism, socialism, communism, corporatism, etc.) or individualism](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kURsX5fq3CM).\n\n4. [Decentralization, smaller polities and localism is the only solution](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m_hWr834h4M&t=13s&pp=ygUhYWNhZGVteSBvZiBpZGVhcyBkZWNlbnRyYWxpemF0aW9u). Ryan McMaken\u2019s [free] book \u201c[Breaking Away: The Case for Secession, Radical Decentralization, and Smaller Polities](https://mises.org/library/book/breaking-away-case-secession-radical-decentralization-and-smaller-polities) is an excellent introduction for those interested in understanding the merits behind this idea.\n\nThe Nobel-Memorial-Prize-in-Economic-Sciences-winning F.A. Hayek opined, \u201cperhaps the fact that we have seen millions voting themselves into complete dependence on a tyrant has made our generation understand that to choose one\u2019s government is not necessarily to secure freedom.\u201d\n\nRobert Higgs appropriately said that by \u201cvoting, the people only decide which of the oligarchs preselected for them as viable candidates will wield the whip used to flog them and will command the legion of willing accomplices who perpetrate the countless violations of the peoples\u2019 natural rights.\u201d\n\nAs Steve Curtin so eloquently put it, \u201cvoting is your voice and it speaks loud and clear: \u2018I consent to being robbed and terrorized, though I may complain about it.\u2019\u201d\n\nRobert Heinlein pointed out that, \u201cwhen you vote, you are exercising political authority, you\u2019re using force. And force, my friends, is violence. The supreme authority from which all other authorities are derived.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Tucker thoughtfully asked, \u201cis not the very beginning of privilege, monopoly and industrial slavery this erecting of the ballot-box above the individual?\u201d\n\nWhen one votes, the voter is saying that they\u2019ll honor the results of the election (meaning accepting whoever wins as \u201cPresident of the US\u201d). They\u2019re consenting to being a cog completely at the whim of the collectivist machine in which they find themselves. So, regardless of which party you vote for, it\u2019s ultimately a vote for tyranny.\n\nWendy McElroy nailed it when she said, \u201cvoting is not an act of political freedom. It is an act of political conformity. Those who refuse to vote are not expressing silence. They are screaming in the politician\u2019s ear: \u2018You do not represent me. This is not a process in which my voice matters. I do not believe you\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn the words of Don Freeman, \u201cI would rather take my chances with anarchy than this current system of scripted poverty, brainwashing, intimidation and never-ending war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe useful collective term \u201cwe\u201d has enabled an ideological camouflage to be thrown over the reality of political life. If \u201cwe are the government,\u201d then anything a government does to an individual is not only just and untyrannical but also \u201cvoluntary\u201d on the part of the individual concerned. If the government has incurred a huge public debt which must be paid by taxing one group for the benefit of another, this reality of burden is obscured by saying that \u201cwe owe it to ourselves\u201d; if the government conscripts a man, or throws him into jail for dissident opinion, then he is \u201cdoing it to himself\u201d and, therefore, nothing untoward has occurred. Under this reasoning, any Jews murdered by the Nazi government were not murdered; instead, they must have \u201ccommitted suicide,\u201d since they were the government (which was democratically chosen), and, therefore, anything the government did to them was voluntary on their part. One would not think it necessary to belabor this point, and yet the overwhelming bulk of the people hold this fallacy to a greater or lesser degree. \u201cWe\u201d are not the government; the government is not \u201cus.\u201d The government does not in any accurate sense \u201crepresent\u201d the majority of the people. But, even if it did, even if 70 percent of the people decided to murder the remaining 30 percent, this would still be murder and would not be voluntary suicide on the part of the slaughtered minority. No organicist metaphor, no irrelevant bromide that \u201cwe are all part of one another,\u201d must be permitted to obscure this basic fact.\u201d\n\u2014Murray Rothbard",
