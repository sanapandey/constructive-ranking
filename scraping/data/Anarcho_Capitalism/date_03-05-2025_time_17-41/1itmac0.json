Citizens United was *only* about publication of political opinions, and *had nothing whatsoever to do* with donating money to candidates.  Anyone arguing otherwise has either been duped by deliberate misrepresentations, or is willfully complicit in spreading false information.\n\n> It gives them the entirety of the 1st ammendment rights while maintaining fictional capacity.\n\nThe first amendment has nothing to do with campaign donations.  The only parts of it that relate to this discussion pertain exclusively to freedom of speech and the of press -- i.e. \"publication of political opinions\".  The first amendment has always protected speech itself, regardless of who is speaking or what tools or models of coordination they are employing.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"fictional capacity\", which is a term that to my knowledge has no generally understood legal meaning here, but if I assume you are talking about corporate personhood being a sort of legal fiction, that's irrelevant here, because (a) the first amendment has always prohibited the government from restricting political speech without qualification, so no one is ever \"given first amendment rights\", and (b) the provisions attempting to exempt the government from the first amendment when it comes to speech distributed by organizations were first introduced in 2002, and have no precedent in American constitutional law.\n\n> A government concept where they can be protected by the government in lawsuits and still get the full authority of a living being for lobbying..\n\nYou are conflating limited liability -- which protects *external investors, not the corporation itself* from being fully liable for the corporation's activities -- with publication of speech, publication of speech with lobbying, and with campaign donations.  You've got lots of unrelated and legally distinct concepts muddled up here.",

Corporations were never allowed to make political contributions, the 2002 BCRA didn't change that, and *Citizens United* striking down the bits of the BCRA (edit: and *Austin*) that violated the first amendment also didn't change that.  Corporations are still entirely prohibited from donating money to candidates, and anyone who says otherwise is, as above, either a liar or someone who has been duped by liars.\n\nCitizens United *had nothing to do* with donations to candidates.  It was entirely about the FEC trying to enforce the \"electioneering communications\"  provisions of the BCRA to suppress public release of media by organizations expressing their own opinions without any donations to candidates or coordination with their campaign being involved.\n\n> Yes allows them to keep individuals from making those contributions. So the end result is individuals go through corporations to make those contributions.\n\nAgain, this is entirely false.  The \"electioneering communication\" provisions of the BCRA never applied to individuals using their own resources in the first place.  Individuals have always been free to spend as much of their own money to spread their own opinions as they want to.  \n\nAll *Citizens United* did was to affirm that speech is always protected under the first amendment, regardless of who is engaging in that speech or how much they're spending to facilitate it, and that individuals do not lose their first amendment rights when forming organizations to help facilitate their speech.  It had nothing to do with campaign donations whatsoever.",
