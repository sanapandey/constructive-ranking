It's a subtle question, but do the silicon valley people who are invading DC right now, do they want to cut government based on a set of deeply felt ideological principles? Or do they simply want to be the ones in charge?\n\nCurtis \"Mencius Moldbug\" Yarvin advocates for something that some people reductively call \"monarchy,\" but what he's really describing are sort of \"CEO-Kings.\" It is, effectively, rule by corporation.\n\nMaybe this is OK from an ancap perspective if we're talking about multiple \"franchise\" management systems operating in an interconnected, polycentric legal framework. This is simply an extension of the fact that workplaces, homeowners associations, etc all have rules and codes of conduct that are not necessarily \"democratically\" decided, but rather imposed by a CEO. The \"democratic\" part is you vote with your feet by changing jobs / homes.\n\nBut is that really what Elon is after? Do they really want to get rid of the Pentagon which (forget about this DEI crap) is probably the most concentrated system of government power and money? I'm skeptical. I don't know if Elon wants to get rid of the Pentagon, rather than to just be CEO of it. That's a very dangerous thing.",

He talks about \"feedback loops,\" and choosing institutional structures that have more effictive feedback loops.

Whether you're pro- or anti-DEI, these organizations were set up in many cases by Congress with parts of that as their mission.\n\nThis idea that Elon's just going around saying \"hmm what's this organization supposed to be doing?\" is laughable. He understands exactly what USAID and CFPB were *supposed* to be doing, and he disagrees with their missions, independent of the real waste and abuse uncovered there.\n\nWhether we agree with it or not -- there is an intentional ideological evaluation of the core mission of these agencies being done by Elon and his crew, that is happening *outside* of the Legislative branch (arguably outside of even the rest of the Trump Admin), which is where we're supposed to be debating these things.\n\nSo, we should be very concerned about what Elon believes or doesn't believe -- because he seems to be the only one making these decisions right now.",

Everything inside the executive branch that isn't explicity called out by congress should be gutted and removed.

But I disagree, it has always lived, but not in a fantastical form, but rather in the vengeful, self-righteous socialists, who preach about their values and act condescendingly when someone disagrees with them, thinking of them as dumb and anti-intellectual. One of their common arguments is that libertarianism, anarchism, etc, don't work in practice and only on paper, that these societies are impossible and unstable, but when proof is provided to them from the past, they shrug it off as \"just in the past, it might have worked for them but now it doesn't\", but when something in the present is provided, they can't refute it with anything, so they instead encourage the forceful destruction of these societies because it threatens their indoctrination into the cult of statism. \n\nStatism will always destroy anything it sees as blasphemous, especially when that blasphemy fufills one of the requirements to disprove it.",
