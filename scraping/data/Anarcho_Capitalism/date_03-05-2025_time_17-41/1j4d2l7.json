I was on the phone with an IRS agent today who was giving me the usual bs runaround and said to check with them again in 30 days. After the third or fourth time he said it, I finally lost my temper and said, \u201cThirty days from now the Department of Government Efficiency might axe all of you anyway!\u201d He got mad and hung up on me.

                            "body": "The short answer:  it's the replacing of the state with market-based and voluntary institutions.  \n\n\nThe medium answer- it's the replacing of the state with market-based and voluntary institutions which we want (and you might too) both because we have reasons to expect that markets can produce law and governance and regulation better than the state (the state being a *legitimized* territorial monopoly on force), and because markets can and would work much better without the distortions the state creates, and also because individual liberty is a good which is un-priced or under-priced on political markets and private markets distorted by the state and it's interventions.  We expect that voluntary, private markets might fail to produce some public goods and fail to internalize some negative externalities as well as an ideal state can; but that states (because of political incentives and paradoxes in democratic mechanisms) will rarely if ever act in ideal ways; and also that the state tends to produce its own negative externalities and unintended consequences which appear to far outweigh the costs of even the most pessimistic assessments of how badly markets would fail in a few areas.  \n\n\nThe long answer requires a bit of reading:  \n\nHere's some suggested studying to learn what anarcho-capitalism is about-\n\n1. [The Problem of Political Authority](https://archive.org/details/problem-of-political-authority-the-michael-huemer/page/n1/mode/1up) by Michael Huemer\n\n2. [Machinery of Freedom](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Machinery%203rd%20Edn.pdf) by David Friedman\n\n3. [Price Theory](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html) by David Friedman\n\n4. Any other mainstream econ textbooks as far into the subject as you can handle with as much of the math as you can handle; but I do recommend starting with Modern Principles of Economics by Alex Tabbarok and Tyler Cowan.\n\n5. [The Calculus of Consent](http://files.libertyfund.org/files/1063/Buchanan_0102-03_EBk_v6.0.pdf) by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock\n\n6. Any other mainstream political economy texts or works, but I recommend Governing the Commons by Elinor Ostrom, and though not a book, [Mike Munger's intro to political economy course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEJy2f_EWBqX1yIF-VP1MJsgnYy8OLK7t&si=LEgVKe5rGO9-Qz4-) available on YouTube.\n\n7. Rothbard's [Man, Economy, and State](https://mises.org/library/man-economy-and-state-power-and-market).",
