You're currently in a state of anarcho-capitalism. Now imagine you  engage in actions, but your actions have no impact on your fellow man. This is still a state of anarcho-capitalism. Now imagine you engage in actions of which impact your fellow man, but you do so consensually, where both parties in question are agreeing to an exchange. This is still anarcho-capitalism.\n\nThe only time you fall outside of anarcho-capitalism is when, for example, your neighbor threatened to use violence against you unless you gave them some of your food, if they violently attacked you to try to cause you harm or to kill you, if they attempted to steal your property, to enslave you, etc.\n\nBasically if people never initiate actions of which violate the will of others then the default made from that is anarcho-capitalism.",

                            "body": "But then that 10% isn't anarcho-capitalism.\n\nAnarchy is just without monarchy. Anarchy is to monarchy as atheism is to theism. Theism is a belief in the divine, atheism is the non-belief. Monarchy is with rulers, anarchy is without rulers.\n\nCapitalism is just a state in which trade between parties is consensual. Honestly, anarcho-capitalism is a redundant set of grouped words, because anarchy or capitalism are both more or less the same thing. You can't have non-free trade without rulers, and you're not going to get free trade when you have rulers, because all rulers (even those beneath democratic systems) are going to place rules and regulations on that trade of which are not there to protect the innocent.\n\nNote that all laws are unjust laws if they are laws pertaining to victimless crimes. All positive rights for example create a victim, whereas no negative rights do.\n\nThe irony in much political discourse is that the majority of people all want the same things, but they've been so brainwashed by statism throughout their lives that they can't see that the communist wants the same things the fascist wants, and both could have it in a state of anarcho-capitalism.\n\nNobody wants what they themselves will for to be restricted or taken away. So allowing your fellow man to live their lives in peace so that you may live yours in peace, and only interacting by way of consent is the only true path to success in these political discourses, but very few people have a mindset that can grasp that.\n\nSocialists for example who want universal healthcare don't seem to put together that they can get it and all they have to do is group together consensually, pool their resources together, create medical systems that do this, and voil\u00e0, universal healthcare at no expense of anyone who doesn't want to partake in their endeavor.\n\nSo instead, they want a monopoly on the use of force to threaten people with violence unless they give them resources that they can then use (poorly) to create a system of universal healthcare that will most assuredly always result in people not getting the care they need, or like seems to be the state of Canada's healthcare system right now, trying to convince people to get euthanized because the ill are too heavy a burden on a system that without the proper incentives, is not an efficient system.",
