The market is automatically maximally anti-cartel, and any legal regulation of a market written can only make it more pro-cartel.\n\nSo \"anti-cartel law\" is a contradiction in terms.",

But they did this anyway and the prices in the biggest grocery chains went up. Now the government found out about this and punished them. \nIn this particular case how the anti-cartel laws made the cartel?",

As it was possible for appeasement to stop Hitler from gaining power.\n\nConsider this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSc3\\_lP24oQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSc3_lP24oQ)\n\nAnd this counter example: There are 3 brands of grocers, A, B and C. The three all agree to fix their prices, but unbeknownst to A and B, C decides to sell at a price less than their competitors (but enough to still keep C profitable). A and B find this out too late and go bankrupt due to nobody buying, making C as the only grocer brand. \n\nThe example shows that cartels go *against* profitability, not *for* it. Each company is its own individual organization, wanting to get itself as rich as possible. If all companies agree to form a cartel, then all it takes to break out of it is to just sell at a lower price (assuming no contractual tomfoolery is signed). Even then, what is stopping a 4th party from entering and making another grocer business? No gov't as its a free market. Funding? If the venture can be proven to be profitable then venture capitalists will be happy to provide funding.  \n\n\nWe can go even further with this:  \nIf C then sells the goods at a price so low the business is no longer profitable, then C will go out of business (this is called predatory pricing btw), but if C sells it at high prices, then other businesses will spring up to sell at cheaper, but still profitable, prices. Therefore, unless C always sells goods at the right price, it will lose its monopoly in a free market (spoiler alert, not likely given humans aren't perfect).\n\ntl;dr this one case doesn't justify gov't coercion.",
