I can post something that once was basic in society for instance that one should try to do a good job at work, and now in most places on reddit, that kind of statement would be downvoted to hell.   Instead there is glorification of dodging work, milking the system, getting away with the minimum, scamming more money for themselves, etc.  And as much as I understand that there are some work environments where the boss deserves all that, there are many others where the boss, not to mention coworkers,  do not deserve all that, yet people's sentiment does not seem to acknowledge the latter.  \n\nSo that's a long way to say, maybe part of it is attitudes have changed and govt is the haven for many of the more lazy workers.",

I don't think society has changed that much, it's just that your measuring stick has changed. Reddit is a shithole filled with losers, and they justify themselves to each other. I think if you go outside and talk to normal people, you'll get normal responses. That's why redditors are so angry and fearful: they only find validation on this website, and the real world doesn't conform to it.\n\nThe kids are alright.",

With removal of some govt, some of that will probably naturally happen.  PLus the job market is not as tight now as it has been in the past so there is wiggle room.  Officially there is currently 8 million jobs unfilled so that's nothing compared to 100,000.  Also don't fire them all in the same millisecond, stagger the firings a bit. Unemployment benefit costs will probably go up for a while too but that's still less expensive than paying all those people and departments long term.  \n\nHOpefully the new jobs will yield more productivity vs their old job of just wasting tax payer money.  Lower taxes mean average people buy more which stimulates the economy.  Plus the US govt will soon become insolvent due to 36 trillion debt so we really have no choice now, the govt HAS TO be cut by 40% even if there are some negative side effects from it, because the alternative is much worse.  The pain will be far greater if we don't do it.  So even if every last other thing I mentioned goes wrong, we'd still have to do the cuts.",

You should see the clusterfxck of regs that California is constantly creating for everything like special car emissions and gas mileage standards.  \n\nAnother especially obnoxious one is a while back, Cali made it a law that you could be sued for anything you sell that later gets found to cause cancer even if it was not known that it was a cancerous agent at the time you sold it.  So maybe some element of the metal finish of some product 30 years from now is found to cause cancer, you are liable if you sold it 30 years earlier.   So if you walk into a hardware store, there'll often be signs saying products might cause cancer.  WHich ones?  Who the fxck knows, they are just covering their butt from liability.  Almost anything might cause cancer, there's so many signs on everything that none of it has any meaning and it's a total waste of time.  Because the way to avoid liability is if you include a cancer warning label.  And also many companies will not ship here because they don't want to have a separate package with a cancer warning just for Cali.  \n\nSo if feds removed their standards, the only diff we might see as businesses is that regulation might loosen up in a few states, which businesses would like.",

She was WFH and she'd bring her laptop but spent most of her time playing pickleball games and in between games, she'd do a tad of work on her laptop.  Pressure to work must have been minimal though as she never turned down an opportunity for a game.   I read somewhere that it's estimated the average WFH worker spends approx 4 hours of their work day not actually doing work.  One has to assume that is why WFH is so loved by so many workers who do it.  \n\nAnd it's not even like I don't understand.  I work for myself and it IS harder to work constantly when tons of temptations to goof off are all around and there's no one looking over your shoulder who'll notice if you are not working.  IMO a lot of this is human nature but probably down the line AI will track output more and WFH slacking will be more easily detected.",

Musk repeatedly says he has to check with Trump or only if Trump approves when asked about things that he has not spoken with Trump about yet.  Musk works for Trump and as long as Trump backs him then his orders are Trumps orders, that's how the chain of command works.  Also history shows Trump is not afraid to yank someone back with a violent slapdown the second he is not happy with them so this weird attempted narrative that Musk is somehow taking over from Trump is quite far fetched and weak since it does not even fit with the personalities in question.  I know you know this so maybe just quit with the feigned ignorance, it's not a good look and no one is falling for it here.",

That\u2019s not how governments work. \n\nOk, let\u2019s remove every employee of the government and replace it with something that is 0. \n\nAre we keeping Health insurance, social security, defense, debt, benefits for veterans, we are already at 80%. There are places that could reduce spending - like all the subsidies to oil companies for example that generate record profit, or companies run by musk, or trump or their buddies. The whole pharma sector. But this is not what they are after, they are after cheap shots of things they don\u2019t understand and complete lies and made up claims. It\u2019s like a game of broken phone. A health aid of a few millions that prevents all kinds of nasty epidemics turns out after a few exchanges to be 100M if condoms funding \u2026 and people are buying it. \n\nEvery system of this scale has waste. This waste and inefficiency could be remove and the waste that these guys are removing is completely insignificant. By their own accord they\u2019ve remove 16B of waste. Cool. Until someone else does the calculations and it turns out that it will total about 2B. One of their claims is that they\u2019ve removed an 8B government contract for the border and it might turn out that this is actually 8M.",

His tweets are not evidence.\n\nThey have a website listing it. They cut the hell out of DEI programs and a bunch of money laundering. Were you stealing from us, too?\n\n>The majority of the federal government was sitting around in PJs wishing death on you? Surely you can think of a specific example then \n\nGaslight harder. Are you pretending to not remember the COVID years?\n\n>The biden administration doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the autocratic power grabbing trump is doing. \n\nLOL wrong. Again, the COVID years.\n\n>Biden sucked but didn\u2019t centralize power further as trump is doing HARD.\n\nHe forced 100 million innocent people to take an experimental drug so his son could buy more coke and hookers.\n\n>You don\u2019t think your taxes should go up. Trump does. \ud83e\udd14 \n\nAccording do you. Not according to reality.\n\n>Trump absolutely got a first term ya cultist.\n\nNah, they made up the Russian hoax and denied him his power.\n\n>Quit being an autocrat enabling simp and never pretend you care about the sanctity of the US constitution or any nonsense like that. You want to force your preferences on everyone else.\n\nYou guys made me wear a face diaper and forced an experimental drug in the arms of 100 million Americans while your politicians gallivanted around maskless, ignoring lockdowns. You fellate Nazis.",
