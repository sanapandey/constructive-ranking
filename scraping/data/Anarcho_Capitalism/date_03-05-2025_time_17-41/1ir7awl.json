            "body": "The bottom image is what the top image used to look like. Comparing modern first world living standards with third world living standards is delusional, because it ignores this fact.\n\nThe natural human condition is poverty. We have no food, water, shelter, and certainly none of the modern conveniences that I'm enjoying right now and that you are too as you read this. Why? because our economy was allowed to develop from the bottom stage to the top.\n\nEconomies start with agriculture, civilization starts with agriculture. You can't settle in one location without a stable, predictable food supply, so thats what everyone does for work- subsistence farming. Development of technology (if it is allowed by the government/not stopped for whatever reason) makes this farming more efficient, cutting down on the labor required. Given that there is no lump of labor and that there is always more to do (same reason why AI won't put the entire human race out of work) people go into new industries. Where markets are allowed to operate, capitalists in wealthy countries will invest and hire low skilled labor in developing nations.\n\nIf these jobs are taken voluntarily, there is no problem. Is the pay bad? Yes. Are the hours long? Yes. Are the conditions bad? Yes. But...is the work better than what they were doing before? Absolutely.\n\nWhat people don't consider is:\n\nThe ills of the gilded age in America were ended by allowing the gilded age to run its course. Pay went up dramatically before the government stepped in with a minimum wage. Hours went down dramatically before the government stepped in with laws regarding hours worked in a day. Child labor was almost gone before it was outlawed. Workplace fatalities fell dramatically before OSHA came around, and so on. Why? Economic development and competition in labor markets. Okay, factory A will only pay $4 an hour to an unskilled worker. Factory B can manage to slice its profits thin enough to attract the unskilled worker by paying $4.50. And so on. Same thing applies to hours worked. As workers gain human capital in heavy industry, textiles, etc. (skills they never had at all as subsistence farmers) they become more productive, can demand more money for their time, and come out of the drudgery of sweatshop work, IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO. In situations where government imposes minimum wages, outlaws child labor, puts in onerous regulation on business, they are merely condemning these nations to poverty.\n\nSouth Korea kept these practices legal. The work was awful by our first world standards. But you let these workers gain skills and become wealthier, and soon enough they'll work less, have easier jobs, have safer and more comfortable jobs, and have enough money that their kids can go to school instead of working. A common Ancap meme is that we love child labor and want kids to work. Its funny but not accurate- I want VOLUNTARY child labor to be legal in these developing nations because I understand that letting them work for their families is the fastest way to get them out of the factories and into the schools.\n\nPassing a law banning this practice is not going to fix this. An extremely disturbing anecdote from Rainer Zitelmann's book In Defense of Capitalism discusses how a consumer boycott to Walmart left thousands of kids unemployed in the third world, so what did they do? Did they just start going to school because now the evil capitalist wasn't \"forcing\" them to work anymore? No, they worked at more dangerous, worse paying, and harder jobs. Some just became prostitutes. Is that what socialists want? Probably, as NAMBLA was founded by a marxist.",
