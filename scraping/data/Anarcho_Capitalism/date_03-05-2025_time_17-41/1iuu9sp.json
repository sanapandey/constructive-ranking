If your audience is older as well, such as a judge or a congress person, they tend to prefer the two spaces.  It is what they are used to and it makes it easier for their eyes to track the beginning and ending of sentences.  Most younger people these days were never taught this because they mostly use computers and write for other young people.  Once your eyes get a little less sharp, or if you ever have to read a lot of print on paper, you'll realize why we did it.",
