I also like subs like this that don't ban you for having a different opinion and I also have had a constant political text debate with my right libertarian friend to keep people challenging my views. \n\nI watch several YouTube channels but that's mainly about History, economics and war but they obviously tie in to  politics a lot. My favourites are: William Spaniel (an A-political, political scientist), Kings and Generals (war and history) and Caspian Report (war and geo-economics). I did used to watch Luke Beasley bit I decided he was too biased when I saw him ignoring several (what I consider to be reasonably legit) right wing rebuttals to his arguments. \n\nProbably TMI but there you go lol\n\nHow about you?",

However there is a good bit of lost subtlety in these 'centrist' sources. I use some of them as well but make sure to stay aware of what their biases. Are they centrist right warhawks? Are they only on the left for a specific issue, et cetera. I find Groundnews leaves a lot to be desired. Simply left vs right is not a great spectrum.\n\nIf you ever find yourself completely trusting any news source I hope you remember old adage, \"There is a sucker born every minute, if you dont know who it is it is you.\" From my experiance is no such thing as unopinionated news. Looking back, from what I can tell, this has always been the case. So please don't fall for the myth of a balanced centrist view point. Even science journals have agendas.\n\nI prefer news where the bias is clear and in your face. I don't care what part of the spectrum in comes from so long as the arguments are well articulated and the writer isn't trying to subtly hide their views while they attempt to sway me. That means I get exposed to extreme views on all sides of an issue, which I find is much better than hoping someone will summerize an issue for me accurately.\n\nAlways keep an eye on what is not said, what issues their opponents bring up that they leave unanswered. Usually they cannot answer that point, so they avoid it all together, which is telling.\n\nNow in a previous post you said the issues being brought up were reductive. Would you mind sharing your views on those issues?",

Ancaps believe that if there was no state and no government than people would finally be free and there would be no more subjugation. But that's absolutely not the case.\n\nSubjugation is defined as \"the action of bringing someone or something under domination or control\". But to think that if you just remove government there will be no more subjugation is just naive.\n\nLike without free, tax-funded public schools for example many children growing up in very poor families would be deprived of an education and may reach adulthood not even being able to read. And so once they reach adulthood the poorest people will have extremely limited options and may have no other options but to slave away for 80 hours a week just to put food on the table. And so they would be very much subjugated to their employer. If they refuse to obey, if they refuse to put in the hours expected from them very quickly they'd be fired and be without shelter, food and healthcare. Meanwhile children growing up in very rich families will have much more options as to how they live their lives and do not experience anywhere near the same level of subjugation.\n\nSo that's just one example. But so if we used taxes for example to make sure that every child has the right to an education and that professional education is affordable to everyone that will actually reduce levels of subjugation for millions of people.\n\nGrowing up poor and subsequently reaching adulthood constantly being enslaved to an employer where the slightest misstep could lead to you losing access to food, shelter or healthcare is not a lack of subjugation. It is very much a form of subjugation.",
