Problem is, the left makes little distinction between people like us, and the Reagan-esque conservative statists. \n\nThey've banned all their spaces, so they kinda funnel down into ours. Because we're so few, and consolidated, it's going to skew people's perception.",

What's right is right. \n\nEven \"taxation is theft\" is less used nowadays... things come and go.\n\nBut it does help us to not keep remembering our conservative allies about the things they don't like about us... We want more space in this administration, not less. We want Trump closer to Musk, Vivek, Milei... \n\nIt's that new right that will help us get more freedom.

However, you should still have the right to a credible means of defense, should that be something you wish to pursue. \n\n>Especially after I saw 1000s of 2A people claim the covid era was pure tyranny, EXACTLY what I've been told the guns are for, and they all sat back and didnt even go out to protest.\n\nTo be fair, there were protests, huge ones actually. Remember the trucker convoy that went from Canada to DC?\n\nAnyway. It's more of a defense measure than an offensive one. If I decided to take my rifle and attack the government head-on without backup, I'd simply be killed. It's better to simply not comply with tyranny and defend yourself when the tyrants send their people to you. See the tale of Kenneth Walker (Breonna Taylor's boyfriend) for an example of this. \n\n>Generalizations can be useful, but they're always inaccurate by nature of being a generalization. \n\nI appreciate the level-headed responses and good points.
