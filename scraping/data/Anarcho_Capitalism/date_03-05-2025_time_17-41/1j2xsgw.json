Some would argue they would not have waited until 2022 to invade, and would have done so at the behest of their own clients.",

            "body": "Yeah, that's an interesting angle. In a Molinari-style setup, you'd expect the security providers in the Russian-speaking regions to act much earlier to protect their clients, probably well before 2022. But the key difference is that without state-level egos driving total war, you'd likely see smaller, localized conflicts focused on defense, not conquest. The costs of prolonged fighting and occupation wouldn't make sense for private agencies, so the incentive would be to resolve disputes quickly and protect paying customers, not drag it into a years-long mess.",
