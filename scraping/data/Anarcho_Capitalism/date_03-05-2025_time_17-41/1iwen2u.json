That\u2019s why housing is so high basically everywhere in the US.\n\nThis increases property tax income, while decreasing affordability. Thus gutting the middle class and making the rich wealthier. \n\nEvery single politician in the US who is anti-housing should be prosecuted for the RICO crime of creating an anti-competitive market.",
