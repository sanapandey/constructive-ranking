I swear to God, it would be hilarious if it weren't so sad to watch these pathetic blowhards whose entire security is thanks to the shield American taxpayers have been putting up for 70+ years. The gravy train is coming to an end (hopefully). We got fucked with NAFTA. I only regret not voting for Perot in 1992 cause goddamn was he right!",

If they are large enough they can stand their ground and eat the loss of business. If they aren't big enough they have no choice but to either cave to the pressure or go under. We can laugh at the company who instead of caving chooses to fight and go under, refusing to believe the economical disadvantage they are at in a self made delusion (aka Canada).\n\nThe nice thing about achieving diplomacy through tariffs is that on the macro level it follows the NAP and I'd much rather see countries resolve disputes through the mechanism of trade than the mechanism of violence.",

Each participant should be allowed to make their own decisions, accept the consequences, or mutually benefit from whatever terms they set. That would be pure market forces at work.\n\nThe difference with tariffs is, while it may help level a playing field in an ideoligical sense (which is unlikely to be the reality),  you have introduced a third party that stands between the two parties and enforces permissions and a certain set of rules to manipulate the outcome of the transaction, typically to the benefit of that 3rd party. Like a mob boss demanding their cut before the transaction is allowed. \n\nIn ancapastan, those tools to help artificially balance the playing field dont exist, true. Instead, markets work because imbalances are thought to self-correct through competition, innovation, and consumer preference. If a business fails, it\u2019s because the market has determined it\u2019s not providing enough value, not because of artificial barriers, subsidies, or government favors one over the other.\n\nTo say that tariffs are a peaceful way to conduct diplomacy under the NAP has the issue that if a business refuses to comply, the government backs up those rules with fines, restriction opf permissions, and ultimately force. That\u2019s not voluntary trade, that\u2019s governemnt coercion and market manipulation under threat of violence...its exactly the force based control the NAP is meant to oppose",

Mexico could just slap uniforms on cartel members and send them to the border to 'patrol!'   PLus their police force is famously corrupt. I was taking  a taxi in Mexico once and chatting with the driver, he mentioned taxi prices at night are higher, I asked him if was due to crime and he said no, it was due to cops pulling over random cars and demanding money from them in exchange for not getting a ticket for an invented reason.  The cops usually demanded $60 which is a lot of money consider a typical taxi ride fair is only a few dollars.  These taxi drivers are more afraid of cops than of criminals.",
