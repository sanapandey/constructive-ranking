It was NOT his best debate in any shape or form. \"Concepts of a plan, they're eating the cats and dogs, every single issue in America was caused by Kamala Harris\" as if the VP has any real power. Fucking lazy bullshit. He couldn't even directly answer any question they asked and just kept going back to immigrants.\n\nAt the very least, Trump did better against Biden and Hillary, the first not even anything he did, because all he really said were jokes about Biden, it was just Biden completely bombed, even though he was the only one who discussed any sort of policy. He came off like an old, weak, tried man. Which is exactly how Trump came off against Kamala (an extremely weak candidate btw).\n\nHe's a sycophant, a liar, a warmonger and a complete sellout loser who should be nowhere near any policy making decisions. These fucking GOP \"yes men\" are absolutely pathetic.",
