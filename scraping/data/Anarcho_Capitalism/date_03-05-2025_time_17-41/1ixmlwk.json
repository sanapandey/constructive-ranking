As it currently stands, everyone is hysterical about getting fired if they cannot prove themselves useful, but that's not been mentioned yet.

And that's where the win can be, in my opinion. It's useless management layers that should be worried about getting outed as impediments.",

Musk has come through with an axe to the department anyone interacting with DOGE in any way is expecting to be axed with contempt. No if ands or butt's about it. Next it is known that due to the volume of these there isn't a person looking at this but an AI. So who knows how it will weight and determine whether you are mission critical or not. What buzzwords should you be looking to put in? Next that it was sent over the weekend when you're relaxing and now you have to question how to best handle the situation. It's not the request that is simple, if that request came from someone who they have met it would probably be well received and immediately answered. But it comes from somewhere in the high high up nebulous and from someone you know really wants to find any reason to fire you. Not to mention the thing looked like spam, as someone in IT I very well likely would have told people it was a phishing attempt.\n\nThink of it more like this, pretend you're in a similar spot. The company you work for just laid off a lot of people in another location. Then the COO who lives out of state sends you and email asking what it is that you do? You're going to be nervous about it right? It's scary to think that even though you continually perform well in your performance reviews and you work hard and all of a sudden you may lose your job anyway. You're powerless. And yes Federal employees typically have good job security but often times they are paid significantly less than their private sector counter parts and so you're taking a cut to improve security.
