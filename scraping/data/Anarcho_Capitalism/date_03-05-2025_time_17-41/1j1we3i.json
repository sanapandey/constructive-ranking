Like Trump threatened to jail Mark Zuckerberg at one point and he [threatened to shut down TV broadcasters](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/donald-trump-has-threatened-to-shut-down-broadcasters-but-can-he/) that are critical of him.\n\nAnd just the other day he posted that he's considering suing book authors that publish dishonest material and he's thinking about creating a new law targeting book publishers: [https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114070115148185478](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114070115148185478)\n\nSo under Trump free speech in the US is certainly also in danger now.",

Beyond that Trump flaps his lip all the time like threatening to jail Hillary so I pretty much only look at what he actually takes action on, not his idle bs chatter, some of which is just bait for his base.  So I'd say the level is danger is to be determined and so far, he's taken action on a lot of things but not that.  Whereas the Biden admin DID take lots of direct action to restrict speech.  Thus so far Trump is still the least of the evils on that, especially when compared to EU where they actually already threw many in jail over nothing.",

Since TV broadcasters require a licence to operate in the US, yes threatening to revoke that licence is a threat to shut them down.\n\n>That's him saying he would sue them, which is legal.\n\nHe also said \"maybe we will create some NICE NEW LAW\". So yes, he's threatening to impose anti free speech laws to deal with book publishers who are critical of him.\n\n>LOL according to a blog.\n\nNot just according to some blog, according to Business Insider, which is a pretty reputable and impartial source. And a Twitter employee has confirmed the same story in a House Oversight Committee hearing: [https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/115561/documents/HHRG-118-IF16-20230328-SD057.pdf](https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/115561/documents/HHRG-118-IF16-20230328-SD057.pdf)\n\nSo I get that you're probably a huge Trump fan. But Trump is definitely not a pro free speech guy. Trump hates people who criticize him and he doesn't mind restricting free speech to shut down criticism.",
