The irony.\n\n\n\"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes.\"\n\nFederalist 46. In case anyone was curious why we should just outright ignore any gun laws...\n\n\nEdit: yes yes, silly pieces of paper. Anyways, Madison made a solid point here. Guns = freedom. End of discussion. Don't bother following this if you live there, resist as hard as your stomach will allow you ;-)",
