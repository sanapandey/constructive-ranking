Only the things you inherently agree to or act as if you agree to are enforced on you.\n\nDo you respect my property?  \nI'll reciprocate by respecting yours.\n\nDo you act as if you can steal a 1000$ from me?  \nI'll take my money back and then a 1000$ from you.\n\nDo you believe that simply claiming to be in need gives you the right to take my stuff?  \nI'll reciprocate by claiming need and taking my stuff back + just as much as you took.\n\nEnforcing private property could be taken as simply enforcing whatever property norms you already voluntarily agree to. No one can say that an AnCap did something to them that they believe is wrong.",
