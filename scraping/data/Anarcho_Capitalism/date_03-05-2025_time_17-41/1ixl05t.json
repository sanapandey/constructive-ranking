They are lesser.\n\nI say this with no hostility to the \u201cleeches\u201d of society. My hope is each and every one of them can receive the help that they as humans deserve.

You can\u2019t ensure order without infringing upon freedom; allowing freedom entails the possibility of chaos. \n\nSo you have to trade off freedom for order and vice versa. It\u2019s where you fall on those sorts of trade offs that helps you to determine your ideology. So, for example, if you were to take the political compass test\u2014which does oversimplify things but is still really useful\u2014the vertical axis is going to deal with exactly that trade off, based on how you respond to different scenarios. \n\nOnce you know more about how you feel about these trade offs you can consider *why* and you can start to think about the underlying consistency of your positions.",

            "body": "You should look into Objectivism. Read \u201cObjectvism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand\u201d by Leonard Peikoff or watch some of his many lecture series on YouTube.\n\nIt advocates for free markets and personal liberties. Politically it\u2019s similar to libertarianism or minarchism (completely free markets, governments only purpose is military, police, and a legal system to the protect property rights, enforce contracts, etc) but it\u2019s all tied together and rooted in a comprehensive and wholistic philosophical system including metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and politics. Despite its political similarities to libertarianism, Ayn Rand famously hated libertarians because without the philosophical basis, they end up mired in subjectivism, collectivism, and other anti-individualistic mentalities.\n\nHere\u2019s an AI summary since I\u2019m too lazy to type any more:\nObjectivism, the philosophy developed by Ayn Rand, is built on a specific metaphysical and epistemological foundation:\n\nMetaphysics (Reality)\n\nObjectivism is grounded in an objective reality, meaning:\n\t1.\tExistence Exists \u2013 Reality is independent of consciousness; things exist regardless of what anyone thinks, wishes, or believes.\n\t2.\tIdentity (A is A) \u2013 Everything that exists has a specific identity; things are what they are, governed by the Law of Identity.\n\t3.\tCausality \u2013 Entities act according to their nature, meaning cause and effect are inherent in reality.\n\nIn short, Objectivism rejects supernaturalism, subjectivism, and relativism, affirming that reality is absolute and knowable.\n\nEpistemology (Knowledge)\n\nObjectivism holds that reason is man\u2019s only means of acquiring knowledge:\n\t1.\tReason and Logic \u2013 Knowledge is derived from sensory perception and conceptual abstraction, guided by logic.\n\t2.\tConcept Formation \u2013 Concepts are formed through a process of measurement omission, integrating particulars into universals.\n\t3.\tObjectivity \u2013 Truth is discovered through rational inquiry, not emotions, faith, or authority.\n\nRand opposed skepticism and mysticism, arguing that knowledge is possible and that certainty can be achieved through proper reasoning.\n\nObjectivism\u2019s politics is a direct extension of its metaphysics and epistemology:\n\t1.\tMetaphysics \u2192 Individual Rights\n\t\u2022\tSince reality is objective and independent of consciousness, no one has the right to force others to accept falsehoods or obey arbitrary authority.\n\t\u2022\tHuman nature requires freedom to think, act, and pursue values; thus, individual rights\u2014especially property rights\u2014are the foundation of a proper political system.\n\t2.\tEpistemology \u2192 Capitalism\n\t\u2022\tSince reason is man\u2019s only means of survival, a political system must leave individuals free to think and act rationally.\n\t\u2022\tA government\u2019s role is to protect individual rights (life, liberty, property) from force and fraud, allowing people to interact voluntarily.\n\t\u2022\tThis leads to laissez-faire capitalism, the only system that fully respects individual freedom and reason.\n\nIn short, Objectivism defends a limited government that protects rights but does not interfere in the economy or personal decisions. It rejects collectivism, statism, and all forms of coercion.",
