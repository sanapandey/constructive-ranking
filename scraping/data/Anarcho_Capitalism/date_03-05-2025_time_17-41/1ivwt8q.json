And let\u2019s not forget Trump\u2019s promise to establish a task force aimed at combating \u201canti-Christian bias\u201d in federal agencies, a move that panders directly to his Christian nationalist base.  \ufffc \ufffc\n\nBut it\u2019s not just about policy; it\u2019s about the company he keeps. Trump\u2019s inner circle is filled with figures who champion Christian nationalism, and his administration\u2019s initiatives reflect a concerted effort to embed these ideologies into the fabric of American governance. From reshaping federal agencies to reflect Christian values to actively courting the support of white evangelical Protestants, who overwhelmingly back him, Trump\u2019s actions speak louder than words. It\u2019s a calculated alliance, one that sees both Trump and Christian nationalists using each other to further their own agendas, all while undermining the pluralistic foundations of our democracy.  \ufffc\n\nBut sure, close your eyes if you want.",

While Trump is far from financially ignorant, I really doubt anyone outside of the crypto world really understands this shit. If Trump pump and dumped and sold his coins, then yeah that could be a rugpull but I'm not aware of that being the case... Did he hold his coins or sell them, or promise to hold the coins and sold them instead?",
