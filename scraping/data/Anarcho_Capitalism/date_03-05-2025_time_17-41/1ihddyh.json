I don\u2019t dwell on it. 90% of the people ahead of me in life are smarter or worked harder. 10% were lucky or inherited or something. The same is true in reverse. 90% of the people that are less successful are not as smart or did not work as hard or both. 10% were unlucky.\u00a0\n\nBut the biggest fallacy is believing that someone else\u2019s success is to your detriment. The inventor of the tractor saved countless hours of human labor. \u00a0Before modern equipment 80-90% of us were farmers. When they came inventedr farm equipment we fell down to 2%. And yet this did not cause massive unemployment. It freed us up to do better jobs and advance the world in other ways. That tractor inventor probably got rich. But it did not make everyone else more poor. It made the whole world more rich.\u00a0",

Capital (money, machinery, ownership) cannot generate value on it's own. When workers strike, production stops, and revenue also stops. This proves capital is like an invisible whip, not a source of value.\n\n>Capital and entrepreneurial creativity do too\n\nCapital's \"value\" is abstract, you can't eat money or shares. Entrepreneurship and creativity are human traits, not capitalist inventions. Capitalist systems actually stop creativity and innovation by subjecting it to profits - patents, rent seeking, or no worker autonomy - people sometimes work like slaves in more than one job to sustain themselves and have no time for anything.\n\n>without these, the workers wouldn't have jobs\n\nThis is inverting cause and effect. Labor predates capitalism, humans worked collectively for thousands of years without bosses or wages to meet their needs and always on the quest to maximize freedom. Capitalism didn\u2019t \"create\" jobs - it monopolized access to resources. And the jobs are coercive arrangements where workers accept wages far below the value they produce or else they will be laid off or not hired which will take away their access to resources which they need to survive, gated by profit driven private ownership.\n\n>equality is an idea which you're trying to impose on reality\n\nEconomic inequality, like racism and sexism, is a social construct enforced by capitalist propaganda. Workers create all wealth through labor, yet capitalists hoard it by controlling production increasing inequality. Capitalism only looks at infinite growth and ignores inequality, conflating wealth with \"merit\" while trapping workers in wage slavery. Meritocracy is a lie. Profit seeking isn't human nature, we evolved through cooperation, not competition. Equality isn't utopian, it\u2019s dismantling systems that reward hoarding over humanity. No one deserves poverty or artificial scarcity, just as no one deserves supremacy based on race, gender, or inherited wealth.",

When workers strike, production stops, and revenue also stops.  \nI don't know why you think this is a good argument. Of course when you take away labour, a critical input in value creation, production would stop. But the same holds true of capital - if you take away the factory and the money needed to pay all the bills, the workers would have to return home. If you take away the founder's creativity and resourcefulness, the business would not have been there at all, and would fail under changing circumstances without continued creativity at the top.\n\n\\> Capitalist systems actually stop creativity and innovation by subjecting it to profits - patents, rent seeking, or no worker autonomy - people sometimes work like slaves in more than one job to sustain themselves and have no time for anything.  \nThere has been more creativity under capitalism than ever before in human history. Yes, low skilled workers whose input is of low value do struggle with their lives, but humans have always struggled- today the proportion of humans not having to struggle like slaves is greater than ever before. I am a worker myself but a high skilled one, and I definitely don't feel like a slave.  \nAlso, you are vastly overestimating the number of people who are actually creative. Laziness and lack of ambition are overpowering traits of many people, which are contributors to why they are in dead-end jobs in the first place.\n\n\\> This is inverting cause and effect.\n\nNot at all. Let's think about cause and effect in the case of Amazon - Amazon workers only have jobs today because Jeff Bezos was creative enough to conceptualize a new solution for shopping, put his career and money on the line to make it happen, and then persevered through years of being unprofitable while continually solving new problems.  \nIn your worldview, Amazon would have existed since the Big Bang, and Jeff Bezos would have sold his soul to the devil for $100 billion and captured all the resources of Amazon, thereby taking away the creative potential of people shuffling boxes in warehouses who would have been Picassos and Einsteins were it not for Jeff Bezos.\n\n\\>Economic inequality, like racism and sexism, is a social construct enforced by capitalist propaganda\n\nNah, you have it backwards. The social construct is actually the idea of Equality. E.g., the constitution of the United States says 'All men are created equal' - pretty much an explicit declaration of social construction. If you actually think about it, what does two human beings being 'Equal' even mean? In math, if you say 2+2 equals 4, you know exactly what that means - the left-hand side of the equation is exactly the same as the right-hand side. But clearly, two humans are never the same, then how can they be 'Equal'? The idea that human beings are equal is purely ideological, having taken hold since around the French and America Revolutions.\n\n\\> Meritocracy is a lie.\n\nAre you seriously saying that two human beings can't have varying degrees of merit, i.e. ability and willingness to contribute?\n\n\\> we evolved through cooperation, not competition\n\nIt's not an either/or. We evolved through both. Competition has always existed - e.g. tribes killing each other for land/resources (and within tribes, for who will be the leader) - now the competition is more peaceful, more individual (which has its pros and cons, but more pros in my opinion), and more productive.",
