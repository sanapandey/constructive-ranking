Thus only agreeing with two of my claims.\n\nSeveral responses tried but only got silent when asked basically this: Once the power concentrates, as is generally agreed upon, what\u2019s to stop that power from abusing it? Expanding it. Even upon those that don\u2019t agree with it?\n\nAnd so my two points still stand and remains undisputed: The Anarcho-Capitalist society will always reverse to the current state, thus being utopian. And in the process millions will die, thus being dangerous.",

No one is forced to participate in a system they don\u2019t like. Unlike a state, where you\u2019re taxed and controlled without consent, an AnCap society (or even a somewhat AnCap one) allows governance to be subject to market forces. Bad actors can\u2019t just seize power through elections or military force\u2014they have to provide value.  \n\nAnd let\u2019s be real\u2014hundreds of millions of people *already* died under socialism, fascism, and other centralized state systems. The danger isn\u2019t a lack of regulation; it\u2019s unchecked power, which always comes from the state. How would Nazi Germany have ever built tanks without first *robbing* its citizens through taxation?",

A true AnCap could answer this better, but I\u2019ll try nonetheless.  \n\n> How exactly does AnCap establish a system where force isn\u2019t an option?\n\nIf every citizen and company is armed, collectives will naturally form to protect each other. In cases where conflicts can\u2019t be resolved through private courts, yes, violence *could* occur\u2014but it would be localized and short-lived. In contrast, states suppress these small conflicts, allowing tensions to escalate into large-scale oppression and wars.  \n\nIn a free market society, the majority values freedom, meaning any entity trying to enforce tyranny would face resistance, both from armed individuals and competing protection services. Yes, in theory, some group *could* develop a superweapon and take over\u2014but what\u2019s the probability? 1%? That\u2019s still far better than handing the state *absolute* power from the start, ensuring oppression from day one.  \n\n> What\u2019s to stop one of those structures from taking over others who don\u2019t comply?\n\nThis is why I advocate for a minimal state\u2014a thin layer acting as a safeguard against coercion. Essentially, a state that is *anti-statist* in nature. For example, it could enshrine the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) and natural rights in its constitution, making it a state designed to limit state power itself. You get what I mean?  \n\nBut back to AnCaps: They would argue that armed individuals, private defense agencies, and voluntary associations would prevent power from concentrating. I find it difficult to implement in practice\u2014hence why I lean toward Minarchism or something like that...\n\n> People are power-hungry and will always seek to expand control. \n\nWhich is exactly why \"Hoppeanism\" (Hans-Hermann Hoppe\u2019s argument for private, decentralized governance) exists\u2014to counter that reality. The difference? In a state, power is centralized and almost impossible to escape. In a decentralized market, competition and voluntary association keep power in check.",
