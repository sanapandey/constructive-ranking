Actual, unironic communists are allowed to take over whole subs, some communities are allowed to brigade while others get banned for fake shit, there were 2 separate reports over the last 6 months about active astroturfing campaigns for Kamala and *literal terrorist propaganda,* and nothing was done about it.\n\n\n\nI'm just tired of EVERY. SINGLE. SUBREDDIT. being spammed constantly with blatant propaganda, then getting in trouble for \"abusing the report function,\" when I report them. It's just no fun anymore. Even the subs I used to really like, like PCM, are practically unusable.\n\n\n\n\nIs there anywhere else that I can go to where I can talk with like minded Ancap/Libertarian types that isn't an astroturfed hell hole? Hell, I'm considering going back to Facebook at this point. This place is just miserable.",

[Price Theory](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Price_Theory/PThy_ToC.html) by David Friedman\n\n4. Any other mainstream econ textbooks as far into the subject as you can handle with as much of the math as you can handle; but I do recommend starting with Modern Principles of Economics by Alex Tabbarok and Tyler Cowan.\n\n5. [The Calculus of Consent](http://files.libertyfund.org/files/1063/Buchanan_0102-03_EBk_v6.0.pdf) by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock\n\n6. Any other mainstream political economy texts or works, but I recommend Governing the Commons by Elinor Ostrom, and though not a book, [Mike Munger's intro to political economy course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEJy2f_EWBqX1yIF-VP1MJsgnYy8OLK7t&si=LEgVKe5rGO9-Qz4-) available on YouTube.\n\n7.
