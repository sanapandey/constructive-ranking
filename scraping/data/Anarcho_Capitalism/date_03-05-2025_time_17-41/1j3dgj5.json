If you're any other bracket it's like top 2 or 3 for overall tax burden.\u00a0\n\n\nProperty tax is really the only tax. They do vehicle registration and inspection. But they're pushing a bill to remove the inspection. Hb649. There's some hotel tax and hot meal tax, or done in tax. I can't recall it's specifics.\u00a0\n\n\nThey also passed a law recently that said it's up to whoever owns the shitter to decide the gender trans thing on usage. And it's up to each individual school(or school district, can't recall)\n\n\nThey also have the \"education freedom account\" where some of your money will follow the child if you take them somewhere other than public school. It's like 3-5k per kid. Which is about a years worth of property tax in a lot of areas here.\u00a0\n\n\nEdit, forgot to mention the freestate project and YAL(young Americans for liberty)\n\n\nBoth have heavy presence in NH and push for less government.

Texas use to (still could) have a law about a set number of cows and you're able to define it as farm land and get like half off your property taxes. But they also had other sources of taxes.\u00a0\n\n\nI think NH is really strict on loop holes cause it's their only revenue.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nEdit\nSorry I got distracted and sent the comment before I meant too.\u00a0\n\n\nYeah I just don't do it. It's illegal. But supporting the system and giving justification of the inspection by participating in it is immoral.\u00a0\n\n\nPretty sure if you register your vehicle as a farm truck you can get out of it. I don't know the stipulations around how to qualify for that. I have a farm truck, but it's not registered and it's running out of state expired plates.\u00a0\n\n\nI actually was going to do the legal thing, but the town is pretty small and the town clerk/DMV is only open 2 days a week each for half a day. There's something there about shit government workers, but she's literally everything, and I'm pretty sure she doesn't get paid to do any of it. The town has like 1300 people.\u00a0",
