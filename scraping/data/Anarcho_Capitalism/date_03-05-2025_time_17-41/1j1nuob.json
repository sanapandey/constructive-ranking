    "selftext": "I've seen a lot of debates on whether FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) is inherently socialist or capitalist. Some argue it's a pure expression of socialism, while others say it's the pinnacle of capitalism.\n\nOne comment that stood out to me was:\n\n>FOSS embodies what's called Socialist Competition, where good ideas are spread freely, so everyone can benefit as quickly as possible.\n\n>Capitalist competition, so-called by Schumpeter as \"Creative Destruction\" involves keeping one's ideas to one's self, in order to obtain competitive advantage. Think 'Trade Secrets'.\n\nThis completely misunderstands how FOSS works and why it thrives. FOSS isn\u2019t some rejection of capitalism\u2014it\u2019s a product of market forces. The difference is that instead of capturing value through direct sales, open-source projects monetize through services, donations, and reputation.\n\nThe biggest reason FOSS is viable is the nature of software itself. It's an infinite resource. Unlike physical goods, software has zero marginal cost. Once written, it can be copied and distributed infinitely without additional production costs. This is why open-source models work so well\u2014there\u2019s no scarcity in the product itself, only in the expertise, labor, and infrastructure around it.\n\nFOSS succeeds because it aligns with market incentives. It allows companies and individuals to build on existing work rather than reinvent the wheel, accelerating innovation while still allowing for monetization through support services, enterprise solutions, or dual licensing. There\u2019s no contradiction here\u2014open-source software is leveraged by massive corporations (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) because it provides real value.\n\nI ran into this philosophical problem myself while developing software that I want the public to use for free. But for certain features that require cloud hosting, computing power, or other finite resources, I need to charge a subscription\u2014purely because those resources cost *me* money to provide. The software itself remains free, but the infrastructure to run some of its coolest features isn\u2019t.\n\nWhat many people miss is that FOSS is still a product of capitalism\u2014just not in the traditional \"sell a product for money\" way. Beyond direct monetization, one of the biggest incentives for FOSS development is **credibility**. Developers who create successful FOSS projects gain reputation, which can later be monetized through job offers, consulting, sponsorships, or launching their own businesses. The idea that FOSS is somehow detached from capitalism ignores the fact that the market rewards those who contribute to it\u2014even if the value isn\u2019t captured immediately.\n\nRather than being a rejection of capitalism, FOSS is an example of how voluntary cooperation and market incentives can coexist. It\u2019s not about government intervention or forced collectivism\u2014it\u2019s about people freely choosing to share their work because they recognize the long-term benefits. In that sense, FOSS isn\u2019t anti-capitalist at all\u2014it\u2019s just another way the free market allocates value.",

            "body": "Yeah, fully agree. FOSS is refutation of at minimum two arguments that are often being made *against* free markets\n\n1) Products will only be produced if there's a monetary benefit\n2) Copyrights and patents are necessary to motivate creators to produce\n\nObviously, there is a profit, as you correctly pointed out, it's just not monetary. Note that for the Socialist Competition argument to hold there would have to be no profit whatsoever. And that's not happening, as can be shown by countless FOSS projects that have disappeared because they didn't get traction or the creator decided to invest their time in more *profitable* things.",

The Linux foundation, which pays Linus' bills, is nearly all funded by corporations. Corporations have all just realized that developing a common platform is beneficial for them financially.",

The primary reason I do PR's on bugs I've fixed in software I'm interested in using is because it's less of a hassle than having to fix the bug again and again in every new release. Incorporating the fix into the code base lets you move on and not think about it any more.\n\nLinus Torvalds has said that the vast majority of Linux devs make one or two PR's and then are never seen again. Although I'm not aware of any surveys to back it up, it makes perfect sense that this majority of one shot devs are doing the same thing as me, and it's purely out of self-interest, not for any altruistic reasons.\n\nThere is also a hierarchy in every FOSS project I've seen, with the originator of the project making the final decision on code inclusion and the direction of the project. The position can be handed off to someone else but it's not done democratically. As far as I'm aware socialism and monarchy are mutually exclusive.\n\nAll of that is not to say that there aren't socialists that write FOSS for socialist reasons, but socialism is certainly not intrinsic to FOSS. Sorry socialists, but you don't own cooperation.",

Once developed, there is zero marginal cost to reproduce it and obtain value from it.  \n\nAttempting to monetize it in the manner of a physical product never made a lot of sense in the first place -- it worked early on because the distribution of software was via physical media, and when that was coupled with copyright laws, we had a situation where the only legal way to obtain a copy of a software product was to purchase a physical boxed copy.  \n\nThat model has declined, and as a result, new methods to earn a profit on the initial capital investment of developing software have evolved.",
