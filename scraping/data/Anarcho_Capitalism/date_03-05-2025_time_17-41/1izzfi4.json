                    "body": "I had chat GPT calculate wraparound care for 18 years for the 12 million illegal aliens presuming four kids born here per couple, including head start, public education, section 8 housing, healthcare, cash benefits, ebt, and court costs were looking at 50 trillion dollars in benefits over 18 years just for the twelve million that came into the country.\n\n\n\nHere you go:\n\nI got back, appears around $1 million per child from birth to 18.  Of the 12 million illegals only had an average of two kids per couple, that would cost around $12 trillion over 18 years, plus the costs of their parents benefits.  With 4-5 kids on average.  It\u2019s more like $50 trillion over 18 years or 2-3 trillion per year.\n\nThe total cost of a child born to an undocumented immigrant in California depends on various factors, including the specific benefits received, the duration of support, and the administrative costs involved. However, estimates vary widely depending on the assumptions used.\n\nHere\u2019s a general breakdown of potential costs:\n\t1.\tEducation (K-12 & Head Start):\n\t\u2022\tThe average annual cost per student in California public schools is around $18,000 (varies by district).\n\t\u2022\tOver 13 years (K-12): $234,000\n\t\u2022\tHead Start (2 years): Around $20,000 total\n\t2.\tHealthcare:\n\t\u2022\tIf covered by Medi-Cal, the cost varies, but for a child, it could be around $3,000 - $5,000 per year, totaling $54,000 - $90,000 over 18 years.\n\t\u2022\tBirth and maternal care: $10,000 - $25,000 (if covered by public programs).\n\t3.\tFood Assistance:\n\t\u2022\tIf eligible for CalFresh (food stamps) & WIC, benefits could total $3,000 - $6,000 per year, or about $54,000 - $108,000 over 18 years.\n\t4.\tHousing Assistance:\n\t\u2022\tIf receiving Section 8 or similar aid, annual costs might be $10,000 - $20,000, potentially totaling $180,000 - $360,000 over 18 years.\n\t5.\tCash & Welfare Benefits:\n\t\u2022\tPrograms like TANF might provide $4,000 - $7,000 per year, totaling $72,000 - $126,000 over 18 years.\n\t6.\tLegal & Administrative Costs:\n\t\u2022\tCourt, law enforcement, and administrative costs vary widely but could be $5,000 - $20,000 per case.\n\nEstimated Total Lifetime Cost (Birth to 18) in California:\n\nLow estimate: ~$500,000\nHigh estimate: $1,000,000+\n\nThese estimates are highly dependent on actual benefits received, and not all children born to undocumented parents qualify for all these programs. Additionally, children born in the U.S. are citizens and may contribute to the economy over time. Would you like specific sources or more details?",
