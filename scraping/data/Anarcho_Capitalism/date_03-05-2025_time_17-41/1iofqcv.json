            "body": "Marx says the plebs will rise up and topple the Elite. In reality whenever they get power, in history, they start behaving like the Elite. Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class provides the answers for why that pattern keeps happening. Its a hard job once a marxist gets into power to get everyone (given all our differences and goals) to row in the same direction based on just ideology. Its much easier with Veblen style Conspicuous consumption/leisure where the message is - hey man look at me, look where i live, look who i hang out with, look what i eat, look what i wear, look what toys I have, if you want to gain access to all that - do what i say.",

                    "body": "You\u2019re not wrong that power has a tendency to corrupt, and Veblen\u2019s Theory of the Leisure Class makes solid points about status, consumption, and hierarchy. But this doesn\u2019t actually refute Marx\u2014it just explains why socialist revolutions have often been co-opted by opportunists who recreate the same class structures they claimed to fight against. That\u2019s not a failure of Marxism as an analysis of capitalism\u2014it\u2019s a failure of implementing socialism in a way that prevents power from consolidating in the hands of a new ruling class.\n\nAnd sure, conspicuous consumption is an easy way to maintain control\u2014capitalism thrives on it. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the only way to organize society. If anything, Veblen\u2019s theory helps explain why capitalism is so effective at keeping people invested in a system that exploits them\u2014by making wealth aspirational rather than something to challenge. Just because something works to maintain power doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s desirable or just.\n\nThe real issue isn\u2019t whether people in power start acting like elites\u2014it\u2019s how to build systems that prevent that consolidation in the first place. Saying \u201cpower corrupts\u201d isn\u2019t a defense of capitalism; it\u2019s an argument for better checks and balances in any system, whether socialist or capitalist.",

But here\u2019s the thing- only the governments are able to conscript hundreds of thousands of people, or hire mercenaries that will get impunity from war crimes, and throw them in a meat grinder on the other side of the world. So all the corrupt capitalists are almost powerless without the backing of the government. I already feel there\u2019s going to be a rebuttal- but what if corporations hire their own armies?!!! Impossible and doesn\u2019t make any sense. Impossible because we live in the era of instant communication, high awareness, and disdain towards corrupt behavior. Good luck finding enough idiots that would voluntarily go to war today. Doesn\u2019t make sense - Walmart will have their employees round up people in camps and force them to work\u2026 so they can provide them with shelter and food? Do you think someone is going to do business with Walmart if they do that? Please explain to me your fears, as I can\u2019t even imagine such problem today. \n\n\u201cThe corruption in communist countries is negligible compared to this.\u201d\n\nThis is hilarious to me. I was born in the USSR and I\u2019ve learned what corruption is before I learned how to read. You must have learned history from soviet textbooks if you think corruption in communist/socialist regimes was negligible. The audacity of capturing territories and use them as farm fields with force labor while the center decides which cities get all the money is enough to understand how fucked up that system was. You can also check mixed systems that exist today, like Vietnam, and compare their corruption to the level of corruption in western democracies. \n\n\u201cWho sold off resources while taking foreign aid causing famines? The era in which USSR had famines was in periods of war and turmoil, had nothing to do with the economic system.\u201d\n\nThe scientist\u2019s name you can\u2019t remember is Trofim Lysenko who also caused soviet famine of 1933-1933. There war that Soviets were involved at the time is the war against their own population.\n\nFamines caused by natural disasters- all natural disasters were local. China and Soviet Russia are/were massive countries, that could easily pull enough resources together to help the people of affected regions. Yet it\u2019s the capitalist countries that sent aid. Why? Because communist/socialist economies were in abysmal condition, otherwise they would have food or money to buy food from other countries. And the Soviets where selling wheat, which ended up in what\u2019s recorded in history as Holodomor. \n\nIt\u2019s funny that you completely ignored the part about China\u2019s and Russia\u2019s expansionism, and all repressions, like it\u2019s not related to this argument at all. \n\n\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t real communism!\u201d Fuck that. Just like \u201cit\u2019s not real democracy\u201d, fuck that too. \n\n\nSerious question, I\u2019d appreciate if you answer this. You can even ignore the rest of my reply if you want to. \n\n\u201cThere's no mechanism to stop corruption, it's exponentially more in capitalism and will continue to grow with the massive wealth inequalities.\u201d\n\nWould you care for wealth inequality if people that are willing to work car have a very comfortable living? Meaning there will be some ultra wealthy people, but anybody who\u2019s willing and able to work can have a good apartment/house, good reliable vehicle, savings, etc.",

Production is limitless. We can always make more. Humanity is scarce. Therefore, if everyone produces at the efficiency required to satisfy everyone, then everyone will be satisfied. \n\n>You're misunderstanding what communism is - it's based on needs, and everyone contributes with labor.\n\nWithout prices you can't efficiently distribute goods most efficiently, or even without a loss.

There's no profit motive to hoard, everyone does their thing.\n\nIgnoring the fact that this would cause production to completely stop due to not needing to work, this only works if you anniahlate scarcity. That's impossible. Everything physical is scarce.\n\n>the only system that ensures there's always inequality and deprivation for a class is capitalism.\n\nCollectives don't exist. They can't have power. They're abstractions and nothing more.   \n\nWho gives a shit about inequality? Nobody is equal. Stop trying to force them to be. Everyone has subjective values and goals, and it is a disservice to deprive them of what they want for some misguided attempt at \"equality.\"\n\n>You might be surprised to find out how many people starved under British capitalism\n\nThere has never been an era of British Capitalism. \n\n>how many still die today due to economic violence stemming from inequalities that you're unaware of.\n\nCapitalism currently has no place in the world to call home at the moment.

It claims legal authority. In so doing, it denies the existence of property. \n\n>Without the state, many rich people restricting resources would be taken out by mobs.\n\n\"Rich people restricting resources.\" You mean the state? The state. That which claims the legal authority to regulate. Capitalism is anarchy. The state is a public sector abstraction. \n\n>Production is not infinite. What are you even on about.\n\nYes, it is. We can always produce more. There is no fixed pie. That is a fallacy. \n\n>it\u2019s because production under capitalism is based on profit, not need.\n\nYou can only profit by fulfilling the needs of others.\n\n>We produce enough food to feed 10 billion people, yet millions starve because food is treated as a commodity, not a right\n\nFood is not a right. There is no conflict that occurs when you are starving by refusing to procure food. \n\n>Millions of the humanity you call scarce die each year because of it.\n\nThey may be able to survive had states not stolen all of their wealth and restricted access to food. People must work in order to eat. It is required by nature. Food does not just appear out of nowhere. It must be produced. \n\n>With prices, goods are not efficiently distributed\n\nYes, they are. They take into account every factor that goes into production and then distribute it to the person that would make the greatest use of it. We know they will make the greatest use of it due to them being able to outbid other people. \n\n>Needs are determined in communities\n\nNo, they aren't. You can't measure needs, as I have previously stated.   \n\nYou have a tortured, broken epistemology. \n\n>There are basic needs like food, water, shelter, and healthcare, which is prioritized with no debate\n\nYes, and people are not entitled to them. That would be slavery. It would violate the rights of those who produce those goods to claim that you should enslave them. \n\n>democratically\n\nDemocracy sucks. 10 people vote to rape the 11th guy. Suddenly, that's good, according to you. They \"need\" to do it, after all. Otherwise, they wouldn't have voted for it. \n\n>Prices and inequalities out-price you to access essentials.\n\nThey'd be a lot cheaper if the state didn't enslave everyone. \n\n>People are not inherently lazy or solely motivated by profit.\n\nPeople want to do as little work as possible so that they can live a life of leisure. Implying that people enjoy doing hard work instead of leisure activities is an odd take. \n\n>Under communism, work is reorganized to serve collective needs\n\nThe collective is an abstraction. It does not \"need\" anything. This is an epistemological failure on your part. \n\n>Individuals are motivated to contribute to society, not just by profits.\n\nThat would be altruism, the most evil system of morality ever devised by humanity. You demand that man kill himself in the name of some collective. You condemn him for living for himself and attempting to improve his quality of life. \n\n>Resources are finite, but scarcity is artificially created in capitalism to keep up sales\n\nContradiction in terms. \"Resources are scarce, but scarcity is artificial.\"\n\n>Communism seeks to eliminate artificial scarcity and enable equitable distribution.\n\nEconomic calculation problem demolishes this argument. \n\n>It also emphasizes sustainable use of resources, because it prioritizes needs over profits and wastage, so it's more long term without eating up the planet\u2019s finite resources.\n\nOh yeah, like the Aral Sea!   \n\nCapitalism is the lowest time preference ideology possible, which is the opposite of democracy, the highest time preference possible.   \n\nIn practice, it is Capitalism that preserves resources for the future. That's called an investment. Democracy, however, demands that the rulers spend as much resources as possible to make themselves look good. \n\n>Collectives do exist - labor unions, cooperatives, collective farms and mutual aid networks.\n\nNope, those are abstractions. They don't exist. \n\n>Communism seeks to extend this collective power to all aspects of society, all decisions are made democratically and in the interest of the many, not the few. End authoritarianism in the workplace.\n\nCollectives can't hold power. They have no rights to hold it with. They have no consciousness. They have no physical body. They don't exist. They're abstractions. Only identifyable in the purpose of action for an individual. \n\n>Communism is not making everyone identical, but eliminating systemic inequalities that deprive people of basic needs and opportunities. A level playing field for everyone regardless of your ambitions and goals.\n\nThat's what capitalism does. Demolishes the state and leaves every man equal under natural law. Legal anarchism is the only just, logically consistent, and equal legal system, unlike the legal authoritarianism you advocate for. \n\n>lmao ahistorical nonsense. Das Kapital was a critique of britsih capitalism, which was the dominant economic system of its time. To deny this is to ignore history.\n\nMarx's big book of bullshit defines capitalism as so broad as to include \"worker ownership of the means of production.\"   \n\nCorporations are socialist. The state is socialist.    \n\nCapitalism is private ownership of property. Socialism is public control of property.   \n\nCorporations are public, the state is public. \n\n>Capitalism, as it exists today, is defined by exploitation, inequality, and environmental destruction.\n\nCapitalism is defined as private ownership of property. Historically, states have been the most exploitative, being big extortion rackets. The states have caused the most devastation to people, and it's not even close.    \n\nYour definition is wrong because it is an epistemological failure. Your methodology of concept formation is arbitrary and false. \n\n>If you want to argue that this isn\u2019t \"real capitalism,\" then you\u2019re admitting that the system you defend has never actually worked as intended.\n\nNobody has ever tried to manifest capitalism. They always try to place everything into the hands of the state. They give the state legal authority.   \n\nThat is not capitalism. Capitalism is legal anarchy. \n\n>collective ownership\n\nCollective ownership is a contradiction, floating abstraction, and stolen concept fallacy. It is not real. \n\n>democratic planning, and equitable distribution\n\nThe economic calculation problem ensures that this is a terrible argument to make. \n\n>It\u2019s stifled everywhere not because it doesn\u2019t work, but because it threatens the ability of capitalists to exploit resources for personal profit. \n\nYour system is everywhere. The whole world is controlled by states.

Literally which people or person is making the decision?\n\nIt's democratic and in community driven - they decide what is produced and how resources are allocated. Eg - If a community has a need for defibrillators, they would propose this in local or regional assemblies. Production plans are then adjusted based on collective input, reflecting the needs of the people, not based on profits of a few. People are shitty today, because they are indoctrinated with a capitalist system where survival is tied to competition and exploitation.\n\n\\>How do they decide what is a need or not? Is it put to a vote?\n\nYes, needs are determined democratically. Communism operates on meeting human needs first. Basic needs like food, water, shelter, education, healthcare is universally recognized and prioritized without debate. Socially necessary needs like public transport and services are voted on by communities. Luxuries like xboxes are considered only after essential needs are met. Unlike capitalism, where market forces prioritize luxury goods for the wealthy in a speculative market run by wealthy neglecting basic needs.\n\n\\>What if the majority votes that you don\u2019t need an Xbox?\n\nIf the majority decides that xboxes are not a priority, that\u2019s a feature, not a bug. Communism is about meeting collective needs, not indulging individual greed at the expense of others. You do realize this is what that's happening right or are you completely oblivious? Luxuries are not banned, but their production is secondary to essential goods. If communities determine that xboxes are needed, they allocate surplus resources to produce them.\n\n\\>What if too many Xboxes are created and not enough defibrillators?\n\nProduction in planned economies is based on needs, planning and data, not based on market speculation like it exists today. This case especially wouldn't happen, if there are people in need of defibrillators, resources are prioritized to them.\n\n\\>What if the planning resulted in a shortage? What then?\n\nShortages can occur in any system, but communism is equipped to address them. Without private property, there's no need to create artificial scarcity, resources are moved around and allocated rapidly to address shortages. Shortages are also addressed democratically and transparently, there's no corporation or government trying to protect profits.\n\n\\>How is it determined which resources and in what quantities are allocated to anything? Through planning? LMAO\n\nDemocratic planning. The idea that planning is flawed is a capitalist myth. Planning eliminates waste and ensures that everyone\u2019s basic needs are met, creating a society where no one is forced to choose between survival and luxury. In reality, capitalist markets are very inefficient, producing useless goods, advertising to create demand, planned obsolesces to keep up sales - while leaving millions without basic necessities.",

A cat from Congo is still a regular cat if it lives in US, there's nothing special about it. Tying that national identity to worth and currency is nationalism and justifies inequality, exploitation and the discrimination that comes with it, all of which are essential for capitalism.\n\nSelf sorting is like saying, \"We'll preserve our particular system of exploitation here, and you lot can do your thing\". The hope that even Stalin had was that we would build socialism in the USSR, and others would look at us as an example, rise up, and follow in time, which *did* happen, with an eventual withering away of the state and the rise of a needs based economy devoid of profits. But the illegal dissolution in 1991 (77% of all people voted to preserve it), was a huge blow, which is misrepresented as a failure of socialism, but was a result of cold war dynamics, sanctions and the economic troubles that came about due wars because of US intervention.",

It comes from The Black Book of Communism, which has been widely criticized for lumping together famines, wartime casualties, and misattributed deaths to inflate numbers. If we\u2019re measuring ideology by body count, capitalism has racked up an even higher toll through imperialism, colonialism, poverty, and preventable disease. But playing this numbers game ignores the real conversation: no system is perfect, and historical failures don\u2019t invalidate entire ideas.\n\nNo one is arguing that your daily life should be dictated by \u201cdemocratic votes.\u201d That\u2019s a strawman. The argument for socialism isn\u2019t about micromanaging personal choices\u2014it\u2019s about democratizing the economy so that wealth and decision-making aren\u2019t concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite. Right now, a few billionaires have more power over your job, your rent, and your wages than any vote ever could. Giving workers more say in their workplaces doesn\u2019t eliminate individual freedom\u2014it actually expands it by making sure people aren\u2019t just subject to the whims of the ultra-rich.\n\nAnd yes, people are individuals. No one is denying that. But pretending that capitalism respects individuality while socialism supposedly treats everyone like drones is nonsense. Under capitalism, your choices are already limited\u2014by what you can afford, where you\u2019re born, and whether you have the right connections. The real issue isn\u2019t \u201ccollectivism vs. individualism,\u201d it\u2019s whether we want a system where a handful of people dictate the conditions of everyone else\u2019s lives just because they own everything.",

In many cases, the policies were directly responsible for mass starvation. The Holodomor, for example, was partly caused by Stalin\u2019s decision to confiscate tools and food from Ukrainian farmers, which was a deliberate action aimed at punishing them. That said, the issue here isn\u2019t with communism itself\u2014it\u2019s with how authoritarian regimes twisted those ideas for control. When central authority is given too much power, bad things can happen, regardless of the political system in place.\n\nBut let\u2019s not ignore that famines and genocides have also occurred under capitalist systems. Take the Irish Potato Famine, for example. British policies, which prioritized profit over the welfare of the Irish people, led to the death of millions. Famines aren\u2019t just a communist problem\u2014they\u2019re a consequence of economic systems that value profit over human lives. It\u2019s not so much about the theory behind a system, but about how it\u2019s used by those in power.\n\nNow, regarding imperialism and colonialism\u2014you're right that they\u2019ve existed under various political systems, including Rome, the Soviet Union, and China. But imperialism and colonialism are often driven by the need to expand and control territory, and under capitalism, that expansion is often motivated by the desire for resources and profit. The British Empire didn\u2019t colonize places like India or Africa just to control land\u2014it was about extracting resources to feed the growth of capitalist industries. So, while imperialism and colonialism can happen under any regime, capitalism has often been a driving force behind those actions, with economic gain fueling colonial expansion.\n\nThe problem with capitalism isn\u2019t just the exchange of goods\u2014it\u2019s the inequality it creates. It thrives on exploiting people and resources, and that inequality often leads to colonial practices or economic domination. So, while imperialism is a political move, capitalism is the economic engine that often makes those moves possible.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to confuse terms, but when we talk about these systems, we need to think about how the economic system and political power play off each other. Both authoritarian socialism and unchecked capitalism concentrate power in the hands of a few, and that\u2019s where the problem lies. Whether under a communist regime or a capitalist one, power imbalance leads to exploitation and suffering.",

This concentration undermines the very autonomy it claims to protect, as economic power shapes policy and limits the ability of individuals to make decisions in their best interest.\n\nDecentralization, in its true sense, involves spreading power out to local communities, individuals, and workers, rather than allowing a few to control the majority of resources. In the U.S., the capitalist structure, with its corporate monopolies and wealth concentration, doesn't provide this kind of autonomy for most people. It often leaves individuals at the mercy of market forces and corporate decisions.",

But to say communism itself caused those events is a bit simplistic\u2014it\u2019s more accurate to say that authoritarian regimes, whether under communism, fascism, or otherwise, often wield power in corrupt and brutal ways That\u2019s a failure of authoritarianism, not the ideology itself. Marxism, in theory, is not about dictating people\u2019s lives or hoarding power\u2014it\u2019s about collective ownership and the dismantling of class structures that perpetuate inequality. The problem arises when these ideals are hijacked by leaders who prioritize control over collective benefit.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that the global capitalist hegemony has historically been invested in crushing any attempt to implement socialism or communism. Take, for instance, the CIA\u2019s involvement in the overthrow of democratically elected socialist governments, like in Chile with the coup against Salvador Allende in 1973. Or consider how the U.S. supported brutal dictatorships in places like Iran and Indonesia, not because they were anti-communist but because they were willing to maintain capitalist interests. One of the clearest examples of this is the U.S. embargo against Cuba. When the Cuban government nationalized American-owned businesses that were extremely profitable, the U.S. responded with severe sanctions, aimed at economically suffocating the country and undermining its socialist policies. These sanctions, which have lasted for decades, severely impacted Cuba\u2019s ability to build a functional economy and have contributed to the difficulties the country has faced in achieving its goals. The political and economic sabotage of countries attempting socialism played a huge role in their failure to build stable systems\u2014foreign intervention, economic blockades, and sanctions, which made it nearly impossible for these countries to function as intended.\n\nAs for your claim that socialism micromanages personal choices\u2014sure, we can point to cases where authoritarian socialist governments have controlled housing or resources. But that\u2019s not what socialism, in its ideal form, is supposed to be. It\u2019s about redistributing wealth and power more equally, not rewarding loyalty to a party. Capitalism, on the other hand, rewards those who already have wealth and power, regardless of their contributions to society.\n\nAnd the idea that socialism always leads to an elite in power? That\u2019s exactly what capitalism does as well\u2014just look at the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few billionaires. Sure, Musk doesn\u2019t \u201cdictate\u201d how you live, but his wealth and influence shape the political landscape, economic systems, and labor conditions. Do you really think he\u2019s not using his power to shape the world around him in ways that benefit him, regardless of your desires?\n\nThe truth is, whether it\u2019s communism, socialism, or capitalism, power is still concentrated in the hands of a few. The difference is, in capitalist societies, it\u2019s often hidden behind the veil of \"free markets\" and individualism. Just because you\u2019re not \"forced\" to use Musk\u2019s products doesn\u2019t mean the system isn\u2019t working to his benefit and your detriment. And let\u2019s not pretend that billionaires like him aren\u2019t using their power to influence governments, lobby for favorable policies, or build monopolies. In the end, both systems concentrate power\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of who gets to hold it and how it's justified.",

There are plenty of socialist countries they could have traded with.\n\nCapitalism just means free markets and private ownership of things. If there have been private armies murdering millions, it would be of interest to hear. Actions of the US are more than just \"capitalism\", a lot was going on in the world, cold war and so on, it's not simply isolated sabotage of socialist regimes.\n\nRedistributing wealth - who, in socialism, decides who deserves what? You don't have a market. You have an elite who decides what is \"fair\" and who deserves what. Even if you were to vote democratically, that wouldn't make it better. Even in democracies, you have to protect the population from the tyranny of the masses and the government. Also people are not all equal, why do they all deserve an equal share, even though some contribute more than others?\n\nAnd no, Musk doesn't harm me in any way.

But hear me out...\n\nTheoretically, let's say the average functioning person is \"a good person\" which I hope is usually the case. With capitalism, people vote with how hard they work and with money. I get 1 for 1 for my time, and my time is not worth anything, then I must find something else productive. If I think your product or service is crap, I will buy elsewhere. If \"society\" deems you as a problem, people stop giving you money. At a high level, as the majority of people are \"good\", the bad is dealt with accordingly within the society.\n\nWith communism or even socialism, you must trust an established organisation to do the right thing, which has never worked. You must trust ALL your peers will work the same as you or want to work the same as you. You must trust that your peers all want the same result as you. You must trust the central organisation to distribute your wealth fairly. IE, one person may want to work 84 hours a week, while the other wants to work 37.5 hours. Yet, one is disadvantaged by working harder as the goods are distributed evenly at the end of the day and conclusively the incentive to work harder is lost. What's to say the philosopher's time is worth more than an oil rig worker who works more and harder hours?\n\nEveryone thinks they deserve to earn more, relax more, have more... The only true way to evaluate how much you deserve is capitalism. I say I work hard and someone else says they work hard, but hard for them may be they made a painting while I farm the land.\n\nCapitalism only disadvantages the disadvantaged as they will not be as productive, however in capitalism you only have to trust the average person as a good person. This means, it's most likely that the average good person would put a small portion of their money to private organisation to help the disadvantaged that the individual deems productive.\n\nCapitalism allows 1 person to work 80 hours, and the other to work 37.5 hours and both will be happy. Compensation will be based on skill demand multiplied by hours worked.\n\nCONCLUSIVELY, I think communism is a great idea if we lived in an absolute utopia where everyone agrees the same way on everything, but we do not. It's like assuming no friction or air resistance on an engineering problem.",

                    "body": "First off, Marx, as an anti-utopian, wasn\u2019t about a utopia where everyone agreed on everything\u2014he was focused on the real problems of capitalism: class struggle, inequality, and exploitation. If we lived in a utopia, we wouldn\u2019t even need any socio-economic system because everyone would have what they needed.\n\nNow, the whole \"capitalism rewards hard work\" idea sounds good, but it ignores the fact that most people don\u2019t start from the same place. Capitalism loves to point out the rare success stories, but the truth is most people stay in the socio-economic class they were born into because the system is rigged to maintain that. And when you look at marginalized groups, like Black people in the U.S., studies show that a significant portion\u2014about 50%\u2014are likely to remain in poverty, no matter how hard they work. So, if capitalism really rewards hard work, why do these systemic injustices persist? It\u2019s not just about effort\u2014it\u2019s about how the system is designed to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few. Capitalism is especially invested in keeping minorities from holding equity in society\u2014particularly wealth\u2014because in a capitalist system, wealth is the most powerful means of affecting change. If we lack the capital to make any real changes, whether social or monetary, we\u2019re essentially at the mercy of the few. Things don\u2019t change just because the majority thinks they should; they change when an exceedingly small group of obscenely wealthy people decide they should. Just look at Elon Musk, who recently bought one of the most influential offices in global politics with a couple hundred million, and is now making decisions that impact your livelihood, the economy, and society at large\u2014simply because he\u2019s rich\n\nAnd sure, charity can help, but why should we have to rely on the generosity of a few when the system itself creates these inequalities? If the rich can afford to give millions or billions to charity each year, why can\u2019t they just pay their workers fairly to begin with? Charity becomes an unnecessary middleman when the real solution is fair wages. And if we\u2019re talking about the generosity of regular people, why should they be expected to make up the difference? It\u2019s like how restaurants don\u2019t pay workers enough and expect customers to cover the gap with tips. \n\nMarxism isn\u2019t about trusting everyone to work the same\u2014it\u2019s about collective action to fix the systemic issues. Capitalism doesn\u2019t reward hard work\u2014it rewards those who already have the power and resources. Capitalists expect people to survive on the charity of others doing slightly better, when pooling even a small fraction of resources could help create lasting solutions. The system is rigged to keep people from getting ahead without relying on the generosity of others, and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nSo, Marx didn\u2019t want a perfect world, he wanted a system where people could organize together to fight inequality and exploitation\u2014things that are built into capitalism from the start.",

Which is it? If history is just a collection of economic conditions shaping society, why did feudalism end in completely different ways across Europe?\n\nGermany \u2013 The state co-opted landowners by giving them military titles.\n\nFrance \u2013 The Revolution wasn\u2019t really driven by the bourgeoisie.\n\nNetherlands \u2013 The move away from feudalism was more about religion than capitalism.\n\nEngland \u2013 Being an island nation with naval dominance shaped its development more than class struggle.\n\nRussia \u2013 Skipped capitalism entirely, contradicting the supposed \"necessary\" order of history.\n\n\nIf history follows a dialectical pattern, why is it so inconsistent?\n\nAnd about collective property\u2014I don\u2019t mean \"contradiction\" as in \"it's difficult to manage,\" I mean it literally violates logic. Ownership means exclusive control, so if a collective owns something, every member has equal rights over it.\n\nBut what happens when A wants to trade X, B wants to consume X, and C wants to preserve X? If X is traded, then B and C weren\u2019t really owners. If B eats it, then A and C weren\u2019t really owners. Collective ownership leads to an impossible situation where something is both owned and not owned at the same time, violating the law of non-contradiction.\n\nThen there's the primacy of consciousness issue. You say material conditions shape people\u2019s beliefs, but if that\u2019s true, how can you know socialism is true? If beliefs are determined by class, then your belief in socialism is just a product of your material conditions, not truth.\n\nAnd what about Marx and Engels? By your logic, Engels\u2014being a capitalist\u2014should have been completely blind to socialism. Yet he was one of its main architects. If material conditions determine belief, how could he escape his class interest? Either:\n\n1. Truth is objective, and we can know reality beyond class influence (which refutes Marxist epistemology).\n\n\n2. Truth is class-based, in which case Marxism isn\u2019t \"true\", just convenient for its believers.\n\n\n\nEither way, Marxist epistemology collapses. So, what\u2019s your take?\"",

I reccomend you look into dialectical materialism for more about this. FInally as for coersion, it depends. For the ruling class? yes coercive force will have to be used. but for the ruling class, marxism seeks to gain their support by explaining why there interests are diametrically opposed to those of the ruling class. overall, im not in some fairy tale where the revolution will be bloodless",

The value depends on supply and demand.  \n  \nMoreover, the surplus value according to Marx is always conditioned by the profit which only happens after the goods have already been sold. Which means that Marx assumes the sale of goods as a given thing. He ignores that the Capitalist has to look for clients, build network, work on marketing and etc. and takes all the risk in case the sale doesn't happen. The sale is not a given thing. It doesn't just happen magically.   \nThat being said, it's not logical to base the surplus value on the profit. \n\nAlso, when the worker signs a contract to work on a factory or something, they are deliberately agreeing to sell their service in exchange of a fixed salary. They are not agreeing on having a percentage of the profit.  \nSo Marx ignores the legal value of the contract , which makes sense cuz he was a Materialist and thus didn't believe in Justice. But materialism is a flawed methodology. One cannot prove Materialism by using Materialism. \n\nLast but not least, much of what Marx wrote about the interaction of Capitalists and Workers and Means of Production is something that just applies to his time (industrial revolution era).  \nThe market has changed a lot and it's impossible to apply many of his concepts in todays world.   \nNowadays, you have Onlyfans models who become millionaire just by using a camera.   \nThey are the Capitalist and the Worker at the same time. So who are they exploiting?",
