If I kill you, you have the right to kill me in self defense. But say I failed, that doesn't give you the right to kill me a week later, if I'm not a danger to you. Or does that allow you to revenge kill me?

If there's a clear and present danger to you or someone else you can use proportional force. If you see two twelve year old fighting you can pull them apart, but if you see someone about to get stabbed you can kill them.

But that's the beautiful thing about both our justice system and the theoretical ancapistan system, which would be a great improvement over our system.\n\nThe reality is, you will never make people *not* take justice into their own hands (and this is a very good thing because we can't afford, nor would it be liberty promoting to have a cop on every street corner). In the vast majority of cases, people behave correctly. It is only in the rare minority that something sketchy happens that the actions of the individual are brought under scrutiny of his peers.\n\nEvery self defender knows they take their own life in their hands when they take some one else's too. They all know every minute detail will be examined when they decide to pull the trigger. It is an intense pressure. They *must* be absolutely sure because they will be cross examined.\n\nSo the question is not about whether we allow (or should allow) people to take justice into their own hands. The only question is what degree of certainty should we scrutinize people with?",

No?\n\nYes, I'm all for restitution based law, but lets be real. It does not and *cannot* apply in this case. No amount of money from a rapist to a victim makes the victim un-raped. She is permanently damaged.\n\nBesides, restitution based law leads to the terrible conclusion that only the middle class has any reason not to rape people. For the poor have nothing to pay in restitution, so there's no reason to prosecute (unless you believe in punitive law), and the rich have plenty of money to pay whatever the \"restitution\" need be. Only the middle class have enough money to pay restitution, but not enough money that they feel no sting from doing so.",

If you don't even think we should lock rapists up or have *any* punitive response, then I don't really care what else you think. You are my ideological enemy. There is no shared axiomatic base to discuss things over. You're a pansy leftist who doesn't think crime is crime.\n\nBut I would like to point out there's no way you can be consistent on this, because to be consistent you'd also have to say there should be no punitive action for dad breaking the rapists knee caps. sure, the rapist can try to defend himself before it happens, but after his knees bend both ways \"it's all in the past\" and \"there is no justification for any punitive action\".",
