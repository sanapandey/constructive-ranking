    "selftext": "What do I mean by not counting on morality? \n\nMorality means many things. For simplicity sake let's divide them by 2. Morality due to incentives and morality without. There are many between and this is an over simplification. \n\nCapitalistic morality is based on morality with incentives. \n\nhttps://oll.libertyfund.org/quotes/adam-smith-butcher-brewer-baker\n\nAdam is right. We don't count on morality to motivate CEO to do a good job creating great smartphones. Each do what's best. \n\nI am just extending Adam Smith idea. \n\nIf not due to kindness Baker's bakes bread, it's also not due to morality people don't steal. \n\nMorality with incentives works whether people are moral or immoral. \n\nIt's fair. \n\nIn a sense, capitalism is moral. It's the most moral system in the world. \n\nIn a sense it's immoral. It doesn't count on morality. Most do not see that as moral. We just take it for granted and it works. We don't even need to care or argue whether what a person do is moral or immoral. \n\nIf I can buy cost effective phones should I care that the CEO that did it do so out of profit or out of selfish greed. Most likely selfish greed and that is fine. \n\nIf a woman produce heirs that pass paternity tests, should I care that she really loves me or do it for money? No. \n\nThat's, in a sense, what true justice is. You don't care about people motives or morality. You get what you want because people are better off doing what you want. \n\nHow? Mainly by making things explicitly and clearly transactional without possibility of backstabbing. \n\nNot only people need to know it is their best interests to comply, that knowledge should be common knowledge. \n\nWar happened because Putin think he will get away with things. Because people don't know they will get justice or not. People steal because they don't know whether they will get caught or not. \n\nBut people don't defraud others much in Uber or eBay. The drivers know that if he is being a jerk he will get bad rating. Companies know that they will lost customers if they sell shody products. \n\nThis common knowledge of assured justice make them do what's economically productive. Nothing else. Nothing else much at least\n\nYou just care about the results and get results you want. That's capitalism. \n\nIf you care about people having Nobel motives you just get dishonesty and hypocrisy. \n\nThen there are morality without incentives. This is what people call true morality. If people are good because it is profitable to do so, is he a moral person. Most people would say no. \n\nThis morality is problematic. \n\nFirst it's unjust. If out of 100 people the one that's immoral is the one that makes more money, then it's unjust. \n\nSecond it doesn't work. We see most government officials are corrupt. We see communist countries are poor. \n\nIf the immoral guys are the one making money then people will be immoral. They will be lazy under capitalism or corrupt as government officials. \n\nThen what? How do we fix the problem? Nothing. Politicians will say oh people steal because they are immoral. We need more moral education\n\nSo some guy steal and the solution is to indoctrinate lots of innocent children that stealing is wrong. \n\nThat's scam. It doesn't work. But people do it again and again. \n\nTrue morality in a sense of morality even without incentives is overrated. It simply doesn't work. But people incorrectly think it works they count on it again and again. \n\nLook at marriage. So many divorces and suffering. Why? Not just because romance and love doesn't work. Because they don't work and people somehow think they do. That's what overrated mean. \n\nWhen I was young I wonder why I got scammed again and again till a psychopath told me something profound. There is no morality. People hurt me because they can.\n\nSince then I always presume people are untrustworthy and scammy and I am doing fine. Without fear of being scammed I become more successful because that's all I need from others. Fair trades and no agressions. That is all.\n\nFair trades and no agressions do not need morality. People trade with me fairly because I pay them. They don't hurt me because they can't. No morality is necessary. If morality is necessary I am out. I k ow I will fail. If I need to trust another person that means I am being scammed so I moved on. \n\nLook at communism. If everybody knows it doesn't work then communism is harmless. People just don't try. But it doesn't work and yet people believe that if somehow we put \"good\" People then it will work. It doesn't. \n\nThere is no such thing as good people. Only good incentives. \n\nTake away all proper incentives and what's left? Corruption, war, inefficiency. Nothing. Morality without incentive is highly overrated and most are scams anyway. \n\nSo far I am agreeing with libertarians and bashing communism. But libertarians make the same mistakes commies make. \n\nWhy many voters vote for communism or social democracy instead of capitalism? Most libertarians think it's because those non libertarians are evil. We get nowhere if we call other's evil. That means we care about morality. \n\nInstead we should think in terms of incentives. \n\nWhat's in it for voters to support capitalism? Most workers will have lower salary if they have to compete with immigrants. Most welfare parasites will starve without welfare. Why should they vote for libertarians party. The commies are factually correct. Most of us will not be a billionaire so why defend them. \n\nSo? So we bribe voters. We turn voters into shareholders. We create private for profit communities. Then we share profit to all eligible voters. So like prospera in Honduras. Instead of sharing profit with Honduras government share profit with Honduras voters. \n\nThe private cities will have proper capitalistic incentives. The voters in Honduras get free money rather than bullshit healthcare. The money starts small but it will be free from corruption. Like if we pay $100 million and there are 1 million voters then each got exactly $100. Politicians can't steal that because then the number will be off. \n\nThen what? Voters have more Incentives to allow more and more private cities and the whole world will evolve into many for profit communities and we will all get rich.",
