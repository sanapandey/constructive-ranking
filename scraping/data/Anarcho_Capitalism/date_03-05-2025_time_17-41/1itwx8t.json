People tell us  to look for personality.  \n  \nBut if we look for something nobody cares, like personality, nobody makes a fuss.   \n  \nWhy? Because if we are right everyone says we're wrong and when we are wrong everyone says we're right.  \n  \nAnd what is profitable and right is the exact opposites of what most people say.  \n  \nWhy?  \n  \nBecause humans have crab mentality they want us to suffer.  \n  \nThey too will pick pretty women irrelevant of personalities.  \n  \nJust like most pretty women will pick money instead of guys with personalities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y45pl0uxaake1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4d1dd5990aea983d80c9b1d1a53f5098b31f0d9\n\n  \n",
