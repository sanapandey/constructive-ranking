            "body": "You're misunderstanding Walter Block\u2019s argument. He isn\u2019t advocating for historical chattel slavery but defending the principle of voluntary contracts, even if that includes long-term labor agreements that some might label \"voluntary slavery.\" The key distinction is \"voluntary\". If someone freely enters an irrevocable contract, Block argues that libertarian principles should respect that. You can disagree, but calling him a \"moron\" for applying consistent property-rights logic is just lazy.\n\nAs for 1800s slavery, no serious libertarian, including Block, denies that it was a statist atrocity.",

Of course, this is why courts of law don't uphold promises but do enforce contracts.\n\nLet's make your example a porno shoot. If the woman signs the deal that she is to have sex with her costar on a future date and then reneges on that contract, she is liable to compensate the producer because she had an obligation to uphold her end and she failed to do so. Can they physically force her to perform the act? No.\n\nNow, in the case of the lifetime \"slavery\" contract, the issue would be the same, in my view.

One is that students loans as currently constructed are fundamentally different from other loans specifically because of state regulation.

An arbiter can make it more difficult for you to do business if you violate a contract and the arbiter rules in the other party's favor. \n\nIn the case of a \"slavery contract\" the slave \"owner\" would have to show losses as a result of the slave running away (\"violating the contract\"). If no wages were ever paid, what possible damages could there be for failing to honor what is essentially a promise? If wages were paid in advance of work agreed to contractually, then that's not a slavery contract, that's wage labor. Thus making this entire concept meaningless.",

They can rule, but have no power to force anyone to act in any way. The value of an arbiter is that if they rule against you and you do not comply with the ruling, your social standing in matters of business and personal conduct becomes diminished. Depending on how bad the situation is, it could be greatly diminished. Hence, you have an incentive to comply with an arbiter's ruling. \n\nIf I sign a piece of paper and agree to be your slave forever, in exchange for literally nothing, and five years later I change my mind and break the contract, what is the \"slave owner\" going to do? The arbiter cannot force someone to be a slave, and in all likelihood, their ruling would be to pay damages. What damages would a slave have to pay back to an owner? In all reality, the \"slave\" would likely value their freedom more than their reputation, and even if ordered to continue to be a slave, they would ignore it with little consequence. \n\nIn practice, a \"slavery contract\" would almost always be an agreement to work in exchange for some other benefit (usually a lump sum payment) in which case, it's not slavery anymore, it's wage labor. If you pay someone a million dollars in exchange for 20 years of work, and they change their mind after 10, the solution is almost always a payment of the prorated sum back to the person who paid the million bucks, plus or minus a few dollars here or there for value lost, or miscellaneous things. This is how arbitration works now, it's how arbitration would work without the state.  \n\nThe NAP, contracts, all of that, they aren't laws of physics. Compliance is entirely based on the incentive to comply vs not comply.",

Eventually the debt of the master would be too great to pay you back. \n\nI had heard of defending the undefendable, but I hadn\u2019t given it much thought when making this post.
