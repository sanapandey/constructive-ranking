([wiki check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States)) yeah, the same as catholics.  Add to that the number of apathetic or cultural christians who basically just tick the box but have no meaningful political alignment with christians and atheists might end up on top.  but that's another discussion for another place.",
