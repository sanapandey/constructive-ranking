            "body": "It seemed for the majority of my life, people were not so politically divided. Of course people discussed politics, but one of the more interesting things about the country becoming more divided, is it seemed to make people love government more.\n\nIn other words, the elevated hate for one side, has made people blind to any bad their chosen side might do. Logically I would have assumed a more blatantly corrupt, divisive, and failing system would have increased skepticism, but seems to have made people boot lick harder. Division strengthens attachment?\n\nIts fascinating. It must be some psychological theory, like Stockholm Syndrome, or some sunk cost fallacy that describes this, but it really shows our natural cognitive dissonance, or just how easy we as a species get hung up on the details and struggle to see the large picture when emotion is involved.\n\nWe would rather kill somebody that thinks different, than realize there must be a bigger picture causing that difference",

In 1985, after Congress passed the Boland Amendment (which prohibited military aid to the Contras), the Reagan administration circumvented the law by using other agencies\u2014including USAID\u2014to continue supporting the rebels under the guise of \"humanitarian assistance.\" The misuse of USAID programs for covert operations was later exposed in the Iran-Contra investigations, raising concerns about the agency's role in Cold War-era conflicts.",
