Which is why it only exists in modern society where it's hidden or the people are so psychopathic that they don't care.\n\nGovernment is a form of slavery.  A society which doesn't accept it won't let it form.",

Coupled with a lack of eternal vigilance which allowed the boiling of our frog:\n\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog\n\n\n\nA few hundred years ago Alexander Tyler put it this way:\n\n\n\"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy, always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's greatest civilizations has been 200 years. These nations have progressed through this sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.\"\nAlexander Fraser Tytler",

Government, in and of itself, is a practicing violation of individual consent via the rights to life, liberty, and property. An AnCap society would prevent such a government the same way they prevent any other act of aggression.\n\nI am more accurately a Hoppean Anarcho-Capitalist. I tend towards Hans-Hermann Hoppe's more communitarian and Ordonaturalist/Neo-Feudalist approach to AnCap. In this approach, contractually bound private law societies are built on preventing the typical economic and cultural tendencies of government through applying the community contract to trespassing rules and establishing a \"nobilitas naturalis\", or natural elite, to act as the voluntary leaders for a society.\n\nEither of these answers are appropriate for AnCap. I have chosen my words carefully here as to not trigger the Reddit mods, like I have in the past. Also, this sub definitely has external resources for Anarcho-Capitalism, as the top comment explains.",
