Do you believe he will come through on the ones I mention above? \n\nSaying that he\u2019s right because people are going after him isn\u2019t logical: if we go after a serial killer that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re doing something right. What other arguments/evidence do you have that he\u2019s going something right, or not consolidating power to monopolize violence even more?",
