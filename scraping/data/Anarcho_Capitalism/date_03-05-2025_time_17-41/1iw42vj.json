The gov requires us to write bi weekly highlights of what we completed and to produce a document listing all of CDRLs at the end of the CLIN year.\n\nI find it funny I have to justify every penny I spend on my contracts from the government and account for everything I do but then when the government is held to 5% of the same standard they freak the fuck out.\n\nThat said I don't mind doing highlights and proving what work I am completing. It keeps me and the guys who work for me honest and ensures we are adding value.",
