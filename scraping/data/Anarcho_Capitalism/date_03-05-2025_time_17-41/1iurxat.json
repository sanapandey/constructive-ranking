Whether or not \"wage workers\" would exist instead of \"independent contractors\" for all steps of production is arguable, but this author feels that the whole concept of \"worker-boss\" is a holdover from feudalism and not, as Marx claims, fundamental to \"capitalism.\" Of course, capital-statism is the opposite of what the libertarian advocates. Furthermore, even large businesses today could go partially counter-economic, leaving a portion in the \"white market\" to satisfy government agents and pay some modicum of taxes and report a token number of workers. The rest of the business would (and already often does) expand off the books with independent contractors who supply, service, and distribute the finished product. Nobody, no business, no worker, and no entrepreneur need be white market.\n\nand you'd call Rothbard \"envy-cultist bait\"\n\n\\>If we are to keep the term \"capitalism\" at all, then, we must distinguish between \"free-market capitalism\" on the one hand, and \"state capitalism\" on the other. The two are as different as day and night in their nature and consequences. Free-market capitalism is a network of free and voluntary exchanges in which producers work, produce, and exchange their products for the products of others through prices voluntarily arrived at. State capitalism consists of one or more groups making use of the coercive apparatus of the government \u2014 the State \u2014 to accumulate capital for themselves by expropriating the production of others by force and violence.\n\nI could keep listing people, and reasonable positions against the present form of capitalism, from people at the actual root of AnCap philosophy, but I won't.\n\nThe current relationship between bosses and workers is an exploitative, statist drain on the people.
