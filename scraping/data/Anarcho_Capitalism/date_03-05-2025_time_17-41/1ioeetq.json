Like, yeah I get it they're not perfect but did you see the trajectory we were on recently?\n\nWe were looking down the barrel of a WHO treaty that would create a one-world govt with emergency powers in the scenario of a pandemic. And guess what always seems to happen when people give themselves emergency powers?\n\nThe lockdowns should have been terrifying for anybody who understands personal liberty and freedom. It wasn't \"just a few weeks\" as many dimwits liked to parrot. It was the idea, *the concept* that any of these governors had unilateral power to shutter private businesses.\n\nIt wasn't about whether masks worked. It was about whether or not we'd ever have personal autonomy again. \n\nHow many inches into liberty do you allow them to encroach before you realize you don't have it anymore?\n\nThe online censorship was probably the most terrifying. People want to bicker about whether private businesses had the right to remove comments from facebook but they were missing the bigger picture all along. Internet backbone providers were aligning to develop a massive censorship machine that *by the way* is still there and pieces are still being put into place.\n\nICANN was given away by Obama so now there's no 1A arguments to be made against domain seizure. The entire DNS system is effectively a censorship mechanism now. Major companies such as godaddy, google, cloudflare, amazon and others have been involved in upstream censorship, killing access to basic infrastructure to smaller companies unless they commit to censorship.\n\nWe've seen it with domain seizures, DNS denials, DDOS attacks (which, let's face it, cost money to operate and aren't just script kiddies in basements), internet connection denial to smaller  companies, cloud server denial to smaller companies. All of this on ideological lines, *not a legal basis*.\n\nAnd the best part is, the masses are welcoming every move into our lives because they're couching it all under the guise of fighting nazis or fascists. Who cares if content is removed from the internet *if they're nazis they deserve it!*\n\nAnd there you go. Can't have free speech if there's a subject that's summarily prohibited, no matter how much you might disagree with it. \n\nUsed to be a saying \"The internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it,\" but nowadays people are cheering for the censorship.\n\nI could go on, but my point is, anything that shrinks govt is good in my eyes. Anybody who thinks Elon bought Twitter to turn a profit is a fucking moron. The dude obviously took a huge hit and won't likely regain those losses any time soon. He's got fuck-you money and is clearly taking a lot of flak for pursuing what I believe are pretty nobel causes. Is he perfect? Hell no. But I appreciate that he opened Twitter to opposing viewpoints during a time in which all the social media companies were in lockstep against any right-leaning views. Is Trump perfect? Hell, no. In fact, I think he makes a ton of unforced errors that really hold him back. But when you compare him to the status quo of presidents during my lifetime, he's a breath of fresh air. Even if he accomplishes nothing, the fact that he's even willing to discuss shrinking govt... those words have never even been spoken by the old guard.",

They say \"it's in the past, why are you still on about this?\"\n\nIt's like the boiled frog. I like to ask them if in 2010 I told them that governors would shutter their businesses and force them to take an experimental drug to get a job, if they believed the govt had enough political capital to pull that off without a massive revolt. 2010 me would have said you're crazy. 2025 me is kicking myself for not being *more extreme* in my doomsday predictions. Not only did they completely pull off massive crimes against humanity, the masses cheered for it. There are people **today** who have used this cultural divide as the basis for their entire personality. The NPC meme could not be more apt.\n\nCanada has gone even further than I ever expected. I love visiting Canada, or I should say I used to, but recently I've added it to the list of places I dare not go, lest I find myself a political prisoner. Hell, just the things I've written on reddit are enough against the overton window I worry if I ever travelled to the UK, Australia, or Canada, if I would remain free. Their speech laws have slid so far into authoritarianism that every-day speech *including jokes* are crimes in those countries.\n\nI can't get over.. *won't get over* the fact that all of these things occurred and the entire system I believed existed to protect our rights caved and became part of the problem itself. \n\nEven our basic right to defend ourselves was being challenged. I'm sure you heard the message loud and clear during the past 5 years. We are allowed to burn your cities to the ground, but if you defend yourself, we're going to throw the entire weight of the govt against you. There were so many cases of self defense that were *directly related to govt endorsed mobs in our cities* that ended in lengthy, biased court cases. I'm semi-relieved that some of the high profile cases did eventually rule in favor of self defense (I'm sure you know of the ones I'm talking about), but the message was still clear: If you have to exercise your right to self defense, you're entire future hangs in the balance and you can't really trust the courts to do the right thing anymore.\n\nThe \"misinformation\" campaigns are the closest you can get to a real life example of doublespeak in my opinion. Every time I see the word \"misinformation\" I assume the person using it is lying and I pay attention to whatever they're labelling as wrong.\n\nIt's frustrating that the dystopian futures that were well known as cautionary tales a few decades ago have become a reality today. I remember the common sentiment not too long ago was that censorship is universally bad and that authoritarian rule was bad. Now the general public cheers for it. I just can't even understand what happened.",

People need time for new institutions to develop and they need to become wealthy enough that they don't need charity just to survive. Then we need to grow institutions to take care of the disabled, from age or injury or from birth. I remember when blind men sold pencils on the street, rattling their cups for a penny. We need institutions that keep wealth from collecting in the eddies of our economy and to keep information honest and available. The rich aren't going to do these things, they will take every advantage their money can buy. These institutions will have to come bottom up  not top down. Until these problems are solved we are compelled to maintain the structures that exist; it is easy to tear them down, it is difficult to build them.",

I[asked grok to summarise his politics in regards to libertarianism and it looks pretty good to me](https://grok.com/share/bGVnYWN5_47734267-0503-4415-9b1b-cee42e356f02)\n\nNick Freitas, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, is often described as having a \u201cconservative voting record with a libertarian streak.\u201d His approach to politics can be characterized by several key points when viewed through the lens of libertarianism:\n\n- **Individual Liberty and Limited Government:** Freitas advocates for individual liberty, which is a central tenet of libertarianism. He has expressed support for reducing government intervention in the economy, promoting free-market economics, and opposing what he sees as excessive government control over personal choices. His stance on issues like opposing Obamacare, advocating for the repeal of federal income tax in favor of a national sales tax, and his criticism of government mandates, such as those related to transgender restroom use, align with libertarian principles of minimal government interference in personal and economic life.\n\n- **Fiscal Conservatism:** Freitas has shown concern for deficit spending, which resonates with libertarian views on fiscal responsibility. He has criticized congressional Republicans for not controlling deficits, emphasizing the need for unpopular but necessary votes to manage the country\u2019s fiscal health.\n\n- **Gun Rights and Criminal Justice:** While not strictly a libertarian position, his support for gun rights aligns with the general libertarian advocacy for the right to bear arms. However, his stance on criminal justice reform shows a more nuanced approach; he supports moderate reforms like rolling back qualified immunity and \u201cno-knock\u201d warrants, indicating a willingness to adapt libertarian ideas of reducing government power to practical policy changes.\n\n- **Cultural and Social Issues:** Freitas\u2019s positions on social issues sometimes diverge from pure libertarianism. For instance, he supports building a wall on the US-Mexico border and has taken conservative stances on issues like abortion. These positions reflect a blending of conservative and libertarian ideologies, where cultural conservatism intersects with libertarian economic and personal freedom principles.\n\n- **Endorsements and Affiliations:** Freitas has been endorsed by notable libertarian-leaning figures like Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, suggesting a recognition within libertarian circles of his commitment to some libertarian principles. However, his endorsements from groups like the NRA and his association with conservative funding also highlight his broader conservative appeal rather than a strictly libertarian one.\n\n- **Public Perception and Criticism:** While some view Freitas as a libertarian hero, especially in the context of his speeches against socialism and his advocacy for individual rights, others criticize his libertarian credentials due to his more conservative social positions and his association with far-right donors, suggesting that his libertarianism might be more tactical than ideological in certain contexts.\n\nOverall, Nick Freitas embodies a blend of libertarianism with traditional Republican conservatism, particularly in how he navigates cultural issues alongside his advocacy for economic freedom and limited government. His political stance is seen by some as a promising sign for the GOP\u2019s libertarian wing, though it\u2019s clear his politics are not purely libertarian but rather a fusion of libertarian philosophy with conservative values.\n\n[I drilled down further by aging about his most controversial political tweets and then to summarise the main ones that are non-libertarian to help](https://x.com/i/grok/share/hhVHegU8crjKFclOBPMLSIPZ8). (Reddit really needs something like grok, I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t have anything yet even only for premium members. )\n\nHere are some non-libertarian elements or takes that can be observed in Nick Freitas\u2019 controversial tweets:\n\n1. **Support for Certain Government Interventions**: While Freitas often champions libertarian ideals like minimal government involvement, his critiques of voting rights, especially in relation to felons or certain crimes, could be seen as advocating for government oversight in areas where libertarians typically oppose intervention. This can be interpreted as non-libertarian because it involves the state determining who has the right to vote, which isn\u2019t aligned with a pure libertarian stance of maximizing individual freedom with minimal government interference.\n\n2. **Selective Criticism of Government Spending**: His criticism of government funding for abortions or certain health mandates might align with libertarian principles of limiting government expenditure and scope, but his selective focus on these issues while not addressing others (like military spending or corporate subsidies) might suggest a non-libertarian inconsistency. Libertarianism would typically critique all forms of government spending or regulation that aren\u2019t absolutely necessary for protecting individual rights.\n\n3. **Education and Indoctrination**: Freitas\u2019 comments on education often focus on what he perceives as ideological teaching, suggesting some form of government oversight or reform in education to prevent this. While advocating for education free from ideological bias can resonate with libertarian ideals, the implication that government should actively intervene to achieve this contradicts the libertarian preference for private or parental control over education without government dictating curriculum or ethos.\n\n4. **Election Integrity**: His questioning of election processes might lean towards skepticism of government efficacy or corruption, which could resonate with libertarian distrust of government. However, if these views lead to support for policies or actions that increase government control over elections (like voter ID laws that might disproportionately affect certain groups), it could be seen as non-libertarian. Libertarians generally advocate for minimal barriers to voting to ensure maximum individual liberty.\n\n5. **Mask Mandates Critique**: While opposing mask mandates can be seen as a libertarian stance against government overreach into personal health choices, the manner of critique, especially if it involves advocating for laws or policies that would limit the government\u2019s ability to implement public health measures during crises, might not fully align with libertarian principles if they lead to broader restrictions on government action in other areas.\n\n6. **Criticism of Political Figures**: When critiquing other politicians, especially with a partisan lens, it can sometimes veer into territory where the critique is less about policy and more about political opposition, which might suggest a focus on party politics over principle, something less emphasized in libertarian thought which prioritizes individual freedoms over party lines.\n\nThese points highlight where Freitas\u2019 public stances might not strictly adhere to traditional libertarian views, particularly when his criticisms or proposed solutions involve government action or imply a selective application of libertarian principles. However, political discourse often involves compromise or strategic focus, which can explain these deviations from a purist libertarian stance.",
