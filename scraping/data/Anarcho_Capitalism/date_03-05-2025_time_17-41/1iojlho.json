Is that your argument?\n\n>Why isn\u2019t he going after the actual culprit of debt, the dod?\n\nHe will. Cutting state media off of funds and ending the invasion by stopping the NGOs is more important.\n\n>Why isn\u2019t he only going after agencies that have investigated him? \n\nBecause Biden directed every agency to harass him and his companies, including bribing news agencies to lie about them. There is no agency that wasn't weaponized against him.\n\n>Why is he blowing up mole hill spending and feeding it to the media like it\u2019s the biggest scandal in history? \n\nThe fact that the government has been couping our allies, funding censorship efforts, buying off the media, sowing DEI poison everywhere, and made COVID is the biggest scandal in history.\n\n>Trump and musk play the lp and continue to do so.

You note that Hitler, for several months, declined to bomb London because he was still hoping to convince Churchill to see reason and negotiate a peace treaty. Churchill was insisting he would take the fight to Germany. He had his bombers bomb Berlin.\n\nLARSON: Yes.\n\nDAVIES: And that kind of changed things, didn't it?\n\nLARSON: One key element before this, before it became the - before Germany began its first deliberate bombing attacks on London was it was a mistake that the Luftwaffe made on August 24, 1940, when a group of German bombers thought they were over their target. They were not. They were over central London. They dropped their bombs. And this was the first attack on central London. And it was terrifying to the citizens of London who had felt that, for whatever reason, they were not - this was not going - they were not going to be the subject of attack, you know, by Hitler.\n\nThis gave Churchill what he would describe as the moral right, then, to turn around and bomb Germany. The RAF was in - bomb Berlin, rather. The RAF was a little bit reluctant to do that as well because of the moral consequences, so they'd have to weigh it, like, and so forth. So now suddenly, you have this rapid escalation that leads to, on September 7, 1940, the first deliberate mass intense bombing of the city of London.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/03/30/823830284/how-winston-churchill-pulled-britain-through-the-early-years-of-wwii\n\nBefore the summer of 1940 British intransigence could be justified by the fact that Western Europe remained in opposition to Germany. Once Germany conquered France and chased the British Expeditionary Force off the continent at Dunkirk, however, the terms changed in a way that highlights one of my main criticisms of Britain\u2019s war policy. As Gray said in his thread above, the strategy of the British Empire toward Europe had long been to use a combination of financial and military means to play one nation off another in order to avoid the emergence of a continental power capable of challenging the Empire. But that strategy had run its course in the summer of 1940. There was no power left to play off against of Germany. The war was over, and Germany had won. There was no plan, and no possibility, of\nBritain mounting a reinvasion of Europe to change the outcome on its own. Yet Britain refused to entertain terms of peace, even when they were offered at the height of Hitler\u2019s power. The question, then, is why would Britain insist on continuing a war she had no means of fighting? True, the hunger blockade made life hard on the continent, but it could not starve Germany into submission now that the latter had a pact with Russia. The only weapon available to the British was aerial bombing that amounted to random acts of terrorism against European civilians. The truth is, the only hope Britain had was that the United States, the Soviet Union, or both, could be pulled into the war to bail them out. Another way of putting it would be that the British strategy was to turn a war that was basically over into a global conflict that, under the most optimistic circumstances, would result in the deaths of many millions of people. And of course that\u2019s what happened, although far from benefiting - or even preserving - the British Empire, World War 2 brought it to an end, and handed the world over to conquest by the United States and the USSR.\n\nChurchill\u2019s refusal to even countenance Hitler\u2019s peace overtures, and his tendency to escalate British bombing campaigns immediately after they were made, made no sense to much of the German leadership. Hitler pointed out, correctly, that a war between Germany and Britain could only end with the destruction of the British Empire, and it was widely believed by German officials that Britain\u2019s irrational escalation of the conflict was proof that International Jewry was influencing British policy without regard for British interests. This was the view among Third Reich leaders. The worsening bombing campaigns against German civilians, even as German planes were forbidden for months from retaliating in kind, and the continuation of the hunger blockade as it began to bite the occupied civilian populations, intensified Hitler\u2019s sense of paranoia and claustrophobia, and his sense that there were forces larger than Great Britain whose only war aim was to see Germany destroyed.\n\nhttps://subscribe.martyrmade.com/p/to-the-perplexed-waudio",

However, Hitler actually had little direct control over the Luftwaffe by August 1940. G\u00f6ring had successfully gained independent control - and was very clever at misrepresenting reports to keep his independence.\n\nStill, during the initial phase of the Battle of Britain, the Luftwaffe mostly targeted shipping, RAF radar and airfields, and plane factories, in an attempt to break the RAF defence and gain the vital air superiority over the Channel which would be necessary to launch an invasion.\n\nThe first bombs on London fell on August 24th. This was probably an accident due to lost pilots. Britain did send bombers to Berlin the next day.\n\nNow, works like The Battle of Britain (which is an excellent movie, and gets most of the history right with some artistic licence) would have you believe that is where it started. Hitler gave a rousing speech and promised \"moar bombs\" in return for what the RAF dropped on Berlin.\n\nBut it was actually two weeks later that the Blitz really started. The Luftwaffe continued pressing their attacks on the RAF and factories until September 7th when G\u00f6ring and his command (under pressure from a frustrated Hitler) acted on intelligence that brought them to believe the RAF was at breaking point, and the Blitz was seen as the final phase of annihilation before the sea invasion.\n\nSo - while London was probably bombed by accident on August 24th - it was not the primary cause of the Blitz.\n\nhttps://history.stackexchange.com/questions/34829/was-the-london-blitz-accidentally-started-by-lost-pilots",

We seek from them no compunction. On the contrary, if tonight the people of London were asked to cast their votes as to whether a convention should be entered into to stop the bombing of all cities, an overwhelming majority would cry, \"No, we will mete out to the Germans the measure, and more than the measure, they have meted out to us.\" {applause} The people of London with one voice would say to Hitler: \"You have committed every crime under the sun. Where you have been the least resisted there you have been the most brutal. **It was you who began the indiscriminate bombing. We remember Warsaw! In the first few days of the war. We remember Rotterdam. We have been newly reminded of your habits by the hideous massacre in Belgrade.** We know too well the bestial assaults you're making upon the Russian people, to whom our hearts go out in their valiant struggle! {cheers} We will have no truce or parley with you, or the grisly gang who work your wicked will! You do your worst! \u2014 and we will do our best! {sustained cheering} Perhaps it may be our turn soon. Perhaps it may be our turn now.\"\n\n>>July 14, 1941, in a speech before the London County Council.

The Nazis had a plan; they deliberately starved millions of people to death, and here Cooper is saying \"the Nazis had no plan\" and these people just \"ended up dead\" as if by accident or negligence. That's straight-up Holocaust denial. He's not denying it happened, but he's *lying about the reasons for it happening.* He is denying that it was deliberate. \n\nHoly shit is it mind-boggling that any libertarian takes this wannabe fascist seriously.",

So this one department decides across all departments and above the congress, that this spending is no void. This is political and its undermining whoever and why those budgets where put there in the first place.
