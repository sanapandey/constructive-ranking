He was very pro-Ukraine in his first term and supported arming their military. Even during the campaign this time he was pretty circumspect (for him) in his comments and many people thought he'd side with the neocons to keep the war going.\n\nBut every Democrat and media talking head were so hell-bent on the narrative of him being pro-Russia that it basically didn't matter what he'd actually said or done, and it seems like people on the Tucker Carlson/Rand Paul side were actually able to sway him over.",

I guess I've just become a lot more pragmatic. Being right is useless if you're not convincing others or making progress towards your goals which I view as a big problem with the libertarian movement.\n\nNow I consider myself a more pragmatic libertarian. My end goal is still anarcho-capitalism, but maybe if we can get there in a stepwise manner, convincing others why more services can be privatized, it would be more successful. Even though Trump is doing a bit of this, it seems like he's doing it in the most divisive way and really only cutting certain programs because he specifically doesn't like them, not because he wants smaller government per se. \n\nI also take a world approach to libertarianism rather than strictly an American one. To me, the first step in moving towards libertarianism is ridding the world of large, powerful authoritarian governments. You're right that entangling alliances and sending foreign aid isn't strictly libertarian from the perspective of the United States, but helping a country like Ukraine cut ties from relatively more authoritarian Russia and embrace values of more freedom is a love in the right direction for libertarianism. At the very least, if we're not going to send foreign aid, which I understand, we can at least voice support for Ukraine rather than Russia, which seems to be what is happening with Donald Trump in the last week. \n\nThe key word is relative. I know there's a long ways to go in making our country more free, but relative to the rest of the world, we're pretty far ahead.",
