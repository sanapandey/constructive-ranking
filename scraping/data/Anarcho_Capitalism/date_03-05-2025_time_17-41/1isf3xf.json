I should be able to see my family in a few weeks for 15 minutes every 3 days",

I got a letter from the IRS that said I owed penalties and interest from almost 2 years ago. I actually did finally get someone on the phone and asked them if they received all the payments I sent to them since then and they verified that they had. So I ask them why I'm being charged interest on something so old and why hasn't my payments since then been applied to the oldest tax owed. You know what I got \"sorry, that's how it is\". A few weeks after my phone conversation I get another letter with additional interest and a threat to sieze the property to recoup about $90 that I never should've been charged in the first place. So, I went onto EFTPS to pay and yeah same, it doesn't show you any amounts. The system isn't right and I'm starting to think that it is intentional to soak us for more than we ought to have paid.  *grr*",

I remember this one time when I had a tax question about cryptocurrency, and I got an appointment with an IRS agent, and they told me they can't answer any questions about cryptocurrency taxes. The FSK is this ? Why CAN'T I get legal advice from the government agency that will put me in jail if I get this wrong ? They can't even pass me up the chain of command until I get to someone that knows the answer, they just refuse to help me. This is the level of service you get from people that are not accountable to anyone. For this issue, I just have to hire my own private CPA, or just wing it and hope. Even when I needed government help, they are mostly useless. The only problem with DOGE is that THEY are just winging it too. Firing everyone in DEI is a good start, but they could just keep on firing people, and I doubt the rest of the country would even care that much. This is the core flaw with government shutdowns, they send home all the customer service people, and keep all the worthless regulators. If they reversed that, no one would even care, because the only people we actually interact with or need are the customer service people, and even they wouldn't be needed, if the taxes and regulations we have to figure out just went away.",

(Usually they take a minute to think until they say how they\u2019ve changed their driver license X years ago).  Then I follow up with - how was your experience? Most common answer - you can\u2019t compare DMV with all government. Ok\u2026 - Have you ever tried getting any answers and accountability from USPS when they lose or break your shit while in transit? (Silence). How comfortable are you when you\u2019re followed or stopped by a cop? (Silence). Do you like asking for permission to build on or to remodel your property? (Silence). Do you blindly trust to anybody who\u2019s licensed by the government to do the job? (Silence)\u2026\n\nAt some point most, regular people will ask - but who\u2019s going to protect you from robbers and burglars? Lol. You all know the answer to that. \n\nRedditors favorites - who\u2019s going to protect us from corporations? That\u2019s the most hilarious one, and even some very educated and smart people have this irrational fear. All you need to do is ask them how they envision that. I guess people are having some wild nightmares about how they are being rounded up by Walmart employees and forced to stock shelves or something\u2026 Common rebuttal- they\u2019ll have slave labor.
