What I'm trying to convey here, is that the objective of cutting spending, is to not have debt AND to reduce taxes. You cannot reduce taxes first, because you only increase debt.\n\nWhen I said spending is not getting any lower, I meant relative to revenue. If I got a Revenue of 10 and a spending of 20 I got a deficit of 10. If my revenue goes down to 5 but my spending only goes down to 19, I got a deficit of 14. The spending is higher than revenue now compared to before. \n\n>Also, the debt is completely irrelevant. The only important thing is the total spending.

Keep talking though.\n\nI asked you in what terms you were talking about the tax cuts. So yes, it's ver years. Thanks for answering the question,  even if it was like an uppity asshole.\n\nAlso your own article proves me right\n\n>$4.5 trillion in tax cuts and a $4 trillion increase in the debt limit so the U.S. can continue financing its bills.  \nThe budget plan also directs a variety of House committees to cut spending by at least $1.5 trillion while stating that the goal is to reduce spending by $2 trillion over 10 years.\n\n4.5 trillions in tax cuts. Only a 1.5 trillion cut to spending. An increase in debt ceiling of 4 trillion.\n\nYeah, clearly debt and deficit are going down ....",
