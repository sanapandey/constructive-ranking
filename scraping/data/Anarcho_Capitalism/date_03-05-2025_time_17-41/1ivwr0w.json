His views are in stark contrast to the views of the vast majority of the rest of us physicians.  \n\nHe claims he invented mRNA vaccines because he worked on mRNA research.  What a joke.\n\nMany COVID policies were laughable and there were a lot of mistakes when people were scrambling to learn more about this formerly unknown virus; however, the COVID vaccine itself was effective, with benefits outweighing the risks in the vast majority of individuals.",

As a physician who actually worked in the ICU during COVID, let me help you out. Those spikes? They align perfectly with major COVID waves\u2014Alpha in early 2021, Delta in late 2021, and Omicron in early 2022\u2014when hospitals were packed with young, unvaccinated patients struggling to breathe.\nIn fact, this graph actually works against the narrative that vaccinations increased deaths in young people. That big spike with the early vaccinations was when elderly high risk patients were getting vaccinated. The overwhelming majority of young people were getting vaccinated during the late vaccination stage which is a lower point on your graph.\n\nYou know what doesn\u2019t show up in actual epidemiological data? A wave of vaccine-caused deaths. But hey, why let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory?",

Government sucks, but you don't need to become an antiscience, tinfoil hat-wearing nut job to demonstrate that.",
