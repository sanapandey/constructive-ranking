A gilded age leads to a minor progressive movement, then a reaction back to conservatism, then a total economic disaster and then a major progressive movement. Would be nice if we could just have a progressive movement without a Republican caused disaster but that doesn\u2019t seem possible",

Makes for probably half of democrats if not more reluctant to try more drastic measures (which is impossible anyways right now with Republican obstructionism)\n\nI think this gilded age will continue for quite some time, for as long as cheap labor has value it will make it very tough with global trade to have policies that don't kill domestic economies.  As global wages even out across countries, I expect more progressive policies will have far more value.",
