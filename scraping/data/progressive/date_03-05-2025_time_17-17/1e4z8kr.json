            "body": "> Trump, of course, has worked against workers\u2019 interests at every turn\u2014molding the National Labor Relations Board in his image, vetoing the Protect Right to Organizing Act, and restricting overtime pay, wage increases, and health and safety protections. Compare that to Biden, who in 2022 signed the Butch Lewis Act, saving the pensions of nearly 350,000 of O\u2019Brien\u2019s Teamsters membership.",

                    "body": "Even before he fucked over workers through policy as President, he had a long, consistent record of ripping off and screwing over his own workers.\n\n> During the Atlantic City casino boom in the 1980s, Philadelphia cabinet-builder Edward Friel Jr. landed a $400,000 contract to build the bases for slot machines, registration desks, bars and other cabinets at Harrah's at Trump Plaza.\n\n>The family cabinetry business, founded in the 1940s by Edward\u2019s father, finished its work in 1984 and submitted its final bill to the general contractor for the Trump Organization, the resort\u2019s builder.\n\n>Edward\u2019s son, Paul, who was the firm\u2019s accountant, still remembers the amount of that bill more than 30 years later: $83,600. The reason: the money never came. \u201cThat began the demise of the Edward J. Friel Company\u2026 which has been around since my grandfather,\u201d he said.\n\n> Donald Trump often portrays himself as a savior of the working class who will \"protect your job.\" But a USA TODAY NETWORK analysis found he has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades \u2014 and a large number of those involve ordinary Americans, like the Friels, who say Trump or his companies have refused to pay them.\n\n> Trump\u2019s companies have also been cited for 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act since 2005 for failing to pay overtime or minimum wage, according to U.S. Department of Labor data. That includes 21 citations against the defunct Trump Plaza in Atlantic City and three against the also out-of-business Trump Mortgage LLC in New York. Both cases were resolved by the companies agreeing to pay back wages.\n\n> In addition to the lawsuits, the review found more than 200 mechanic\u2019s liens \u2014 filed by contractors and employees against Trump, his companies or his properties claiming they were owed money for their work \u2014 since the 1980s. The liens range from a $75,000 claim by a Plainview, N.Y., air conditioning and heating company to a $1 million claim from the president of a New York City real estate banking firm. On just one project, Trump\u2019s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, records released by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1990 show that at least 253 subcontractors weren\u2019t paid in full or on time, including workers who installed walls, chandeliers and plumbing.\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/\n\n> But for the carpenters, electricians, plumbers, window installers and other contractors who built Trump\u2019s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City three decades ago, the wounds from not being paid still fester.\n\n> Triad Building Specialties ended up taking out a $40,000 loan just to pay its suppliers. And then the firm needed another decade just to pay off the loan. In the end, Triad received only 40 cents on the dollar from Trump for its work on the Taj, said Jenkins, now 49 and the firm\u2019s co-owner.\n\n...\n\n> When contractors complained about delays in pay, Trump said he needed to complete audits to make sure they weren\u2019t overcharging. Years later, when he ran for president and was asked about his failure to pay, Trump suggested that he needed to carefully check the bills because he feared that some contractors were cheating him.\n\n> By 1991, when the Taj collapsed into bankruptcy, Trump offered those contractors only 33 cents in cash for each dollar he owed. He promised another 50 cents on the dollar later. But many contractors say it took years to get anything.\n\n> And they were the lucky ones.\n\nhttps://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2020/01/24/donald-trump-still-owes-money-to-contractors-who-built-taj-mahal-atlantic-city/4547037002/\n\n>After putting in long hours for a special event at Trump National Doral, a Miami resort, 48 servers had to sue for unpaid overtime. The settlements averaged around $800 per worker, but went as high as $3,000 in one case. On top of that, a paint shop owner named Juan Carlos Enriquez also sued Trump's business, claiming he never got the final payment for a paint shipment to the same resort. In 2017, after a three-year legal fight, a court found in Enriquez's favor, and ordered Trump's company to pay the final $32,000, plus $300,000 in legal fees.\n\nhttps://theweek.com/articles/783976/brief-history-trumps-smalltime-swindles",

Palmer has also openly criticized O\u2019Brien\u2019s budding relationship with Trump, writing that speaking at t\nhe RNC \u201conly normalizes and makes the most anti-union party and President I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime seem palatable.\u201d",
