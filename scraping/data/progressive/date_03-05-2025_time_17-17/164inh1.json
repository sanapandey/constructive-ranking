Now, they are making a play that could end in their biggest victory since the Citizens United ruling in 2010.\n\nThe GOP is growing increasingly optimistic about their prospects in a little-noticed lawsuit that would allow official party committees and candidates to coordinate freely by removing current spending restrictions. If successful, it would represent a seismic shift in how tens of millions of campaign dollars are spent and upend a well-established political ecosystem for TV advertising.\n\n\nAn eventual victory in the lawsuit, filed last November by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, would eliminate the need for House and Senate campaign committees of any party to set up separate operations to make so-called independent expenditures to boost candidates with TV ads.\n\nCommittees could work in concert with their candidates, opening up millions of party dollars to individual campaigns and allowing party committees to purchase TV air time at the much cheaper rates offered to candidates.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is just pry open another barn door to get very large unlimited contributions toward candidates,\u201d said Tom Moore, a former longtime aide to a Democratic commissioner on the Federal Election Commission who now works for the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cThis is money that they don\u2019t have to raise in small-dollar increments from actual voters.\u201d\n\nU.S. flags and campaign signs on seats before a campaign rally for former Vice President and 2024 presidential hopeful Mike Pence.\nAn eventual victory in the lawsuit would eliminate the need for House and Senate campaign committees of any party to set up separate operations to make so-called independent expenditures to boost candidates with TV ads. | Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSome top Democrats are skeptical that the lawsuit has any hope of succeeding. But if it does there is even a small, if unlikely, chance that such a transformation could take place before the 2024 elections.\n\nThough Republicans have brought forward the lawsuit, it would advantage both party committees. The GOP, however, may benefit more at first because its candidates, particularly in the Senate, have struggled to match Democrats\u2019 small-dollar fundraising largesse. A relaxation of coordinated spending laws could allow them access to a party committee\u2019s cash.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a partisan issue. For decades, these limits on party-candidate coordination have hamstrung both parties\u2019 ability to do exactly what they are meant to do: robustly support their candidates,\u201d NRSC General Counsel Ryan G. Dollar said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to the 6th Circuit striking down these limits and restoring power where it belongs.\u201d\n\nThe case currently lies with an Ohio district court judge who only has to determine whether it should be sent to the 6th Circuit for review. That jurist \u2014 Judge Douglas Cole, an appointee of then-President Donald Trump \u2014 gave Republicans new hope in early August when he ordered a three-month discovery period, something that could indicate the case is on a glide path to the higher court.\n\nAttorneys for the FEC, the defendant in the case, noted in court filings that the judge created \u201ca highly expedited discovery schedule.\u201d Campaign finance experts say that could be a sign that the judge is likely to certify the complaint and move it up to the circuit court for full arguments.\n\nAnd indeed, Cole indicated to attorneys involved in the case earlier this month that he was setting a fast timeline to get arguments up to the circuit court, according to a person involved with the litigation who was briefed on his comments but was not authorized to disclose them.\n\nThe 6th Circuit is a fairly conservative bench with a near-supermajority of GOP-appointed judges. The venue itself is a win for Republicans. The FEC sought to have the case either dismissed on technical grounds or moved to federal court in D.C., but Cole denied that request.\n\nSome legal experts have cast doubt on the likelihood of a GOP victory. Republicans have waged similar attempts to strike down spending limits only to be thwarted by federal courts, most notably in a 2001 Supreme Court case out of Colorado. At least one prominent Democrat believes that precedent will stymie them again.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates are seen at Fiserv Forum immediately before the first Republican presidential debate.\n2024 ELECTIONS\n\nWho won, who lost and who fizzled in the first Republican debate\n\nBY POLITICO STAFF | AUGUST 24, 2023 12:55 AM\n\u201cDifferent lawyers can have different points of view,\u201d said Marc Elias, a top Democratic elections lawyer. \u201cBut the question of whether or not a lower court can disregard a Supreme Court ruling, it\u2019s not really a question of opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI strongly suspect the Supreme Court won\u2019t take it up,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause the Supreme Court has dodged campaign finance cases, for the most part, and the conservative majority has a number of other issues that are higher priorities.\u201d\n\nUnder the existing campaign finance reform, the NRCC and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committees can spend between $59,000 and $119,000 in coordination with their candidates. The NRSC and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee can spend between $119,000 and $3.6 million. Beyond that, party committees must rely on their independent expenditure operations, known internally as IEs.\n\nIndependent expenditure arms require a degree of separation. Their staff cannot directly coordinate with candidates or those in their organization who don\u2019t work for the IE. They communicate in code through so-called \u201cred boxes\u201d on hidden public websites during the fall TV ad campaigns.\n\nErasing these coordinated spending limits would aggrandize the party committees for both Democrats and Republicans. Super PACs, however, would remain largely unaffected.\n\nFew, if any, average voters would notice a difference under a change in spending laws, other than it might allow them to see more ads designed by the candidates\u2019 own campaigns rather than one designed by an allied group.\n\n\u201cThis is something that we have complained about for a long time, about the extra effort,\u201d said Nathan Klein, a former leader of the NRSC\u2019s independent expenditure operation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to spend the money anyhow, but all we\u2019re doing is making the message less resonant. Voters deserve to hear from the candidate.\u201d\n\nBut good government groups say that, even if the public may not notice the change in spending, it would allow big donors to exert more influence over candidates.\n\n\u201cWealthy donors seeking to curry favor with a candidate could underwrite coordinated spending on that candidate\u2019s behalf,\u201d said Michael Beckel, the research director at Issue One, an anti-money-in-politics group. \u201cLimits like this are designed to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party has looked to chip away at various campaign finance regulations for decades. But they believe they have never been better positioned than they are now. Last year the Supreme Court voted 6-3 to roll back another campaign finance regulation, which could indicate a willingness to strike down other long-standing laws.\n\nStill, party committees can already circumvent the current coordinated spending limits by designing a \u201chybrid ad\u201d that advocates for or against a candidate and a political party. For example, a so-called hybrid ad funded by Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would need to attack both Tester\u2019s GOP opponent and the Republican Party as a whole \u2014 or boost both Tester and the Democratic Party.\n\nThose ads are clunky. Not to mention that Montana is a red state and Tester will need to court GOP voters to win.\n\nThe district court judge indicated that he would rule on whether to send the lawsuit to the circuit court in November.\n\nFILED UNDER: CAMPAIGN FINANCE, NRCC, NRSC,\nPOLITICO\nMOST READ",
