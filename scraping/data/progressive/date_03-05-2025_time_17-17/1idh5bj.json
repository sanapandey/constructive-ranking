It is happening now and everyone outside the fascist party with power has clearly told us all they will not fight. \n\nNow the question is, do you want to experience it your whole life or would you like to live to see it fall? \n\nAct accordingly.",

Personally I don\u2019t really see a problem with it even if it was a manifesto as they serve a purpose, mainly to introduce people to a way of thinking in which they will be more willing to follow your link and resist fascism. I wouldn\u2019t knock any source of information/education right now, we need all we can get. It\u2019s never \u201ctoo late\u201d for any kind of knowledge. I guess I just don\u2019t really find your attitude helpful as never in the history of any mass movement has everyone been on the same page or read every piece of literature. This is why it is good to have an abundance of options",
