I expect them to actually make it to the polls more than I expect, say, the 4chan constituency.\n\nBut from that perspective, Biden's failings to be a progressive leader are a real threat to turnout. His seemingly unthinking support for a war where one side has killed 20x as many civilians as the other is very tough for me to stomach. Even I myself am wrestling with the question of whether I'm culpable if I vote for him, just to keep Trump out of office.",
