That is a scam if I ever heard of one.  \n\nSad thing too is that I\u2019m familiar with the area they\u2019re writing about.  It\u2019s pretty rural with the biggest city being about 30 miles away.  It\u2019s commutable, but being on a fixed income since most of Northeast Mississippi, well most of Mississippi period is a retirement state, that eats into whatever the seniors are getting every month.",
