He is the only United States Supreme Court Justice to have ever been impeached.",

Just like the President.\n\nI don't see that happening with the current makeup of the House, even the MAGAts won't vote to remove a Republican appointed Justice.  So maybe in 2025 if the Democrats control Congress.",
