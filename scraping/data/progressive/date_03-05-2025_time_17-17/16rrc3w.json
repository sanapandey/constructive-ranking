He and his very close team are.\n\nPolls a couple months ago had a third party bid still allowing him pluralities in key states, with more support taken from Trump than him (West takes from Biden but still gets a plurality; Manchin takes from both but Biden gets a plurality).\n\nBut now all recent polls are swinging Trump's way. Let's ignore the insane Trump+10 outlier and the Messenger Trump+5, but we should start fearing a pattern here.\n\nAny loss in support will give even less room for Biden to lose.",

It is assuming that for some 3rd parties, more of their voters would vote Biden than vote Trump if those were the only two choices.  For example, say in 2016 that the Green Party voters had been exit polled and asked that question and 25% of them said they'd vote Clinton and 15% said Trump and all the rest said they wouldn't vote at all, then that means if you could prevent all third party candidates from being on the ballot without pissing off the third party voter, you could justifiably count 10% of the Green vote as an add for Clinton.  And what about the Libertarian party?  Amazingly, it was about the same percentage (note: still wasn't enough for Clinton to win Pennsylvania had Green and Libertarian voters there matched this nationwide exit poll - which is why Clinton's complaints against Stein are absolutely moronic).\n\nThe poll was done by [CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/).  See the section \"Did Johnson and Stein Affect the Outcome?\".\n\nNote to the Biden team: Now does anybody own third party voters (including me)?  Hell no.  If you don't like the status quo - you fight for NPV and ranked ballot voting and maybe the third party voters will rank your party higher than the other major party because at least you showed us some respect instead of yelling at us.  I'm not holding my breath.",

The rhetoric suggesting otherwise is incredibly condescending. \n\n\nAppealing to the majority who don't vote seems more worthwhile than attempting to blame and guilt trip politically engage third party voters.\n\n\n\n\n>But there are a couple of snags to the \u201cthird-party votes did it\u201d argument. Firstly, it assumes that a lot of voters\u2019 second choice was Clinton. There\u2019s little evidence that was true. Most polls \u2013 which, it turns out were deeply flawed \u2013 simply asked: \u201cWho would you vote for if the election were held today?\u201d Rarely was there a follow-up question of: \u201cAnd who would you vote for if you didn\u2019t vote for that candidate?\u201d\n>\n>\n>There are three other possibilities besides choosing Clinton as a second choice candidate:\n>\n>\n>1. Those voters might have chosen a different third-party candidate. For example, Johnson voters might have switched to Stein, or vice versa. If so, that would have had no effect on Trump\u2019s chances of winning.\n>\n>\n>2. Those voters might have chosen to stay at home rather than vote for someone who wasn\u2019t their first choice. If so, they again wouldn\u2019t have changed Trump\u2019s victory over Clinton \u2013 except to make it even larger as a share of all votes cast.\n>\n>\n>3. Those voters might have chosen Trump as their second-choice candidate. If so, they not only would have secured Trump as the winner of the national popular vote, they could have also bumped up his electoral college votes by claiming Democratic states like Virginia, Minnesota, Colorado and New Hampshire, where Clinton won by a smaller number of votes than those cast for third-party candidates.\n>\n>\n>In reality, it\u2019s some combination of all of the above. Some third-party voters could have chosen to stay at home, some could have voted for Clinton, and some for Trump. (People don\u2019t act in perfect herds. If pollsters had better understood that, perhaps they wouldn\u2019t have got this election so badly wrong.)\n>\n>\n>Except that third-party voters didn\u2019t do any of those things. They put their crosses against the name of a candidate they almost certainly knew would not become their next president. Which suggests a strength of feeling that renders all hypothetical \u201cwhat ifs\u201d a little redundant.\n\n\n\n-[Did third-party candidates Jill Stein and Gary Johnson lose Clinton the election?](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/10/third-party-candidate-gary-johnson-jill-stein-clinton-loss)",
