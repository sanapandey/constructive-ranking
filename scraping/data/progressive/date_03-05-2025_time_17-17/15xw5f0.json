Do you think bigots are too stupid to realize they can make their bigotry more palatable to others by softening the language?\n\nWell I haven't heard them say anything bigoted and certainly nothing promoting violence.  Walsh seems like he's more of a conservative Christian so he might be the most \"bigoted\", but he isn't hateful that I've seen.\n\n>Do you oppose all medical intervention that may result in sterilization, or just treatment you think is icky?\n\nThis isn't a normal procedure where there's something wrong that requires a medical intervention.  These surgeries permanently alter children who are perfectly healthy.  They'll become dependent on medications and hormones the rest of their lives.  If they change their minds they'll be permanently disfigured and sterile.  It's incredibly sad to hear the stories of people who detransition.\n\n>Why do you think we should base our laws around the comparably few people who decide they didn\u2019t need to transition, rather than the overwhelming majority who continue to say it was the right decision for them? Do you hold other medical treatments to that standard?\n\nThere have been [systematic reviews](https://segm.org/NICE_gender_medicine_systematic_review_finds_poor_quality_evidence) that conclude there's no clear benefit to gender-reassignment surgery for minors.\n\n>Why should anyone view this as anything other than the modern version of the argument that gay people were influenced to be gay?  \n\nThe argument that people can't be influenced to be gay is that sexual orientation is determined by biology.  The whole non-binary movement is based on the claim that gender is primarily cultural.  So according to this reasoning, gender is necessarily influenced by other people.",
