She said she feels we elect state reps to pass this kind of thing and resents being asked to vote on basic things that should just come through the legislature. \n\nNot sure if I agree but I wonder if maybe the best way to have new laws passed isn\u2019t by just using the proposition process every time and just elect competent people to the state legislature.",
