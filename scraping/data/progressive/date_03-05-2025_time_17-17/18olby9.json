            "body": "Conservatives lack empathy in general, except for those who they perceive to be on their conservative team. They have a strong \"Us versus Them\" attitude.\n\nOf course a stranger gets no benefit of the doubt from conservatives, who are primed with stigma and bias and judgement. But if the addict is conservative, the calculus is different.\n\nRush Limbaugh was an opioid addict, and spent a lot of time and energy attacking addicts, and he was nevertheless lionized by conservatives. He was a hypocrite who attacked people for relying on the government...when he himself relied on government programs when he was unemployed. And he was a conservative hero, a complete hypocrite.\n\nConservative values are performative and ultimately meaningless. They hate gay people...until a family member comes out. They are anti abortion...until they need an abortion. They excoriate drug addicts...until they are addicted. They are proudly religious, but know fuck all about their \"religion.\" \n\nThis is why Trump defying all of their proclaimed values isn't a problem for conservative voters. He's the captain of their team, so they offer support no matter what. The conservative \"values\" are and always were fake.\n\nThe Republican base is full of sociopaths and dupes. Most of them will never realize that they were never actually on the team at all. They will never realize just how much Trump and Republican leadership viciously hate them.\n\nLastly, conservatives think that everyone else is secretly just like them. They really do. That's why they believe \"wokeism\" is insincere and everyone is simply virtue signaling. They believe everyone is pretending to care about other people. It's because conservatives couldn't give a flying fuck about you or anyone that they don't perceive as being on their \"side.\" The idea that they would care is absurd.",
