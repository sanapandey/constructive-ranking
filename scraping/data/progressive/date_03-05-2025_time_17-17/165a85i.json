People on the left have parental rights too - to not have a vocal minority dictate their child's education be censored or their school defunded, to not have good teachers driven away from their school out of fear of saying the wrong thing or keeping the wrong books in their classroom. Public schools represent and serve everyone in the community. Keep political culture wars out of our schools.",

We've seen attacks on school boards, political pressure placed on public schools to follow minority guidelines, and an emboldened base of fascists trying to destroy a democratic way of life through our embattled and poorly funded public education system. \n\nEvery Christian has the right to place their child in whatever educational environment they want- but not at everyone else's expense. Home school them. Pay for private schooling. If you want to wreck your child's world view, it is unfortunately quite preserved as your right- but don't come after my kids in their school. And I have no responsibility to fund or make it possible for you to make that decision for yourself.  \n\nThis is the fundamental issue with these people: they are not satisfied to simply make decisions for themselves, they have to attempt to drag us all kicking and screaming into their world view. It's not democracy, it isn't the American way of life.",
