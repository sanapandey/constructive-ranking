Idaho has received more than $3 million annually in Title V funds in recent years, according to statistics cited by Huntsberger.  \n>  \n>The MMRC, whose members say annual operation costs stand at about $15,000, has been deemed budget-neutral, running at no cost to the state.\n\nSo since the Republican troglodytes in the state legislature will be ending the MMRC will they also be returning the $3 million in Title V funds since it's obvious that they have zero interest in \"improving the health of mothers, infants and children\" of Idaho?\n\nAccording to experts the risk of death due to pregnancy complications is 14 times that of abortion. So these backwards, medieval, pro-forced birth Republicans are literally consigning a number of women to certain death as a result of their religious crackpot abortion bans.  No wonder the Republican-dominated Idaho state legislature doesn't want to keep track of maternal related deaths.\n\nJust further evidence that the  anti-choice right's claims to being \"pro-life\" are about as credible as Defendant Trump claiming to be an honest man.",
