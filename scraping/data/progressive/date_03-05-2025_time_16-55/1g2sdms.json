            "body": "Fantine Giap, MD, sat across from a 21-year-old with a rare sarcoma at the base of her skull. \n\nDespite the large tumor, nestled in a sensitive area, the Boston-based radiation oncologist could envision a bright future for her patient. \n\nShe and the other members of the patient's care team had an impressive cancer-fighting arsenal at her fingertips. The team had recommended surgery, followed by proton therapy \u2014 a sophisticated tool able to deliver concentrated, razor-focused radiation to the once apple-sized growth, while sparing the fragile brain stem, optic nerve, and spinal cord. \n\nSurgery went as planned. But as the days and weeks wore on and insurance prior authorization for the proton therapy never came, the tumor roared back, leading to more surgeries and more complications. Ultimately, the young woman needed a tracheostomy and a feeding tube. \n\nBy the time insurance said yes, more than 1 year from her initial visit, the future the team had envisioned seemed out of reach. \n\n''Unfortunately for this patient, it went from a potentially curable situation to a likely not curable situation,\u201d recalled Giap, a clinician at Massachusetts General Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School. \u201cI wanted to cry every day that she waited.'' \n\nWhile a stark example, such insurance delays are not uncommon, according to new research published in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe study of 206 denials in radiation oncology concluded that more than two-thirds were ultimately approved on appeal without changes, but often these approvals came only after costly delays that potentially compromised patient care.\n\nOther studies have found that number to be even higher, with more than 86% of prior authorization requests ultimately approved with few changes.",

            "body": "Friend used to enter doctor referrals and codes into an insurance company's system. She had no medical training. She'd have to approve treatment. Sometimes the codes would kick back questions. If the code was a typo or didn't match diagnosis she was supposed to reject treatment and send back to doctor. If she could tell it was a typo she'd approve treatment and ask doctor's office to correct paperwork. The insurance company kept giving her more and more to enter. She couldn't keep up. She was told to get someone to help her. Essentially hire a freelancer. She couldn't find anyone reliable. Eventually she hired her 13 year old nephew. He was reliable and motivated, got paid piece meal so he worked every free minute. I wonder how many people had treatment rejected by a 13 year old.",
