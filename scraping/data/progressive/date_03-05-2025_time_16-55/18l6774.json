The gov seized it from his family and used it to bury Union dead. Why tf is there a monument to the very people who killed those Union soldiers?\n\nIt's like putting a big statue to the Nazis in the Normandy American Cemetery. \n\n> *Today we commemorate the Nazi bastards who murdered all of our boys. Technically, this cemetery couldn't exist without them!*\n\nI mean, how is it different?",
