            "body": "Article Text:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump closed his Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday with an ominous 80-minute speech denouncing his political rivals, assailing immigrants and promising to invoke an 18th century law to pave the way for mass deportations.\n\nBut it was the opening acts of the New York City rally \u2013 a hodgepodge of donors, entertainers and MAGA politicians \u2013 who unleashed an eleventh-hour campaign furor that prompted angry rebukes from Democrats and some Republicans who worried the vengeful show would hurt their standing with moderate voters.\n\nLocal Trump loyalists, who made up many of the speakers\u2019 list ahead of the former president, took the opportunity to spew familiar grievances at some of Trump\u2019s favorite targets. One failed Republican House candidate labeled Harris \u201cthe antichrist.\u201d\n\nHe hardly stood out.\n\nThe rally began with Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian and podcast host, assailing Puerto Rico \u2013 in the city that\u2019s home to the largest Puerto Rican population on the US mainland. About 500,000 Puerto Ricans also live in battleground Pennsylvania, where Harris campaigned on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on, like, I don\u2019t know if you know this but there\u2019s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s called Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nThe line was well-received by Trump supporters who filled the historic arena in Midtown Manhattan. Trump has recently taken to calling the US \u201ca garbage can for the world\u201d when he rails against undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThese Latinos, they love making babies, too. Just know that they do,\u201d Hinchcliffe continued.\n\nAfter the rally, Trump\u2019s campaign sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, who like the other speakers was an invited guest, and his comments about Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cThis joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,\u201d Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement to CNN.\n\nBut Harris\u2019 campaign had already seized on the attacks on Puerto Rico, quickly clipping the video and posting it on social media channels. The vice president on Sunday visited a Puerto Rican restaurant in North Philadelphia, where she discussed her vision for the island along with plans to lower costs and create opportunity in Puerto Rican communities on the mainland.\n\nPuerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, whose album \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d was the most-streamed album globally in 2023, posted a video of Harris spelling out her plan for Puerto Rico to his 45 million Instagram followers shortly after Hinchcliffe left the stage.\n\nRepublican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, whose reelection campaign depends on sizable support from the state\u2019s Puerto Rican community, joined the backlash, writing of the \u201cjoke\u201d on X, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny and it\u2019s not true. Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans!\u201d\n\nHinchcliffe, also on social media, addressed the furor, saying that his critics \u201chave no sense of humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone \u2026 watch the whole set,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTrump \u2014 who was introduced by former first lady Melania Trump in her first speaking role at a rally this cycle \u2014 largely stuck to the script in his own remarks, including his now common assertion that his political rivals represent a traitorous \u201cenemy within.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running against a massive, crooked, malicious leftist machine that\u2019s running the Democrat party,\u201d the former president said. \u201cThey are smart and vicious, they are the enemy within, we must defeat them.\u201d\n\nAnother warm-up act, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, reprised his old attacks on Harris and the idea, as he described it, of Americans celebrating her possible election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be pretty hard to look at (the country after Harris wins) and say, you know what, Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she\u2019s so impressive \u2013 as the first Samoan, Malaysian, low IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president,\u201d said Carlson, before exclaiming that anyone who is not impressed by Harris will be called a \u201cfreak\u201d or a \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\nLater, Republican politician David Rem took the microphone to call Harris \u201cthe devil\u201d while waving around a cross.\n\n\u201cShe is the antichrist,\u201d Rem wailed, before saying he planned to run for mayor.\n\nAnother speaker, radio host Sid Rosenberg \u2014 who once occupied a plum seat beside Don Imus on WFAN, the area\u2019s largest sports station \u2014 started off by attacking Clinton, the Democratic nominee from eight years ago.\n\n\u201cShe is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh?,\u201d he said, channeling Trump\u2019s own past remarks. \u201cWhat a sick son of a b*tch.\u201d\n\nRosenberg then turned his attention to migrants now living in New York City \u2013 and his fury over the local government\u2019s attempts to feed and house them.\n\n\u201cYou got homeless and veterans \u2013 Americans, Americans \u2013 sleeping on their own feces on a bench in Central Park,\u201d Rosenberg said. \u201cBut the f**king illegals, they get whatever they want, don\u2019t they?\u201d",
