In several of our last elections, the race was decided by just a few percent or even less than a percent. So a fairly small swing can tip the election. History has shown that when voters feel disengaged they often just stay home. Even the last election with a lot at stake and historical turnout had about 1/3 of voters stay home. When malaise disproportionately affects one party, it could be fatal to its presidential prospects.",

Eventually the Supreme Court would get tired of hearing such cases, and would need to rule definitively on the topic. \n\nBut if the Supreme Court does rule that it's allowable, then they will likely also suggested that the states firm up specifics about what makes someone ineligible to appear on the ballot, which in turn will require states to have more specific and clear language on how to interpret 14.3. \n\nIn the meantime, there is some likelihood that the Supreme Court may end up ruling on Trump's eligibility or at least, Presidential Immunity.",
