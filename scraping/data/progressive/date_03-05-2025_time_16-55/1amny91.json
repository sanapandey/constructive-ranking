In kindergarten, it's more than just learning ABCs, coloring, and 1,2,3s\n\nLater on, lots of elementary school readers taught us certain values. I vividly remember my 3rd and 4th grade teacher requiring us to read a certain number of books for each 9 week period, largely based on the old [American Adventure Series](https://www.abebooks.com/collections/sc/american-adventure-series/2mhSk7k6N6ypNOIGKFwNMa) . Looking back, it promoted mainly conservative but not right-wing views and values (at least for that time not right-wing).\n\nI see no reason there can't be a liberal-progressive analogue to what I just wrote.",

It is plausible that the curriculum is acceptable, however its impact (either positive or negative) is dwarfed by the variability of the small population to which it\u2019s applied.  After all, the population turns over from year to year.\n\nFor those with a curiosity for understanding, there is more research to be done to separate the independent variables before making a causal link to the curriculum.  For those with a confirmation bias, the \u201cwoke kindergarten\u201d has failed children.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

I think at that age they just see people and don't really have the concept of different races from different areas and countries.
