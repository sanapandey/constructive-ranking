Not the games, mind you, just the warm-ups. For the games they wore their regular jerseys. And it was entirely voluntary.  These same Russian Orthodox players weren\u2019t being forced to participate in any way, but they still threw fits and refused to play in the games because of what they claimed were religious liberty grounds.",
