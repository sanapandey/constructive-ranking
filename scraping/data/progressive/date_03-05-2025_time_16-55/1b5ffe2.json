But they are also a powerful part of the party who puts pressure on republicans and democrats alike to get ideas on the table.  They also have a pretty strong get out the vote system.\n\nAre there stupid people on all sides who make bad decisions? Yes.  But we heard you the first billion times.  Now what can you do to help?",
