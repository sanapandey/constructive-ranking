We're constantly getting told how low unemployment is and how wonderful the economy is doing, all while we're spending more on food and rent than we ever have. \n\nYou don't win elections by telling people what won't happen if they elect you. We need a plan, maybe some sort of platform thingy, that tells them what we're going to give the people, what we're going to protect, and how we plan to make sure it stays in place. I don't really see that happening right now.\n\nEdit: good grief, I didn't say anything about me or my situation, but people seem to be taking it as me clamoring for handouts or expecting the government to coddle me while offering nothing in return. Not what I said at all. I'm saying that the Democratic platform is virtually non-existent and we need to be telling people what we will be doing for them if they elect Democrats, not just what they'll be avoiding. Otherwise, we're just voting for the status quo, and people aren't happy with that. \n\nAs for if things are bad, [65 percent](https://thehill.com/business/4346224-most-americans-feel-the-economy-is-in-recession-despite-strong-job-market-steady-growth-survey/) of millennials and Gen xers feel the economy is in a recession, despite numbers touting the opposite. The biggest reason for this is greed-driven inflation, which may have slowed, but certainly hasn't reversed. So yeah, we may have more money now than we ever have, but compared to even just twenty years ago, it doesn't go nearly as far.",
