If you think women were mad about the overturning of Roe, then just wait until birth control is severely limited. The reaction will make the record-breaking voter registration look quaint in comparison, getting men involved as well.\n\nFuck around and find out! If they do this, then 2024 will be a blood bath for the GOP.",
