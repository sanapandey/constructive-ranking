    "selftext": "As the political reality of 2024 sinks in, more and more left-leaning individuals like myself are realizing the only option for the primaries is to switch parties (either to R or Independent, depending on your state) and try to get Haley on the 2024 ballot instead of Trump. While Haley is the antithesis of everything we stand for policy-wise, I believe we all realize she's not even close to the level of danger Trump poses to our democracy, and is at this point the *only* alternative to Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination. \n\nTo be blunt, just voting for Biden in the general election isn't enough. When the future of our nation is quite literally at stake, it's everyone's responsibility not to vote for Biden but to vote *against Trump* regardless of the alternative. If the idea of switching to Republican registration for one election sounds repugnant, get over it. It's not capitulation, it's subversion. \n\nAs a moderate democrat, this is a challenge particularly toward my more hard liberal brethren. All the talk and activism in the world isn't worth crap if you choose to sit on the couch during the most important primary in the last century. Let's go take down a wannabe dictator.",

But negative polarization is a helluva force. \n\n(Not voting for Haley or whoever the candidate is regardless, but voting against Biden).",
