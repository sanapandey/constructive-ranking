If you are going to bring back the crime of vagrancy and lock people up for being homeless then just say so. Because just telling everyone nationwide to \"get up and move along, you can't sleep here\" isn't a solution.",

I would argue 75% of the people you see living on the streets here desperately need to be medicated. I'm yet to hear anyone suggest anything half-sensible to addressing these issues (in fact, Kentucky lawmakers just passed legislation quite similar to what London is proposing).",
