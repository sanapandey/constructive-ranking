It's a fine sport that's good for cultivating a lot of good personal traits. I think that the American left has done itself a great disservice by focusing so heavily on gun control. It's part of what fucked us over for the rural vote. For my part, I make it known that I have a standing policy of offering gun advice and training to anybody who wants it. As someone with a lot of LGBT and POC friends, I was surprised by how many people wanted to own guns but felt intimidated by the traditional, stereotypical firearms community.",

Barrel shrouds? Telescoping stocks? People go after shit like that instead of working *with* gun owners - the people who know what they're talking about - on things that would actually save lives, like more enforcement on background checks or more accessible safety training. That sort of attitude is why gun control is viewed by us as a botherance rather than as a means to saving lives.\n\nAlso, have a look at the material conditions of our country. We're totally different from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. We're no island and our living standards have been declining since the end of the American System in the 70s. We're more like South Africa or former Yugoslavia. Declining living standards cause violence for many reasons. Even if all our guns went away, we'd still have mass killings.",

You can\u2019t solve the one without the other.   We have a war on drugs that needs to end already.  And we have a poverty issue where people need money and they get it from illegal means like straw purchases, illegal check cashing etc.  \n\nBut our constitution allows us access to firearms.  For better or worse it\u2019s a right.. we have so many other issues that it\u2019s amazing to me we continue to fight one another over limiting our rights instead of fixing and expanding our rights like right to have healthcare or right to not fucking die on the street due to addition or mental illness.  It\u2019s a wild concept that rhe supposed left leaning people push more and pass rhe laws that restrict freedom than expand it.\n\nThere\u2019s absolutely nothing stopping any state in America to make healthcare a right and then provide it to its people through taxes and regulate its medical community to require them to take it if they practice in the state.  Accept their donors the ultra wealthy won\u2019t allow it.   If regular Joe no longer needs to worry about healthcare then how do you keep them prisoner of your labor?  If small businesses can now compete with talent with large ones due to no longer needing to go without benefits or shit ones.. then who wins??
