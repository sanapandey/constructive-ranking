To even charge a president would require going through the courts to assert that this \"official act\" should not have immunity. This process would take years, likely beyond a president's term.\n2. The six Republican Injustices went further and said that the president's motives can't be used to remove immunity.\n\nSo in practice: Yes, the six Republican Injustices gave the president the power to assassinate opponents (or at least to order it, whether someone would actually pass on the order or carry it out is a separate question).\n\nThe only reason the majority authored this decision out of their asses is because they know Biden (and believe no Democratic party president) would every abuse the office to do the authoritarian shit that Trump is eager to do.",
