            "body": ">From Democracy to Oligarchy\n\n>Billionaires are a trump card that can disrupt democracy by exploiting the dreams of some people to acquire enormous wealth, become famous, and break the law with impunity. Once billionaires win, however, they become the law. As in Russia, the oligarchs collaborate with the ruling party to transform politics into patronage and economics into outright theft.\n\n>To do this, they don\u2019t have to break the law: they make the law.\n\n>In the United States, such an oligarchy would look a lot like the state of affairs at the impishly named X. \n\nThe author of this article seems incredibly naive.  This already happened in the US long, long ago.  They already made the law.  It's called Citizens United.  Unlimited money is already being poured into politics.  Democrats aren't losing because they don't have billionaire support.",
