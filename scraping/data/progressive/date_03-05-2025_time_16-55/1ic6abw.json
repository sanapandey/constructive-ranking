AliKhan blocked the action Tuesday afternoon, minutes before it was set to go into effect. The administrative stay pauses the freeze until Monday.\n\nThe White House had planned to start the pause as they begin an across-the-board ideological review of federal spending.\n\nThe plan sparked confusion and panic among organizations that rely on Washington for their financial lifeline.\n\nAdministration officials have said federal assistance to individuals would not be affected, including Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, student loans and scholarships.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below... [see link]\n\n\u2014-\n\nSelections from this article:\n\n\u2014-\n\nDemocrats described the Trump administration\u2019s decision as capricious and illegal. They argued that the president had no right to unilaterally stop spending money appropriated by Congress.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James planned to ask a Manhattan federal court to block the funding pause.\n\n\u201cThere is no question this policy is reckless, dangerous, illegal and unconstitutional,\u201d she said.\n\nSeparately, group of nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit in Washington saying that the funding pause is \u201cdevoid of any legal basis or the barest rationale.\u201d\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pause-federal-grants-aid-f9948b9996c0ca971f0065fac85737ce",

The constitution says one thing, and one branch is behaving in contravention to that. What happens now depends on the people involved. When he tried stuff like tbis in 2021, the guardrails generally held, because most of the people involved were dedicated to the institution over the man. This is why Trump has been diligently working to purge the executive (as as much of the legislature as possible) of anybody not sufficiently loyal. If people choose to obey Trump over the law / courts, it means the constitution has ceased to govern the nation, and our governance is being reshaped into some form of autocracy.\n\nFor an illustration, look at the early months of 2017, when Trump instituted his \"Muslim ban\". The courts struck it down, and several executive departments said \"OK we'll resume pre-ban operations in compliance with the court order\", but the DHS (and/or maybe ICE?) said \"We take our orders from the president\". That's why Trump's most overreaching abuses (e.g. mobilizing the FPS in response to the 2020 protests) were largely carries out by those loyal institutions, and he went to work purging the other institutions of disloyal members. Now that job is pretty nearly done, and there are very few left with any interest in defying his orders. \n\nIf you've studied much history, you may recognize that this is literally how governments collapse. Various forces and agencies take sides with one figure rather than the state, and it dismantles the state piece by piece. That's why Roman generals weren't allowed to bring their armies past the Rubicon -- armies tended to be more loyal to their generals than to Rome.",
