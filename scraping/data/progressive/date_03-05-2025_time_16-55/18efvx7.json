So the companies are taking the vast majority of the financial risk. This doesn't mean that the patent system is fine, or that they should be allow to price gouge, or that they shouldn't have to pay a fair price for licensing government patents, but let's be honest about where the risk lies. Remember that all those pharma companies that progressives complain about are the *very few* survivors - countless companies in the field have disappeared due to the risks involved in getting drugs to market.\n\nI'm very happy that the Biden administration got rid of the non-interference clause - that was an abomination. And I hope they use this Act to specifically target companies that evergreen their patents and/or use patent thickets.",

It is true that in the US marketing is a big expense *once* the drug is approved (because of the stupid direct to consumer marketing) but it doesn't factor into the cost of approval.",
