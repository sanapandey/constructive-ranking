We're also just feeding Chinese companies terabytes of data on Americans to train hostile AI on.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's easy to say targeting it is just trying to remove a communication tool of the youngest workers and voters in the country (bad for the left), but there are also *real and serious* security concerns with how that app functions.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's my understanding at least.
