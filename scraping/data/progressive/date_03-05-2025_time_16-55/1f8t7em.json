And re-evaluate eligibility is pretty much just a euphemism for \"changing the rules to kick as many people off medicaid as possible while still maintaining the minimum federal requirements to retain funding\"?",

Roughly 70% of those who were dropped lost their coverage because of procedural reasons such as paperwork issues, although some may no longer qualify for other reasons, such as an increase in income.\n\nDropped with little notice\nMelissa Mazaeda, vice president of care coordinator J&M Support Coordination in Florida, says procedural mishaps have been particularly problematic for people with developmental disabilities, who often require extra assistance to complete the renewal process. Advocates for the disabled say far too many were lumped into the wrong Medicaid categories, were dropped with little notice and didn\u2019t receive timely help when they were disenrolled.\n\nMazaeda said states should never have kicked the developmentally disabled off Medicaid in the first place. \n\n\u201cThey are never going to not need Medicaid. You don\u2019t get over Down syndrome. There is no cure for cerebral palsy. You don\u2019t get better from spina bifida or autism,\u2019\u201d Mazaeda said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to require lifelong services. And the basis of that is Medicaid.\u201d \n\nThe National Health Law program \u2014 a nonprofit that advocates for the health rights of low-income and underserved individuals \u2014 has filed civil rights complaints in Colorado, Texas and Washington, D.C., alleging discrimination against people with disabilities.\n\nIn Florida, a class action lawsuit accuses the state\u2019s unwinding process of being not just sloppy, but illegal. Plaintiffs allege the state violated the constitutional rights of tens of thousands of Floridians, ending coverage \u201cwithout adequate notice\u201d and with \u201clittle or no explanation of the actual reason.\u201d\n\nOf the 1.9 million people in Florida who lost Medicaid coverage, according to KFF, patient advocates estimate that thousands of disabled people like Eakin have been affected.",
