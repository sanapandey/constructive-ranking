Watch this video right here to see what Lawrence represents:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Ik7FQ1Qrg\n\nSince white people fled antiracism protests in 1984, the city of Lawrence, MA. has been associated with Puerto Rican and Dominican people, and so many white people fear school beatings in schools with lots of Dominican people because of extreme racist stereotypes. This article seems to be reinforcing the horribly racist stereotype about Dominicans and school fights and beatings. \n\nNot too far from Lawrence in Lewiston, Maine, news media is spreading more horrible stereotypes about Somalis.",

The problem is these fights actually happen, and there are students, staff and parents upset about them. \n\nSchools will sweep a lot of misbehavior under the rug so they don\u2019t look bad to the public eye. This is a case where the bad stuff is out for people to see.",
