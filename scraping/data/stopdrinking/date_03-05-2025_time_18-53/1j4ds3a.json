    "selftext": "On my 9th day. In the middle of the day I was overwhelmed by fatigue. Have slept well and had some much energy from third day and until today. \n\nIs this something anyone here has experienced? (If not I am afraid it\u2019s the flu, so almost hope it\u2019s an early sobriety thing\u2026) \n\nI have read posts about people being tired in week 1. But this is middle of week 2. I may have over done new lifestyle with a lot of activity but have also slept better than when I was drinking. So I am quite sure I haven\u2019t pushed myself too hard. Also stick to healthy diet, no junk food or sugary stuff (ate chocolate today though) \n\nFeels like I ran into a wall today. Have been relaxing on bed for hours. ",

Fact of the matter, I still get tired, my back still hurts, my feet hurt, I still get pissed at work and deal with the daily stressors of life.  Now overall do I feel better, hell yes.  Is my life better, hell yes.  But please please please give yourself some space to not be great all the time.\n\nMy fatigue lasted for quite some time.  Several months if I remember correctly.  Depending on your age, it can never hurt to hit the dr to check everything out.",

It was like my body just said \"no more functioning for you. Sleep now!\" Very hard to do when your at work! I changed the time I took my meds and that helped. I also started going to bed a bit earlier even if I wasn't sleeping I was still resting and increased my water intake. I so t know if any of that will help.",
