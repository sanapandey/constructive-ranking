    "selftext": "Hi all, (29f) I\u2019ve been drinking at least a bottle a day for the last 4 years and a troubled drinker for much longer than that. \n\nI\u2019m on day 4 and feeling very proud of myself and it\u2019s such a great feeling in the morning. It\u2019s mostly been a lot easier than I thought - I just keep telling myself \u201cI don\u2019t drink\u201d and thinking about all the benefits. \n\nHowever - I get close to slipping each day when it hits about 3pm and I\u2019m excited to finish work and my thoughts have been going to \u201cwhy? I\u2019m not drinking tonight\u201d and I get a little disappointed but have managed through it knowing it\u2019s just my addiction talking.\n\nAs a side note I thought my eyes (cloudy & veiny) would have cleared up and dehydration would have reduced by now which has not happened. But something to look forward to! ",

They're something to look forward to every evening now.\nI know that after work moment you describe as well. What I am usually trying to do is keeping myself busy after work, trying to push the thoughts about alcohol away. It works for me, sometimes better and sometimes worse. I'd usually do chores or try to get something done I planned to do for a long time already. Like paint that kitchen shelf, sort things in that cabinet or declutter the basement. Having done such things gives me an achievement to look at, something to be proud of and to think I would probably not have managed to finish that if I was drinking. There are tons of hobbies I used to say I don't have time for anymore but now thinking that maybe I do actually have the time for them, because I'm not drinking so I have the time I used to sit on the couch with a bottle of beer in my hands and doomscrolling.\n\n\n\nMaybe there's some activity you enjoyed doing but didn't do for some time? Some kind of sports, puzzles, games, arts,...? Or, if you are like me, maybe there's some improvement you wanted to do in your home but never quite got the motivation to start with it? If you do that now, it will serve as a monument of what amazing things happen when you're doing other things than drink! \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\nI'm off to work soon. And even if after work I might feel that a drink would be nice, I will definitely not drink with you today!",
