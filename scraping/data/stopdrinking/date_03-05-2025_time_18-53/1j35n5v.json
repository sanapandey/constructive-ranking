    "selftext": "28M.\nSober streak for 7 days for the first time in around 2 years.\nI\u2019ve been an alcoholic for over five years now, and moving to Japan only deepened my drinking habits due to the culture here. That said, I\u2019m a highly functional alcoholic\u2014productive at work, well-respected by my boss (who has no idea I drink), financially stable, own a house, have a wife, and we\u2019re expecting our first child in May 2025.\n\nThe breaking point came last week. I downed 1000ml of whiskey in two hours, fully knowing I had to take my wife to the hospital early the next morning. I passed out at around 1 AM and had to wake up at 6. I felt like absolute shit the entire time at the hospital. And then, as I watched the ultrasound of our baby, all I could think was \"What the hell am I doing?\"\n\nThat moment hit me hard.\n\nI haven\u2019t had a drink since, but it\u2019s been rough.I always wanted to quit before having a kid, but it didn\u2019t happen. Over the past year, I\u2019ve gained 20kg due to excessive drinking. Back when I lived with family, I didn\u2019t drink as much, but ever since moving in with my wife, it became an every-night thing. She doesn\u2019t drink and has never been around heavy drinkers, so she never really saw my habits as a problem. I could finish a full 700ml bottle of whiskey by myself, and she wouldn\u2019t even realize I was drunk\u2014I just talked a bit more than usual, passed out without brushing my teeth, and overate. Because I was always \u201cfine,\u201d I never really had a reality check.\n\nI never drank and drove, but I did sometimes sit in my parked car after work and take a couple of shots before heading inside so that the amount I drank at home looked more \"decent\" in front of my wife. Now, she\u2019s seven months pregnant, and we have a baby shower coming up next week\u2014on my birthday. Friends and family are flying in from all over, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll stay sober through that. I told myself I wouldn\u2019t drink until the event, but deep down, I know that if I take even one sip, I\u2019ll be right back in it.\n\nThis past week without alcohol has been tough. The first three days were brutal, I still think about drinking all the time, but my sleep is better, my mood is better, and I\u2019m actually helping my wife with chores. I know life is better without alcohol, but I still don\u2019t feel in control.\n\nOn top of that, I want to get fit again. I used to play football and had a great physique, but now I\u2019m 90kg at 175cm, and I hate what I see in the mirror. Years of drinking have done damage, and I know I won\u2019t magically fix it in a week, but I just need some motivation to keep going.\n\nTaking it one day at a time, but it\u2019s damn hard. Any advice or motivation from those who\u2019ve been through this?",

You'll be taking a huge step to make sure you are present through your child's life.  You'll be taking a huge step to making sure you remember things that are happening in your child's life.\n\nMy grandfather died of a heart attack at 58 because he was an alcoholic his whole life.  90% of my cousins and I never got to meet him, and he never got to see my older cousins who did know him grow up.  My mom holds onto a little anger towards him for not taking better care of himself and leaving everyone so soon.  She desperately wanted that time with him, and now she'll never get it.  Don't do that to your family.\n\nIt'll literally never be any easier to quit than it is now.  It WILL only get more difficult as time goes on and you continue to drink.  I thought I would be fine but in reading some of the stories on here after I decided to quit, I've learned alcoholism is a progressive disease that WILL take everything from you, slowly but surely.\n\nYou can do this, and you deserve to live your best life!",

You have a wonderful wife and will have a child soon, mine was a loving wife who was being crushed by my drinking. \n\nNot sure what you have done to help you in your efforts but many people here recommend useful books including Allen Carr\u2019s \u201cQuit Drinking Without Willpower\u201d and Annie Grace\u2019s \u201cThis Naked Mind\u201d.\n\nI have recently finished Allen Carr\u2019s book and found that for me it is helping a great deal.\n\nTwo quotes from the book I find particularly powerful are:\n\n\u201cYou hit rock bottom when you decide to stop shoveling\u201d.\n\n\u2060\u201c The craving is not relieved by the drug you\u2019re addicted to, it is caused by it\u201d \u2022\n\nYou might want to give one or both a read.\n\nIWNDWYT",
