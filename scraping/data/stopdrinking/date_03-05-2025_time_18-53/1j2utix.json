    "selftext": "hey guys i\u2019ve been sharing bits and pieces of my sobriety journey here and today has been the worst day yet man. i\u2019m 22 years old and about 6 weeks sober and it almost feels like my life is getting worse and worse by the day. \n\ni bought a car drunk in 2023 that i realistically cannot afford and i\u2019m going to have to surrender it to the bank before it gets repossessed on its own. so that sucks. my credit score dropped from a 750 to a 592 due to the late payments since i bought the car and i\u2019m pretty much ready to hit the reset button and take the L for the next 7 years in regards to that situation. i\u2019m 5k+ underwater so there\u2019s no real way for me to get out any other way. i have a POS car i can drive still so it\u2019s not like i\u2019ll be without transportation. i know i\u2019m going to end up owing money still and i\u2019m pretty stressed about that. \n\ni work on cars and i have for about the past 2 and a half years. i\u2019ve been a job hopper to the fullest extent and i haven\u2019t been able to stay at a shop for more than 9 months before i find some reason to quit. i used to show up drunk to work (never got caught) and would call off frequently when i was still drinking. my work was always quality which is why i\u2019m assuming management at all these places were willing to put up with me for so long. i\u2019ve definitely burned a lot of bridges and i\u2019ve pissed a lot of people off though. i got sober in january and basically wiped the slate clean and was ready to start fresh at this new shop. i was a model employee to the truest extent or atleast i thought i was. i showed up 15-30 mins early, left 15 mins late, and was nothing but friendly to everyone there. i worked my ass off but the car counts have been low and i genuinely have not had that much work to do. most of my time was spent helping other people on their cars or cleaning the shop. last thursday i hit my head on a lift while looking down and acquired my fourth concussion. i didn\u2019t make a big deal out of it or anything, i did miss friday to rest up a little, but i came in today ready to get right back into it even though i\u2019m definitely not supposed to be working again. 30 mins after i clocked in, my manager pulled me aside and told me he was eliminating my position and due to my lack of drive and lack of improvement, he wasn\u2019t interested in finding another role for me. i\u2019m just so tired man. i tried so hard at this place. i knew the job security at this place was non existent and i was extremely worried about it when i took the job and now here i am. i\u2019m extremely talented for my age i just keep getting burned by the shops i\u2019m going to.\n\nbasically everyone in my life is telling me to give up on cars. my whole family thinks it\u2019s not worth it. my mom and brother are trying to convince me to work at walmart, and my dad wants me to go back to working at the factory i used to be at. my brother went on this whole rant about how i\u2019m basically a loser and i\u2019m kinda trash because of the situation i\u2019m in. i just don\u2019t think things can get any worse for me. i\u2019m having like the worst day of my life and everyone i try to talk to just makes things worse. anyways sorry for my rant cheers guys i\u2019m glad i\u2019m facing this sober because alcohol would make this 10x worse.",

Don't believe others.\n\nYou need income. If garages aren't hiring, find what you can to pay your bills. Take advantage of any connections to get a foot in the door.\n\nI told my son when he was your age that no matter how horrible, distressing, or difficult your life seems, it will always work its way out. Always. You may need to walk through fire and be really uncomfortable, but you can have pride in the self empowerment you are practicing to get yourself past it. I also say never, ever give up. Spoken from someone who has walked through so much fire, my feet have scars.\n\nI'm so proud of you for all the work you've already done to heal. Big, warm, loving hug to you. Keep going. You can climb this mountain. \n\n\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f",

            "body": "You have got to address one thing at a time, and focus on what you can actually change. You made a bad decision on the vehicle purchase and ended up underwater, but since there isn't much you can do about it and you have a lot of other things to deal with, just accept it and move forward. Don't waste the brainpower on worrying about debt you can't change right now. \n\nFact is, you need a job in this world. Going to Walmart or the factory might give you the time you need to focus on your sobriety, build confidence, build trust in relationships and get back to a place where you can start pursuing what you really want to do (cars). Unfortunately, you are not in a position to take on a full lifestyle overhaul and work towards your dream career. I won't say give up on cars; if that's you passion, put it on hold until you can focus on it. Right now, you need to focus on sobriety. After some time, once you have proved to yourself that you can hold down Walmart, cope with life stress, get healthy again, you will have all the confidence you need to land an awesome shop job! \n\nAs we alcoholics with time under our belts say, its one day at a time. Start small and focus on what you can control. IWNDWYT!",
