    "selftext": "I'm (40F) going to hit a month this Friday. For the past few days, my emotions have been ALL OVER the place. \n\nI have an anxiety disorder which I've been managing. So, I'm not a stranger to the deep, dark feelings a \"lucky\" few of us understand. But I've been angry, activated, depressed, uncharecteristically assertive, and plain ruminating about how I dont feel validated or seen by my husband, that work takes advantage of me, etc. \n\nI used to drink like a bottle of wine a night, then severely reduced for several months, and finally went to zero in early February. Except for the anxirty mental illness, my body is perfectly healthy. Every biomarker, cholesterol liver etc are all perfect. What gives? Is this my brain recalibrating? I was already drinking way way less. ",

Good at times, anxious, irritable and depressed at others.\n\nBear in mind that our bodies and minds (and souls?) are undergoing MAJOR recalibration. Patience and not getting too caught up in any one feeling are the watchwords.\n\nMost people report improvement in months 2 and 3, with  a big leveling off around 4- 6 months.\n\nIn the meantime, therapy, exercise, meditation, reading/audiobooks/podcasts and hobbies (the more constructive/creative the better) all help me tremendously.\n\nOne day at a time!\n\nIWNDWYT",

It sounds like you may be going through post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) which is the clinical term for the brain recalibrating after substance abuse. The length of time PAWS lasts is different for everyone and dependent on a myriad of factors.",
