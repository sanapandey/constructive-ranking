If the suicidal thoughts persist please get help, suicide hotline, reach out to friends or family, whatever you can. You get one shot at this life, don't throw it away because of some dumb shit you did in the past. It's the alcohol that is making you anxious and the longer you stay away from it the less it will be until, one day you will notice it's gone (or at least very manageable) Try to focus on the present and maybe a bit toward the future. Happy you are not drinking on your birthday, that is a great start. Keep coming back here, we have your back. Take care and good luck. IWNDWYT",

What works to help me shut my brain off is meditation. I did guided ones based on videos at first, then started working in some talks around ethics and it's led to a pretty peaceful way of life all things considered. The big thing is understanding that this moment is based entirely on the previous one so if you want peace in the next, it helps to do things like not drinking in this one to set that one up. This outlook has helped me deal with a lot of things that unconsciously I was using alcohol for. Hope it helps. IWNDWYT",
