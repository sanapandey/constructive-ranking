    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nFirst time poster on this sub but feel it's a good time to do it.  I've suffered from OCD, intrusive thoughts and anxiety for around the last 10 years and have been using alcohol as a coping mechanism to releave anxiety to point I can't relax without it.  I'm currently 31 and have been drinking most of my adult life however have been drinking heavily over the last 3 years.  \n\nI never thought I had any issues with my drinking but I've started to notice the effect it's having on my finances and health which terrified me and still does.  I've been limiting my drinking to the weekends but that often results in binge drinking on the \"on\" days and bleeds into drinking during the week again.\n\nI feel the number one thing stopping me from moderation is having to deal with OCD intrusive thoughts and anxiety which I have used alcohol to largely block out.  Over the past month I have largely went 3-4 days each week without any alcohol before the feelings associated with my OCD become overwhelming and I go back to the drink.  Recently my concerns about the effect of drinking is having on my health is actually causing me to drink more particularly if I've been sober for a few days and justify to myself I'm fine as I am.\n\nI've never spoke to anyone about this but feel now is the right time.  Drinking alcohol heavily is something that everyone I associate with seems to do regularly but I want a better life and a healthy body.  Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to control anxiety/OCD when trying to quit drinking?  At times it feels unbearable and I'd love to get some input and advice from others who have been in a similar position.",

Even a 5-10 minute walk can clear your head. I\u2019m so sorry, anxiety sucks, but as you know, drinking makes it worse in the long run",

            "body": "I suffer from the same. Not many understand just how debilitating and crippling anxiety can be. \n\nI treat intrusive thoughts like a craving. At first those scared feelings/the urge to jump out of your skin or scream or DO anything/perform a ritual to make them go away will still come. Like a craving, over time, you will learn to shrug at it and... ironically it eventually goes away. \n\nOne thing I was taught was to count every time the intrusive thought came in my head. You'll find the realistically its probably really like 10 times a day over the 6 million thoughts you have a day. That helps to weaken the power it has over you. By counting it, you are also separating yourself from it instead of getting sucked in. Over time it teaches your brain, \"This thought is irrelevant and I don't need to send stress signals when it pops up.\" And then you kinda just forget about it. It can take like a good two or three weeks of practice before you realize it doesn't bother you anymore. Hang in there. \n\nThoughts are thoughts, feelings aren't goals.",

Then after i have been trough a major event and finally give up and/or relax that means a low and exhausted period when i don\u2019t really crave alcohol at all.\n\nSorry i have no solution though.",

Just have to stick to it and have a little faith in myself.  That being said I've been as irritable as can be!  Everything feels like a task throughout the day without having a beer and whiskey to sit down with later on but I'm sticking to it.  Friday and Saturday night will be the real challenge...",
