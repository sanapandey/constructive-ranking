    "selftext": "Despite hating blood draws, I was actually excited to get my blood drawn today. It's been 4 months without alcohol and my numbers were abysmal before, basically on the verge of a heart attack. \n\nMy AST and ALT were both pushing 100. My AST is now 39 and ALT 45. \n\nAnd my vitamins that basically didn't exist are now all in the green. Oh, and I've lost 50lbs between cutting alcohol, a diet change, and light exercise. \n\nThis is my friendly reminder to myself that I was down but not out. If you're thinking it's too late for you, it's not. \n\nIWNDWYT! \n\n",
