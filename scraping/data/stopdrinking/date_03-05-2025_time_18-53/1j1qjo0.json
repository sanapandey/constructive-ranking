When you drink chronically you run the risk of major electrolyte imbalance which can lead to seizures, heart failure, etc. The cramping is a minor symptom of this, and usually can be treated by diet, but will keep happening if you keep drinking! Magnesium, potassium, and calcium are the minerals responsible for muscle function, and eating a diet that is balanced will give you what you need. I don\u2019t recommend taking a supplement unless you are elderly and very very depleted.",

I slipped up and went on a short bender to start 2025 but have been sober from booze since.\n\nI have been pretty depressed and am now realizing I may have been using booze to suppress depression. I knew I drank to much but just chalked it up to trying to break boredom. I have been taking marijuana gummies (I know this sub is torn on this) to help with insomnia and I think this might be exacerbating my depression. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s something deeper that the booze was masking. I have been dealing with a bunch of disappointment in terms of my career and also tremendous changes in lifestyle (moving back to my hometown after years of adventures abroad). Now I am facing all of this without the temporary and fleeting comfort that booze provided me in the past. Actually, I was pretty committed to cutting out booze but more recently I\u2019ve been tempted to return to it simply to curtail my anxiety. Of course, this would be an awful idea because I cannot control my consumption.",

It contributed to my depression as I coped with PTSD but ultimately made things way worse at the time. \nAnother is the sensitivity to bruise. I would get bruised from the smallest injuries but am way more resilient now in recovery. \nThe dehydration caused so many symptoms, I see a lot of those posted here like cramps - which impacted my ability to exercise, headaches, dry skin, etc \nI developed liver pain from drinking. I'm confident I have fatty liver which is still healing. The pain went away for the most part when I quit but I'll have coffee/something sugary and it can flare in tandem with exercise. \nDirty house - everything piled up, no interest in maintaining anything.\nSleeplessness, even with long rest, no amount of sleep felt fulfilling. Also the body temp irregularity kept me up at night.\nI can just keep going. It's insane the amount of conditions that form as a result of consuming alcohol. And these things happen to non-addicted individuals as well ofc. There's simply no good reason to drink, I truly believe that. \n\nLast side effect I'll mention, one that is most profound in my recovery, was my LACK OF HOBBIES! Now that I'm in recovery, I have a million bajillion things I love to do. I always say I have way too many hobbies, a beautiful thing. My favorite is rollerblading which I would never be able to do if I kept drinking. It also motivates me not to relapse as I can't skate if I feel like garbage.",

My body is healing and I remember facepalming so hard when I realized how embarrassing it would have been to go to the doctors and do all that song and dance when\u2026it was the alcohol. Duh. It was the alcohol. \n\nAlso still have some raging poops, maybe I just have IBS but I think my gut is also just still healing itself and I don\u2019t eat the best all the time. The poops are still significantly better partially because not drinking helps me be a little generally better at eating better stuff but I also am constantly snacking..but it\u2019s mostly better because I\u2019m not drinking alcohol. \n\nOh and mental health. I\u2019m still going through a lot and healing slot of things but it\u2019s markedly different. I was concerned I was bipolar or something and documenting my manic ups and downs for my psychiatrist. Turns out the extremes were also the alcohol.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to know that even if symptoms of something come back up, now I\u2019ll be able to actually sort through what\u2019s happening in my body without that underlying voice telling me I have to stop drinking to find out if it\u2019s even an actual health issue or symptom of alcohol dependence",

Then it got more and more constant until it was just a constant issue in my life, I was just one of those people who carried tums everywhere at all times. It was a slow progression to that point that looking back was CLEARLY related to alcohol use that also steadily increased. I have had like, once where I almost ate a tums after eating something with a jalepeno since then. But before this heartburn was raging, I\u2019m talking, almost wanted to go to the hospital, seriously thought something was wrong, would lay on a bar bathroom floor (\ud83e\udd2e) because it just made me so hot and out of my mind and in pain when it happened until it would subside about 30-40 minutes later. Funny thing is once I would get it once in the night and get it to go away, I could usually party on without it happening again. So I kept partying and kept partying and kept \u201cpartying\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s wild to me now that I kept drinking the stuff even though it was so clear in my face how bad it was for my body and mind.

I was having some issues with abdominal pain so after some images were taken I had to have an endoscopy to look at my gall bladder. After the procedure I was asked if I suffered from heartburn because my esophagus had inflamed lesions near my stomach entrance. I was put on fametodine to try and help the situation. Two years later I had another endoscopy and the lesions were still there just a lot less inflamed. The doc also took a biopsy of one of them. He was looking for eosinophils (major cause of inflammation) and any cancerous cells. Luckily the biopsy was negative on both counts. The doc finally took me off fametodine and will probably want another endoscopy when I next see him as it's been 2 years since my last one. I don't know if I still have the lesions.",

I actually thought it was the medication I was on that caused it as I had a few (very rare) alcohol free or lower consumption than other days but sweat would literally drop from my face and head. 5 weeks sober and i hardly sweat, I actually feel the cold now where as I'd be in cycling shorts and a t-shirt in winter!!! Also the anxiety \ud83d\ude2c I used to wake up in fear of what I might have done the night before, dreading checking my call log or text list, beer fear is definitely real!!!!",
