    "selftext": "Yall, I\u2019ve never been a drinker like that\u2026mixed drinks on a weekend night out with my friends\u2026 wine after a long week of work (and both occasions were rare).. my drinking started to pick up about 3 years ago.. I switched to vodka/ white claws at every outing I had or trip I took.. it still wasn\u2019t anything too crazy though\u2026. Just a good time.. after I had weight loss surgery\u2026 vsg.. in Feb of 2024 my drinking became shot for shot with no cut off\u2026 the only cut off was me getting into arguments and fights with a specific person..(at that point i knew I was beyond my limit because I am not a violent or argumentative person)\u2026 fast forward to June of 2024..now I\u2019m taking more and more shots and not only still going off on a specific person.. but apparently saying things that rub others the wrong way as well\u2026I held it in the road for a while and was ok for a little bit\u2026 but THEN\u2026 in September of 2024 I started day drinking and even drinking alone.. to the point I fell asleep on my garage floor because I was trying to get out of the car and that\u2019s as far as I made it\u2026. Later whenever I drank I would become violent with only one person\u2026 even in a room full of people\u2026 say awful things to them and etc\u2026 of course it would end up with me being bruised up.. but when u start it u gotta expect the other person to defend themselves too right\u2026. I slowed down in December of 2024.. did well in January 2025 and had another slip in Feb 2025 that led me to just stay in a hotel a few days by myself alone just staring at the ceiling\u2026. BUT NOW I REALLY BELIEVE THE FINAL STRAW FOR ME (BECAUSE IM JUST TIRED OF MY OWN SHENANIGANS ATP) WAS THIS PAST WEEKEND WHEN I WENT OUT WITH FRIENDS\u2026 WE WERE DAY DRINKING AND TOOK A BREAK FOR A WHILE\u2026 THEN WE WENT OUT TO A LOUNGE AND WERE DRINKING\u2026 I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER THE SECOND HALF OF BEING IN THE LOUNGE BUT THE VIDEOS SHOWED ME WE HAD A GREAT TIME\u2026 THE PROBLEM CAME IN WHEN WE WERE LEAVING\u2026 I WALKED OUT THE LOUNGED PERFECTLY FINE\u2026 THEN BOOM! AS SOON AS WE GOT INTO THE PARKING LOT\u2026 I FELL FACE FIRST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD\u2026. I TRIED SO HARD NOT TO BE THAT PERSON\u2026 I TRIED BY BEST TO GET UP\u2026 because I didn\u2019t wanna be that person ..JUST TO FALL AGAIN\u2026it was a group of us yet once again I STARTED GOING OFF AND TRYING TO FIGHT THE SAME SPECIFIC PERSON AGAIN.. THAT NIGHT ENDED WITH ME CRYING IN MY CLOSET WITH ANOTHER FRIEND THAT WAS THERE\u2026. I think it is time I understand\u2026 I CANT DRINK IN MODERATION\u2026. Most people know their limit\u2026 but I can never feel mine until I hit it :( \u2026. I haven\u2019t had a drink since that night\u2026 so it\u2019s been 2 days going on 3\u2026. OAN: why is alcoholism going so unnoticed in this generation.. all we do is laugh it off the next day and prepare for the next drinking session THAT IS NOT NORMALLLL.. well it doesn\u2019t feel normal to me.. I\u2019ve sent a cry for help to people close to me and they think it\u2019s a joke. I AM SCARED ",

I AM SCARED \n\nThe wonderful thing about getting into a program (and there are lots) is the fellowship of meetings. We \"get\" each other. \n\nThe [Community Guidelines and Resources] (https://old.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) page is a good place to start. There is a list of recovery resources, and you can find something near you.\n\nTaking that first step is scary, but it is so very worth it. I love my life now. Sobriety is liberating.",

Got a big scar under my eyebrow and another under my chin to remind me. I\u2019m guessing you have some of those too. Stopping is hard. But drinking is pretty damn hard too right?  My body and mind are thanking me everyday now that I\u2019ve stopped. Yours will too. \nIWNDWYT",
