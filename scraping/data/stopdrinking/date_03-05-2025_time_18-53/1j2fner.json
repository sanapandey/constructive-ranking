    "selftext": "One year ago I had finally put my life together after alcohol caused it totally fall apart.\n\nI stopped drinking for a few weeks, got back to work, recovered physically, and moved back into my father's house and found some stability.\n\nI was cured.\n\nSo I told myself, \"tonight I'll go have a few drinks and watch the game with my friends\". I promised myself that I'd learned my lesson and I'd have no more than 4 or 5 drinks.\n\n  \nI had more than 10 within the first few hours. I blacked out and had to be sent home. My friend the bartender sent me a picture of the receipt...i'd signed my name at the top illegibly instead of on the dotted line.\n\nI didn't do anything \"bad\", but I have no recollection after my second hour in the bar and 0 memory of being driven home.\n\nI woke up in a cold sweat with heart-bursting anxiety.\n\n  \nThank god I did though. I finally learned the truth: I am powerless over drugs. \n\nI bargain. I break promises. I forget my values. I don't pace myself. I obsess. I lose all sense of time. I get tunnel vision. I panic about my next drink. I stare down the mouth of the bottle into the darkness hoping it lasts just one more sip.\n\n  \nThat was one year ago today. 365 days without hangxiety, regrets, apologies, embarassment, or shame.\n\n  \nIt's so much easier to do this when you realize that you can't control alcohol and that any time you drink, it will lead to shame.\n\n  \nNow that I see alcohol for what it really is - shame, lies, embarrassment, anxiety, depression, panic, and guilt - I don't want it.\n\n  \nIt gets easier. I rarely think about using. \n\n  \nIWNDWYT",

It was my first slip since I got sober almost a year ago. It really reminded me why I needed to stay sober, and it kind of took my fear of alcohol away too. It answered some questions I was nervous about during my sobriety.",
