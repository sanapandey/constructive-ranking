Like a LOT of people I wake up at 3:00am every night with full on mind racing and panic.  I know why but I am wondering how long does it take before that doesn't happen?",

            "body": "For me first two weeks were pure hell. Night sweats, sleepless nights, weird dreams, brain fog. At about two months my brain became a super-machine, photographic memory, laser sharp focus, endless motivation. But that also balanced out. And then once the pink cloud faded, it was a bit of a challenge to re-learn how to deal with life. I just had to let the process happen, it would be silly of me to assume that finding baseline was going to be as easy as destroying it with ethanol. Even now, if I have bad night sleep, stress, anxiety, I just need to find ways to either prevent them, or learn how to deal with them at its own pace. Ethanol taught my brain that it shouldn't have to work, manage stress, or learn from the process.",

I had a LOT of \"drinking\" nightmares at first, but after a month or so, my mind started to quiet down.\n\nI still wake up around 3am sometimes...and it's nice to realize I'm waking up because I'm old and have to use the bathroom and not because I'm in panic over what I did that night. I fall back asleep easily.\n\n  \nIt gets better is all I can say. Hang in there. \u2764\ufe0f",

Sometimes with anxiety about drinking dreams, but most of the time it just seems like the \"magic time\" I wake up to pee and get some water and think about how grateful I am it's not withdrawal causing me to wake up.\n\nThe 3am ANXIETY wakeups took about 3ish weeks to stop, for me, but I was in pretty serious withdrawal - on librium for a few days. But the anxiety and sweats subside once your sleep evens out, in my experience. I still like to drink some chamomile tea or some warm beverage with magnesium to help, and those were super useful the first month or so.\n\nI promise it gets better! IWNDWYT!",
