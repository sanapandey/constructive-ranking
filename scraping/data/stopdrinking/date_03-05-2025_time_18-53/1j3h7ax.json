    "selftext": "Hey guys I posted on here a couple days ago that I'd be starting Naltrexone today. Mild nausea, but went away with a snack. Headache, annoying but I can work through it. Now the big one I AM SO TIRED. I couldn't keep my eyes open. I was supposed to deep clean my house today but instead have been sleeping on the couch. Should I start taking it before bed? ",

The problem is I would either drink while i cleaned or reward myself with drinks after so now that I'm done I don't quite know what to do. I showered got the baby to nap getting my 6-year-old off the bus then I guess watch my favorite show and try to get through the day.",
