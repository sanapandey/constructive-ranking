However, I remember going to a bar with someone during my first year and there was a mandatory drink minimum. They didn't serve any soda, so I couldn't order my usual of diet soda. I ended up ordering some mocktail of theirs, yet I remember double checking with the waiter about five times to make sure that this is non-alcoholic. Even when it came to the table, I made sure to smell it and have the tiniest first sip just to make sure. \n\nI'm extra cautious because this last stopping drinking streak is by far the longest I've ever gone, and I know my mind will mind-fuck itself over if I did accidentally drink some alcohol. It's not healthy and I'm very much aware of that, but it's just on the long list of things I have to work on about myself. \n\nCongrats on 88 days! IWNDWYT",

Don't know how many days you are in, but I had many day 1s and countless struggles during my journey. Had I given up in the first 50 attempts, I wouldn't be where I am now. \n\nI'm coming on two years now and it is kind of crazy. I know the issue is that I have that all or nothing mindset. When I FINALLY accepted that I'm going to be on board with the whole sobriety thing and not be on the fence about it, the fear that I might mess up started to creep in the back of my mind. The thoughts are getting better and if some accidental thing happens, I think I would be able to process it in a healthy manner. At the same time, I know if I went out intentionally for whatever big or small reason, I would say fuck it and I've broken my streak. Who knows when I would come back. The guilt, shame, embarrassment, and fear would eat my alive. The fear of this also keeps me from picking up that first drink. \n\nI'm glad you have me responding to this because things aren't perfect and sunny in my life right now. I'm going through a breakup and the thoughts of numbing have crossed my mind. Writing this out to you is also reminding myself that numbing isn't going to help, so I'm just stuck. I know I can't numb but also don't want to sit with these feelings and thoughts. FML.\n\nIWNDWYT",

But yeah I do get scared when I order one as opposed to buying them for myself but I'll usually just say in the bottle/can when I'm ordering and 80% of the time the waitress or bar tender respects it and asks if I would also like a chilled glass to pour it. Sometimes they will pour it and just bring the empty to the table which is fine because I don't assume everyone is out to get me haha",
