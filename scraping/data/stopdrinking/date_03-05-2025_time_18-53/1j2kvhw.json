The thoughts strike exactly when I remember I won\u2019t be drinking in the evening.\n\nIf I decide to drink that evening, this does not happen.\n\nIs this alcoholism, the disease, trying to \u201cwin\u201d by rewarding me by getting what it wants?\n\nIt\u2019s so strange to be at odds with your own brain.\n\nCurious to see if anyone else has experienced this!

Convincing you that the chemical will be soothing to whatever negative emotion is going on.\u00a0\nFind some project level things to occupy your mind. Clean, fix, create. I found the results of doing things that I cannot while drinking is a mental reward that wins over the booze voice.\u00a0",

The drinking didn\u2019t actually help, it just made me ignore the negative voice. It\u2019s been a lot easier with being able to actually work with the negativity than to run from it.",

Alcohol *created* those problems in my brain: a lack of alcohol caused them, and drinking alcohol fixed them.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a point of no return where we say we\u2019re drinking to relax, but we don\u2019t realize that we are actually just drinking to *feel normal* because alcohol has changed our baseline mental state.\u00a0\n\nIt gets so much better! \u00a0",

But the demon of addiction is mad, so mad, that you aren't listening to him . And it will make everything it can to make you believe that it's your fault, and your brain's fault. I picture my brain and my addiction like those two little Kronks from Kuzco, the angel and the demon. It helps me taking it with humor. The demon is so ridiculous and loud, while the angel knows deep down you are not a bad person, even if he's so shy, calm, and he can't really take advantage over the demon. Keep fighting. Be a good Kronk.",

Tell them to shush and that they are wrong.\n\nI used alcohol to self medicate. I\u2019m very familiar with these negative thoughts. I would\u2019ve rather numbed the issues I have, with alcohol. I felt like I was having fun and that my negative feelings would pass, eventually. I was wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve reached back out to my therapist(I had to go through 3 different therapists in order to finally find the perfect one, for me) It is crucial to help your mind.\n\nI used to take 2-3 shooters before my phone/video therapy sessions because it was harder to face/deal with my traumas, sober, BUT IT IS THE ONLY WAY. I was not facing the issues at hand. I was numbing the reality of everything which in turn did nothing but make me stay stagnant, where I was. Drunk, being wreck-less and staying emotionally disconnected.\n\nTherapy helps me big time. A therapist is holding you accountable, which is so helpful! Reddit is helping me BIG, BIG, BIG TIME. AA meeting this weekend will also feel bad ass!\n\nYou\u2019ve got to help your mind, your \u201cengine\u201d. If your engine isn\u2019t functioning the way it should be, you\u2019ll fall into the wrong lifestyle & further harming your beautiful brain. Although it is not easy dealing with your traumas, it\u2019s even harder completely wasting your life, being drunk. F alcohol! \n\nYou\u2019ve got this!!!!\n\nIWNDWYT\u2728\u2728",
