    "selftext": "About a year after I quit drinking, I got back into going to the gym. \n\nBecause of that, I started talking to my high school friend about bodies and working out. \n\nAt some point, he recommend getting a calcium score. I'd never heard of this, so I asked my doc. She sent me to a cardiologist who gave me the test. \n\nCalcium score showed I had a problem with arterial occlusion. From this, they sent me for a stress test. \n\nStress test confirmed something amis. Nuclear stress test confirmed the confirmation. This led to CT and EKG type testing. \n\nThese tests showed I have two coronary arteries 90%+ blocked. \n\nALL OF WHICH LED TO THIS: I am going in for double and maybe triple bypass surgery on Friday morning. \n\nScary as fuck to be sure. But also good, nay, great news. We are out in front of it, and we're not trying to save my ass after a heart attack. So unlike those who suffer a cardiac event, there's been no damage to my heart. Surgeon told me \"it wasn't a matter of if, but when, and when would have been soon\". Since my father died of a heart attack when he was 50 (I'm now 55), this all makes sense. \n\nAs one of my doctors said, \"You're still going to die, but I'm going to make sure it won't be from a heart attack.\" And I likely added a couple of decades to my life. Woohoo!\n\nAnd dear readers, all these cosmic tumblers started turning the day I decided to quit drinking.",
