    "selftext": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nHi everyone! Thank you for such a warm welcome to my first day hosting yesterday, it's an honor to be here!\n\nOne thing I started when I quit drinking was a sobriety notebook. This subreddit is such a wellspring of knowledge and experience that I wanted to begin collecting the things that spoke to me, along with bits of wisdom that I've found elsewhere. \n\nWhat are some of your favorite sobriety quotes, perspectives, phrases, etc? \n\nI look forward to learning from you all today. Let's get this week off to a good start. Have a wonderful Monday, and I Will Not Drink With You Today. \ud83c\udf3b\u2764\ufe0f",

IMO, the collective wisdom of all who have gone before us and those standing with us in this fight-  is priceless.  Here are a few: \n\n* The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The next best time is today.\n* If someone asks you what you do, answer \u201cWhatever it takes\u201d\n* When I could stop drinking I didn\u2019t want to and when I had to stop I couldn\u2019t\n* Alcoholism is suicide on an installment plan. \n* I thought it would be too painful to quit.  Turns out it was too painful to stay the same\n* If we lined up all the alcoholics, in a great big line, from worst to least worst. It doesn\u2019t matter where you are in the line, it\u2019s that you\u2019re in the line at all.\n* Sobriety didn\u2019t open the gates of heaven and let me in. It opened the gates of hell and let me out.\n* Sobriety is a second chance at childhood \n* You are not weak for struggling. You are strong for continuing to fight.\n\nIWNDWT \ud83d\udcaa",

Remove drinking, and guess what?  Life is still hard, but it's a lot easier to face sober.\n\nI've tried to stop drinking so many times over the past 30+ years, but I've never really understood or embraced, \"One day at a time\" until this time.  It's one of the most common sayings in regards to addiction, and now I find it to be incredibly powerful for me.  As an ADHD idiot, I only have to focus on today, I'll worry about tomorrow tomorrow.  I can face today, I will not drink today.  \n\nIWNDWYT!",

Grief has been a huge part of my sobriety whether it's drinking related or in other ways. One of the reasons I drank was my family and I know that I had to have some distance in order to stay on course with my sobriety. It's painful to know what my family endured and that a lot of them continue to ignore all the toxicity and past because it is too much to hold or sit with. Me and my mom were the first to unpack and no wonder it was such a hard go for the both us in our own ways. Harder for her.

Interesting development--I've had this terrible inflammation in my shoulder for months. Got an x-ray, have an MRI scheduled, etc.\n\nIt's slowly gotten better the past two days. It barely hurt this morning (usually that's when the pain is worst). I have almost full range of motion again. \n\nOf course, a little googling would have told me about alcohol and arthritis/inflammation, but I'll take the win.\n\nIWNDWYT",

I wouldn't hurt anyone with it.\n\nI was still undecided. I know from before that when I'm \"undecided\" it's really because I have decided, and I've decided I will but just fool myself. Ultimately I ended up talking with a colleague until 5pm and I had to rush for my train. There was no time to stop anywhere.\n\nMaybe that's a sign. Maybe it was coincidence. It doesn't matter.
