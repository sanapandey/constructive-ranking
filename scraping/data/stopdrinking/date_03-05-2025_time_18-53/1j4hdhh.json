My mind would trick me into thinking the next drink was going to be the start of some adventure, or I\u2019d be more funny and have more fun. But the reality was that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere and i certainly wasn\u2019t making me more charming. I can tell things have changed by how people respond to me and the types of conversations and relationships I have now. I\u2019m no longer chained to a bottle and I\u2019m not too drunk or too hungover or too fucking weird to go out and do stuff. I realized I became a stick in the mud about a lot of things. Coming up with the conclusion before I\u2019ve done any of the work is still something I\u2019m working on but it\u2019s gotten much easier to say yes to things and experiences I normally would\u2019ve shit on in order to continue drinking. It\u2019s work sometimes but it\u2019s worth it.",
