    "selftext": "Hey y\u2019all! \n\nI\u2019m typing this while laying wide awake in my bed, panicking. \ud83d\ude1e English is not my mother tongue, so please forgive spelling/grammar mistakes. I would appreciate if you could give me some comfort or advice. \ud83d\ude0c\n\nI am a 30yo/f and until yesterday, I\u2019ve been drinking about 1 bottle of wine per day, sometimes more, for the last 3 years, mostly due to mental health issues/anxiety/depression/loneliness. Before that, my consumption would be described as moderate.\n\n4 days ago, I noticed a slight to moderate, reoccurring pain in my upper left back as well as my left (side) stomach. Additionally, I sometimes feel nauseous after eating. Normal coloured urine & stool, so far.\nAll I can think of now, which is causes me to feel a mixture between shame, despair and sadness, is that it\u2019s significantly likely that those symptoms are being caused by chronic pancreatitis. \n\nToday, I contacted a gastroenterologist who will get back to me in the following days. \nHow will I survive the time until I\u2019m getting a diagnosis? \n\nI cannot think of anything else right now. I still haven\u2019t lived the (sober) life I want at all yet, I would like to have kids in the future and have a fulfilling career. Now it feels like I can forget all of that if chronic pancreatitis (which will likely develop into cancer) would turn out to be true. It would also absolutely break my parent\u2019s hearts, it\u2019s making me hyperventilate every time I think about that. \n\nThe only comforting thing I\u2019 telling myself is that part of my symptoms (specifically the back pain) may also be caused by muscular tensions. Comparing my two sides, the left one feels more stiff to me, I also had some headaches on my left side. \n\nI basically don\u2019t know how to live through the next days, let alone how I would cope with a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis. \nDealing with all of that sober doesn\u2019t really make it easier for me, I just hope that I can abstain from booze now for good. \n\nThank you for listening! I am so grateful for this community. \ud83d\ude4f ",

It can turn chronic, but if you avoid alcohol there is a very very good chance you will not have future problems. Of course follow up with your GI doc. But i think you can relax and focus on not drinking for now. Just get through 24 hours.",

I couldn't keep down solids, or liquids eventually, and all the while was in incredible pain. I mention all that to say, that even from that extreme level, I recovered and healed just fine. And here I am almost 2 years later in good health and it's now just a memory. It looks like you had a physician give you some good advice here too which I hope makes you feel better. You can get through these next days, be kind to yourself and your body in the meantime :)",
