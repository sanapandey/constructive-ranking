Last night a new friend brought out some nice whiskey and offered me a beer as well andI was able to watch the rest of the group enjoy their drinks and not even be tempted. I only wish I would have found this 2 years ago!",

I _think_ that 3 to 5 months might have sufficed, but I kept taking it partly to comfort my long suffering wife (but the extra insurance against another slip didn't hurt!)\n\nI always like to say something about it potentially being a bad choice for anyone who would possibly/likely drink while on it.  I've heard a few stories from recovered alcoholics who drank on Antabuse, and sayin' it ain't pretty is quite an understatement.  (I was warned that the mix of the two could even be fatal.)\n\nSober Life is Beautiful!\n\n**IWNDWYT**",

Its a non stop wave of emotions and situations that need inside thought and regulation, deep spiritual work and acceptance. Its a hard challenge. But its 100% easier and more safisfying sober than wasted.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be a kant, but sugarcoating sobriety can be damaging to newcomers. You still got to deal with life on lifes terms, y\u2019know.",
