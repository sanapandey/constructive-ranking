My fears prevented me from even trying to quit. I did a lot of reading beforehand, I didn't have a day on the calendar, eventually one day I realized that THIS could be my day one. Tomorrow could be my day 2. My experience so far has been much easier than I thought, because I have a sober community here 24/7. Keep coming back. IWNDWYT",
