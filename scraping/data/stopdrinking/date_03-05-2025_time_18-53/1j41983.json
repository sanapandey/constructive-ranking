    "selftext": "(I wrote this in my diary and thought I'd post it here\u2026 because why not. Maybe it will help you. Maybe it will help me.)\n\nI have been sober since roughly the early morning of Sunday, March 2nd. That means I've hit the seventy-two hour mark of sobriety. I consider that to be the end of \"acute\" withdrawal, or at least the worst of it. Importantly, last night was the first since Sunday that I was able to sleep through the night. I woke up a couple of times, but promptly fell back asleep.\n\nThe first day is, unsurprisingly, the worst of the lot. Sweating, unable to walk properly, unable to even sleep. I had one severe panic attack, but it didn't become a full-on seizure. I asked my mother for one drink, which helped immensely. That first night sober was a daze.\n\nThe second day was better. I was able to go to the apartment, clean and do laundry. But the severe agitation and anxiety meant I could never rest or relax. I did find some peace in reading Demon Copperhead. I slept a little Monday night, but not as much as I was hoping. I had bizarre dreams, including one in which my ex was murdered by her father.\n\nTuesday was characterized by brain fog and\u2026 lethargy. The smallest task felt like a herculean effort. I took the dog for three walks, though, and I had brief moments of clarity and good feelings. I finally reached out to work, saying I could come back in Thursday. My manager said we'll meet then. I'm not 100% sure I'll still have a job, but there's not much I can do at this point.\n\nI thought a few times about drinking that night. I yearned for that wash of relief. But I also know I can't continue doing this. Sometimes I can drink and function the next day. Sometimes though the drinking becomes a full-on bender like this last time. I drank continuously for six days, eating only three meals. I remember very little. When I woke up Sunday night I knew I was too much of a wreck to go out and buy more. This is what always stops me, the sheer inability to go out and buy more. I drank the suds of every wine bottle, liquor bottle, and beer can in my apartment. I even swallowed what was left of the mouthwash. And then I settled in for the painful process of withdrawal.\n\nI've done all this more times than I can count. I had ten months of sobriety in 2023 and was sober for most of 2024. Why do I want to be sober now? Because drinking is miserable and I never want to go through withdrawal again. That's not a strong reason, I know, but it's all I got for now. IWNDWYT",
