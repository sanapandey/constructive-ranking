            "body": "When my mind was still trying to come up with ways to get me to drink, it would make me not sleep, get very stressed, massive anxiety. And then when I caved, my mind would quickly tell me \"see, that was the right way of dealing with it.\" And then in no time, I am again drinking myself into stupor, trying to understand each morning how I got to the same shitty spot where I was. And then not drinking felt even more difficult, since my mind knew how it could get me agitated enough to get me to succumb. Now I can be having the shittiest days, ready to run away into the mountains. And all I have to do is step back, take a very deep breath, exhale very slowly, and notice how my mind is just in overdrive for no real reason. If I ask it, yea it'll have a billions of reasons, and billions of reasons why a drink is a viable option. But that small moment allows me to see that I am not in pain, my legs are not on fire, I'm not bleeding, and whatever is bothering me isn't going to go away if I get black out drunk. In reality the mind will overamplify everything to get what it wants.\n\n40 days! Amazing. All the walls we climb over in our process will feel like small stepping blocks once we know how to climb over. Yet our minds will make those blocks feel like impassible obstacles. \n\nIWNDWYT",
