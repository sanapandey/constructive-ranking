    "selftext": "i\u2019m not an alcoholic, but i use alcohol as such a crutch in social situations and hate who i am when im drinking. i don\u2019t like the way i feel when i wake up, i get crippled with anxiety, so why do i do this? \n\ni drank last night and i feel like i was the worst version of myself. i don\u2019t drink frequently, but i have been going out more often lately, and i can\u2019t keep doing this to myself. i like myself generally, but i don\u2019t like myself right now, and i think it\u2019s time to make a change. \n\ni tried moderation (only drinking beer) but i don\u2019t like beer and it\u2019s tough for me to say no to drinks or shots once i start drinking. it\u2019s not working and i need to own up to that and be honest with myself. \n\ni\u2019m scared that my friends will say im being dramatic going sober because im not an alcoholic. i\u2019m scared that i AM being dramatic. but im at the point where i\u2019d rather be dramatic than wake up and hate myself one more time. \n\ni\u2019m excited to prove to myself that i CAN do this. i CAN say no. i CAN be a better version of myself, even if i\u2019m \u201cless fun.\u201d thank you all for being a positive influence on me to say i don\u2019t have to do this anymore.

I also never resonated with that term, but my life has been so much better since I stopped drinking and honestly no one really cared when I did. I tell people that I\u2019m doing it for my health and no one really questions it!",

I know I am, and it sounds like you are reaching that conclusion yourself. The bottom line is you don't need to ever wake up hating yourself again, and that's a HUGE thing IMO.\n\n\nThe thing that helped me is changing my perspective towards alcohol; because I don't want to drink and understand that alcohol doesn't give me anything personally, it's not about giving up the ability to drink as much as it is that I'm gaining sobriety. I think from that perspective it's easier to tell your freinds that you're choosing sobriety.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I think you'll find in the long run that you're not any less fun without booze, although it may take a whole to figure out how to be fully comfortable socializing without alcohol.\u00a0",

Life is so much better physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. Alcohol was dragging me down! Who needs that?!",
