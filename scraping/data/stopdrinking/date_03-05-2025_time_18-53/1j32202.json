I am medicated for anxiety and depression but I think being without alcohol has me feeling really low as well.\n\nLast year I was sober for 5 months (my longest ever) and the benefits were amazing. What did your timeline look like as far as the benefits of sobriety?",

For me the benefits were almost immediate. I didn\u2019t have withdrawals oddly enough and I began to feel much better within a week. It\u2019s not like that for most folks. But the mental side took bit longer. In fact it\u2019s still a work in progress and it may always be so. But I\u2019m open to it now and I\u2019m making progress every day. You will too the further away you get from that last drink. \nJust don\u2019t quit five minutes before the miracle! Congratulations on your first week! Keep going and keep coming back! IWNDWYT",

When I say recover, that's just to go back to my baseline - mild anxious and depressed state. Like I'm still anxious and a bit depressed but it's manageable. I've found out that I needed a good month and a half to actually feel energized, visibly decreased anxiety, and generally in a good mood. Keep up the good work, alcohol only makes everything worse !",

So I decided to make a drastic change to my diet and put as much healthy stuff as I could in it.  I ate so many fruits and veggies and drank nothing but water and milk.  I felt better almost instantly.  I wish I would have tried it sooner but hey, I made it.  Learning how to make them tasty also occupied my mind as well.  Hang in there and best of luck!",

It wasn't easy to fall asleep, but once I did, the sleep felt so much better and I started to dream again. I also found that I felt just as good after 5 or 6 hours of sober sleep vs 8-9 hours of drunk sleep. \nMy anxiety and depression started to get better after about a week.\nMy stomach and digestive issues got better after about a week. \nI was a heavy, daily drinker for 30 years before I quit. \nI had my first day without a craving after about 60 days. \n\nYou can do this!",
