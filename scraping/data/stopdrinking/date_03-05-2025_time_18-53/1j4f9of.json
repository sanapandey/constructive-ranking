    "selftext": "26m, back on day one after a 3 day bender despite approaching 6 months sober. frustrated with myself but ready to put myself back together and keeping on with it. \n\none of the main struggles right now is having to accept the fact that i have to stop for good at a pretty young age. in the grand scheme of things i know that all stopping now means is that ill save a ton of money, prevent damage to my health and relationships, and be a generally higher functioning person than if i chose not to quit, but it\u2019s really daunting knowing that ill have to deal with this forever. i know there\u2019s the \u201cone day at a time\u201d mentality but that never really worked for me. for now the goal is get to 6 months again and then take it from there (which i guess is just sort of a 6-months-at-a-time mentality\u2026.) \n\nso for anyone who got sober around my age and has kept it going, any advice or words of wisdom or just anything at all would be really appreciated.

I hope you don\u2019t forget all the work and dedication you put in to make that happen! \n\nAnyways, im pretty close to your age and the idea of quitting drinking for good was kinda intimidating. Thinking \u201cWow no more Sunday mimosas, no more wine with my meals, can\u2019t even go to a party and have a couple drinks to loosen up\u201d. It can get pretty negative. \n\nBut on the same note, try to remind yourself of all the trouble you\u2019re avoiding at the same time. No more hangovers, no more calling out of work due to hangovers, no more slowly killing my liver and myself, no more wasting money and time on something that does nothing for me.\n\nOn its own, it can seem like you\u2019re missing out. Just don\u2019t forget all the downsides you no longer have to deal with in sobriety.\n\nIWNDWYT",

            "body": "I'm recently sober (84 days), but my husband is 15 years sober and quit when he was 26 and I was 22. I didn't drink for probably 7 years then slowly got into wine mom culture and recently decided to cut it out for good. My weight slowly crept up over the years and I ended up depressed and obese from almost daily wine drinking. I'm 37 now. \n\nThe difference I feel in my health and happiness is UNMATCHED. I sleep better, I've lost 15 lbs and counting and I exercise almost daily. I feel SO GOOD. But it has been a lot of work and the first month is tough. I had to immerse myself into taking care of myself. Lots of motivational YouTube videos, David Goggins has been a huge part of my newfound discipline. \n\nAnyway, the day my husband got sober, unbeknownst to him, I was going to break up with him. It was another horrible night of him blacking out. I was so tired of the blackout drama and planned to break up with him and move out. He called to tell me that he was getting sober. I never pressured him. I was just DONE. \n\nFast forward to now and we have been married for 13 years with two daughters. He's the most amazing dad and a wonderful husband. \n\nIt wasn't easy at first and there were a lot of awkward firsts. We also lost a lot of \"friends\" and felt pretty lonely and isolated. He started running shortly after he got sober and started taking care of his health. He has told me many times how happy he is that he quit when he did. He's in a band and is in the bar scene on a regular basis. If he can do it, so can you! \n\nYou can do this and it's so worth it. The best part about quitting young is you don't end up 40+ with damaged organs. It's harder to bounce back the older you are. He's very grateful he got out unscathed. Good luck!",
