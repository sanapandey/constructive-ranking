    "selftext": "Hi everyone, first time posting here, but I\u2019ve been visiting on and off for a couple months. I\u2019m about to turn 29, and basically since age 22/23 I\u2019ve had bad drinking habits. What started out as young fun turned to dependency. My mother always told me growing up that addiction runs in the family, but I suppose I thought \u2018that won\u2019t happen to me.\u2019\n\nIt has, and it\u2019s continued to be a boulder holding me back. I\u2019m engaged to my best friend, and although he enjoys drinking he doesn\u2019t have the same issue I have. His type of shot is a small sip and he knows when to stop. Me? When I don\u2019t notice the effects of a full shot instantly, I take one or three more to follow. I\u2019ll get that itch and bug in my brain telling me if I don\u2019t drink more I will die or something bad will happen. \n\nI was diagnosed with adhd just a few years ago, so I\u2019ve always had mental and behavioral issues throughout life. When I drink past a certain point, my mood shifts in a Jekyll and Hyde kind of way. I\u2019ve said things to my fianc\u00e9e that don\u2019t even make sense the next day. I\u2019m so sick of making excuses and telling him that angry person isn\u2019t me. \n\nI did it again last night - drank some wine, then vodka, then more wine. One little thing he did absolutely pissed me off in a way that I can\u2019t comprehend now. Then I got sick and passed out, and woke up confused at 2am with that gut full of anxiety and regret. \n\nHe\u2019s always told me I\u2019m his best friend and love of his life, but when I treat him the way I do because I\u2019ve been drinking, I just think he deserves so much better. I\u2019m not sure how he doesn\u2019t hate me already. I think my personal issues and insecurities pop out and so any self control I had left bursts away, and all that\u2019s left seems like rage about life. \n\nI managed to go three weeks sober during the summer, and that was a fantastic time. Since then, the most I\u2019ve been able to go without a drink is between 1-3 days. I\u2019ve always struggled with self control and discipline, but making today Day One is what I need to do to save myself. I don\u2019t want my relationship to be strained anymore, but I realize if I\u2019m not my own best friend, and if I\u2019m not truly happy with myself, then nothing good will last anyway. \n\nI apologize for the long post and ramblings. I\u2019m so appreciative of this community as it helps me feel less insane and guilty, and I hope I can post about reaching 100 days or even a year. IWNDWYT.",

This is the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever had to deal with, but thankfully I do have a good support system. My mom used to drink heavy, too, but has been sober almost 10 years. \n\nI love your username btw!",
