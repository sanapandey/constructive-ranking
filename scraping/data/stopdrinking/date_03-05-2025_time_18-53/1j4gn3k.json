Can\u2019t tell if they were trying to be snide/rude or not, but I\u2019m erring on giving people the benefit of the doubt more now, in recovery.\n\nIf they WERE being nasty, there is ZERO place for that sort of shit attitude on this sub.\n\nETA: ah, I\u2019ve come across this person before. A cursory review of their post history reveals a very unhappy individual. Saying a prayer for them!",
