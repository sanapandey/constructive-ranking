Thanks to all of you lovely people and the collective of AA. \nLife is still hard at times but I haven\u2019t done anything stupid, wasted any money or hurt anyone due to being drunk. \nMy life has gotten objectively better since my last drink. \nI\u2019m posting this as proof that it\u2019s possible to not drink for a year. \nIWNDWYT\n",
