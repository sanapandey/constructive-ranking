    "selftext": "I never thought I would be able to make it to this point and it feels amazing. I abused alcohol for over two decades and then at age 47 I realized if I kept on going down the path I was on, I was mostly likely going to die early, miserable, and alone. \n\nThe last time I drank I woke up the next morning hungover and still a little drunk. I was horrified to see I that I had gotten in a text argument with someone I cared about very much. I said such mean-spirited things and I had no memory of any of it. Blacking out drunk had become my normal. I decided at that moment I was done with drinking. I poured out the small amount of alcohol that remained in my house and haven't looked back since. \n\nHere are a few things I've learned since getting sober:\n\nFirst, make sure to have a plan for cravings. Especially early on. I found that having tea and sparkling water on hand helped a lot. I also found that getting out of the house and doing something, anything, helped the cravings pass. Anything from going for a walk to doing some quick bodyweight exercises. Just anything to take my mind off the cravings. \n\nNext I decided to get my diet and fitness in check. Years of drinking to excess had led me to making poor food choices along with a sedentary lifestyle. I was always either too drunk or hungover to do much of anything. Now I work out six days a week and eat healthy. This improved not only my overall health, but my mental health as well. \n\nI took up hobbies that I had given up on during my drinking career. I finally have the time and the desire to do the things I enjoy. Life without alcohol feels strange at first. Boring sometimes. Getting into hobbies made me realize there is so much more to life than drinking. Now I can't believe how much time I wasted sitting around drinking. \n\nFinally I had to work on the \"why\" for my drinking. I identified that I drank to combat depression and to avoid problems. Which is ironic because now I clearly see that drinking made me more depressed and added a million new problems. \n\nI did all of this on my own. No prescriptions, no program, no help. This isn't a brag and it's not to in any way say my way is the right way. I only bring it up to offer a little hope to people that think quitting drinking has to be some impossible, complex process. It's not. Anyone can quit. If you need treatment. Get treatment. If a program appeals to you - get in a program. If going to a therapist seems helpful - do it. \n\nThere's no right or wrong way to get sober and it's never too late. \n\nThank you to everyone in this community for posting. I've gotten so much inspiration here over the years. ",
