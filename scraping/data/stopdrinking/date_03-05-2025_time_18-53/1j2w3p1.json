This is my 3rd time trying this and I\u2019m hating it. I have this great optimism when I wake up and then the evening comes around and I\u2019m irritable edgy unable to stop my mind from wanting to drink I\u2019m visibly upset and my fianc\u00e9 tries to ask me if I\u2019m ok, he knows what I\u2019m doing and fully supports me but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m gonna be exhausting by the end of the month if I don\u2019t get it together. Today I read someone on here say \u201cone day things and life will bring you joy like they used to before alcohol\u201d and it hit me\u2026 idk if I\u2019ve ever been as happy as I am when I\u2019m buzzed. Even as a kid minimal things made me feel true joy. That will be something I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have to eventually unpack I\u2019m sure. How can I look forward to sobriety when I don\u2019t ever remember feeling content even before I went down this path ? Someone tell me something comforting \ud83d\udc94",

I had days where I wouldn't years ago but I've been drinking nightly for so long it's hard to shut off the cravings and urges.\n\nJust take it one day at a time. Sometimes one hour at a time or even 15 minutes at a time. It's not easy at all. I feel the same way you do. Mornings are wonderful but evenings are terrible. I still want to drink but I can't due to health reasons. I read on a website about an older guy, I think from Scotland, who basically said \"How come everyone else can drink but not me?\" That's how I feel. I know people who drink more than I did who are totally fine...at least they seem to be but they might be in the same boat as me some day if they continue. At night I'm trying to find little comforts. Something really good for dinner (whatever I want for the time being), tea, a good movie, ANYTHING comforting. Or go to bed early. Before you know it the next day is here. But it's easier said than done. I know.\n\nOn the bright side there's a whole community here of people who feel similar or used to.",

Who the hell am I ? What brings me joy? Why am I here ? And can I fix myself are the questions I have on a loop right now.\n\nI hope you start feeling better soon friend and for today maybe not tomorrow but for today I will not drink.",

Now I'm like \"Oh yeah. I can't drink. Guess I'll drink tea.\" \ud83d\ude29 It sucks.\n\nI've been literally obsessed with this sub. I'm on here constantly because it helps SO MUCH. \ud83e\udec2",
