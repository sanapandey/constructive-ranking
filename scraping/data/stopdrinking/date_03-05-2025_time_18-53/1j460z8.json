    "selftext": "Good morning, everyone!\n\nI've been noticing more posts on my feed about the physical side effects ups and downs in the early days after quitting. I commented on a post last night with this advice, and I decided to make it into an actual post for anyone that may want or need it.\n\nWhen you're in early recovery, have a relapse, etc., and your body is trying to regulate itself again, we all know we feel like absolute GARBAGE. Our whole systems are out of whack. That being said, I seriously cannot recommend implementing a multivitamin into your routine enough.\n\nI take one every morning regardless, but I notice that my gut, energy levels, sleep, nervous system, and pretty much everything else, bounce back a little quicker (if I fall off the wagon, because let's face it, it's happened to me a couple  of times) when I take a vitamin or three every morning as part of my healthy routine.\n\nWe know alcohol severely messes with our gut and blood sugar and dehydrates us, but it actually depletes our bodies of sooooo much more nutrients than we actually realize.\n\nA multivitamin will introduce everything you need back into your system without shocking it. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just make sure you get the basics into your body. It's so simple which is sometimes what we need, and it's effective.\n\nI hope this helps someone, and I hope all of you have a lovely day! Onwards and upwards, keep going, I'm proud of us.\n\nIf anyone has experience with this and would like to touch on any more points, benefits, etc., feel free to share below!\n\nIWNDWYT! \ud83e\udd0d\n\n\n\n* Edited for grammar/spelling",

You saying our systems are out of whack makes a lot of sense, it's like I'm fighting a cold I don't have.",

Thank you for reminding me because I forgot to specify this in my original post.\n\nBut alcohol also severely lowers our immune systems! Makes sense, since all the nutrients we need to be healthy and strong are seriously lacking while we're drinking.\n\nWhen I'm sober, I don't get sick nearly as often. If I fall off the wagon for a bit, I'm immediately fighting colds and whatever crud off pretty much all the time.\n\n\ud83d\ude02 Also, no worries about being disgusting, it wasn't. This community is pretty candid, even about our bowel movements, because that's just a part of the experience and process.\n\nI also had the same issue with heartburn and just overall nausea when I was trying to consume only healthy foods and drinks to get my physical self back on track. Having a multivitamin (and peptobismol, tbh) really made the process a lot easier and more comfortable.",

Surely that's just brimming with vitamins and nutrients haha. \n\nAye, that's kind of where I am right now. I've got an Aloe Vera drink (that's actually doing quite a good job I reckon of just soothing my gullet) which I'd recommend to you/anyone reading, it doesn't seem to be flaring up my stomach and has lots of vitamins. Similar with coconut water, I can't say how nutrient dense or otherwise it is but it's fluid, has at least some vitamins, and isn't burning a hole through my stomach lining. It's also \"thicker\" than water so coats the throat instead of just barrelling down if that makes any sense so also helps in terms of comfort.   \n  \nBetween that and a multi vit, I'll be ready to hit a marathon on Monday!",

PEMDAS or whatever. \ud83d\ude02\n\nIn all seriousness, those Aloe Vera drinks are gooooooood. I basically just hit the flavored, fancy, and sparkling waters hard when I'm sober, and go through phases depending on how many days along I am.\n\nNo matter how good I feel, I'm not sure I could be paid to run a marathon haha. I have two hunting dogs, so now that I can keep up with their energy, that's good enough for me. \ud83d\ude02 (Seriously, I feel like an absolute buffoon for taking care of these two while I was drinking. I'm surprised they didn't destroy everything due to lack of exercise and stimulation... but they love me to death, even the worst of me. We dont deserve dogs. \ud83e\udd7a Not gonna lie, they were also part of the motivator for my sobriety, as silly as it sounds.)",

                    "body": "The first time I went fully sober, I started feeling better after a week, but it was around the 2-3 week mark that I noticed I felt pretty much back to (mostly) normal again. It takes time, especially depending on the longevity and severity of the drinking before quitting. As I mentioned above, I've fallen off the wagon a couple of times, but those stints usually aren't long, so my body recovers a little quicker than that now.\n\nYou're getting there! It's worth it, I promise.\n\nFor the anxiety part, I know taking calming supplements helps me quite a bit in that department. I've taken all sorts of things that have helped me in different ways. Ashwaganda and St. John's Wort (this one not recommended for anyone pregnant or wanting to be) help regulate cortisol levels, which is the stress hormone. That will also help with your sweating, since the sweats can be a stress response. The brand OLLY makes a \"Calm\" gummy and supplement that has chamomile, L-Theanine, and GABA in it. I take that in the mornings with my multi. It makes a world of difference in my day, and then I do the Ash at night. No matter where I'm at in the recovery phase, it helps keep a cap on any drinking-related anxiety, and general insomnia. Not fool-proof 100% successful, but an improvement enough to be functional and not grumpy or overstimulated.\n\nI find the GABA part in Olly's Calm interesting, because that is a major protein that we lack when we're boozing, related to not only anxiety but *emotional impulse control*, something an alcoholic can obviously struggle with. My doctor prescribed me gabapentin as an antidepressant when I first got sober (now I take a different one), and she told me the 'GABA' in it helps with curbing urges and cravings and can help stabilize mood. Something about how the chemical makeup of alcohol vs that protein and how they fit into our neurotransmitters, one overtakes the other, both can't \"fit\" in the same lil slot in our brain cells. I wish I could remember the exact breakdown of the science so I could articulate it better, but that's the jist in dummy terms. I urge you to look in to it. It's interesting. Gabapentin helped me with triggers (until I had to switch to a different med in general), but the Olly Calm definitely picks up some of those same benefits, I imagine for the reasons of similar chemicals in it.\n\nWhen it comes to the anxiety and stress, there are all kinds of solutions out there. Do some research and find what works best for you. I just wanted to give you a few basics as a starting point.\n\nSugar cravings and blood sugar issues will be a normal struggle unfortunately. I found that I deal with that in the first week or so, no matter how well I'm keeping up with vitamins and supplements. That is where I cheat, and have a stash of pop (\"soda\", depending on where you reside in the U.S. \ud83d\ude02) or candy that I allow myself to dip into when I crave sugar, but I cut back the intake little by little as each day passes. Alcohol is full of empty sugars and carbs, which is why everyone seems to have similar reactions and experiences with this issue when they quit.\n\nAlso, if you have any issues with the gut/nausea/etc., because I usually do every time I quit, ginger root in the day and Magnesium glycinate at night helped me IMMENSELY in regulating my GI health. No more nausea, no more weird and random bathroom trips, my appetite came back quicker so I could begin to eat normally.\n\nI hope some of this was helpful! You've got this, darlin!",

I\u2019ve been trying to quit for over a year now and have had more day ones than I can count, but in the last few months each sober stint has been longer and longer. I\u2019ll definitely have to try the Ashwaganda and GABA supplements, Ive also heard good things about magnesium glycinate for stress and sleep. Sometimes it\u2019s just so hard to reason with the little monster when I\u2019m not seeing dramatic results (even though I am feeling relatively better than while I was drinking) it\u2019s like my brain says might as well drink since we aren\u2019t seeing results which is silly since we are; they just aren\u2019t dramatic! My doctor prescribed me naltrexone months ago but I haven\u2019t touched it, maybe I\u2019ll ask them about the gabapentin.. Thanks so much for all the advice!!",
