    "selftext": "I\u2019m 26, started drinking heavily when I was 21. It went from a couple drinks every other night to a lot more drinks every single night relatively quickly, especially after I broke up with my fianc\u00e9 at the time who kept my drinking somewhat in check. After that, it got bad. Only relatively recently has it started to affect my health. Last time I tried to get sober, I was throwing up blood and tissue. This time, I\u2019m not throwing up anything weird, but I was getting intense stomach pain, and most of my diet had been alcohol for a few months.\n\nI haven\u2019t visited a doctor since 2020. I stopped drinking a little over a month ago, scheduled an appointment with a general practitioner, and went to the appointment a couple days ago. I was honest with her about my alcoholism. She ordered a ton of blood tests to check my organ function, metabolic function, lipids, blood, vitamin levels, basically everything she could think of.\n\nAlmost everything was fine. My liver and kidney function are A-OK. My metabolic panel was normal. Lipids were normal. I don\u2019t have any vitamin deficiencies. However, my red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were way, way above normal.\n\nMy dad has polycythemia vera, a rare blood cancer. In his case, it eventually progressed to acute myeloid leukemia; it is terminal for him. PV is not usually heritable; however, in very rare cases, it can be. My dad\u2019s brother was recently diagnosed with PV as well. The hallmarks of PV are abnormally high RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. All of those measures are abnormally high for me, especially my hematocrit, which was literally off the charts.\n\nThere is a very straightforward genetic test to either rule out or confirm polycythemia vera for me. It\u2019s a genetic mutation on the JAK2 gene. I will be taking that test tomorrow. \n\nI thought I would have results that pointed to decreased liver or kidney function, but no, I might have cancer that\u2019s completely fucking unrelated to my alcoholism. If it\u2019s caught early, I\u2019ll probably be fine, to be clear\u2014my dad\u2019s PV was diagnosed over 20 years ago after he\u2019d already had severe and almost deadly internal bleeding from it, and nowadays there are really effective meds for PV that allow people with it to live more or less normal lives. Hell, my dad hasn\u2019t even had to do real chemo. He was put on a medication called Jakafi, and it helped immensely. Despite having full-blown terminal leukemia diagnosed in 2021, he\u2019s still way more active than almost everyone else his age without ever having undergone full-blown chemo.\n\nSo I know I\u2019ll probably be fine if I have PV, but it feels like a slap in the face that I stopped drinking, started caring for myself, and now I might have cancer at 26. Even if I do have PV, I\u2019ll be ok. It is technically cancer, but for most people it\u2019s more of a chronic illness than anything. My dad was just unlucky\u2014his was especially severe and then his former doctor dropped the ball, and now he knows how he will die. His brother will likely be fine. If I have PV, I will likely be fine. \n\nIt\u2019s just weird to wake up from a years-long haze and then suddenly, hey, we need to test you for blood cancer. I don\u2019t like being this awake and aware, but at the same time I know I have to be. This shit sucks.",
