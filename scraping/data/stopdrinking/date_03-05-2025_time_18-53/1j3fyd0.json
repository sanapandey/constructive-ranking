I need some more advice on how to deal with a craving hits.  \n\nSometimes I have what I think of as a pre-craving.  It\u2019s usually later in the week on a Thursday or Friday where I mentally give myself the go ahead earlier in the day to stop at the store on the way home from work.  By the time I get to that point I find myself in the store.  I am also on naltrexone and my alcohol brain talks me out of taking the dose in the afternoon sometimes\u2026\n\nI\u2019m identifying my triggers but haven\u2019t found any very good way to stop the really hard cravings.  \n\nThose usually come on the weekend where I\u2019m bored and have already done some physical stuff and yard work and it\u2019s the evening.\n\nCandy sometimes works - what\u2019s your favorite?  Maybe other sugar, can of coke? ",

I will say cruel things to people who love me.  I will break the trust that my wife has for me.  I will black out.  I will pass out.  I will be hungover in the morning.  I will miss time with my family.  I will be a worse husband, father and worker.  I will gain weight.  I will have a red face.  I will damage my liver, my pancreas, my brain.  And I will do it all again the next day, because once the floodgates are opened, it's immensely difficult to close them.\n\nOr I can be sober.  Being sober is simpler (not always easier, but simpler).\n\nBest wishes, friend.  I will not drink with you today.",

Right now I'm focused on having a variety available so I'm more likely to find something that strikes my fancy.\n\nYesterday an app I use had me clench all the muscles in my body (even the face!), hold for five seconds, release, then repeat three more times.  I don't know what it was, but after I was so aware of the feeling in my body that it distracted me for a bit and not long after it subsided.\n\nI also have no clue if this is actually helpful- but I've been making sure to eat regular, balanced meals with lots of fiber.

It\u2019s called vivitrol or something else (maybe brand name?), but then you dont have to deal with debating on taking it every day. One shot a month and you\u2019re set. No forgetting or choosing to not take it, no bringing it with you places, etc. Just easier.",
