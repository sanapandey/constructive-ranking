One whole week and that\u2019s the first time in a very long time , really guessing I\u2019m ganna have to say about 2 years about ! \nI would go a day or 2 here and there but it was usually because I was recovering from a weeks worth of black outs, those hangovers where u honestly feel like your dying and tell your self never again but then next chance you get right back to the bottle!!! \nBut I did it and did alot of things this week that will hopefully make this change feel more like somthing I can actually handle! I realized the other day how fucked up i actually am and how my drinking has really become super unmanageable within the last 5 years and that\u2019s insane I allowed it to go this long ! \nHopefully this will be no more and I can hold on to what I really want !

I think the initial change is the hardest part, but in AA circles there is a concept called the \u201cpink cloud,\u201d: it\u2019s the initial euphoria of having quit and realizing those first health benefits. \n\nI bring this up because, for me and many people I\u2019ve chatted with who have SUD, sticking to sobriety gets trickier when life gets hard and you can\u2019t use your easiest and fastest coping mechanism anymore. That\u2019s why I think meetings are an essential part of AA, but those aren\u2019t the only meetings or the only way to talk about sobriety. I don\u2019t like AA personally, but I see a therapist weekly and am active on this sub. \n\nNot trying to poop on your parade or minimize the accomplishment of stringing together 7 days. Just giving you fair warning.  There\u2019s always potential to relapse, and it\u2019s something people like us have to be vigilant about. But it does get easier with time, and you\u2019ve already done the hardest part. Welcome to the sober club!",
