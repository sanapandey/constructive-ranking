    "selftext": "Two months ago I decided to stop drinking. I used it in my highschool and early college years to fit in with my peers. I got in trouble for it a couple of times and was arrested as well. I had a therapist a few years back try and force me to go to AA and then shame me when I didn\u2019t do it everyday. I was 21 and I just needed someone to talk to honestly. But two months ago, I decided that I hated the feeling of drinking. It just made me feel like shit and I would get depressed the next day. I didn\u2019t need anyone to tell me to stop I just did it and honestly this is the most proud of myself I\u2019ve ever been. Just thinking of the fact I did it on my own makes me happy! ",

I'm 2.5 months in and it gets easier everyday. I guess it's just the change in routine. Cold turkey was the way to go for me. Moderation doesn't work for me. I'm starting to like me again. Way to go! \nIWNDWYT",
