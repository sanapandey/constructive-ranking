    "selftext": "First time I have made it this long since I started drinking over a decade ago. \n\nOne thing I have learned is that time slowly heals and fixes everything. With each passing day I become a little bit mentally stronger, and the occasional super hard day marked by emotional challenges or high pressure situations turns out to be a blessing in disguise because it trains my mind to become that much more resilient without resorting to alcohol as a crutch for escapism. \n\nTo everyone struggling, I just wanna say the following: It doesn\u2019t get easier, but it does get better.

I'm trying to more purposefully attend to the stressors and situational factors that create a counter-productive mindset for me now. It's not about focusing on triggers but giving them recognition to take away their power. Consciously acknowledging them for what they are, which, up to this point, has helped me gain a better understanding of either my immediate negative reactions or better preparation for certain environments. \nKeep up the strong work!",
