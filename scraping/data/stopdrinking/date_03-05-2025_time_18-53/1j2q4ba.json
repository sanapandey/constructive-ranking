    "selftext": "It\u2019s been almost a week again. I\u2019m committed this time. I didn\u2019t drink at the last family gathering (bowling). I\u2019m sleeping better. Eating better. I have more energy, more focus. I\u2019m more calm and less anxious/depressed. I\u2019m reading books again. I\u2019m performing well at work again. I have this underlying hope/positivity.\n\nBut It\u2019s my weekend (I have Mondays and Tuesdays off). All I\u2019d have to do is hop in my car and swing around the corner, pick up two 6-packs of Busch for $10 and call it a day. But what would that result in? Well\u2026\n\nSitting on my couch, staring ahead not able to focus, listening to music and crying, drunk texting,  possibly drunk driving to get more beer, dehydrating myself via mega pissing, starving myself until I\u2019m satisfied with how much I\u2019ve imbibed, eating a giant unhealthy meal, not brushing my teeth, collapsing in bed with clothes on, waking up drenched in sweat, massive headache, no rest at all, next day completely ruined, next 3-4 days tired with brain fog, anxiety, anger, and emotional issues.\n\nPlay that tape forward guys.
