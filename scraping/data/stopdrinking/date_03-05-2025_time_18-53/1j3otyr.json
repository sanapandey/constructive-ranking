I mean, I know I SHOULD for health reasons, but part of me simply doesn't want to do it.\n\nI drink a bottle of wine a night. I don't have hangovers. It doesn't interfere with work or relationships. The most immediate problem is that it keeps me from losing weight. Even knowing that, I don't want to stop.\n\nHow can I find meaningful, lasting motivation?\n\nTIA for your empathy. ",

            "body": "This was me exactly. For many years. Until January 1 of this year, probably for about 12-13 years straight. I would drink a bottle, sometimes more like a bottle and a half. I'd go through a box of wine in less than 4 days.  I loved the buzz, the relaxation, etc. I never had hangovers, I was never late for work, never missed any family or work or friend obligations. In fact, when I quit, nobody was really impressed (except for one friend) because in all their minds I didn't have a problem at all. I only drank at home. If I was out somewhere, it was maybe one drink.\n\nSo I've been sober just over 2 months now. No, I haven't lost weight (maybe about 3 pounds in 2 months, but unfortunately I started giving myself other treats to make up for the wine, am just now trying to get all that under control). So life is so much better sober. My mind is more clear, I focus better, my creativity is really high, my sleep is fantastic, I haven't measured my blood pressure yet since I quit, but my average resting heart rate is a lot lower, my digestion is better (no more urgent poops and constant stomach issues), my skin is clearer. And I know when I'm ready to kick it into gear and lose the weight, it won't be burdened with my need to drink wine.\n\nI never thought I'd be able to go this long without wine. Never. But now I barely even think about wine. I have occasional cravings. I've replaced wine with sparkling hops water mixed with no added sugar cranberry juice, and I think the most important thing is that I'm into a very important creative project right now, which distracts me from the urge to zone out.\n\nAnd now because it feels so much better to be sober, I don't want to ruin it by going back into it. Anyway, that's my take on it!",

Where the amount of pain to stay the same outweighed the discomfort of making the change.\u00a0\n\nSometimes that sufficient amount of pain is necessary, but is not a prerequisite. I had a million chances to get ahead of the ball and would always put it off. It is important to truly want it. And I don\u2019t think there is a sufficient way to manufacture the essence of that desire. A good start is just not drinking today. Leave tomorrow\u2019s business for tomorrow. You might find strong motivation in experiences outside of the bottle.\u00a0",
