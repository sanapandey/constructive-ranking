That's probably a huge improvement from before!\n\nIf you did a graphic visual:\n\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS\nSSSSSDDD\n\nSee all those sober days!?",

Not weeks, not months, not years. It may not seem like it, but that\u2019s a win. As is being here posting.\n\nAs others have said, \u201choping\u201d is not enough for us to rely on. We need to reflect on how we got back here (I distinguish here between reflecting and self-recriminating, big time), and work to establish strategies and resources on which to rely when another situation arises.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up, and please be on your own side. It is critical to give ourselves the love and grace and understanding that we would have for other alcoholics struggling.\n\nEasier said than done, but practicing acceptance and self-love, and reflecting/planning rather than shaming/guilting will always put us in a much better position.\n\nIWNDWYT\n\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83e\udec2",
