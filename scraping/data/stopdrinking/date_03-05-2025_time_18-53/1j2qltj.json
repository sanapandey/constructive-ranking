    "selftext": "i know that alcohol is a negative for sleep quality but i can't fall asleep without drinking. it's one of the main reasons i drank, as a sleep aid. it helped me relax and fall asleep. without it, i struggle. alcohol is bad for sleep quality but not being able to sleep in the first place is worse. i don't know what to replace it with and it's tough not to have anything, it's like waking up in the morning without being able to have a cup of coffee or tea.\n\ndid anyone else experience this and what was your remedy?",

My anxiety at nighttime was so bad I didn\u2019t know how I could knock myself out without a bottle.\n\nThe following is just my experience so please don\u2019t take it as a guarantee!\n\nFirst I started taking magnesium tablets along with a cup or two of chamomile or similar sleepy time tea. I think just having a cup of something in my hands kind of helped substitute a drink.\n\nThen, I also started to notice that actually what had made me so anxious that I could barely sleep was the alcohol\u2026 one of the classic alcohol paradoxes. I was so anxious from drinking that I needed to drink to sleep. Realising that somehow helped calm me down.\n\nFinally, I know it sounds trite but I got really into exercise. Physically using your body up to a point where it feels tired really helped me sleep, and actually look forward to sleeping.",

So, from my lived experience, this advice is really valuable.\n\nApart from magnesium, tea and exercise, I also implemented a rule where my bed is only for sleeping*. I don't read in bed, I don't game in bed, I don't even bring my phone to bed (and instead use the alarm on my watch). This means that my bed is - psychologically and habitually - where I sleep. I doubt there's science behind this, but it works for me. Good luck.",

There was a couch I refused to get rid of for when I was ready to move out again. I put it in the \u201coffice\u201d we never used it and collected dust.\n\nA couple months after I got sober I had the whole \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing everything in my bed\u201d thought process and immediately remembered that damn couch and started dragging it up the stairs by myself lol.\n\nMy room feels a lot smaller but now I have a couch for when I just need my alone time without laying in bed. I\u2019m not playing bass while sitting on the end of my bed. I don\u2019t crochet or play video games in bed. It\u2019s a nice in between zone for when I know I\u2019m done talking to people for the day, but need to unwind without the pressure of my brain telling me it\u2019s \u201cbedtime\u201d. \n\nYou probably don\u2019t have a spare couch just laying around, but maybe you can find a similar yet simple solution? Your space is your space, get creative with it. My room feels like a damn castle compared to the plain walled dreary set up I had before quitting. \n\nGood luck to you! Living with parents is both rewarding and difficult like many things.",

I also can\u2019t  fall asleep at night without an aid - though I\u2019m working on it. \n\nMy two biggest issues is my sleeping arrangement isn\u2019t solid because my wife is a nurse and many days has to stay up late or wake up at 4 am, so I sleep in the guest room - and it immediately makes me feel like my bachelor days and I end up binging tv or playing video games and usually that comes with the beer. \n\nThe other biggest issue is that I work in sales and 90% of meetings and feels happen at happy hour - where people will call you out. I\u2019ve gotten friends with a few service staff that will let me order a \u201cvodka tonic\u201d and serve me lime and tonic without booze, to avoid issues.\n\nMany people recommend vape or cbd or what have you, but I\u2019m not sure replacing booze for THC is the long term answer.\n\nI have significantly decreased my consumption, but a long way from zero.\n\nI just got a rowing machine and an exercise bike and it seems to help. \n\nAnyway, thanks for posting comments to help motivate people- I\u2019m not really sure why I posted such a long message.

That term makes for a good web search: \"sleep hygiene\" should yield some reliable medical websites on the topic.  Harvard Medical has one that looks pretty good (irrespective of one annoying popup.)\n\nSome of the biggest factors for me: no caffeine, after noon, or better yet after 10 AM; no late night snacks; moderate exercise every day; keeping a quiet, mellow bedroom; a couple/few hours of mellow time before bedtime - I worked it out with my wife that we wouldn't start discussing things like bills or taxes or whatever shortly before bedtime, because when we did, it'd have my mind buzzin' about it when I was trying to get to sleep (we'd kind of been in a _habit_ of bringing up all sorts of things just minutes short of hitting the pillow: \"_Oh!  Tomorrow let's be sure to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_._\" and then I'd be thinking about \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ instead of falling asleep.\n\nAnother thing that's been helpful to me that isn't mentioned: I try not to _worry_ if I'm not falling asleep, or if I'm having one (or maybe even two) restless nights - it's not going to kill me!  I remember in the before-times hitting the pillow and obsessing over whether or not I was going to sleep well, and that worry itself would keep me awake!\n\nNone of it was a quick and easy way to instant good sleep (I don't even count the pills for that, for they had their own price.)  But it was all incrementally providing better and better sleep.\n\n**IWNDWYT!**",

(spoiler alert, i did end up getting sleep back in my life and it's much better quality than when it always involved some degree of passing out.)\n\nOne thing I realized was the I was leaning heavily into my second favorite drug, coffee, to help me get through my first year. If you're similar there, perhaps something to think about. I mean pounding coffee all day is definitely better than pounding shots of Jack, if it comes down to either/or. But if we do lean into coffee, then we should be prepared for the consequence of insomnia.\n\nFor the first few months of my sobriety, I subscribed to the 'Calm' app. It has great meditations that helped me through the cravings, but also they have a 'bedtime stories' section that tells you calming stories that will help you fall asleep. I highly recommend checking into that app. A year subscription costs less than the money you saved from not going to the bar one night.\n\nI also learned a sort of how to sleep philosophy that I use successfully to sleep all the time: Instead of trying to sleep, ***try to relax***. Like your heart rate, sleep is an involuntary function of your body, it's not something you control through effort. Relaxing you mind and body however, is something you can do. This will help your heart rate and help your body fall asleep. Conversely, 'trying' to do something that isn't a matter of willpower, like sleeping, will cause stress and anxiety and will make your body go into alert mode which will have the opposite effect on it from falling asleep.",
