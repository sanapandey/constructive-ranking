I'd like to add, if you are still finding you are bored, then I would politely say that you need additional hobbies. That can be challenging but also fun.\n\nFor myself, if ever I am bored, I make sure to find find stuff to do. I lived alone for years and years and after I became sober, I got the creative juices flowing.\n\nSo take a look here:\n\nI have a list of activities I love to do. **The idea is to plan these ahead of time an activity to do so when the day/time comes, you'll know exactly which of these activities you'll be doing:**\n\ngoing out in nature for walks\n\nbike rides (very good for that natural high and it lasts all day!)\n\nfinding non-alcoholic replacements (that can be a fun project)\n\nfind new hobbies (I know you've heard that before, but it's so true)\n\nhave a new mini-project to do at home liking building something, anything\n\nbuy a Lego set (gets the creative juices flowing)\n\njoin Hoopla and Libby and download a bunch of books from your favorite genres\n\nmake fun recipes (think of restaurants where you had your favorite dishes and search 'copy cat recipe Tara Thai Pad Thai' for example) then go to store and buy all the ingredients and spices and sauces and make a day of it\n\ncook on Sunday for the whole week and have fun freezing/labeling foods for each day of the week\n\nvideo games\n\nmake playlists of favorites type of videos on YouTube and watch them at night (but go to bed on time still)\n\nHope this helps!",

There are a lot of other sober people who are bored. Making these friends has really made my life infinitely better. I am an introvert and I\u2019m the beginning I drank a lot for social anxiety. The great part about AA meetings is that it\u2019s a place to go to meet your friends that you don\u2019t really have to plan ahead for. It doesn\u2019t matter if people bail at the last minute, some people will show up. Sometimes I want to be more social and I\u2019ll go for coffee after, sometimes just leaving my house and facing the world for one hour is enough and I\u2019m ready to head home. I know a lot of people knock AA for a variety of reasons. I\u2019m also an atheist and I fought AA for years, but opening myself up to it has been the single most useful thing in my recovery and for me, scratches that itch that you\u2019re describing.",
