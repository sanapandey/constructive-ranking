    "selftext": "Having one of those days where I need to see my progress staring back at me. To see that nearly 11 months ago I was drinking between 500 - 750 ml of liquor, plus 4 - 6 beers every day and didn't think I could stop. Not missing the hangovers, the guilt, the feeling that it was going to kill me, the lost time, lost opportunities, lost life. Not going to drink today.",

With how much I drank it seems crazy that I can say I didn\u2019t have a single alcoholic drink in 2024. \n\nHow\u2019s your life doing since? I use a \u201cquit\u201d app that shows money saved and beers not drank\u2026 close to 2,000 beers I haven\u2019t had\u2026 I worked out the dimensions of a cuboid they would take and it\u2019s ridiculous\u2026 \u00a32,500+ not spent on beer too\u2026 although I\u2019ve had to buy a whole new wardrobe twice because of the weight loss. \n\nI look back at photos and I\u2019m a different person; obese, red, always sweating, always irritable, stomach issues\u2026 and more. \n\nIf I had truly realised how much better life could be with booze then I\u2019d have given up years ago. \n\nGood luck at keeping going. Once more month!\n\nWere you expecting to succeed or just hoping?\n\n** edit: 478 days, not 450\u2026 you do eventually stop keeping track when it becomes easier **",
