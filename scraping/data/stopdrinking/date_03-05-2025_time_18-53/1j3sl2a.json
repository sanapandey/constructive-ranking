    "selftext": "Hi, all. I have tried and failed to stop drinking several times over the past eight years. One of the biggest things I\u2019ve noticed lately is that I am extremely paranoid. I have convinced myself that various different people in my life (work and personal) are mad at me, hate me, or are on to my toxic drinking habits. And I\u2019m just anxious overall. Can anyone speak to a similar experience? And how it changes once you get sober?",

Self-pity, self-hatred, self-absorption, on and on.\n\nMakes total sense.\n\nTherapy helps. Being of service to others helps. Getting out of our heads and into the world be it for a walk, exercise, recreational hobbies, volunteering (strong recommend), really anything is a good fix.\n\nEsteem-building activities build self-esteem. Once we get a hang of it, hopefully we want to chase that feeling, instead of the self-sustaining shitty ones.\n\nIWNDWYT\n\n\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

I felt much like the way you\u2019ve described - although in addition to thinking everyone I knew hated me, I\u2019d also begun to assume complete strangers hated me too. I eventually came to believe that I was inherently hated by all and the thought of leaving my house became panic-inducing. \n\nIt all went away when I stopped drinking for more than 1 or 2 days at a time. I still get nervous from time to time like most people, but the panic disorder and agoraphobia I had been diagnosed with at the end stages of my drinking career were almost 100% attributable to alcohol and no longer govern my life when I\u2019m sober.",
