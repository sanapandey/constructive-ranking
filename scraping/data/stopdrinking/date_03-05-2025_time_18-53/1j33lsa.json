    "selftext": "Idk what it is but when I drank I used to feel so much more alive. I have no friends and at times I get the itch to drink when I\u2019m alone to have some fun. I usually hop on some video games and drunk me finds a random group of drunkies. Which then we have a great time. Now that I don\u2019t drink I find it so hard to cope with the loneliness. I try reaching out to people and talking to others but it doesn\u2019t lead anywhere. \n\nWooo day 11 of being sober \ud83d\ude23\u2764\ufe0f\nI\u2019ll get through the night and try to enjoy myself.",

I was lucky enough to find this sub as well as a great chat group for people my age on here.  It helps so much and don\u2019t be a stranger here!  Meditation is also a quick and easy reset.  I never tried it until sobriety but just a simple youtube in a comfortable place where you can sit and follow their instructions.  I even did it as many as 5 times a day in my first few weeks.  Stretching before or after is great too!  Best wishes and I look forward to your 1 month post!",
