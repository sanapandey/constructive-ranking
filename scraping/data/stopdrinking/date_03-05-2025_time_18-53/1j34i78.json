I was a puker, like face in the toilet, puking up bile, can\u2019t hold anything down\u2026..all day.\n\nBut when I got into my 30s, just straight up anxiety, heart pounding, and pounding headache. But no more barfing\u2026\u2026\n\nI\u2019m now 35.",

I'd somehow stay up really late and be able to manage the next day, up until I was like 21 ish.\n\nThe past few years has turned into either: \n1. I magically don't get hungover (heavily dosing myself with gravol during and after drinking, drinking so much water I pee every 20 minutes, etc.)\n2. Continue drinking the next morning to avoid it\n3. Throwing up all day\n4. I literally am so hungover and exhausted I need to sleep until 2, 3, even 4 pm, then lay on the couch and go back to bed by 9. \n\nCrazy how much shit I've put my body through.",

But in the last year or so (~33) I started having wicked hangovers. Just puffy, bleary, scratchy throat, headaches, feeling awful. It was weirdly unpredictable too, like one night I'd drink 3+ bottles and be fine, the next I'd drink 2 and be a wreck.",
