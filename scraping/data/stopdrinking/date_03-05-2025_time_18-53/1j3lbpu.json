Came home and went straight to bed. \n\nWhen do the mistakes, failures, dangers, embarrassments, risks, and sheer negligence and stupidity become enough to stop drinking?!? I utterly hate myself right now!",

I don't know how your relationship is with your family, or your daughter  but she's still in your life, so be better!  And hating yourself makes it easier for others to do the same.  Just start with doing the next right thing.  Don't pick up.  Use the next week of feeling lousy as a reminder that you are still alive and you can either move forward, or backward.  Learn to forgive yourself, the world has enough in it to kick your teeth in, you don't need to help with the beat down.  I'd do anything to be with my wife and daughter right now.  She's not old enough but if she was, I'd be stoked to be picking my little one up from the bus and going home to hang out with her and mom.  My family isn't coming back, and thats something that will eat me up for as long as I live.  Don't take your loved ones for granted, you got this buddy just be better!",

But I think the biggest wake up call for me, besides having a bleeding ulcer early last year, was over this past summer. I had been sober for about 12 weeks because of said ulcer, but had pretty quickly fallen off the wagon after my health was better. But one day I picked up both of my precious daughters from school. Drove them both to their respective sports practices. Then I went to Home Depot to get some light bulbs. When I came back out to my car, I realized that not only had I left it running, but I had left it in gear. Without the parking block preventing it from moving, that would have been a big problem. Let this be your wake up call. It's only going to get worse from here if you don't stop. I feel incredibly lucky that I was able to be self-aware about how bad my problem was before I ended up with a DUI, or ended up killing someone. You can do this. And you'll never regret it.",

I externalize and objectify alcohol as an evil beast.   You CAN slay this beast, but you may very well need help.\n\nOnly you can do it.  But, imho, you have to want it sooo bad.  THAT'S when getting help will work.\n\nYou are good, you are on the side of goodness, and you likely know what's good and what's bad.\n\nSending good vibes you're way.\n\nThere's no such thing as \"joining\" AA, btw.  You just go if you need/want to, that day.  Then, on a different day you decide for yourself again if you want to go.  You NEVER have to say a word, EVER.  You just gotta want to stop drinking, that's it.  There's magic two-way empathy there, even if you NEVER say a word.",
