    "selftext": "Because last year\u2019s ceremony was when I hit my rock bottom. Took my afternoon walk, told myself I was gonna go to the bar around the corner and have a glass of wine before the program began and head back home\u2014because it was my turn to give my daughter a bath and put her to bed that night. Told myself I wouldn\u2019t go crazy, like I usually do, because most of my drinking is when she\u2019s in bed or while I\u2019m away and it totally doesn\u2019t affect her in any way, shape, or form, nor my husband. (Denial is a heavy drug.)\n\nOne glass became several and probably a couple of beers, and by the time I stumbled the few blocks home, it was already 8 o\u2019clock, my daughter was already getting ready for bed, and my husband was furious and scared because he had no idea where I was. I was too drunk to care, and the night ended with my throwing up and passing out in front of my daughter. The next day was my first day into sobriety. It took a lot of professional help to get there, and the shame haunts me still, but god damn it, I got there.\n\nI love movies. Saw mostly of the nominees this year and am happy for everyone nominated. But I can\u2019t watch them this year and join along with my friends (who can drink responsibly). Not because I mind them drinking\u2014most places I am unbothered by alcohol, save for the neighborhood bar, where I can\u2019t bring myself to go back to despite the \u201cfriends\u201d I made there over the years and the fact o ghosted them entirely). But everything about the rigamarole has me really anxious and sweaty and stressed out.\n\nThe good part is that a week from now will be my sober birthday\u2014March 10. And everything that was a mess a year ago\u2014my marriage, my work, my self-esteem, my health\u2014has done almost a complete 180.\n\nSo, in a strange way, I am grateful for the Oscars. But I don\u2019t know if I can ever watch them again.\n\nIs this normal? Is there some media you just can\u2019t watch, read, or listen to because you associate so strongly with drinking or the shame? Just wondering.\n\nAnyway, take care of yourselves. You deserve sobriety so much. IWNDWYT.",

I\u2019ve been getting a kick out of rewatching shows I watched while drinking because now I realize how much I missed by being too hammered to pay attention.\n\nCongrats on a year, OP!

After I quit drinking, I just decided that I couldn\u2019t do the tournament anymore. I know I\u2019d drink because of habits and because I miss my best friend so much.",

I relsied these friends of mine are not friends at all..and thats ok becouse they helped me relise that I dont have a good relationship with the drink and as such wont drink anymore, they also taught me taking responsiblity may not always lead to forgiveness but doimg the right thing anyway is still good even on a personal level. \n\nFor whats its worth, IWNDWYT.!",
