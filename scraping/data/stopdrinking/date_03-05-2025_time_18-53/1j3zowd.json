    "selftext": "I don't know if I'm an alcoholic but I'm definitely a binge drinker. \n\nI've been able to stop for long periods of time before. I have 2 kids and didn't drink for almost a year each time I found out I was pregnant.  Then it starts with 'I'll only drink on Fridays.' Well, Friday turns into Friday and Saturday (might as well just finish the case/bottle) which turns into Friday, Saturday AND Sunday and before I know it, I'm drinking 4-6 days a week. When it gets to that point, I'm able to stop myself. I take a break, \"reset\" for a month or so, and then repeat the cycle starting with 'only on Fridays!' \n\nI tell myself that even though I drink so much,  I'm at least being responsible. I only start drinking after the kids go to bed, I don't drive or drunk dial/text and I've only ever blacked out once (on a night away from the kids). My drink of choice is cheap tequila mixed with Gatorade so the hangovers aren't even really that bad, mostly just dry mouth. I've been noticing more than just physical side effects lately though; I have a short temper with my family after drinking nights, I have a more negative outlook after drinking nights, etc. \n\nMy husband, I believe, is a functioning alcoholic.  He drinks almost every night and constantly (gently) pressures me to join him. He's not mean, or violent or abusive, I don't truly think he does this to be a jerk or to sabotage me or whatever, it's just that drinking together is fun. It's how we connect. Our kids are young and the days are long and exhausting and it's nice to sit at the end of the day, have a few and watch a movie or old music videos together. I try to get him to take breaks or reset with me from time to time but he never makes it more than a few days.\n\nBoth of my parents died from health conditions caused by alcohol abuse so you would think that would be enough for me to give it up all together but it hasn't happened yet. I've been lurking here for a while and I've seen time and time again that moderation doesn't work for most, but it has to work for some people, right??? \n\nThe end of January I stopped for 2 weeks, until we had some family come into town to visit. I drank that weekend and the following weekend and decided to stop again for another 3 weeks until a weekend getaway I have planned with my best friend. After that.... idk what I want my drinking to look like. I know that 'only on Fridays' doesn't work but I'm not sure I want to give it up forever. \n\nTl dr: wondering if it's possible to get drunk a few weekends a year without it escalating. ",

Including many sports events, nights out at bars, and my husband drinking moderately on many, many days. I encourage you to get a streak going greater than 60 days and notice how you feel, sleep, etc. I also had no problem not drinking during pregnancy and breastfeeding but like you, alcohol use crept up gradually for me and I didn\u2019t really notice how much it affected me until I stopped. Benefits  = great sleep, less anxiety, weight loss. The longer my streak goes with no alcohol, the less I am interested in drinking. There were several occasions I decided ahead of time I would permit myself to drink at a social event but found I really didn\u2019t have the desire to when I got there.
