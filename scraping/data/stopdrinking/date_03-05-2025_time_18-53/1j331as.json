    "selftext": "Like I said in the title, I am struggling. It went from \u201cI\u2019ll just have a couple drinks at night\u201d to I\u2019ll have a few while I\u2019m working to ease the stress. Now it\u2019s just full blown and I honestly don\u2019t know how it started from just a couple of drinks to drinking while I\u2019m working (work from home) I am at my wits ends but seriously don\u2019t know if I can stop. I get excited at the thought of quitting and working on my life and then I get stressed with the news, or my job and just drink all day. Please help me. I cannot afford therapy, I also really do not want to disclose this to my doctor as I am on meds that I take for anxiety. What helped you the most? I do workout, I\u2019m at a healthy weight. I\u2019m just afraid this will consume me. It also runs in my family. Any advice is very appreciated. ",

When I go, I respect those people\u2019s beliefs, but I just kinda ignore the God stuff and find comfort being in a room full of people who know what this feels like.\n\nAs far as what has helped me, \u201cOne day at a time.\u201d I quit drinking forever a hundred times.  It never stuck.  That was HUGE! The rest of my entire life! Fuck that. No way.   But one day I decided that I\u2019m not going to worry about being sober forever.  I was just gonna stay sober that day. Maybe tomorrow I\u2019ll drink, but I knew I could make it through one little day. And I did.  Then the next day, I did that again. I just kept deciding that I wasn\u2019t going to drink  for one day, over and over again. To be honest, there were days where I had to focus on not drinking for one hour, or even for the next 15 minutes. But I\u2019d make it through and do it again. \nYou\u2019re right. It is easy to get stressed looking at the world we live in. Add to that, work and the thousand other stressors we have daily. But this is one stressor you will be glad to get rid of. It will take time and there will be really hard days. I didn\u2019t become an alcoholic overnight.  It took years of hard work to guzzle as much poison as I did, so it stands to reason that undoing that mess was gonna take some time and hard work too.  But this community is great. Come here whenever you need encouragement and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it. And for now, you\u2019re doing great. IWNDWYT!",

I\u2019ll tell you, I used to be able to enjoy music, outdoors, cooking, working out, any of my hobbies without alcohol and now it\u2019s like I associate my hobbies with alcohol? Like for instance, when I cook I want to drink or else I won\u2019t enjoy it anymore, or when I listen to a song I love it makes me want a drink, or when the weather is nice I just want to drink to celebrate the weather being nice. Doesn\u2019t make any sense but here I am. You are right, it did not happen overnight. It\u2019s been a constant thing that\u2019s happened and it\u2019s taken over my hobbies and now I associate my happy feelings with alcohol. You\u2019re completely right, I can try to take it day by day. When the urges come up maybe I can distract myself with something better. My biggest issue (I think) the common denominator is that I drink when I do things I like to do. I need to somehow detach alcohol from my hobbies but it\u2019s so damn hard. Thank you, friend. I am going to try harder but it\u2019s so hard.",

Then, once you\u2019ve tackled this for a while, start working in your old hobbies again and \u201crediscover\u201d them. It is hard. No question. But you can do it.",

I\u2019m just curious because I\u2019ve tried like 5 times and I have lasted maybe 1 month without drinking in the past 2 years or so. Did you ever get to a point where you could moderate drinking, or did you have to quit completely? You don\u2019t have to answer I\u2019m just curious.",

For a while. But, of course, one beer on Saturday night only, turned into two, turned into Friday and Saturday, turned into nightly again until I tied one on at 11 am one day and drove home. Thankfully, nothing bad happened. No DUI, no crash. But it showed me that I could not, in fact, moderate.  That was the third of July 2020. \nIn the interest of full disclosure, in January of 2023 I made a very deliberate and specific exception.  I took a vacation to Costa Rica and I decided that I would moderate drinking while there.  I wanted a tropical fruity drink on my tropical vacation. So I did. I drank 3 of the 7 days we were there but I was very careful to not get drunk. My wife and two very close family friends were there with me (they all knew my history) to keep me in check. And it was fine. I never restarted my counter cuz I never considered it a relapse.  On the contrary, I found that I didn\u2019t even really like it anymore. The sugar in the drinks made me a little nauseous and the couple of beers I had didn\u2019t hit the spot like they used to.",
