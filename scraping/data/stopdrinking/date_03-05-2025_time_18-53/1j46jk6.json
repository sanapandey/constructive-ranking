    "selftext": "I just spent all weekend in a very intense bender and spent most of last week under the influence. To make a long story short I was blacked out for 2 days straight. I haven\u2019t had alcohol in 2 days now but I\u2019m not sure how to go about getting help or where to start for that matter. I feel afraid and cannot trust myself. All of my friends and family are big drinkers so I know moving forward gaining any support will be lackluster. \n",

That is brave and wonderful.   \n\nI detoxed in the ICU.  The hospital staff was so supportive and did not shame me, and I would recommend going to the ER closest to you if you need medical assistance.   \n\nYou don\u2019t have to go through this alone.  We are all here for you.  \nHang in there.",

There are a lot of great books/podcasts/vids as well. Sober Leon on youtube has a number of great videos to help. This sub can provide a ton of info/support. Glad you came here. Two days is great, lets get you to three. Hang in there, you can do this. IWNDWYT",

I set my feed to show me the most recent posts, as opposed to most popular, and tried to respond as much as possible.  If a post had no replies, I was there.\n\nIt helped me so much, I would never have made it without r/stopdrinking.",
