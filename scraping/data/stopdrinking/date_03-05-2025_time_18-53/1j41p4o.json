    "selftext": "I guess my main symptom right now is sleep disturbance, today will be my third day with no alcohol. I wouldn\u2019t say I feel hungover this morning bc I have energy but ugh I\u2019ve got a headache. It\u2019s not severe, I took some ibuprofen but I was expecting immediate positive results and I guess it\u2019s going to take some time. I was drinking daily since 2023. \n\nJust posting it here since I know others can relate and it makes me feel better to verbalize it. \n\nThat said, I\u2019m about to actually exercise before work, something I haven\u2019t had the energy to do in a long time! So maybe there are some positives already. ",

Verbalizing it was one of the kickers for me to push through the constant conflict. Stoked you're gonna exercise, go get it. I'll join ya not drinking today my dude :)",
