I\u2019ll keep it shorter than my original post but after 13 years of abusing my body I\u2019m done. I know I need to take it one day at a time but I also really need this to be it.\n\nI\u2019ve haven\u2019t eaten anything for 2 days due feeling so sick and anxious after yet another bender I promised myself wouldn\u2019t happen. I just need somebody to tell me long term sobriety is possible because it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. I\u2019m on Day 2 and my cravings are intense but I honestly want this to stick. Just want to use this wonderful community more frequently from now on to keep me on track.",

Having been exactly where you are right now, I would say find a meeting or sober community to connect with as soon as you can. And be kind to yourself. I know how it feels to be so anxious you can\u2019t eat. If you have a comfort movie or tv show, put it on repeat. Try to have your comfort foods on hand so you can eat something when you\u2019re ready. Drink a ton of water. Know that it will get easier. EASY never guaranteed, but it will not always be like it is right now. You have this, you\u2019re ready.",
