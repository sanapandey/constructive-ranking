    "selftext": "2 weeks, no alcohol. I first started drinking at the age of 12 but idk how old I was when I accidentally took a first sip since my mom was a damn alcoholic for most of my life. She\u2019s sober now and alcoholism has been such an issue within my family. I\u2019m choosing to not let my child see me the way I used to see her. It\u2019s going to be tough especially during family functions and holidays but I definitely have the support now. Wish everyone well on their journeys :) ",
