    "selftext": "Hey Guys I'll keep it short and sweet.\n\nAs said in the title, when I drink on a friday/saturday night I tend to drink a fair amount like the equivalent of 8 or 9 pints of beer. I'll only do it on one of the days of the weekend.\n\nAnyway following that I tend to feel depressed and anxious for the next 3 or 4 days. The first day of the hangover I'm completely out of commission physically and mentally. The second and 3rd days I still have a headache and feel very low/depressed and anxious. The 4th day there is still this slight lingering sad/low and anxiety and then the next day i'm back to normal.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this because it's quite weird to me seeing as i'm young and don't even drink that often.\n\nI feel like this may be a case of it's just not for me kind of thing and I'll have to seriously reduce my drinking or stop completely.",

Unfortunately I didn't try to break out until I eventually fell into daily drinking. It's much better to recognise the issue now and do something about it before it gets worse.\n\nDoing a timed \"challenge\" (eg no alcohol for 1 month, or 100 days or whatever) can help give you a bit of perspective. When I saw how life is *supposed to be* without this awful alcohol loop, it really opened my eyes to what alcohol was doing to me.",

Eventually concerns about the long term health impact has caused me to stop.  There's a guy who posts daily on YouTube, liver disease is the name of his channel, descriptive if not imaginative.   Anyway, check out his first two or three episodes.  That was a huge wake up call for me.",
