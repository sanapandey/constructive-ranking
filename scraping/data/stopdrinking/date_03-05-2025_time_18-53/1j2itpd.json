Finally got my life back on track, repaired relationships worth saving and cut out the people in my life who were tearing me down, got a fantastic job and actually have something to lose. \n\nAnd for some stupid reason I went and drank Saturday. It\u2019s been over 24 hours and I still feel so absolutely stupid and dirty and like it\u2019s something I can\u2019t wash off. \n\nI\u2019m just trying to hold myself accountable and this group has been a huge help during my journey. First time posting but been here lurking for quite a while. Y\u2019all have no idea how grateful I am for this subreddit! \n\nIWNDWYT. ",

You did some field work and you\u2019re back to let us know that it has not gotten any better out there. Thanks for helping this alcoholic stay sober for one more day. IWNDWYT",

They said something to the effect of if you were sober for 99 days and got drunk for one, you have been sober for 99% of the time, and that's pretty damn good still!\n\nTook the fear of that slip up away. Obviously it's not an invitation to drink, but something to take the sting of a precieved \"failure\". You are still doing good. IWNDWYT",
