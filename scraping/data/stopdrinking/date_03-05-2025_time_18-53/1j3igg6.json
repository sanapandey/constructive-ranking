    "selftext": "It\u2019s been less than a week since my last drink, but I\u2019m feeling the temptation a lot today. It\u2019s Mardi Gras/Fat Tuesday, a day I associate with celebration and indulgence before the 40 days of penitence in Lent. I don\u2019t really practice Catholicism anymore, but I feel a connection to the culture because of how I was raised. I think on a deeper level, though, it\u2019s because any holiday like this was a good enough reason to \u201ccut loose\u201d and drink more than I should without fear of being judged for it. \n\nAnyway, I almost gave in just now. \u201cJust one more binge and start fresh for Lent tomorrow. You barely started, right? Five days is nothing.\u201d But no. That\u2019s the kind of thinking that let me lie to myself about my drinking problem for the last three years. I will use Lent to soft launch my sobriety with my family, but it started last Thursday. I may go get a king cake, but IWNDWYT. ",
