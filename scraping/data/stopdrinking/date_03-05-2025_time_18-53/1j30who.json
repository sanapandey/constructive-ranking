    "selftext": "I wish I was one of the people whose life drastically improves without alcohol. But my life sucks. It got shitty and then I became a drunk. But my life isn't going to get any better unless I stop drinking. It just sucks to have nothing to cling to except the slim possibility of having a nice life in the future. Also, I wish I could nap or bed rot. If i could nap, I could just go to sleep instead of needing alcohol to have some chill. Nothing else gives me any peace, not exercise, not medications, not meditation, not breath work, not journaling, i can't sit and watch tv. I get so tired of how loud my brain is all the time when I'm sober.",
