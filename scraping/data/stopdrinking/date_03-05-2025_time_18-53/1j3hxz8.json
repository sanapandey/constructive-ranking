Can you comment here so I can come back around 5pm so I won\u2019t drink tonight? \n\nI was doing so good until the holidays. And then, with all the gatherings, I started drinking again. 1-3 glasses of wine daily again. I know I slipped back into my pattern and I really want out. I\u2019m down to 1/2 to 1 glass of wine only, but I don\u2019t even want that. \n\nI even bought non-alcoholic wine at the beginning of January to see if I can switch to that as a transition, but never opened it. I keep making excuses to go to the store to buy real wine. \n\nMaybe tonight, with your help, I won\u2019t go to the store? Maybe I will open and try the non-alcoholic wine? Or sleep tea like I used to? \n\nThank you in advance for your support and help. I\u2019ll be back later today and IWDWYT!!!!\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udcaa",

I would go to a yoga class, walk my dog or go for a run. It helped me get past that window when I would usually start. Is there anything you can plan tonight?\n\nIWNDWYT.",
