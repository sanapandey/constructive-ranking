I\u2019ve noticed that things are just becoming better. \n\nOne example is that I enjoy cooking new dishes and preparing meals for my husband and our 1 year old. \n\nWhen I was drinking, almost every day, the meals would be decent but I\u2019ve noticed my cooking & baking are WAY better when I\u2019m sober. I\u2019m not drunkenly measuring, drunkenly adding things I think would make the dish better. Lol\n\nBest of all, I\u2019m THERE. I\u2019m 100% present for my son! He has a mama who\u2019s there for him in every single way. He\u2019s incredibly intelligent and I feel like he had this feeling that I was acting \u201coff\u201d when I\u2019d be drinking heavily. \n\nIt feels so good showing him I can do this. \nI can be sober. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of myself. Life has so much more meaning, this way.\nIWNDWYT\u2728\u2728\u2728\n",

I lost my dog of 13 years a couple days ago and it fucking HURTS, but I know it would be a lot worse if I were drinking because I'd just be doing an awful downward spiral. I'm glad I was able to be present for his last months and that I can feel the pain while appreciating his memory and not just be chasing booze to numb myself.",

I have a 2 year old grandson and twins coming in May, I want to be an engaged and playful Grampy, not tired, grumpy and going to the Dr's office all the time. I was a chef many moons and careers ago, but I am starting to re-think how I eat and cook again, not Pizza and fast food junk because I'm buzzed. It is so good to feel this way!\n\n You being \"there\" for your son is hugely important, I know all too well. I was not nurtured at a young age by my mother, who was a heavy drinker. I learned early on witnessing it that I needed to get away. So I always played at a friends house, I ate dinner there if I could. I didn't think I had a bad childhood, I didn't know any better. Once I was 16 and found booze. . . YAAAYYY!  I figuratively ran from everything my whole life, and partying made me sooo happy. Fast forward to raising a family and good jobs and good marriage. . .the booze was there the whole time. Therapy for the first time last month opened up the details of why I drank so much because of the way my brain was modeled. I quit 16 days ago because I was tired of faking it and running all the time. Sorry for the long reply, but to any parent that is struggling, just think about what you will miss by drinking,. . . . LIFE, and your kids brain development.",

I am so happy to hear you have the courage to start talk therapy. That changed my life, too. It isn\u2019t easy unraveling what happened, who wronged us, why we do the things we do and so on.\n\nI was sexually abused by my mom\u2019s father in the early 90\u2019s, when I was a toddler up until about 11 or 12 years old. He finally became bed ridden & I had the choice to walk away. That abuse, my mother\u2019s denial that the abuse occurred just spiraled me into a deep dark path. \n\nI accepted any and everything from anyone with no boundaries set for myself. That led to enduring physical abuse from both ex-boyfriends, self medicating with alcohol & cocaine, I was a mess! \n\nI\u2019m 36 years old, I\u2019ve been in talk therapy for 3 years. I am a whole new person. I\u2019m so proud to have made it out alive after  a very scary abusive(short lived) relationship where I was being physically abused by a drug addict whom I tried to help! I inherited my mother\u2019s codependency along with many other issues that I\u2019ve been working through. Love ya, mom! hahaha\n\nI was so tired of being abused for 30 years. I wanted it all to end, already. I wanted to be healthy.\n\nI\u2019m so at ease, now. I have a small, loving inner circle of people that are there for me. My older sister has been with me, encouraging me to quit drinking. I\u2019m so in love with my life. I used to want to die but I feel so different, now. I love this existence. \n\nTherapy is so helpful. I\u2019ve realized I still have healing to do. I\u2019m ready for all of it, SOBER.\n\nThank you for sharing. I genuinely enjoyed reading every word you wrote.",
