    "selftext": "I\u2019m on day 5 and going to be day 6 later this afternoon of no alcohol. But as I sit here, I realize I don\u2019t really have any specific reason why I stopped in the first place. I mean, yes, alcohol is a depressant and could exacerbate my already existing depression and loneliness and all that. But it\u2019s not like anything about my life will slowly change like it has for so many people who quit. \n\nI\u2019m California sober as it were: not consuming alcohol but also taking drugs like CBD or THC. And the reason is because being stone cold sober would be too fucking hard. My brain literally cannot produce dopamine if I were 100% sober. It just cannot. The only time I ever get close is when I vape or ingest CBD. And the only time I actually achieve any semblance of happiness and uplifting is when I take THC. But outside of those, I literally just exist being unhappy, unsatisfied, etc. And no amount of talk therapy can fix that. Believe me, I\u2019ve tried. \n\nAgain, I don\u2019t really have any good reason for quitting alcohol. Not like I\u2019ll suddenly gain friends and my life will be transformed, even if I give the 12 Steps a shot. I don\u2019t believe in their God or Higher Power and feel emasculated when it says I can\u2019t control my drinking and that I need to surrender myself to some other force. \n\nIdk. I\u2019m just ranting. This whole post is probably pointless. Not like I\u2019ll have jack shit to leave anyone if I off myself anyway. Few thousand bucks, and no one would show up to my funeral besides my immediate family. I\u2019d end this life feeling wasted and unfulfilled just like I imagined it. ",

None of us can want this for you - you have to want it for yourself - but we *can* all tell you how the path goes a few steps in front of where you are, because we've walked it. So here it is: \n\nYou deeply believe things can't get better because you haven't gotten there yet. You are still in a fog through which you simply can't see reality at this point, but you will only see it if you stop clouding yourself *long enough* to get clear.\n\nThings don't suddenly get better right away after quitting substances, that's true. It takes some time. But I can *promise* you they won't get better at all if you continue to numb out. Alcohol is unequivocally exacerbating your depression.\n\nLike another poster says, your body will never learn to make its own dopamine again as long as you are flooding it with it artificially. I highly recommend reading This Naked Mind - it truly changed my mind about giving up alcohol when I was depressed and thinking like you are now. \n\nYou know very well what life feels like right now, right? So if you keep going, you can expect that and worse. Alcoholism is progressive. What you don't know is what's on the other side though, after creating more distance from alcohol and drugs. Days will pass anyhow: why not keep going without drinking and discover what you haven't felt yet? \"Don't quit before the miracle\". \n\nThe more day by day that you go, more will be revealed and things will feel and get better, I am willing to promise that to you. I felt like you felt, didn't want suggestions and wanted to drink at everyone out of spite... but day by day, one day at a time away from drinking, the fog and lies started to lift until I realized I didn't feel so crappy. And one day you'll feel a spark of joy and energy. And then eventually you can't fathom how you used to feel like this. \n\nThat's available for you and you deserve to find out - I hope you keep going \ud83d\udc95 IWNDWYT",

My suggestion for them was that if outside help is not working, that they try the approach of owning their own faults and taking responsibility of their own actions. No one else can if a person doesn\u2019t want to change themselves and if their whole point is that they don\u2019t want to change their ways then maybe a sub for recovering addicts is not the right place for them.",
