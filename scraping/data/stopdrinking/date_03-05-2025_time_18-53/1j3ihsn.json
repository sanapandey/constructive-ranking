Everything was going so well then I just throw it all away. I literally feel like the biggest scum bag in the world, this feeling of hopelessness is something I haven\u2019t experienced, it\u2019s as if I will never redeem myself after this relapse. I just can\u2019t understand how I would even dare put a drink to my mouth after all the grief I have already caused. How will I win back the people I love ",

You cannot change the past, even if it's just yesterday. Learn from the mistake and move back onto the sober path. You had two weeks so you know you can do at least that. Also, stop promising people something you may not be able to deliver. The only thing you can to is keep trying till it sticks. This next try could be the one. Keep coming back to this sub as it can be a great support. If you want to check out some vids on alcohol addiction etc \"sober Leon\" on youtube is worth checking out. Good luck. IWNDWYT",
