    "selftext": "I female (25) have been attending this AA group for a few months now. On the monday 6pm meeting it's typically packed and I just sit where ever is available. Tonight I sat in the only open seat and realized I was sitting next to the parent of a kid I used to teach (I switched classes and I no longer work in that class but I say hello almost daily to his guardian since I used to be in his kids class). i'm not sure if this subreddit is even open to advice i just am freaking out a little that he will tell my work he saw me here and they will fire me. I know it's AA and you are not supposed to talk about it outside the group but if he feels i'm unfit since seeing that i'm at a meeting like that I'm scared he will tell my admin and they will see me differently. I would NEVER drink at work but I do have a tremor that's pretty noticeable (side effect of medication i'm on). I am scared if he tells them he saw me at an AA meeting admin would think my shaking is due to alcoholism. I may just be completely overthinking this but I would just like honest opinions on how i should approach this situation because i am incredibly anxious right now ",
