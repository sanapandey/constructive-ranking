Or, it's been a crap day, it's not going to hurt. Those are my thoughts every few days. I just wanted advice on moving past that. How do you defeat the thoughts?",

Early to bed, early to rise, work, workout, AA meeting, early to bed.  Rinse repeat.  Day in day out. Didn't see old friends for awhile, made new sober ones in recovery meetings.  Changed the way I eat.  Got fit.  Picked up new hobbies, and sports I hadn't played in years. \n\nSlowly, over time, this routine became habit. \n\nAll these years later, I still have a lot of the same routine, although I only get to two meetings a week now as my life looks a lot different.  I'm now a husband, and a Dad to two young boys, all of whom have never seen me take a drink.  I still get up early, I still go to bed early.  I still eat well, still workout.  And I've got sober friends that I have known, and more importantly they know me, like really know me, for years.  Real relationships, not the phony ones I had drinking. \n\nIt sounds like a lot, and it is.  It's hard.  But the alternative, for me, was eventually death.  No two ways about it.",

All you need to do is follow two rules: 1. Read the entire book cover-to-cover at least once, but go for twice for best results; AND 2. Only ever read the book when you are sober. You can still drink right up until you finish the book, but never read the book after even one drink. If you follow those two rules and you\u2019re serious about quitting then in my experience, the sober life that you so desperately crave is literally one book away.",

Going for a walk, joining a gym, whatever. \n\nI wish you the best as you get started!",
