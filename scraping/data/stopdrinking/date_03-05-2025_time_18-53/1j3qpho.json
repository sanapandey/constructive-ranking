What will help me to not crazily obsess over it? Obsess over how people now see me?\nWhat will help me to accept my mistakes and slowly start becoming the person i truly want to be?\n\nAll love \ud83e\udef6",

A lot of that shame and guilt is from drinking - it\u2019s such an insidious cycle! Sure we can not erase the memories but getting that sober time changes the way we focus on them. Try to give yourself the same grace you\u2019d give anyone else. The people that love and care about you will be happy to see you blossom as you become sober longer and longer. Anyone that chooses to view you thru the lense of the stupid drunken shit you did isn\u2019t worth your time or thoughts! And also what other people think of you is none of your business. I\u2019m routing for you! You got this!",

Obsessing, self-shaming and self-recrimination are definitely NOT.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that as alcoholics/addicts, we are often wired towards negativity, recrimination, and self-pity/self-loathing. This is a toxic cocktail, and def doesn\u2019t prepare us to healthily assess this sort of thing, especially early on.\n\nIt\u2019s commonly recommended to focus on staying in the present early on. We can\u2019t change the past, can only do so much about the future, and should primarily be focused on staying sober and surrounding ourselves with the support and resources we need to do so. Obviously kicking our own ass isn\u2019t a huge plus here.\n\nGoing to recovery meetings can help a lot. It\u2019s one place where we will be understood, accepted and surrounded by people with similar (or much worse) experiences to/than our own. The value of this really can\u2019t be overstated.\n\nIt can help to recognize that those things weren\u2019t done by the \u201creal me.\u201d This isn\u2019t to give ourselves a pass, but to clearly articulate that the sober, present me would never have done that shit. The future sober me not only won\u2019t do those things, but will actively try to amend them.\n\nMost critically perhaps, we have to give ourselves love and grace. Again, most alcoholics aren\u2019t wired to do so (quite the opposite), so this may require effort, therapy, and/or talking to recovery peers/sponsors etc.\n\nBut we absolutely must approach ourselves as we would another suffering alcoholic, with love and acceptance and healing. Hope for the future.\n\nFinally, there is a tremendous relief in just letting go, at least for now. For me, part of it was wrapped up in hopes/expectations that people would forgive me, or worries that they wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s not acceptance, it\u2019s still trying to exert control over a situation way, way outside of our control (see alcoholism 101 \ud83d\ude02). Again, easier said than done, but to consciously close the chapter, step up from the table and walk away (again, perhaps just for now, there will be time later for amends where appropriate) can be incredibly healing. It\u2019s like setting down a burden that we realize is slowly breaking our back, and taking a few fresh steps unencumbered.\n\nProbably long-winded, and perhaps blather, but I hope this helps in some way.\n\nThis is one of the toughest things in early phase, and a prime cause of relapse. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t fucking handle this so whatever, I\u2019m just gonna numb it. I\u2019m fucked anyways.\u201d\n\nThis is an incredibly common response and excuse to go back to the bottle.\n\nFar better to accept, love, and begin to heal ourselves, starting NOW.\n\nIWNDWYT",

Can't do anything about it so there's no use stressing over it. The future is still waiting to occur. You can do something about that, and quitting drinking ensures that you have a better shot of making it a good story.",
