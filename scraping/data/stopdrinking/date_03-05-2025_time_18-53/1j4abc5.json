    "selftext": "Back when I was a teenager, I made a friend in college and we were both sober young men getting along with each other and having a great time.\n\nI turned age 18, the legal drinking age in the UK first, because of this fact, I introduced him to alcohol months before his 18th birthday. He was a lightweight at first, only being able to drink two beers before throwing up! That is an extreme lightweight. I used to joke with him saying he was a lightweight as I could drink 6 beers.\n\n6 months later, our drinking together got more frequent and I noticed he was catching up in tolerance level, he wasnt only just drinking with me but drinking with other friends of his. We started going to the pub together and drinking 6 pints each.\n\nA year later, which was 2021, we had a wicked time on the beers. Every Friday and Saturday we used to get hammered until blackout. On the street we drank together, in the pubs we drank, at his house we drank, in the park, we drank. It was a brilliant year and my young body handled booze so well that I could go to work and the gym after a heavy session, my mental health was amazing despite the alcohol. Whilst drunk I was a friendly, fun, go all out drunk and 90% of the time it was amazing. 10% was the misbehaving but we used to laugh it off. \n\n2022 was similar to 2021 but less intense. Things started to go south, I recognised I had a drinking problem, my friend started having no money to cover his booze so I would have to buy the beers until he could pay me back. I haven\u2019t mentioned yet that there is a 30 minute train ride between us, before it was a fairly even split, but this year it began me coming to his area 80% of the time. I was always paying the train fare and time to join him at his house or his local pub, he never suggested coming to my area and at this point I didn\u2019t realise this was unfair.\n\n2023, I grew more sense and realised I was paying my money and time for the train fare to his, yet he was barely travelling to mine. THIS YEAR IT WAS 95% ME, DOING THE TRAVELLING. When confronting him of this, he said he will sort it but he never did, every re-confronting he would say he would sort it, but again, never did. He was still borrowing money from me, whilst he did pay me back everytime, literally 3-4 days after being paid, he would have to re-borrow the money. I realised our friendship wasn\u2019t what it once was and that deeply saddened me. I suggested we try a sober social event round his house, he agreed. The first two hours we were both sober. Then in front of me, he opened his wardrobe and took out a warm can of beer and began drinking it. When I said \u201cyo wtf you doing, we agreed to be sober.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t resist.  \n\nIn late 2023, it finally got to me. I got fed up of his money borrowing, his lies, me travelling to him 90% of the time, etc. I was in the wrong for the following action but whilst I was heavily drunk on alcohol, I almost blacked out and I grabbed his throat and aggressively unleashed my anger on him. It was a terrible alcohol induced behaviour to occur and I got banned from his mums place.\n\nThe very next day, I got a phone call from him \u201chell, last night your behaviour was absolutely appalling, you\u2019re never allowed round my house again, my mum is angry with you. But anyway do you want to go to the pub for a beer?\u201d \n\nHe had no money again but I felt bad for him due to my actions so we went for a beer. It was a success, we had a great time and I thought our friendship was good again. \n\n6 months later, in mid 2024, I realised I am ruining my life with alcohol and bad habits. I was so angry with my past self and I recognised hanging out with this person was setting me back. Again I suggested alcohol free gatherings with him and him coming to my area, yet all I got was all talk and no promises. \n\nEvery month he kept owing me money. He paid it back but was broke 3 days later. He said he would do dry August but failed 4 days later, dry September lasted 14 hours because we were at the pub at 2pm, he wrote off dry October because he was going on holiday, dry November we forgot to do, dry December he couldn\u2019t do because Xmas. \n\nDry January I finally done it and he congratulated me. I asked him how his went and he said \u201cthe bloody work mate invited me out and bought me a beer so I couldn\u2019t do it\u201d.\n\nTo conclude this long post, this wasn\u2019t a buddy I met through drink, nor at the bar. It was a college friend who literally hated alcohol and couldn\u2019t handle it. Our friendship was amazing sober. 1 year later we were drinkers and our friendship was still amazing. But 3 years into the drink and our friendship began showing problems. He showed less intention than me when it came to quitting. What do I do with this friend? I am lost. I reminisce on the amazing times we had sober. I reminisce on the amazing times we had drunk. However I feel like he could be preventing me from my self improvement plan and the good memories are becoming less and less. It is tough.",

            "body": "Your first commitment is to get sober and let go of this poison before it totally ruins your life. If your buddy wants to come along at the same time, that's great, but don't let his actions screw up your intent to stop. You've decided at this point in your young life alcohol has the potential to destroy your health and happiness, Sounds like he hasn't but hopefully he does. All you can be is a role model for him, you can't make him stop. You may have to move on from your mate but hopefully he sees the light. Good luck on the sober journey, it is truly amazing. Keep coming back to this sub, I have learned so much here. IWNDWYT",

I feel like this buddy is holding me back, firstly we only meet in pubs and meeting at our homes are difficult due to the logistics, secondly whenever we do meet drinking is involved and even if I drink soft drinks, he opts for alcohol. Thirdly, he never has any money because of drinking and owes me money very often, lastly, the best memories I share with him are when we were drunk and I desire to relive them with him.",
