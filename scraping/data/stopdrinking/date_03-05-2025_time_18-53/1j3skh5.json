    "selftext": "Hi everyone, so I\u2019m going to be 7 years sober in a few months. It\u2019s been great, I\u2019ve become successful in my career and I do really love my life, but I\u2019ve been having the itch to drink again. \n\nFor background, I quit drinking when I was 23 and I had been drinking since I was 19. My life was insane, I was binge drinking whenever anything went wrong, and I felt like it was the only way to maintain my friends. I had a lot of trauma in my teenage years which I think led to my insane drinking and lack of coping skills. But now it\u2019s been 7 years, I\u2019ve gone to multiple years of therapy, have a bunch of coping skills up my sleeve, take my prescribed medication, and I feel genuinely good. And sometimes, all I really want to do, is have a glass of wine with a friend. Or a cocktail on a birthday, or a drink on Christmas. \n\nI think because I got sober so early in my life, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m an alcoholic, or I was abusing alcohol because I was at a really bad place in my life. And now that it\u2019s been almost 7 years and I\u2019m now 30, I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m reevaluating if I truly need to be completely abstinent. I have also been dabbling with edibles as well so I\u2019m not completely sober, but I really enjoy those and they help me relax on the weekends. I never overdo them or take an edible before work.\n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering if any of you have experienced this, or have known anyone who has.  ",

Took about 2 years to remind me why I had a problem before. But I told myself I could control it. Then I couldn\u2019t. Then I wanted to quit again but I couldn\u2019t. Or wouldn\u2019t. Then I had the moment where I knew it had to stop. And that was almost 3 months ago and I feel so good.\n\nNow I wish I never went back to it and hope I never do it again. I don\u2019t want to lose how good I feel again",

We can\u2019t really sit still, we are either moving in one direction or in another.\n\nPeople love to hate on AA, but this is one reason it works for many. It\u2019s a commitment, one day at a time.\n\nTwo bits of reflection (you may know already):\n\nA) we almost always go right back to where we left off, and it accelerates. There is no control, or normal, or whatever the lies are cajoling you with.\n\nB) It can help to roll the tape forward as they say. How do you think this story ends if you pick up a drink?\n\nOne more: one drink is too many, one hundred is never enough.\n\nYou almost certainly don\u2019t want to give up that highly impressive and admirable 7 years for another go at Russian Roulette.\n\nIWNDWYT",

I've got about 2 years of sobriety at this point and have done (I think) a really good job of turning things around and rebuilding my life.\n\nJust a few weeks ago I got invited to a fancy after-party networking event thing at a wine bar. I wasn't going to go at first, but I recognized it was a tremendously promising opportunity to finally start getting my name out there for work related stuff. I'd always be  wondering \"what if\" if I bailed on the event so I decided to just give it a go and scope it out.\n\nI wasn't worried about breaking my sobriety, but I was kinda anxious about trying to network since that ain't my thing. An hour or so into it I was actually thinking about whether or not it'd help to get *a* glass of wine to blend in. Maybe now that things seem to be going pretty well I could start being a social drinker? Would that help me with situations like this?\n\nI asked the bartender if they had any NA drinks and when he told me no I just asked for water for something to sip on. I forced myself to make the rounds and introduce myself to a few people and hand out business cards. If someone asked if they could buy me a drink I told them I probably wouldn't be sticking around much longer and had to drive home. I haven't gotten any calls yet from that event, but I did learn **exactly** how quickly my conviction to sobriety could flip like that. Fucking insane given how much alcohol fucked up my life for 12+ years. I was ready to give it another try after an hour of feeling awkward at a party.\n\nI've built up and burned down promising careers like 3 or 4 times in my adult life due to my drinking. How quickly we forget how one drink turns into two which turns into a week-long bender.",

It seems as though they come out of nowhere. Over the last couple of weeks, they've been very invasive.\n\nI usually remember feeling like I was 9 feet tall as I walked into a liquor store to buy whatever beer or whiskey I wanted. I remember how much I liked the smell of red wine or the mouthfeel of a certain beer. I remember how I'd feel like a big shot relaxing at the end of a work day with a well-earned glass of whiskey.\n\nFor those 10 seconds, I'd probably enjoy myself. But what then? I'd feel guilty for letting myself down, and letting down so many other people who believe in me and love this sober version of me. And I wouldn't physically feel good from drinking anymore. Even at the point where I was drinking 'round the clock, I only really enjoyed the first drink of the day. Everything that followed was just another slow descent down the spiral, another lap around the drain. I used to absolutely detest myself.\n\nSo yeah, it's normal to experience that feeling of wanting to have a drink or feeling like you're missing out on something, but that creation in your mind of what drinking will be like is never actually what it's cracked up to be.",

That\u2019s what got me. It\u2019s why I\u2019m on this sub - just was going out to drink far too often, and using it as a crutch, not sure if your average person would even consider me having a \u201cproblem\u201d - wanted to change my relationship with alcohol.\n\nI did dry January. I drank a few times in Feb. but I haven\u2019t drank alone by myself to cope with stress or anything. Just social events. Doing mostly dry March\u00a0\n\nNot sure if this helps but hopefully it does\u00a0",

After the first one were you ever able to say \u201cyeah, that\u2019s good for today\u201d or did your impulses kick in and tell you to keep going?\nHas your life benefitted from sobriety? \nWhat do you stand to lose if the experiment fails and you head down a dark path?
