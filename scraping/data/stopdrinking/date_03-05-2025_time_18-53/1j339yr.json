    "selftext": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nHi there, sobernauts!\n\nThe outpouring of wisdom we had here yesterday was amazing! I love the way everyone here helps each other by sharing their knowledge, experience, and favorite quotes. \n\nOne that I forgot to add myself was \"20 miles into the forest, 20 miles out.\"\n\nAfter quitting alcohol our bodies and minds take time to recover and rejuvenate. The healing process may take a while- many of us abused alcohol for years and kept walking ourselves deeper into the forest. It can be frustrating or disheartening when we don't see certain positive results of sobriety as quickly as we'd like. But we'll get there. And we should be gentle with ourselves in the meantime.\n\nI think it's important for us to indulge in self-care during recovery in order to promote the healing process. What are some of your favorite ways to practice self-care? \n\nMine are letting myself have a tv marathon from bed for a low-energy recharge, and spending quality time in nature to help myself feel grounded. I'll treat myself with some chocolate or ice cream, because doing something small to make myself happy helps. And anything is better than alcohol. \n\nI'd love to hear what works for you all, and maybe find a useful method or two to try out myself! \n\nI'm very thankful to be walking out of the forest with you all. I Will Not Drink With You Today \ud83c\udf3b\u2764\ufe0f\n\n",

Stopped drinking on new years, lasted 52 days until I drank at work last weekend for National Margarita Day thinking it\u2019d be okay to have a social drink, it was not. Started over and made it 7 days until my work took the employees out to dinner yesterday and I was peer pressured to drink as margaritas and shots were continuously offered to me. I drank 3 margaritas and a shot and I was drunk. Very disappointed in myself especially because I drove home that way and ended up getting in a fight with my boyfriend as the drunk toxica was let loose. Our coworkers wanted to go to a bar after dinner and I didn\u2019t want to go because I knew I would drink more and I had to work early at my other job the next day. I gave my boyfriend shit for wanting to go without me which is what caused the fight. I feel bad I kept him from having fun just because I lack self control (he doesn\u2019t drink so it was not a problem for him). However, one of our coworkers totaled his car coming home from the bar and my boyfriend could have been in the car with him (our coworker was okay thankfully). This also could have been us as my boyfriend was in the car with me after leaving the restaurant and had no clue that I was drunk driving which is fucked up to put him in that danger unknowingly. I just really need to realize that I can\u2019t be a social drinker but I just wanted to be \u201cnormal\u201d and not make a big deal about not drinking around my coworkers as it\u2019s embarrassing to admit I have a bingeing problem. I just feel like I really fucked up and feel so guilty. My boyfriend has forgiven me which I don\u2019t think I deserve as it\u2019s hard to forgive myself rn. Here\u2019s to day 1.",

So now I make sure it\u2019s a meal prep and three meals a day to get my nutrition. \n\nI was one of those people who use the same shower towel for everything, and now I have a skin care routine that I diligently follow morning and night. Not that I actually needed it. My face looks so much better after I quit drinking.\n\nThen there\u2019s fitness.  10,000 steps a day, 3-4 full body work outs a week. I\u2019m in the best shape I\u2019ve ever been in in my entire life.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t not mention journaling. Thoughts are just chaos of the mind.  Writing them down into tangible sentences helps me organize that chaos. I\u2019ve journaled every day since I quit drinking.\n\nAnd of course, AA meetings. Three times a week, things get a little fucky in my head if I don\u2019t. Going when I\u2019m not doing so well helped me feel better. Going when I\u2019m doing just fine helps me help other others.\n\nDoing all this has made me feel so much better about myself.  I might not have any of the same friends I had when I was drinking, but I don\u2019t need validation from others to know who I am. And I am damn proud of who I\u2019ve made myself become in sobriety. I never did any of this when I was drinking because all that really mattered to me was getting drunk and turning my brain off.\n\nIWNDWYT",

I asked a friend yesterday if I was overreacting to the hard things in my life because I don't know how to cope yet.

My morning routine is self care and meditative- coffee, daily check in, check emails, walk dogs, gym, shower, breakfast then on with the day. Cookies (any time is a good time for a cookie!) are self care! My wife and I have been going pretty hard at both work and play the last couple months. Last Saturday we literally did nothing except watch movies on tv the whole day (September 5th, Scarface and some rom com that wasn\u2019t very good and we didn\u2019t finish). We never have a total veg out day like that. It was fun but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s very rare. Love getting lost in a good book too. All kinds of self care! IWNDWYT!",

And decent NA beers and of course some go to NA cocktails that barely cost me anything. Whereas my teammates ended up spending a small fortune on beer having about 6-7 busch lites each on top of all the michelob ultras they had back at their hotel room. Came back on Sunday for our second shift, and heard all the stories from everyone else how they are proudly exclaiming, \"Man I feel so hungover I had to slam 2 red bulls to just get here.\" As I just walk by them, coffee in hand and a clear mind with  no intention of having bloody mary's or screwdrivers, transfusions. Alcohol lied to me and I no longer accept the lie. That clear mind was worth every penny. Also Blue Moon NA slaps, and will easily be my normal drinker if I can get it. IWNDWYT",

I guess I stepped through the tree line and was testing how far I could go and still see the clearing (great  metaphor!).\n\nWhen I would recover from my benders, things that charaded as \"self care\" for me were more just like waiting - they weren't restorative, I just needed the malaise to pass.\n\nI've implemented a system (that I started building in therapy before I chose the alcohol free life) that lists my self-care routines on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. If I want to engage in self care, i'm mindful that it's something aligned with my values, my interests, or pursuant to some sort of goal. Sometimes that's a workout I didn't particularly want to do, and sometimes it's rewatching Gilmore Girls for some feel good outside of my own head.\n\nI know self care can take a lot of forms, and one thing I do for myself with all of you is that...

Wouldn't you get them also WHILE you are drinking?  The answer i found was that your body and brain gets accustomed to the new normal of drinking BUT when you quit your system is knocked off this new normal.  It's like while you drink your system has to protect and compensate - but when you quit your body is in a sort of shock and then goes into healing mode. A big switcheroo for the poor body - but what an amazing thing the body is.  I know my first couple of weeks a big part of my self care was nap nap and more naps - even if I didn't sleep, just laid down for a bit.  The weakness and fatigue was overwhelming.  But it eventually passes (slowly.........) Thankyou MercedesRising. Thankyou SD community soberstars.  IWNDWYT",

I've always struggled with biting off more than I can chew and then getting discouraged when I don't complete everything. Instead of being mean to myself, if I set three small goals in a day and I only get to two, I celebrate the win instead of bemoaning the one that didn't get met. Beyond just being nice to myself, I've been working on my relationship with food. I've been affording myself small treats here and there that I would have begrudged before. If I have an extra soda in a day, it's way better than drinking. \n\nSelf-care has looked a lot like savoring the quiet moments. I am a middle school teacher and I have kids at home too. Quiet moments are hard to come by. \n\nI will not drink with y'all today!",
