Day. \n \n_\"I was doing so well - X days/weeks/months and then I thought I could reward myself\"_ \ud83d\ude07\n \nAnd then KABLAM!!! \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude12\ud83e\udd15\n\nThe result is always regret, and the realisation that the revelry was not worth it. It was simply our reward system that got us to acquiesce to its beguiling ways. \n \nRemind yourself that it is all bullshit. Thousands upon thousands of posts about this sentiment cannot be wrong - so just don't do it. \n \nWe were given the gift of rationality  to overcome our base instincts and hedonistic pursuits. Exercise this self-discipline and know that your fortitude is a beautiful act of self-care. \n \n_If_ you want to reward yourself for some or whatever reason, then have a slice of cake. It's so much tastier and a more indulgent reward \"ritual\". ",

Instead of running away, you could sit there and smile and nod and go \u201cYeah? Yeah? Cool\u2026..BULLSHIT, buddy. Keep it up.\u201d\n\nIt may sound silly, but as opposed to shutting off/shutting down the trigger/temptation, or trying to tune it out, I try to just sit there and look it in the face and see it for what it is.\n\nDefinitely not trying to sound macho or anything haha, I just started practicing this a week or so ago, instead of trying to shut out the intrusive thought. It has seemed to work, and I feel better and more present and resolved afterwards.\n\nWhatever tactic we adopt, it\u2019s sure as shit beats heading out and pumping a few more rolls of quarters into the ass-kicking machine.\n\nGood reminder, thank you for your post!\n\nIWNDWYT",

Knowing there is a point where they will dissipate is the key.\n\nAnd yeah I love what you said because I also do this. In early sobriety, there\u2019d be that voice that popped into my head that said \u201cmaybe we could (insert bad idea here)\u201d or \u201cwhat if we could eventually go back to drinking.\u201d\n\nI used to try and ignore it, repress the feelings and stuff it all deep down inside. That didn\u2019t really work. In fact it usually made those thoughts more frequent and less manageable. Finally I decided I was just going to give them their moment and not worry about them. I knew they were nonsense so I didn\u2019t feel the need to argue and wrestle with them, which made them pop up less frequently and when they did they were much shorter lived.",

I do appreciate that fear though. \n\nI've found it to be a bit of a paradox - whenever I fell off the wagon (and I did it plenty plenty times), I knew in my heart of hearts that I wanted to get sober - and with the amount of days behind me I knew it was possible to get back to this state because I had done it before (which is my rational mind talking), on the contrary however alcoholism (or rather the reward system) is such a bastard that it _knows_ it doesn't want to be deprived again, so it makes the cravings that little bit more intense, and also that it needs to \"catch up\" - so I drank that much harder.\n\nIt truly is insidious if one thinks about it, but the mind and our willpower (and faith in ourselves) can overcome these setbacks. The easiest path for me is simply to accept and embrace the stance that I don't want to be in that place again - and remind myself when necessary (which is why I pop in on SD now and then, but not constantly anymore - although in my experience this is still the best support resource)",
