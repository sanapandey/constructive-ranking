    "selftext": "When you feel lonely even around friends, even around your lover, even during the most successful time in your life. I just got a promotion at my main job. My company values me they put me in charge of two things at once which isn\u2019t common. I have a side job for extra money. Me and my lover aren\u2019t on the worst terms. I have a supportive mom. I have two great friends. But whenever I\u2019m alone all I can do is drink and doom scroll for hours and I\u2019m just so depressed. I\u2019ve dealt with anxiety and depression since I was a child. I was medicated with SSRIs since I was 10 (stopped when I was 13 never tried it again). I\u2019ve always suffered with extreme emotions (EXTREME SADNESS AND DYSPHORIA) but living on my own has made alcoholism more prevalent because it\u2019s just me and him and him is kinda chill so he worries but not too much no matter how much I bring up how sad I am. I am in no means so unfortunate, I am lucky in many ways. I am funny I\u2019m smart im beautiful to some and I still feel like being drunk is the only thing from stopping me from like wayyyy worse things. I had a therapist up until a year ago that doesn\u2019t help either. At this point im thinking of watching some like sad movies about addiction to change my mind and idk just maybe if this doesn\u2019t get modded give me some advice. Im 24 and I feel like I drink soooo much for someone who has gone through \u201cso little\u201d of real life. So many people have gone through so much more and are wayyyy better off than me maybe I\u2019m just not built for irl. I\u2019ve always had addictive tendencies apparently my dad and mom both have that \u201cgene\u201d they never mentioned and so I just ended up on the wrong end of it in many ways until I ended up in alcoholism which is what it was always meant to be. I have a feeling this might get taken down for something but idk where else to post maybe a diary would be better. Thanks ",
