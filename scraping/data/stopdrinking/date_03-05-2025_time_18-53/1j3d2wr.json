    "selftext": "Just wanted to share my (31F) experience. I\u2019ve never been a problem drinker, just a plain old social drinker (a couple of drinks once per week,\nor less these days). I have never really loved it, but did it because \u201cthats what people do\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ve dabbled over the past year in some short \u201csober\u201d stints motivated by wanting to generally improve health and decenter drinking in my life. Most recently, I made a New Year\u2019s resolution to drink less and drink consciously in 2025. I gave myself 12 \u201ccredits\u201d \u2014 12x occasions to drink this year \u2014 and after not a single drop for 2 whole months, I drank for the first time on the weekend. \n\nI had 3 beers and 1 small cocktail across about 8 hours on Saturday. Barely anything by society\u2019s standards. I didn\u2019t even feel much of a buzz, I ate a lot, I drank slowly. \n\nThat night, I experienced reflux after I laid down to sleep so ended up vomiting to clear it. It was short lived discomfort and I felt totally fine before/after and the next day. I typically don\u2019t vomit unless sick.\n\nCome Monday / Tuesday this week, and I\u2019ve had to take sick days from work because of crippling brain fog, particularly in the afternoon. Totally unable to focus. Distractable. Irritable. Spaced out. Sleeping has been fine, I\u2019m just a shell of myself. \n\nIt simply wasn\u2019t worth it. I will be doubling down on my year without drinking. I hope to make it to the end of the year with 11 \u201ccredits\u201d still in tact. \n\nIWNDWYT. ",
