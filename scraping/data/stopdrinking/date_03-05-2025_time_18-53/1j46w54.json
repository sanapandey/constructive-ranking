Quit boozing every day, which gave me more energy to work out, regulated my appetite for garbage food, and allowed me to sleep like a baby again. \n\nI just finished a 24 hour monitoring and I am so happy to say that my average Bp is now 110/69.\n\nJust wanted to share this because I\u2019m so proud of myself and if anyone needs to read this today because they\u2019re feeling discouraged that things aren\u2019t happening for them.  It actually works, guys. Ditching alcohol works. ",

I stopped 1/1/24 and within 5 months that med had been reduced down to 10 mg. I am going to lobby her at my checkup to consider dropping it altogether (my bp readings the several months have been low 100s/mid 60sto low 70s. I did end up losing weight (45 pounds so far) but the BP was affected/dramatically improved long before that happened. Seems miraculous to me really.",
