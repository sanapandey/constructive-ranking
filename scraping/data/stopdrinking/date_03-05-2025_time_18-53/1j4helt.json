    "selftext": "\nI\u2019m not looking for medical advice, I just am curious if anyone has similar experiences. I have decided I want to stop drinking or severely cut back.\n\nSo, this was maybe the second time I blacked out this bad. On Saturday I drank way too much on accident, maybe 9 standard drinks (I\u2019m a woman 5\u20191, 115 pounds) and I blacked out really bad. I didn\u2019t throw up but I had a bad hangover the next day. I got better the second day but that night I started sneezing a lot. Ever since I\u2019ve had a bad flu, headache, brain fog, chills, and a congested nose, sneezing coughing. But what weirds me out of my snot is clear which makes me think that maybe this isn\u2019t a viral infection but a result of drinking way too much this weekend. Has anyone else experienced this? I\u2019ve gotten sick right after a hangover before as well. I just wanted to know if this is a common occurrence for others. ",
