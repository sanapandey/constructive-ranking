    "selftext": "Same old shit different day. My depression rages on. I swung ny the father in laws to drink coors light by the dozen, which makes me indulge in smoking cigarettes with him as well. Talk wayy too much about cringy shit and woke up with a hang over and regretting the cigarettes. Regretting all of it.\n\nIts somwthing i do at least once a week. Somwtimes twice. Pretty un special. But for whatever reason, im done for now. Setting a 30 day goal, getting in the gym and going to just let the depression have me if it wants me.\n\nGoing to get a bunch of sparkling waters. I quit for 6 months a few years ago and i single handedly boosted lacroix stock.\n\nMy kids are 12 and 14. I only got a few years left of them home. Thank you to all the storys i read on here. Give me strength!",
