I also been enjoying making different combinations of fruit/lemom/mint/cucumber water. Trying different water flavoring packets (cryatal light and other similar ones) has also been a nice sweet-treat thing I've been doing!\n\n",

No triggers for me with NA, drinks.\nI always looked on this group with envy and disdain equally if I am honest. But I joined it. Here I am about 5 months in and honestly only tempted 3 times. This naked mind did it for me.",

I don't mind the Recess mocktails- they don't try to mimic the flavor of alcohol and they're not too sweet, but they have 10mg caffeine which I don't love.\n\nI've gone to the store a few times since I quit and just bought a bunch of individual NA drinks to try out, some of them a little pricier, but it's still nothing compared to what I was spending on alcohol.",
