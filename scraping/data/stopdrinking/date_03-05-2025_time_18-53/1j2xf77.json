    "selftext": "I\u2019ve taken breaks here and there and life is always so much better when I go even just a few days without drinking. For some reason I keep telling myself that I finally got it under control, and allow myself a drink while at dinner, at a work party, or some other \u201cjustifiable\u201d occasion, and it always sends me back to nightly drinking and daily hangovers. I\u2019m committing to sobriety starting today. It\u2019s only day 1, but finding this subreddit and reading everyone\u2019s stories brings me hope. Wish me luck. ",
