[https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1iyal5o/14\\_days\\_sober\\_second\\_week\\_done/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1iyal5o/14_days_sober_second_week_done/)  \n\n\nThe fatique triggers me to drink, when I exhausted I wanna have a beer or something. And my smart watches telling me that stress levels are higher now then when I was drinking... But, maybe it is related to the fact, that I am training now. This is physiological stress levels, that are higher.   \n  \nGood luck guys! ",
