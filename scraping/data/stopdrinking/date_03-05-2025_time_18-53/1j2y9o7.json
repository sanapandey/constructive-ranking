    "selftext": "It\u2019s 7am on a Tuesday. You\u2019ve hit snooze 3 times and only have 30 minutes to get to work. There is only a shot or two left in the bottle of four roses you bought last night. It feels like you\u2019ve been shot in the stomach. Your jaw is constantly clinching and clicking and aching. Having a headache is a usual part of your day now. Lips red and cracked, eyes bloodshot, face puffy. You are so, so tired. You smoke a cigarette and it sets you over the edge. You puke. Shower, brush teeth, off to work. \n\nYou\u2019re late and fuck up all day. You\u2019re anxious to a debilitating, almost delusional degree and think everyone hates you. It\u2019s clear you\u2019re strung out and sick. You\u2019re depressed and every negative thought is stuck on a loop. You\u2019re so nauseous you can\u2019t eat. \n\nYou get off work and get more booze. It doesn\u2019t really give you the release you expect and crave; you\u2019ll feel normal again for an hour or so, after that, numb. And still very sick. You DoorDash something and nibble at it. You don\u2019t enjoy it. Drink until you sleep. Next days the same. \n\nWriting this down just to remember why I quit. \n",

In one night, I was doing deliberate damage to my finances, my relationships and my body. It's crazy that I ever saw that as ok, let alone necessary.",
