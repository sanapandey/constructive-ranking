    "selftext": "Four months sober... It's been going pretty well, haven't really had the desire to drink (it honestly churns my stomach when I think about it)... Got my weight more under control, no longer shoveling sweets into my face for the dopamine hit... Job is going well, keep getting told I'm doing awesome... Still feel like I may get fired after the busy season, but that may be paranoia and thinking old things will keep happening.\n\nStill getting terrible sleep, but that's been a constant in my life since I was a child... So don't know if that will ever change.\n\n Depression has been creeping back in, but that could be a combination of my major depressive disorder, lack of sleep, job fears, and family life.... Just gonna keep going strong and hope for the best.",

It was actually one of the reasons I drank so it helped two issues!\n\nDepression is not helping you. See a doctor/naturopath and get some relief with medication and/or supplements. \n\nI am so close to my 4 month with you. Congratulations and  IWNDWYT",

There's no reason to feel like that all the time, and they can help make a plan with you to get you feeling better!   \n\nThe depression could just be paws hitting you after the pink cloud.  I think i fell off the pink cloud around month end or 4 as well and then felt generally anhedonic until about month 9 and a half before I made a turn around.   \n\nPink cloud: \nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/pink-cloud\n\nPaws: \nhttps://www.ororecovery.com/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome-paws-symptoms/",

I'll have to see about going to a doctor, but currently don't really have health insurance... My company is planning on setting up health insurance some time in the next few months, but if I'm not being paranoid and do get tanked, it wouldn't matter anyways\nHowever, I do have a back up job of this one falls through, and they do have health insurance there.",
