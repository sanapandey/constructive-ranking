    "selftext": "Hey, gang. Just venting... As the title states, I'm wrestling with myself. I booted booze last year, and have not drunk for 145 of the last 147 days or something like that. But, I keep coming back to the cravings and the thought of, \"Fuck, it would be nice to have a beer right now.\" \n\nYesterday was a gorgeous day here on the east coast, and I was feeling accomplished. I did my work, worked out, and was enjoying feeling happy. I really wanted to just have a beer or two outside as the sun set. I didn't. I'm just struggling with this thought pattern. \n\nI don't expect it to change over time. It's just something that I have to keep working at, I guess. Thanks for understanding. ",

My version of this is \"it would be nice to have a glass of prosecco right now.\" I force myself to engage immediately, e.g., \"When have you ever had A glass? That's a lie. What you want is to relax, and you might want something cool and with bubbles. How about a Gruvi No-secco or a diet Dr. Pepper? The actual prosecco isn't going to do you any favors and never did.\"",

Nope, but you would have felt guilty/shame/bad whatever the next morning and the pictures of the sunset in your mind would be tarnished. You've done great over the last 147 days, keep it up and keep coming back here. IWNDWYT",

            "body": "I've always compared those kinds of moments to a child trying to enjoy eating healthy veggies when it knows there's a giant colorful super sweet cake in the fridge. It might pretend to enjoy the veggies, but the idea of that delicious cake will overpower any kind of logic. The child will never actually enjoy steam broccoli when an option of the cake is available. However, lets pretend the child is living in severe poverty, there's no cake, and most of the time there's no enough food to go around, that child would be excited to get his hands on any amount of food, even if it's just bread and some milk. My point is that removing the option of cake is how I can starve my \"child brain\" and allow it to reset over time, appreciating what it has instead of fantasizing over what it thinks it can have. \n\nIt's the same as when I drive my car, engine light is on, it's making weird sounds, overdue for oil change, AC broken. I will imagine me buying a new overpriced car, everything shiny, nothing is broken, but I can't really afford it. And that idea doesn't make me focus on fixing my car, getting oil changed, do what I can in terms of what I can afford financially. Because my car still runs, and I can't just leap to get a new car loan every time my car has a small problem. \n\nIWNDWYT",
