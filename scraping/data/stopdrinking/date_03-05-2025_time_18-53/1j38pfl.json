    "selftext": "For the last many years I wake up in the morning and my eyes are dry and extremely red and glossy. I definitely have had a bad relationship with alcohol for a long time now. I\u2019m a 29M and have drank since I have been 14. I think the longest I went was a few years ago and it was like 3 months off the drink. I don\u2019t drink daily and have taken like 1-2 weeks off in between drinks at times so I can usually keep the cravings at bay if any but where I struggle is if I drink there\u2019s a 40-50% chance I\u2019m going to way overdo it. Especially with friends. Could be 9 beers could be 18. Either way I am just wondering if this is what\u2019s causing my body to feel so tired regardless of the amount of sleep I get. I also notice that I\u2019ve always tried to plan my family plans around me trying to get a drink somewhere. It\u2019s been so subtle but and almost on an unconscious level but it\u2019s true. I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s benefits to sobriety symptom wise that i haven\u2019t quit long enough to experience. I also sometimes take my first sip of alcohol and get hot and ears get super red and hot. I don\u2019t know if maybe my body is literally trying to tell me stop because I\u2019m getting allergic to it. Am I alone? Thanks in advance, and IWNDWYT. ",

I quit because I was a drunk, and I had horrible health, and some of other reasons too. So, I don't know for you, but my 30's have been the best time of my life, all because I decided to quit drinking.",

Keeping it to myself for now but plan on letting my wife know once I hit my first goal. Say 30 days or something like that. I think she already knows I should be doing this so I kind of want to surprise her with some success first. May read a book on it if there\u2019s any you would recommend?",
