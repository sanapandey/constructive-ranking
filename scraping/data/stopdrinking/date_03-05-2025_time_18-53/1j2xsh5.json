    "selftext": "I attempted to quit drinking several times but this time feels different. I don't view alcohol as a source of enjoyment like I used to. When my hangover faded after each relapse I always felt like I was deprived of alcohol and that I needed it to enjoy life but this time I don't. I now know that it is in fact not adding anything to my life and taking away a lot. \n\nIt took me more than one mistake/relapse to realize this but I genuinely have no desire for it anymore. It just creates so much suffering for me. \n\nI was sober for a long time before my last relapse and it was so peaceful and nice. I want to go back to that mental state. I want to feel joy, boredom, sadness while sober like I'm supposed to. I love the feeling of having good memory and mental clarity. Waking up with no hangover. Not feeling like I'm betraying my body and destorying it.\n\nI don't want this fucking poison in my life anymore. All I know for sure is that I haven't drank since my last relapse and I sure as hell won't be drinking today. ",

It was something incredible: my mood improved and my brain was radiant. But my promise expired (5 months ago) and I started drinking again. Soon I was drinking a lot, and what's worse, I started to behave aggressively when I got drunk, something that didn't happen.",
