    "selftext": "Successful 2 weeks of sobriety after sevral failed attemps after drinking every night for the past 2 years. Although I feel strong enough to stay sober after drinking four 12% cutwaters one night and having the worse hangover ever, getting through my thoughts are a constant struggle. \n\nI'm a hypochondriac (on top of anxiety) and constantly thinking I've caused irreversible damage to myself. I've suffered with bulimia for almost 10 years, and adding heavy drinking for the past 2 years is making me think the worse. \n\nAlthough I am only 23, there's still hope right? I booked an appointment to tell my dr about my ed and struggle with alchohol, which is in 2 weeks from now.\n\nI guess I just need to write my thoughts out and maybe get some reassurance? Will I be okay though?\n\nSymptom rant:\nI'm constantly tired, feels like I'm not losing weight despite changing lifestyle, such as eating cleaner and working out. I recall seeing people struggle with that once quitting alchohol so I assume it's just my body recovering? I see little veins which I think resemble spider veins? But very few of them, and youd have to look close enough to find them. Probably just my hypochondria making me fear the worse. I have an itchy scalp, which can be explained by me trying a new shampoo this past month, but silly me thinks it's caused by something else. But I imagine I'd definitely know if something major was wrong right? Like liver damage (my biggest fear and concern)? My urine is clear/normal yellow, no pain, no yellowing in eyes or skin, no abdominal pain, etc\n\nMy mom has autoimmune diseases and im always deficient in some sort of vitamin so I imagine those also have a role to play in what symptoms I may be experiencing (If theyre real ones, sometimes my hypo causes me to hyper fixate on the smallest things, making them intensity when theres truly nothing wrong). I will be mentioning the autoimmune disease and such at my appointment. But overall, I feel fine I suppose? \n\nSorry for ranting ",

Men with low test hold weight, women with high cortisol hold weight. I must add this isn\u2019t medical advice, purely anecdotal.",

Ive also been replacing the void that I used to numb with drinking with snacking on buldak and other unhealthy snacks (even right before I stopped recently). I suppose I just need more time for body to adjust to the new diet and maybe add a few more thousand of steps per day. But I'll definitely know once I get my bloodwork done",

            "body": "I can relate so much to you. Although I\u2019m 43 :). I have PCOS (hormone imbalance). You will be very surprised how much better you feel as the weeks go by without alcohol. This is not medical advice but at 23 it seems like you are too young to have done damage that can\u2019t be reversed. Everyone is different. Vitamins play a huge role in our overall well being. Electrolytes being out of balance\u2026 vitamin deficiencies and being dehydrated can all make us feel very ill. Also packaged food, soda ect.   I would get some liquid IVs. Take one a day. A really good multivitamin\u2026 a good pro biotic and a specific supplement for your liver. All these are game changers. I\u2019m on a very low dose of Xanax for anxiety and almost all my anxiety is health related. So I 100% understand. There is a good book called \u201ccalming your nerves\u201d. It\u2019s been helpful for me.",
