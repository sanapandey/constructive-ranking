    "selftext": "Yesterday was the first of 6 days alone while my spouse is out of town. It was a crazy week of thoughts just leading up to it. \n\nYesterday I committed to stay sober just for the day. If I want to drink tomorrow I can. But I'll deal with that tomorrow (this was huge).\n\nThe mental gymnastics were enlightening. It made me realize this battle will always be there. There may come a time that I lose, but not today.\n\nOne day at a time folks. It's not just a cliche, it what has worked for me. \n\nI went and bought some Bubbly water and a few favorite things to prepare some of my favorite meals and snacks.\n\nIt feels amazing to wake up, get ready for the gym and hit the day!\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWether you have one day or years. Both are just as influencial here. Reading your life experiences has been lifesaving. Literally.\n\nThank you to each and everyone of you. \n\nIWNDWYT \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc ",
