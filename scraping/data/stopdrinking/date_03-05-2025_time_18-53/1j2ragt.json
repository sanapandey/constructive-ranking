Yesterday I was getting temptation and all I could think of was how awful it would make me feel and the guilt along with it if I did drink, proud to say I didn\u2019t. This is your sign to keep going strong and put the poison down! IWNDWYT\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb",

I can\u2019t wait to be 15 days sober! \n\nI felt a temptation on Saturday, before I went to the nail salon, which would be a normal thing for me to drink & drive to my nail appointment. \n\nI just thought of my sisters, how they\u2019re counting on me to be alive and well. I thought of my 1 year old son who is counting on me for everything. Then I thought of myself. I\u2019m finally gaining more mental clarity, feeling more myself, not risking my freedom, not risking crashing into another car. I could keep going on and on.\n\nThere will be temptation, as we know it but the strength we have to continue to fight this disease is so much stronger than giving in to the poison! Being drunk then making terrible decisions, feeling like crap, putting your loved ones on the back burner, wasting $ & continuing the hellish cycle of alcohol addiction. \n\nI\u2019M GOOD on all of THAT! Bye bye alcohol, you horrible poison. My life is so precious. I will not let myself be consumed by you! Rip alcohol lol\n\nIWNDWYT\u2728\u2728\u2728",

I've had a few temptations too, but I am really making peace (more like fuck off) with my \"naughty\" brain and embracing a clean life. This past weekend I cleaned the garage, vacuumed my truck and walked my dog, THEN went to the gym. . . .Who am I?!!",
