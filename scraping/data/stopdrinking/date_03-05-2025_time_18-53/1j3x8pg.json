    "selftext": "To give a bit of context, for the past 2 or so years, I\u2019d be surprised if I spent 5 days sober, I would get to the afternoon after work and I would go to the gym, cook dinner, and have nothing to do\u2026 so I would drink say 10-12 standards a night, almost every night for the better part of the past 2 years. I haven\u2019t enjoyed it and tried to justify that I was functioning well socially and in my job but it wasn\u2019t adding anything and I new this. It was a combination of boredom and putting myself to sleep.\n\nRecently I decided to stop and had no issue with this in a social setting nor with the extra time as I tried using kava it helped with getting to sleep and providing a reduced level of anxiety, no withdrawals or cravings to drink\u2026\n\nLately I have been doing BJJ which has helped immensely as it is a good community if you have the right gym, but over the past 4 days I have been hit with a decent bit of depression after about 3 weeks off of drinking, and I barely want to get out of bed but still do everything by force that I need to get through the day, with training being my only thing I really want to do.\n\n Essentially, I want to hear others experiences in this situation on if the depression was a short to medium term thing from the normalising aspects of quitting consistent drinking, and/or if this is something that might be worth trying anti-depression medication.\n\nI want to note that I am reluctant to try anti-depressants as I haven\u2019t had this over the past decade and prior to drinking, and hoping to see how others have coped with the downhill side of things and if this is something that can and/or does come about from the long term withdrawals.\n\nReally appreciate the community as I haven\u2019t looked on here for the past month or so. Any help or your experiences would be great! ",

I am overall just trying to give myself slack when I feel down about the things I will\\need to do. Prioritizing my sobriety. But I am only on day 7 so take it with a grain of salt.",
