    "selftext": "So I had a drink last night for the first time in over 2 weeks. I'm not too upset about the number, my intent wasn't to never drink again. \n\nWhat I was surprised about is how unenjoyable it was. I was thinking I'd get some feeling of \"I've missed this!\", but I didn't at all. It didn't even taste good anymore.\n\nI'm a long time scotch drinker, and have always enjoyed the taste and the burn of it. But this time, all I could taste was the alcohol. It was overwhelming. It made me think \"how the hell was I drinking this everyday?\" I mean I'm sure I got used to it and didn't taste the alcohol as much, but that's not a good thing.\n\nI didn't drink very much, barely even felt anything, but I ended up sleeping terribly. Woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep. Woke up with a minor headache (not sure if it was due to the alcohol or the lack of sleep, but either way, something I hadn't had in the prior 2 weeks) and my head just overall not feeling as clear as I've gotten used to. I hear a lot around here about \"brain fog\" and never thought I experienced that, but this morning I did notice a difference.\n\nSo anyways, on one side I feel like I ruined my streak for nothing, it wasn't even worth it. On the other hand, maybe it was a small price to pay to tell my brain that I don't even enjoy drinking, so why even think about it?",

            "body": "I remember a black label that tasted like gasoline to me but that I still drank because it was a gift and that's where I was. I knew it couldn't actually be gasoline, right? Glad not to be worrying about entire classes of chemicals that I'd be putting in my body were I drinking.\n\nAs for the streak I wouldn't worry about it. I would reset it because I know I get particularly vulnerable after having any kind of a night but it wouldn't change my behavior anyway. I still come here each day, keep no alcohol around, and be kind to myself. Congrats on the two weeks. A great experience to build on. IWNDWYT",
