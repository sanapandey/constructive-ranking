It varies by person how long it takes to fade depending on your drinking history and if you have other health concerns. Congrats on 20 days that\u2019s awesome!",

Less the hangover breaks down the intensity.\u00a0\n\nEverybody needs a brain rest day. Give yourself a break with some patience and grace. \ud83c\udf3c \ud83c\udf1e\u00a0",
