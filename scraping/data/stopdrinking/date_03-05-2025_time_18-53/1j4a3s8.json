Want a blunt and beer so bad, know I will have a full blown relapse within 2 weeks if I pick up just one. \n\nI am rhuminating in some personal pain, I think it majorly triggered me. \n\nToday is one of those days they warn you about. :'(",

This is the longest I've gone without a beer in a long time, and I know I don't want to drink... but sometimes I think, fuck it, what does it really matter anyway?\n\nThing is... all I have to think about now are all the times I've woken up on a piss-soaked couch with a piss-soaked wallet and risking that scenario -- just by having one drink, which I know will lead to another -- seems completely unappealing these days. So much so that, finally, I've been able to push past the fuckits and remind myself that as much as I want to say fuck it today, I need to be kind to myself tomorrow. Drinking definitely isn't being kind to myself.\n\nInstead, I'll slam some seltzers, order a pizza and wings, and watch an old 90s cop drama... because fuck it. That's just as good as slamming 20 beers and I'll still be able to function tomorrow.",

It\u2019s about wanting relief, wanting an escape from the weight of today. And that makes sense. So instead of fighting it, what if you just sat with it for a second? What if you *named* exactly what\u2019s hurting and gave yourself permission to feel it without numbing it away?\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing\u2014this is *one* of those days they warn you about. But it\u2019s also one of those days that, if you push through, you\u2019ll look back on and be so damn proud of yourself for not giving in.\n\nGet out of your head if you can. Move, breathe, get outside, scream into a pillow, call someone, take a cold shower, do anything to shift the energy. You don\u2019t have to feel great today. You just have to get through it.\n\nYou\u2019re stronger than this craving. It will pass. And when it does, you\u2019ll still have yourself, still have your progress, and still have the power to keep moving forward. You got this.",
