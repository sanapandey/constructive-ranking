I\u2019ve been doing good but working a double today and these type of days is what pushes me to grab a drink. Writing this at my desk right now already in an off mood, hoping to stay on course in this journey. ",

After a long tiring day, what\u2019s best for me is just relaxing on the couch, watching some tv, and going to bed early. While booze sounds good after a long day, I know it\u2019s a scientific fact that it doesn\u2019t relax the body and mind at all, and in fact does the exact opposite.",
