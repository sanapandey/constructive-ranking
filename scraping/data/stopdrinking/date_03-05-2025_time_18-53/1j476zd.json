    "selftext": "Hi, I'm 37 and only drink beer on weekends, usually around 18 to 20 half-liter cans. I want to quit because I'm staying up later and later. I start drinking around 9:30 PM and don\u2019t go to bed until 6 or 7 AM. This has been my routine for months, but now I\u2019m feeling increasingly \"depressed\" and my sleep during the week is becoming worse in the days after.\n\nThe issue is that I really look forward to the weekends. Sometimes I have friends over, but most of the time, I\u2019m alone, watching a movie and then YouTube. After doing this for so long, drinking beer feels inseparable from watching a movie. I worry that if I stop, I won\u2019t have anything to look forward to anymore. Maybe I should stick to one night a week instead of two?",

Make sure it\u2019s something you REALLY want to do, so you don\u2019t end up not bothering and drinking instead. You need something worth waking up for, something worth not drinking for. If you can\u2019t think of anything, you need to seek professional help.",
