    "selftext": "Hi guys. This is my first time posting in this sub and I\u2019m a newbie alcoholic. I\u2019m 21F and got a DUI when I was 20 and was basically a functioning alcohol (secretly not functioning at all) for 4 months in 2024.\n\nAnyways I\u2019m on vacation in Costa Rica right now with my mom and sister and drinking is still a touchy subject for me. My mom won\u2019t let me be alone at any point on vacation because she thinks I\u2019ll run off and  drink. For background I\u2019ve been sober since January 1st. I\u2019ve been doing well so far being sober and have avoided drinking in college because my parents don\u2019t let me out anymore and I live with them, instead of on my college campus, so they can keep an eye on me. It really sucks not really having a social life but at least I\u2019m not getting in trouble from drinking and I feel better mentally and physically.\n\nThe thing about vacationing is there\u2019s alcohol EVERYWHERE. There are students here my age on spring break partying it up and everywhere sells alcohol. My mom and I have been fighting and she has been making comments when I make a dumb mistake (like forgetting something in the hotel room for example) along the lines of \"are you drunk? Have you been drinking\" even though I have been 100% sober this whole time and haven\u2019t thought about drinking until now.\n\nSometimes when my mom accuses me of being drunk I get temped to just drink anyways, because what difference would it make to her, I\u2019m already drunk in her eyes. She says stuff like \"you\u2019ll just get depressed and be your usual drunk self if I leave you alone\" even though I have not drank at all and haven\u2019t pushed my mom to let me drink.\n\nI\u2019m looking for advice on how to talk to my mom to get her to reduce these triggers she gives me when she talks to me that way. I know deep down ordering a few mojitos isn\u2019t worth the drama and interrupting my current progress by drinking, but it might make me calmer when my mom attacks me for my flaws and brings up past mistakes I\u2019ve made while drunk (I\u2019m a calm, happy drunk)\n\nSorry this was long. Being sober has been amazing and freeing, but I still do have my tempting moments like the one I\u2019m in right now.\n",

It'd be nice if you could just have an honest heart-to-heart with her, but I know how that can go.\n\nWhat if you escape to a local AA meeting? If the place you're in is big enough, it might have an English speaking meeting. I live in Tulum, MX, and we have a great one here. At the very least, it'd be a good context to vent about the mom situation.",

            "body": "I would be direct with her.  Let her know about your great progress, and make sure she realizes that her accusations are hurtful and and making it hard for you.  It is important to understand that, from her perspective, it's probably difficult to trust you because of past behavior.  But, hopefully she wants the best for you and will be more supportive once she understands how hard you're working and that you could really use a partner in this whole endeavor.  My guess here is that she doesn't realize that you're working as hard as you are and that she feels like she needs to police, rather than support you.",

            "body": "That is so hard. If you were like me, I was already in a deep shame and guilt spiral when I decided to get sober, and having someone add fuel to that shame fire would be so defeating for me. It sounds like your mom is trying to come from a good place but it\u2019s so much easier to be judgmental or brash on your family members than it would be to a stranger or even a friend. Can you tell her about how you\u2019re struggling and tell her what you need right now is compassion and not more guilt tripping? And how her words are actually doing the opposite of helping you and are actually triggering? Perhaps she doesn\u2019t understand that what she is doing (making snide comments, isolating you) is actually hurting and not helping, and that she is not creating a safe space for you.\n\nI know sometimes it\u2019s harder also to have tough conversations verbally that are productive, since sometimes there\u2019s not enough time to process emotions before speaking/reacting. Do you think writing her a letter might help so she can have time to process what you\u2019re saying?\n\nJust know that a bunch of Reddit friends are so proud of you and the progress you have made! And I hope you can take some time to enjoy the beautiful nature and relax on your vacation.",
