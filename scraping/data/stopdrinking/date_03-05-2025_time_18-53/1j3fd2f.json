I just called in sick to work for about the millionth time and I know they're getting tired of it. I'm looking around at a messy, disorganized house. I've been using credit cards again when they were just paid off/down. It's just so beyond time for me to quit this shit. I'm gonna do my best to go light on the wine today - just enough to not feel sick, but not enough to need more tomorrow. I'm gonna try to check back in here, too - maybe it'll help keep me on track. Thanks for listening (well, reading, but you know what I mean \ud83d\ude04) ",

Hopefully, I can get my brain to realize that it\u2019s not adding anything good to my life. For some reason no matter how sick I am, no matter how many things are bad in my life, I still feel like it\u2019s gonna be fun again. But I really like what you said about that seed being planted - I\u2019m just gonna try and keep in mind all the reasons I need to quit and hopefully I\u2019ll just feel bad about drinking. Thanks for the comment!\u00a0",

I absolutely know that quitting will have that effect but for some reason(I guess it\u2019s addiction) my brain still is like \u201cyeah but we like it.\u201d hopefully with practice, I can get that to go away.

Because that sentiment of hoping to get that feeling or thought to go away, and why is it still there\u2026it literally is the dopamine and seratonin and chemical interactions and brain neuropathways and all those things (not a doctor AT ALL and these terms are probably all over the place but it\u2019s something along those lines \ud83d\ude02) ..anyway, I tell myself that. It\u2019s literally science. It\u2019s not me. \u201cMe\u201d is whatever I\u2019m working on being without those interactions caused by alcohol lol.",

I honestly didn't start realizing and seeing things more clearly until after 6-9 months of sobriety. I'd say that while I was still drinking, which wasn't even every day, I definitely wasn't thinking clearly. I never gave myself enough time in between the drinking to actually come out of the shade and see the sun. Every decision I made in the past while I was still in my drinking days were in some way not completely mindful and sound. \n\nThis is one of those things you wont know until you get to the other side and reflect. You owe it to yourself to give yourself a chance. If you don't like it or if it's wrong, alcohol will always be a liquor store away.",
