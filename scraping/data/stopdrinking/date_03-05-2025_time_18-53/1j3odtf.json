    "selftext": "Today will be 29 days into my new lifestyle. It seems like it went by kind fast but yet the days were so long. My boyfriend kick started my journey when he had enough of my lying, I was terrified we were done for good, forever. I\u2019ve wanted and needed to get sober but I didn\u2019t know how and was too scared, insecure and afraid to ask for help. Now all the secrets are out, I\u2019m seeing two therapists, on Antabus and will start an antidepressant next week because I was self medicating. I was so sure these 30 days that I can do it, stay sober and turn my life around. Seeing Karen Huger\u2019s arrest videos shook me, I could see myself in her and I\u2019m not her, who am I kidding? \n\nI was hyperfocused on trying to repair my relationship because I didn\u2019t want to loose him or our family. I couldn\u2019t let any of us down again if I could only get the chance. Day 26 was the best day ever, a turning point in our relationship and a little bit of returning to normalcy. I think we\u2019re still treading lightly and I think that\u2019s the right thing to do. Rebuilding the trust is going to take time and I need to give him time to see. I need to go slow for me too because I\u2019m a new me in some ways. These last few days have been a new chapter and I\u2019m proceeding very cautiously because I don\u2019t want to slip into old ways or habits.  My boyfriend isn\u2019t a drinker and supports my efforts, but now that I\u2019m not focusing my attention on that I\u2019m worried the alcohol will try to sneak back in. I\u2019m proud of these last days and I like who I am and can make it through each day without all this anxiety that I thought the alcohol was helping me with. My house is where I would drink, i wasn\u2019t comfortable in my own home, now I am. I\u2019m doing okay and I\u2019ll continue to push through and focus on my goals, and the little accomplishments that come along without all the booze. 30 days tomorrow, whoohoo! IWNDWYT",
