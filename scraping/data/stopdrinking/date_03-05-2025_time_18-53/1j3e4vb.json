    "selftext": "Today I celebrate my 21st birthday. It will be my first one not drinking in 5 or 6 years. A little over two months off, and as a result I have distanced myself from all my \u201cfriends\u201d (people who I did nothing with but destroy my body and my sanity). No one reached out. So here I sit, by myself with my decaf coffee, listening to George Martin and smiling because today I choose not to drink. Cheers y\u2019all \u2615\ufe0f",
