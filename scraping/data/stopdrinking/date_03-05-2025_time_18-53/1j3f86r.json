    "selftext": "It\u2019s not that it feels like day one in the sense that the urges are worse but maybe that is what it is? I\u2019ve been pushing to get here and feel great and still have such gratitude for how I feel every morning and I\u2019m still acutely aware of how terrible I felt just 29 days ago. Less even, because even while I was mentally in a good place my first week in the sense that a complete switch flipped for me and I didn\u2019t even want to drink so it wasn\u2019t hard, my body was raging against me and my mental health had a lot of ups and downs and I can see those benefits finally starting to come, in teeny waves and I know the big waves will come later. \n\nBut it\u2019s almost like a nervous feeling to be at 30 days?? Like once I get through tonight, which I already have a plan for because I have a big morning tomorrow, and mark that 30 off my calendar in the morning and start day 31, it\u2019ll be like okay, now that\u2019s the *real* challenge. Now we really have to try. It\u2019s like I\u2019m suddenly feeling like 30 days was not a big deal (even though I know it was) and like..I don\u2019t even know how to articulate it. It\u2019s like the last 30 days feel \u201cfake\u201d or like a fog or like I had enough going on or enough of a positive outlook that I did it every day and now like I\u2019m looking toward the precipice of something completely different. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense and I still have all the positive feelings. I\u2019m going to go back to really pouring my positive energy into my goals. My work project this week. I may even be using this as a way to distract myself and procrastinate from things that feel overwhelming to get done. And I\u2019m going to go back to the one day at a time thing. I don\u2019t think that sentiment clicked with me as much before recently. \n\nSo here I am, just checking in to hold myself accountable and remember what I want. The memories of incredibly terribly mornings, shaky showers, throwing up and blaming it on \u201cdrainage from my allergies overnight,\u201d crippling heart pounding anxiety that lasted all day, constant interpersonal relationships struggles, hating the angry dark person I was becoming - those are still close enough in time to be viscerally present in my mind. I don\u2019t want that to go away. I feel like I HAVE to remember that in order to keep the way I feel so great about the way I feel in the mornings, so maybe like it\u2019s scary to think that I won\u2019t even think about it someday because then what if I let my guard down again? \n\nThe ups and downs may be difficult to manage but they aren\u2019t crippling and I don\u2019t feel out of my mind and disgusted with myself and pathetic. I feel strong and powerful and in control of my life again. 30 days is not my last day sober. This is a life change for good this time. But regardless, today is the day that matters. \n\nSo IWNWYTD! I haven\u2019t cleared 30 yet and today is the most important day in front of me.",

            "body": "This makes perfect sense to me. I am always so determined in the first few weeks, then the longer my sobriety stint, the weaker I get. I've got over four months under my belt this time, but came so close to drinking on Friday. Strong cravings put me on the edge of the proverbial cliff. Luckily, I had an emergency plan ready and put it in motion. I went to a meeting (not AA, a group session hosted by the org that runs the IOP I attended). Two hours later, I was committed to sobriety again. Let's stay strong together and IWNDWYT!",

I think around day 30 I was in a dangerous spot where I felt a lot better but hadn't yet built a life without alcohol.\n\n\nFor me, every craving got a little farther apart and a little easier to deal with. And I got better at wanting to drink and not doing it.\n\n\nSomething that really helped me was reasonable self indulgence. Watch the dumb TV! Eat the treat! Just as long as I wasn't drinking I was ok.",

            "body": "Hi!     I'll hit 30 days soon, too!\n I definitely feel a lot of what you're going through.  I've done 30 days every January, I've done months at a time before this time as well.  I set my goal for 30 days because it seemed extremely easy. I know ultimately the goal is forever, but that always seemed like a huge task in my mind.  I've definitely had the pink cloud I've heard mentioned here so I'm trying to remain positive but realistic.  I decided that after 30 I'm going to do another 30, and then another 30 and so on. The goal of \"just another 30\" seems much more obtainable than forever right now.  The relapse stories here help keep me in check as well because I know it'll never be just one drink.",
