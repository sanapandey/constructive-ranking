    "selftext": "I've got about three months of sobriety now and even though alcohol almost killed me at one point, I have these consistent thoughts of how much better my life was when I was drinking and how the problem \"wasn't that bad\" because I never got a DUI or got arrested or anything like that. In fact, the vast majority of my drinking memories are positive. It feels like my life got a lot worse after I quit drinking. My social life is basically dead and my mental health has been terrible since quitting.\n\nDoes anyone else have these thoughts since getting sober? What do you do to stay on track? ",
