    "selftext": "Like the title says, I broke my sobriety. It really freaking sucks. I hate myself for it in the moment and definitely regretting it now. This is a reminder to myself that it's never worth it. I hate the withdrawal shakes after, the sleeplessness, the hangover shits, the nausea, the messy house my drunk self doesn't care to clean up after, the lack of money. Nothing is ever positive. Not even in the moment.   \n  \nAll I can do is learn from this experience and take it one day at a time.  ",
