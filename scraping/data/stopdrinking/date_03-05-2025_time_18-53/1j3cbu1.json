    "selftext": "Hi sobernauts! I'm celebrating 2,500 hours of sobriety today as of 4am local time.  I'm creating this thread on the heels of my 100 day post.\n\nMy official start is midnight, November 20th (the beginning of the day) and I use this date to count time.\n\n'One day at a time' is the primary mindset for success, but I find it helpful to use frequent milestones to celebrate my progress, motivate myself, and stay engaged. Alongside traditional measures of time, I personally enjoy tracking the passage lunar cycles, solstices, and equinoxes.\n\nThese natural markers of time also give us a chance to set common goals regardless of our individual journeys.\n\n\nRecent Natural Milestones:\nFull Moon - February 12th\nNew Moon - February 27th\n\nUpcoming Natural Milestones:\nFull Moon - March 14th\nVernal Equinox - March 20th\n\nMy next goal is to complete the lunar cycle that began on February 12th and enjoy the full moon on March 14th with a clear head. Who's with me???\n\nHow do you measure your sobriety? There are ways that can be unrelated to time. Savings account goals? Odometer miles and oil changes? \n\nThink of the milestones that are important to you and share them here if you like. I'm curious to know.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

As for milestones I'm using the days of previous relapses so 34 was the last one I passed. 66 is the one I'm looking forward to and I've fashioned custom chip keychains for each to keep this achievement with me. I always congratulate people for the time frame they mention so congrats on 2,500 hours!",

It's a great way to keep you looking forward and get excited to reach that milestone!\n\nKeep up your great efforts! That is amazing!",

Humans have been tracking lunar cycles for millennia.\u00a0\n\n\nHours, weeks, and months are constructed to organize time for human society but don't have any natural significance. I count those too but they're not nearly as interesting to me : )",
