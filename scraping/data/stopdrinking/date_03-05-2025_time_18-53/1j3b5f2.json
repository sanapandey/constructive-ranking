    "selftext": "I stopped drinking on October 29, 2024, after a night that ended with me in the hospital\u2014no memory of what happened. I made it all the way to February 14, 2025, before I let myself believe the lie that moderation would be fine. Since then, I\u2019ve been drinking daily\u2014not bingeing, no blackouts\u2014but still feeling like I need alcohol every day.\n\nI\u2019m disappointed in myself, but I also know setbacks happen. So today, March 4, 2025, I\u2019m recommitting to a zero-alcohol lifestyle. I can\u2019t keep living like I have to drink to feel alive when, in reality, it makes me feel like I\u2019m slowly killing myself. Some people scoff when I say this, but I truly believe alcohol is poison\u2014no different from smoking or hard drugs. I need to keep reminding myself of that one night in the hospital so I can stay on the wagon.\n\nAddiction runs in my family, and you never think it\u2019ll happen to you\u2014until it does. I wouldn\u2019t call myself fully dependent, but I\u2019ve been relying on it daily, and I don\u2019t want to live like that anymore. Those sober months from October to February were some of the best I\u2019ve ever felt, and I need that back.\n\n#IWillNotDrinkWithYouToday",
