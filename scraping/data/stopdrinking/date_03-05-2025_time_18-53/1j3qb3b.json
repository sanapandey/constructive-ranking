    "selftext": "I\u2019ve heard that some therapists recommend age regression as a coping mechanism in response to trauma and stuff. Not the weird shit like pretending to be a baby and all that, but letting go of your adulthood for a bit and pretending you\u2019re still your old self, when you were happier.\n\nI started drinking regularly when I was 16 and I haven\u2019t turned back since. It was an instant addiction pretty much and in my mind I consider it the end of my childhood.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I spend the night (when I usually drink) surrounding myself with old video games/movies/hobbies that I enjoyed when I was a kid, it might make me regress back to a time when I found joy in things without needing alcohol. Does this sound weird? Has anyone tried this?",

One of the things I would do to help me get sober is to try and think back on those early days and see how it all started and try to figure out what was going on around me at that time because before I was just a kid then things started to blur and I feel like I've been half in the bag for decades as least. I'd think about all my friends from back then and where they're at now and if they still drink and they all do. Some of them are depressing as fuck and you can see that there's a darkness in their life that is just holding them back. I did manage to get sober with one of my best buddies growing up and we both talk about this all the time. We talk about how we lived with a lot of unnecessary trauma and that we had no one telling us maybe we shouldn't do this. We just went full tilt into life and that's the environment that awaited us. 25 years ago everyone drank and smoked and partied like lunatics every single fucking weekend. I don't think we had a choice in the grand scheme of it all so I can't really blame myself for all of this. All I can do is move forward from it and once you do it's like a giant gear that was stuck for so long gets unstuck and you go hard at life again but this time hope and love and success and the meat and potatoes of life are there waiting for you.",

Often associated with like, educated but still kinda douchey bros who wanna show off how smart they are so they cite DFW or IJ\u2026 which, so many other, BETTER books to chose from.\n\nBut, regardless, if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t give a fuck, read it. Take it with you everywhere and devote the time that massive son of a bitch requires.\n\nI\u2019ve read tons of literature on addiction, by addicts, about addicts, to addicts, by non-addicts writing incredibly one-dimensional, boring characters who\u2019s only motive is that they *are* addicts and use it as a means of character/plot development (I\u2019m looking at you Donna Tartt. *The Goldfinch* was such a letdown after *The Secret History*. Seriously gonna make every character a full on junkie that makes the absolute most insane decisions of all time because they\u2019re addicts\u2026)\n\nAnyway, *Infinite Jest* was the first time I read something that I just\u2026 there were times this summer when I was at a cafe or park and I just couldn\u2019t help myself. Laughing my ass off, or crying, or physically revolting. And from one addict to another we know, it can take a lot to shock us.\n\nI personally thought IJ was the greatest written document of all things drug addiction, 12-step programs, sober living facilities, traumatic memories due to our addictions, little idiosyncrasies of rehab/sober living that drive you fucking crazy. DFW knew what the fuck he was writing about.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace was like our fucking spokesperson back when ppl still just assumed we were shitty people with no self control. The ideas he has. The tangents he goes on\u2026 I reached out to sober friends of mine, shocked that in 2025 a book written 30 years ago is still *ahead of it\u2019s time* when it comes to addiction.\n\nSo yeah, as an addict or not an addict, someone who struggles with some type of mental health issue, read it. DFW was certainly one of us, and we unfortunately lost him to his demons. \n\nThere is a typically hilarious/tragic chapter where a *certain character* goes to what he believes is a trauma group and it\u2019s an age regression therapy session, which I\u2019m sure DFW took liberties with, but said character was *not* prepared for the unraveling he witnesses.\n\nI will forever associate age regression therapy (I honestly didn\u2019t even know it was real until this post) with that fantastic scene in an all-time best book.\n\nBe well.",

A lot of people over at r/decaf found that quitting caffeine substantially reduced alcohol/drug cravings while also bringing back how they felt when they were younger/kids. If you drink caffeine and you're curious, you can go read through some of the top posts over time for the long-term success stories. The most-recents are usually focused on withdrawals.\n\n*From my own experience:* I did some deep self-reflection on why I would crave alcohol so much yet feel so disappointed when I indulged. I realized I was drinking now because when I was in college (during the height of my addiction) it was always accompanied by and therefore became associated with exciting experiences with friends and living life with no care, like a kid. Now as an adult when I was lonely and missing that spark I would drink by myself hoping it would bring back that youthful state. But it never worked because it wasn't truly the alcohol I craved, I wanted the passion and excitement for things I had back then and have been missing for years now.\n\nI quit all alcohol for New Years (I was having a few drinks roughly every two weeks, then quitting for a month, then having a sip, etc.). I felt fine, no withdrawals just cravings. Then I quit all caffeine in February. The withdrawals from the caffeine have been rough but I'm starting to have a few hours a day where I actually get what they were talking about. Little waves of light shining through; the enthusiasm like I'm 14 again building a Minecraft castle.\n\nIf that sounds intriguing I encourage you to go give r/decaf a browse.

And honestly looking at your past is what therapy is all about, and the best way to look at it, to remember, is to kinda go back there in your mind, like you are talking about.\n\nExcessive drinking/alcoholism IS weird though, in the sense that it is a serious problem/trauma in and of itself, but it CAN BE a sign of, response to, or bring up problems/traumas of the past.\n\nYou said, \"I'm wondering if I spend the night (when I usually drink) surrounding myself with old video games/movies/hobbies that I enjoyed when I was a kid, it might make me regress back to a time when I found joy in things without needing alcohol.\u00a0\"\n\nSo, be prepared POSSIBLY for some strong, painful emotions, not just joy, if you are using this as a way to quit alcohol alone at night, the time when you are used to drinking (quitting can be a painful, hard thing to do), rather than as something you do for fun as you are quitting.  Quitting alone is... hard, so it could color that regression experience in negative ways, not just positive.\n\nYou really might want to do this kind of thing with the help of a therapist, or someone you  trust.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong.  Hope so, and I don't wanna scare you, cause it's a cool idea.  It wouldn't hurt to think of someone you can call, just in case though.\n\nSending good vibes your way.\n\nEDIT: or do it in addition to more traditional, supportive ways to quit drinking, like AA.  AA is not something anyone ever \"joins,\" by the way.  It's just a group of alcoholics who try to support each other.  I don't go anymore, unless I think I'm gonna drink, but it might be a perfect safety net for you in this cool experiment of yours.  I dunno know.",

            "body": "Interesting question!\n\nThrough both my major rounds of sobriety attempts, including this current one which stuck, I was doing DBT classes, and a big component of that was taking care of our nervous system and managing the feelings of distress that we feel even when we\u2019re not in unsafe situations. I learned about how people in active addiction often have an overactive fight-or-flight state which contributes to the feelings of unmanageable distress and emotional discomfort which cause us to need to check out. \n\nMy efforts were focused on taking care of my nervous system and, although I\u2019ve never been a parent and this may be a flawed analogy, I treated it like I was caring for a newborn baby. At the base level, I needed to keep my baby (aka me) fed and rested first, and comforted and entertained second. Meet the base needs and nurture from there. Sleep when you can. Go easy on yourself. Enjoy the small moments of peace and bonding. Focus on survival not perfection. You\u2019re a good parent just by keeping baby alive without a nip of whiskey to settle it.",

Tending to that young version of myself - especially the teen age where I started drinking- has been so helpful in healing and staying on track caring for myself in the here and now by not drinking. It\u2019s funny you bring this up though because I do find myself reconnecting with the things that brought me joy in childhood- nature, drawing, games, etc and I think not drinking really allows space for getting back to your joyful self.",

It wasn\u2019t the music itself that got me drinking, but it was everything it was couched in. Long nights in bars, sexual attention from being in a moderately successful band, free drinks and party favors as a \u201ctip\u201d for successful sets. It\u2019s extremely difficult to avoid those kinds of pressures, even at the level of recognition I had attained. So when I hung it up I decided I was going to stop gigging for a bit and get back to practicing. I\u2019m still in that indeterminate probation period but it\u2019s been immensely rewarding to allow myself the hyper-fixation that characterized my early days. Skill-wise I\u2019m actually getting out of the plateau I\u2019d been in during my drinking years! But also while running scales and rudiments it\u2019s become apparent how out of practice I\u2019ve become, which is extremely humbling and with an expectation of getting back to gigging, so I also started buying comic books, Lego sets and collectible action figures again to have low-pressure things to do and geek out about that never had anything to do with drinking. It\u2019s also expensive, so that\u2019s where my booze money\u2019s going lol.",
