Happened again last night and lost money at the casino - I can\u2019t sleep from feeling like shit from the drinks and just threw up. This is pretty normal for me but I don\u2019t want it to be normal. I have so much fun when I drink but the mornings after are the worst. I want to change. ",

One thing that I would always find is that alcohol would help in the moment but that stress would still linger, if not get worse by the morning. I\u2019d say the best advice I have is to break out of that habit. Try to cope with something else. Spoil yourself with things outside of alcohol and see if that can help. One day at a time.\nIWNDWYT",

It\u2019s hard because I feel like growing up there wasn\u2019t a class or anything that taught us healthy coping mechanisms - we then grow up and have access to things such as alcohol and drugs that easily takes that pain away however yes, it doesn\u2019t last and if anything it gets worse.

Changing how you feel without a substance requires action or mindfulness at a minimum, and that's often harder than it seems like it should be. Some people in sobriety might object to this statement, but I believe there is a sort of reality check involved: drinking is fun, and there's nothing quite like it. But that's ok, you start hanging out with drunk people while you're sober and you start to realize that it's pretty much only fun because your brain is halfway shutdown.\n\n\nExercise, diet, community, service to others, honesty with yourself and the people close to you, those are all good angles to look at.",

I\u2019ve recently learned that alcohol actually makes stress/anxiousness/anxiety worse.\n\nHave been doing research this time around and found the below which helps explain that with alcohol \u201cThe craving is not relieved by the drug you\u2019re addicted to, it is caused by it\u201d.\n\n\u201cDrinking alcohol dumps a flood of dopamine into the pleasure center of the brain. The feel-good chemical swirls through your head, but the rush only lasts for a short while (like 10 minutes short) . When dopamine levels dip back down, feelings of anxiety rebound. (hence the binging and inability to moderate).\n\nPeople who suffer from depression and anxiety are more likely to experience anxious feelings after drinking. Though alcohol can suppress anxious feelings while a person is imbibing, the rebound effect can be far worse than their baseline level of anxiety. Unfortunately, those uncomfortable emotions can drive people straight back to the culprit: alcohol.\u201c\n\nIWNDWYT",
