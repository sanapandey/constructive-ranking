    "selftext": "I\u2019m a mom of two young kids and have a full time job. Up until 46 days ago, I thought drinking helped relieve the stress of this pressure cooker. I was so wrong. The days are still long and sometimes I get grumpy, but I am enjoying parenting more than ever - sober. It\u2019s the little moments that I can enjoy more now - brushing out wet hair, driving them to their activities, nighttime snuggles and even brushing teeth (which is one of my least favorite things historically). \n\nI guess what I want to say for anyone reading this as a struggling or sober curious parent - booze was making it SO much harder, when I actually thought it was helping me cope. I\u2019m no longer irritable in the mornings, and I\u2019m not rushing to get them in bed so I can pour a drink. My kids deserve the version of me & I\u2019m thankful I can see that and commit to that now. \n\nBeyond grateful to this sub. Y\u2019all are the best and I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d be where I am without this support. \u2665\ufe0f to everyone on here just reading or posting and commenting. IWNDWYT",

Sometimes being present without actually being present. I don't miss those times not feeling present.   They deserve the best version of us!

I remember my dad out by the trash cans hiding his empties when I was young. The memory hit me one night as I realized I was doing the same thing. Have to break that cycle for my kids.",
