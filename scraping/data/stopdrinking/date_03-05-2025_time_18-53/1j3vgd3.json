    "selftext": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n- US - Night/Early Morning\n- Europe - Morning\n- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n---\n\nGood morning sober fam. Today I had planned on talking about self improvement after we quit prioritizing alcohol in our lives. Unfortunately, I had an unexpected and potentially life-changing conversation with my partner that has devastated me. In light of that, I thought it might help to shift gears.\n\nTerrible things are still going to happen to us when we're sober, and they may be some of the most stressful and tempting times to pick up the bottle again. What tools do you all have in your toolbox to keep that from happening? For those of you who have had to face down such devastating situations, what advice to you have for those of us going through it / those who will go through it one day?\n\nI'm incredibly thankful for this subreddit. The love and compassion you show here is amazing. \n\nI may not be able to reply as often as I have earlier in the week due to the circumstances, but I will do my best. Most of all, I will not drink with you today. Love you all. \ud83c\udf3b\u2764\ufe0f",

Turns out life, sober or not, doesn\u2019t need my help. I\u2019ve lost both parents, one husband, two dogs, many, many relatives and friends - and some of my dearest friends are dealing with life threatening illnesses right now. I\u2019ve stayed sober through it all. \n\nHere\u2019s what helped me: 1. The real life people of AA  and a willingness to accept all the help I can get. 2. My experience that drinking makes everything worse for me and when I\u2019m already suffering and in pain, the LAST thing I need is more pain. 3. Drinking is narcissistic, makes everything about me, and I become part of the problem not part of the solution. \n\nThe whole point of sobriety to me is that it\u2019s there when I need it!! I need a rock, a foundation, like the sun to rely on. Sobriety is this sun. \u2665\ufe0f IWNDWYT",

No, it's not that long, but what impressed me was the lack of cravings and how I was at peace with my alternative sober activities. It wasn\u2019t exactly a pink cloud, difficult stuff happened but my mindset was so right - \u201cwhat does this problem have to do with me not drinking, and how can drinking make it better?\u201d. My life revolved around sobriety and it was basically meeting friends for non-alcoholic activities once a week, sleeping whenever I wanted and binging TV shows. \\*It felt good, though. Peaceful.\\*\n\nIn the beginning of February, my life \u201creturned\u201d. I had been grieving my mum\u2019s death for years. I got \u2018out of it\u2019 and it was and still is amazing - I found my purpose, I wrote so much, I\u00a0got awards, I\u2019m getting published. I went from 0 to 100.\u00a0\n\nAlongside that, my desire for romance came back and then, problems. Anxiety, went back drinking. Got very sick from allergies, back to drinking.\n\nAnd now, even though I still rationally know everything I do about drinking, my mindset keeps changing. I don\u2019t see sobriety as such an important goal anymore. Sure, it\u2019s not black and white, it\u2019s not like I wanna increase my intake, say \u2018f\\*\\*\\* and be irresponsible. It\u2019s still \u2018not so bad\u2019, 1 and a \u00bd bottle of wine every 4 days, no irresponsible behaviour, but I don\u2019t want that.\u00a0\n\nI wanna be able to deal with love frustrations (or to stay away for a long time on purpose), to develop tools. It\u2019s not like they are great guys anyway, it\u2019s just that desire came back like a hurricane.\u00a0\n\nI feel vulnerable, not so resolute about not drinking and I wanna feel that resolute again.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nIWNDWYT - and 24 hrs is all I can promise today.",

I think my mind appreciates that something is written/recorded so it lets me out of the obsessive thought loop for a bit.

I was so so lost for those first few weeks. I leaned hard on my friends and my mom. When I was super upset, I'd talk to my grandma who passed. I know she could hear me somewhere. I drove around in my car, cried and screamed. I just let the feelings happen. When I was drinking, I was on the run from them constantly! Shit is still gonna hit the fan, so, whatever brings you comfort: DO THAT! Let yourself feel it all and then lean into your comfort, whatever that looks like.

When I was finally feeling capable of it, I\u2019d force myself outside to go for walks, knowing it would lift me up even of if I didn\u2019t initially feel like it, I\u2019d force myself to reach out to friends, I would come on the subreddit (I\u2019ve never had such support in my life), I would do everything I could to make myself just be and feel the feelings, but not get lost in the thoughts.. and damn, the feelings can be overwhelming, especially after numbing them for so long.

Heartbreak has always been my biggest trigger to relapse, and a row with a loved one or devastating news will have me using all I can from my sober toolkit! \ud83e\uddf0\ud83d\udee0 \n\nSome things I do: Deep breaths. Stop replaying the upset by thinking about something else (difficult but needed until I'm calm). Workout. Journal it out. Shower. Review my sober collection on Pinterest (supportive sayings and sober people who inspire me). And I come here to SD. Remember others I've connected with here, know that I'm not alone, reach out with comments or a post if needed, and dig deep. Hold on at all costs. This is important work we're doing! \n\nI'm sorry if it sounds lame but I'm so damn proud of each of us here! Getting and staying alcohol-free after we've lived with that oblivion is herculean but we can do hard things. We're badass sober warriors who have been through hell. Staying sober today! We got this.

I hope that your situation works itself out in beautiful ways. \n\nI have been through several of the most difficult times in my life since I quit drinking. They have challenged what I mean to myself, and what other people mean to me. I was talking with another friend on here, and we agreed that life keeps on throwing us curve balls no matter our situation. BUT - being sober has helped me weather those situations. I\u2019ve found that I have more strength than I knew. I am able to face a terrible eventuality with more calm and equanimity, being sober.\n\nI\u2019m not kidding, I\u2019ve definitely been tempted to just forget myself in a bottle for one night - but where would that lead? And would it improve anything at all?? No, resoundingly. So I stick to what I know. I don\u2019t drink and I take care of myself. \n\nHow I love you all! Let\u2019s stay strong together! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc9c\u2728",

She said \"WAIT. Just WAIT! Being impulsive gets you into trouble.\" She wasn't talking about drinking, she was talking about how my mother and I argue and was giving me a coping skill. I've applied this to drinking too. Just wait. Ride it out. The cravings will come and go. They aren't fun, but neither was drinking anymore. Some days I didn't even want to drink but I did anyway. That's how I knew it was coming to an end. I've been through some SH*T! A lot of sh*t, but as time goes by you just learn to deal with it and find little things to make you happy.\n\nIWNDWYT. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79",

I reminded myself that the only way through is through. Alcohol was avoidance for me. Postponing or absolute denial. All three are poison to facing the truth. \n\nThe truth is always a gift. Whether it\u2019s easy or not. Whether we like it or not. It\u2019s the straightest path between here and there. Lies and distortions are just bends on the journey that lengthen the time and distance to get to the same place. \n\nThat being said, please be gentle with yourself and take what you need as far as time. \n\nI sometimes need to stay in my pyjamas and just eat and distract while things work though the back of my head and then resolve myself to get back into the routine the next day with a shower and some fortified resolve of who I am and that I haven\u2019t come this far to come this far. \n\nYou are amazing. \n\nSending you love. \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f",

Quick check-ins also really helped me get through the beginnings of my tough time.\n\nJust remember whatever comes up for you-whether it\u2019s moments of clarity, waves of uncertainty, or just a need for rest-know that you don\u2019t have to have all the answers right now.

It has helped me know that no matter what, I am the only one who has consistently and constantly shown up for me for my whole life. Maybe sometimes I didn\u2019t show up enough, but this girl deserves self love because man has she kept showing up for me.\u00a0\n\nOne trick I learned when trying hard to learn self love and how to shut off how anxious and overwhelmed I would get about a partner or potential partner (still a work in progress) is that I will sing love songs, but I will straight up literally look in the mirror, look myself in the eyes and sing them to myself. It sounds weird probably but it really works for me, starts changing some woo woo thoughts in my head or something.\u00a0\n\nSending love and strength and a commitment not to drink with you today.

Still going to the gym and running to try and get down to at least 225. Looking forward to when my weight and my days sober overlap. Hoping it's closer to 250 than 270!",

Once I get into a 3rd, I'm probably going to want to polish off the 6 pack if I got that or drink a lot more. It was more out of not wanting to be seen without a beer at family functions while everyone else was drinking casually. But I've told my family that I don't drink anymore and everyone's really supportive and I'm just doing NAs now which I love. I just enjoy a cold beer while watching basketball/baseball/football, playing golf, grilling but don't want alcohol. I can still have that cold beer though, just without the booze.",
