My BP medicine was lowered from 40 mg to 10 mg in a matter of a few months last year after I stopped drinking. My pulse was typically in 90s and often low hundreds. Resting pulse now is in the 60-70s. Even after a workout I am in the 80s. Just plain miraculous.",

It would randomly peak around 1-2p almost daily, and I'd get all the symptoms of a panic attack but without any triggers or cause. \n\nPropanol helped me a TON at first - I would take daily to even it out. Last visit two weeks back - was mid 80s. Now I only take Propanol occasionally and as needed (interviews, speaking events) and it works like a charm. \n\nHearts much happier now. Go us \ud83d\udc9c",
