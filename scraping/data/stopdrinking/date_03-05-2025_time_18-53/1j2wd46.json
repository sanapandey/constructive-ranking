    "selftext": "This is hard. Lost my dad a number of years ago to alcoholism, multiple family members have dealt with unrelated blood pressure problems and heart failure, and I had made the choice a long time ago to dramatically cut back my daily wine habit to only with other people and not at home when this most recent birthday came around. I\u2019ve been sticking to it for the most part. Within just a couple of weeks I noticed that I no longer felt the urge to drink, didn\u2019t like feeling buzzed, and best of all the hangovers that drove me to keep drinking now motivate me to avoid it altogether. I\u2019m feeling good, I\u2019m hydrated, I\u2019m grounded, I\u2019m coping, I will get down to zero soon, I can feel it.\n\nOne of my relatives is losing his battle with his demons, bedridden in the hospital, facing a significant chance of losing his life in the next few months. This feels like the end. Even if he manages to change course and get help his body may not be able to give him that chance. When I got the call this weekend a very loud voice within me said THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO STOP DRINKING. KEEP GOING.\n\nI\u2019m now looking into online resources for support as I face saying goodbye to yet another loved one because of alcohol. As awful as things can get, alcohol will make it worse. \n\nIWNDWYT \u270a\ud83c\udffb",
