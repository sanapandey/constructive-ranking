    "selftext": "Have to brag on me for a minute. Made it through a work trip with lots of happy hours and dinners without a drop of alcohol! Work events are always a major trigger for me and I was really afraid of a relapse. While I can\u2019t say it was easy, necessarily, I ended up having a much better time overall. Once I got over the awkwardness of ordering club sodas with lime instead of cocktails, things got easier. I was so concerned what my colleagues would think and have realized THEY DON\u2019T CARE! Everyone is either too drunk or busy thinking about themselves to notice. It was so great not being hungover every day and I found that I was still able to be social and have some real conversations with people. I really thought I wasn\u2019t capable of doing this and am so proud of myself for keeping this commitment to myself. If you\u2019re struggling, hope someone reads this and takes away that it\u2019s possible to surprise yourself and things won\u2019t always be as hard as you think. Not losing sight of the fact that more challenges are ahead - not getting complacent or thinking it will be easy, just enjoying this moment for what it is. IWNDWYT!",

It's hard to stay strong against the social pressure but I've felt the same afterward.. that it was the right decision, that nobody cares, and that the experience is more fulfilling. I'm a little concerned that I'll face some pressure on an upcoming trip but I've handled it before so I know what to do. Just say, \"soda's good, thanks.\" IWNDWYT",
