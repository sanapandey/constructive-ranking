    "selftext": "Stopped drinking 71 days ago. I'm very happy with my decision and currently not close to drinking. I am also in sobriety counseling and individual therapy. I do not feel in danger. My question is- when will I start to feel better? I am sure I did damage to my hormones, but I am feeling general malaise and numbness. Is there a time period common to get your serotonin and stuff back to normal? ",

Those first few months were brutally HARD.  I felt like I was losing my mind as my demon-lizard brain would scream, \"*You know what would make you feel better??*\"  **UGGH!!!**  The obsession, preoccupation, anxiety, sadness, and anger was maddening!          \n\nThe thing is, I made a full and conscious decision to stop drinking, and maybe you have too.\n\nHere's what I know:          \nThe longtimers promised that if I kept with it, it would get better and easier.          \nI was desperate.  I wanted what they had.          \nI hung on\u2014sometimes barely by a thread\u2014with faith that what they were telling me was true.          \nI'm now here to tell you, \"Yes, it DOES get better and easier!\"  But again, unfortunately, it doesn't happen nearly as fast as we'd like it to. \n\nBelieving it will get better is a good start.  Hang in there!!  Don't quit until the miracle happens!",
