She said my wife found the receipt from Publix where I bought flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day. On the receipt was a 12 pack of beer. \n\nThat conversation with the babysitter made me realize that my wife could give two shits about flowers. She wants her husband back. She wants a good father to her kids. \n\nI have lost 7lbs in 7 days. I was present and patient with my kids this weekend. I was sober. I haven\u2019t used eye drops in a week. I have saved well over $200 not going to the gas station to buy IPAs and scratch off tickets.\n\nSure the weight loss, clear eyes and money saved are great. But the relationship with my wife hasn\u2019t magically changed. I know that will come with time. I have to keep focusing on myself right now. Keep my head up and focus on not drinking. My drinking problem has damaged my relationship with my wife and one week sober cannot fix the damage it has caused. \n\nLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s not too late to mend. \n\nDay 8 here we come.\n\nToday I will not drink.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "When i stopped drinking it did absolutely nothing to repair the damage I\u2019ve done in my past. I was a hider as well but I wasn\u2019t nearly as good at hiding it as I thought I was. I had similar routines to continue to drink even as I swore I was cutting back and it strained my marriage to say the least. It took more than a couple weeks of not drinking to start building back that trust and there weren\u2019t any words I could say that meant anything, it took actions. \n\nI\u2019ve been down that road before and I\u2019d always go back to drinking as soon as the heat was off of me. I can see now that my drinking was really just a symptom of what was going on with me and i needed help to start changing more about me than my beverage choices. I found out I wasn\u2019t alone and other alcoholics in recovery laid it all out for me. They gave me an outlet and provided support/ guidance. I just had to show up and stop pretending I knew it all myself. I can fully admit that I didn\u2019t have the patience or vocabulary to have a normal conversation about it all when I was first starting but I learned. I believe talking with other sober people preserved some of our marriage because I didn\u2019t have to bring all my alcohol shit back to the person who carried far too much already.\n\nI was able to make living amends instead of apologizing all the time. Those actions helped us get to a point of finding the willingness to work on it together. We uncovered a whole bunch of resentments, co-dependency, denial and other gnarly shit but it was stuff we were willing to work on together. There\u2019s no way I make it to that point on my own. It\u2019s been over 5 years since my last drink and things are good. My kids have a sober dad and my wife has a sober husband. I\u2019m still active in my recovery and my wife got involved with alanon. It helps with everything. Sobriety gave me the opportunity to repair the damage but I still had to take actions and do the work. Digging up my roots and separating fact from fiction in my own story has freed me up in a way I didn\u2019t think possible and I\u2019ve made some good friends along the way. Keep searching and working on it. You\u2019re not alone",

                                    "body": "My sentiments exactly. I tell people that if I kept going at the pace I was at when lockdown hit, I'd most likely be dead or on the streets. I would have been downing handles of cheap vodka. I would have ended up not caring about hiding it from my wife (then girlfriend) at some point, and she would have went back to her parents. At that point, I would have just drank myself into a deeper stupor until I eventually died alone and loaded in my bed. \n\nInstead, I had a binge on February 24th 2020 that wasn't any different than other ones I'd had. I slept through the first two hours of my graveyard shift and knew I was going to finally get caught being drunk on the job. I was throwing up black \"coffee grounds,\" and opened up to my supervisor who already knew I was going through it. That morning I went to the ER for the first time in my life. I sat there alone, cold, and watching Japanese television for three hours while I reflected on how I got there. I made the choice then to suck it up and go to an AA meeting. I was done feeling like this. I was discharged, went home to take a nap, then went to my first meeting at 6pm that night. There was literal magic in the air of that room. Everything clicked into place. I proceeded to attend a meeting every single day until around March 13th when the lockdowns started shutting things down. At that point I had a good enough foundation built that all I needed was for there to not be booze in the house. My wife was very supportive of me here. The rest is history, and I am writing this to you today having just celebrated five years away from the sauce. \n\nIn hindsight, I could have just told my job that I fell asleep on the job. I usually took a nap before anyways and could have said my alarm didn't go off. I'm glad I took it to heart and decided enough was enough. The lockdown saved me in many ways. \n\nAs for how the last few years have gone, I had to step away from a hobby I loved for a few years while I focused on staying sober. I played a lot of disc golf back then, but it had turned into my excuse to go get loaded. I'd drink a few tall boys on the course, buy a single serve box wine (the ones that have 3 glasses), chug that in the parking lot of my apartment before going upstairs to my wife, and then be able to drink more without her knowing I was already buzzed. She always knew. lol So I needed to stop playing for a bit while my brain reset. I'm back to playing now and am in love with the game again. After five years in, I have zero interest in going back to the booze. I really did not enjoy the buzz when I break it down. Everything in life is much better without the booze. Everything. \n\nI appreciate you asking! Let me know if there is ever anything I can do for you",

After meetings started getting closed and things got weirder it was hard to find balance between exposure risk and not doing enough for my sobriety. I felt like I was fucked either way but I\u2019d be extra fucked if I were still drinking. \n\nDecoupling activities with drinking for me is a never ending project. Most of the concerns are in my head tho. When I\u2019ve gone out to golf or hike or play music, etc. it\u2019s always been a blast. I just put soo many obstacles in my own way. Congrats on 5 years, that\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m still carrying my 5 year coin around with me in my pocket since last month. I don\u2019t usually do that but it feels good. \n\nI\u2019d say the biggest issue I have is relating to my drinking friends. I was  just with a few different groups over a long weekend a couple weeks ago and I fucking hate how all of them talk. I guess I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the \u201cno bullshit\u201d / direct way other alcoholics talk to each other. I felt like everyone was trying to impress everyone else about vacations they\u2019ve taken and complain about how  their spouses aren\u2019t like them. I guess that\u2019s how people talk but I\u2019m glad I can see my role in my resentments and work on something larger. I definitely do not want my spouse to be more like me. I can barely stand myself.",

I had to stop hanging out with my wife's friends for this reason. They'd all get hammered and then be the biggest pieces of shit to their spouses. I had to have a couple of serious conversations with my wife about how this made me feel. I did not like who she was when she was drunk. Granted, I was a handful when I was drinking, but I am over being around drunk, shitty people. She's a wonderful person and doesn't really drink anymore. She stopped hanging out with those people kind of naturally. Now we live 1000 miles away in a new place.",

Be patient with your family giving you their trust back. Accept that you've put yourself in this position and continue to improve. \n\nLastly, be selfish with your sobriety. Getting cleaned up for others is noble, but at the end of the day, you have to want it for yourself. Forget about quitting for anyone or anything. Quit because YOU want to quit. This was something that I internalized during this stint that helped put things into perspective. There is an old story that I relate this to. \n\n\"A man wanted to change the world, but first he needed to change his country. He wanted to change his country so he changed his community. He wanted to change his community so he changed his family. He wanted to change his family so he changed himself. Then, because he changed himself, he was able to change his family. He was able to change his family and now he could change his community. He was able to change his community so he changed his country. He was able to change his country, and finally, he was able to change the world.\" or something along those lines. \n\nDo this for you first and foremost. \n\nOh, and seek out external support with other recovering alcoholics. You gotta get around other people physically who can relate with you. Your support system can only do so much if they are not addicts/alcoholics themselves. \n\nGood luck friend.
