    "selftext": "I didn't think I would be saying that I was 8 days sober in a long time.fell off the wagon a while ago after 41 days and didn't feel happy while sober felt very numb. They switched me from naltrexone to antidepressants and I really don't care about the drinking anymore. Kind of forgot about it, I get the occasional urge to drink once and a while but go sit outside and have a smoke.I always felt happy drinking everyday heavy,but now the different meds are helping.still feel numb some days but so much better then before.\n\n-take care everyone",
