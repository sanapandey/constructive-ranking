I didn\u2019t do anything. I knocked out early, watching tv and drinking my peach Bellini sparking water. What a difference. It\u2019s reallllly realllly nice not having to stress over what I could have possibly done or said. I\u2019m going to keep on trying",

I usually remember pretty quickly that I didn't, but sometimes I'm panicked enough to check the hiding spot. Always a huge relief to realize I didn't drink, and just slept really well.",

Had champagne and went to take another drink of it and realized it was booze and thought about how I'd have to set back my ticker! \ud83d\ude02 It's funny now but I woke up in a panic. Feels great not to wake up with regrets\n\nIWNDWYT",

If you scroll you\u2019ll find similar posts, but where people really focus on being back in a bad headspace\u2014that\u2019s been me too on a few of these occasions, especially after dreams with alcohol in them. But it\u2019s really just a dream, just a moment, it passes and here we are sober. Which\u2026 really is nice.",
