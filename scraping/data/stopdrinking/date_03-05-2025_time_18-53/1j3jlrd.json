    "selftext": "That\u2019s all. Just day 2 again. I had a stressful job function 7 days ago and I caved. I didn\u2019t get drunk but I had 4 days of about 5 drinks a day throughout the day \u2026 felt gross and sluggish. Now starting all over again. I keep hitting 2 weeks. My job is extremely social and I\u2019m, well an introvert in some senses. I get over stimulated and alcohol had helped that. I\u2019m 44. I wish the world could normalize not having to be \u201con\u201d all the time. The problem is that in my circle of work associates \u2026 I\u2019m known now as the person to head and lead meetings. I hate public speaking. I just had always gotten through it by having a glass of wine at lunch before that 1pm meeting where I would talk for 30 min straight to a group of people. For me in particular, I mostly drank little bits at a time at work mostly to be \u201cmore social\u201d. The hours are were brutal. Sometimes 6am-8pm and having to be \u201con\u201d most of the time \u2026 I have switched companies and the demand is high still but much better. Whenever I have to do a 10 plus hour day \u2026 about 1/2 way in a few drinks sound great to keep my \u201cenergy /fake energy \u201c up\u2026. But it\u2019s fake. It\u2019s not real. I never have been one to \u201cgo out partying\u201d\u2026 it truly is to mask social anxiety and the pressure to always know what to do and how to lead at work primarily that triggers my drinking. Then I make the excuse that it\u2019s \u201cfor work afterall\u201d.  Just such a shitty cycle. I\u2019m on day 2. Anxious as heck. Damn anxiety. I\u2019m productive today for sure so that\u2019s good and eating healthy. I stuck with my pretty intense vitamin routine the 4 days I did drink but now adding back in lemon water, green juices and lean food \u2026. I hate drinking. IWDWYT.  ",

I know I\u2019ve used it to hide or run from my problems, but hadn\u2019t thought of that element before. I\u2019m back on day 1. One day at a time though!",

            "body": "Congrats on getting through a stressful week. I've definitely caved after one of those, or during. Many times. It seems like the older i get the less i can handle it. The consequences get worse but the motivation remains the same. With each passing year i have to get a little more intentional about not slipping up. That's not a bad thing. I'm 42. I want to be feeling good when I'm in my fifties not dragging around feeling foggy. I definitely relate to the social anxiety. I'm an introvert in a fairly social job as well, but i absolutely cannot drink while working so i save it all for after work and the weekend.\nWhich is not necessarily any better. \n\nHoping you have a peaceful, calm day of not drinking!",

Some people never lapse, some people have multiple and sustained relapses.\n\nI know it's hard, it's ok to feel bad. I find it's best to reflect on what happened leading up to the lapse so you can make a plan to recognize that behavior in the future and hopefully change the outcome.\n\nIWNDWYT",
