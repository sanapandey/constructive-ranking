I\u2019m walking through the airport just now and I pass the luggage shop and really LOOKED at the beautiful, expensive luggage sets. I saw them as these beautiful items that I never would have paid much attention to. Then I passed Brooks brothers and the same thing happened-glanced at the gorgeous outfits on the mannequins and thought \u201cwow-that\u2019s exquisite clothing.\u201d Then I passed the book shop and looked at all the books and notebooks and felt just..inspired. Am I crazy or do other experience this \u201cclear head\u201d feeling when they stop? I sound high. But I guess I\u2019m just high on life for the moment? (Until this comes crashing down around 4pm when my cravings are the worst..but fingers crossed this means my cravings will hopefully die down eventually..maybe this is the start. I hope so.) ",

Remembering that I felt that way even when the feeling seems so far away or like it doesn\u2019t exist helps me get through that \u201ccrash\u201d period where I everything seems so despondent. Like it helps me take myself out of the craving or disconnect from it slightly enough to see that they *will* decrease. I tell myself \u201clook at the way you saw this small thing differently. This is tangible evidence that your brain is healing and changing. You didn\u2019t see those things before and now you do. This means there is tangible evidence that this craving you are having now will start to feel different too someday soon.\u201d",
