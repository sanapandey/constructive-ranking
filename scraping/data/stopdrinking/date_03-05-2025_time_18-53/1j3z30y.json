    "selftext": "I took a big step today and reached out to my doctor for help after about 6 months of drinking again on and off. The experience was honestly amazing and she was so non-judgemental and helpful. Referred me to an addiction specialist, gave me a couple of prescriptions, recommended some supplements and immediately got my bloods done. Don't get me wrong, I'm petrified of the results and the damage I may have done but she made me feel so comfortable and... normal? Anyway, if anyone is on the fence about visiting their doctor please take this as a sign to do so \u2764\ufe0f",

Results weren\u2019t great, simple as that. Not terrible, just not great. I was clearly drinking too much and my body was strained. \n\nWhen I had another blood test 3 months later everything had started moving in the right direction. I was feeling better, looking better, and having empirical data to show improvement helped me no end. \n\nGood luck, you\u2019ve made a brilliant first step",
