    "selftext": "I recently went on a date with someone I have a history with, and it had been several years since we last saw each other. We decided to reconnect, and I thought it might be an opportunity to socialize since my sobriety is going well and I\u2019ve been a bit isolated. However, after the date, I felt drained and didn't experience the same sense of connection that I had felt when I was drinking with this person in the past. I wonder if this new version of me simply doesn't align with him because I'm not the same person I was back then. It makes me realize that I may have never truly felt a connection; perhaps the drinking was just masking that. \n\nDo you feel since quitting it helps you form deeper connections that are more authentic?",

Alcohol is a mask, a haze, a fog. Alcohol lies and says it's sexy, exciting, and mature. What booze really is is a con artist that takes your money and dignity.",

I listen to my intuition very carefully now. I\u2019m a different person and I\u2019m attracted to different qualities in people!  No need to regress, go forward. \ud83e\udd70",

When on dating apps (which suck) instead of swiping on any and every attractive woman I see, I am thinking a bit more about who I look to match/ connect with.  Even my music taste has shifted a bit. \n\nBest of luck in your search and just know that you being the best version of yourself is only going to help find others like minded and who will continue to bring the best out of you while you're doing that for them.",

I don't have un-authentic friends anymore. So I guess that's the same from a subtraction side of things. I just don't do much to add connections.",
