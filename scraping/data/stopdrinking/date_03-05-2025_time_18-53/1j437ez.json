I\u2019m currently not doing AA or any recovery groups, just listening to a lot of podcast on alcoholism and coping techniques as well as utilizing this platform but nothing \u201cofficial\u201d. I do exercise daily. Try to get outside and walk daily as well as eating well and supplementing  appropriately, but is this doing the work? Is there something else I should be doing? I am not religious and honestly I have 0 sober friends, and have just moved to a new state so kind of a little lost with the next step to maintaining sobriety. ",

Neural pathways are carved in our brains and a person who would not be diagnosed with a alcohol use disorder still has a \u201chabit\u201d or addiction to alcohol, or nicotine, or many other substances that are addictive. It is not to say that a person addicted to alcohol is free of accountability and responsibility for their actions. But I think it is important to know what science says about alcohol. It is an addictive substance. It is not just about physical withdrawals.\u00a0",

Sobriety is deeper than that for me so doing the work was about digging deep and cleaning out the garbage and letting go of shit I didn\u2019t need to hold onto. I didn\u2019t know how to do that on my own so I found people who have been there and asked for help. It started a process of separating fact from fiction, seeing my own role in my resentments, and repairing the damage in my past. I never expected I would be a 12 step person or have anything to do with AA but it helped clean my life up and I\u2019m grateful for the work I\u2019ve been able to do. It\u2019s not the only game out there tho. There\u2019s lots of ways to do recovery work and lots of groups, ideas and even worksheets available online. My sponsor has an educational background and when he showed up with photocopies of worksheets with blank spaces to fill out, I almost walked directly into traffic. But I fucking love those things. They helped organize the mess in my head and got me to start dealing with just the facts, my role and what happened. A pattern emerged quickly and now I can continue to work on stuff that comes up because I have a foundation of work to rely on. None of it matters if I drink so the real work is to not fucking drink today.",
