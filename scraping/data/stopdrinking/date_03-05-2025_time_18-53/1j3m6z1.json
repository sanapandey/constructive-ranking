I am NOT asking for medical advice. \n\n24(f) and had been in pretty active alcoholism for ~2yrs (started off as weekend binging, slowly started drinking everyday, then I the past year I was binge drinking most days) any ways, my hair is definitely thinning I\u2019m not sure if on top or everywhere but I lose a lot of hair in the shower. \n\nI am 9 days sober today trying to fix my wrongs and be a healthier person. I feel so bad that I wrecked my body these past 2 years. I\u2019ve gained 10 pounds and am losing my hair\n\nHas anyone else experienced hair loss due to alcoholism and did it ever get better ?\n",
