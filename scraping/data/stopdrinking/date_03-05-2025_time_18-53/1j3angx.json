    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been drinking way less than my usual (ignore my badge).  Maybe 3 times a week instead of 7, and less quantity. I drank yesterday. Not a lot. I remember the whole night. I didn\u2019t do or say anything stupid. But I woke up at 3 am with raging anxiety and it made me so mad I dumped nearly 1.75 L of liquor down the drain in the middle of the night. I know from my past that if it\u2019s in the house, I\u2019ll drink it. If it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t really think about it because I know it\u2019s not there and I\u2019m too lazy to drive to the Liquor Store \ud83e\udd23 I\u2019m just sick of waking up with anxiety and then going to work with it all day. I\u2019m a teacher and can\u2019t really call in sick last minute (which is probably a good thing) but today is a 12 hour work day for me and I\u2019m just MAD at myself. Drinking didn\u2019t even make my evening more enjoyable. Anyway, I\u2019m rambling now but my longest streak is 5 days. I\u2019m going to go for 7 and then hopefully just keep going after that. I guess I\u2019m just posting to vent and for some accountability. I\u2019m excited to wake up anxiety-free tomorrow. IWNDWYT. ",

But having no alcohol in the house (plus nothing special to drink it from) means I can't drink impulsively.\u00a0\n\n\nMy home is also candy-free. I have type 2 diabetes and use insulin. Same deal. There is nothing stopping me from going to the store for candy. But I never have.\u00a0",

After doing double digits I was hooked and it became more about habits/putting myself in the correct situations rather than cravings. Good luck!",
