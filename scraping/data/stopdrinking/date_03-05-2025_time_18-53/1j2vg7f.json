    "selftext": "I\u2019ve spent the better part of today reading through posts on this page and have decided to finally commit to my sobriety. \n\nOver the last few years I\u2019ve taken multiple breaks from drinking, usually lasting a few weeks at a time. Each time I start feeling significantly better after just a few days, and so many aspects of my life benefit from it. My performance at work is better, my sleep gets better, I even feel like my humor is funnier. I eventually get to a point where I feel like I have a better understanding of my relationship with alcohol and will allow myself a drink or two at an event, which quickly becomes a drink or two after work, then excessive drinks on a Friday because \u201cit\u2019s the weekend!\u201d and then it\u2019s back to where I started \u2014 waking up with a hangover on a random Wednesday morning, late to work, hating myself for being unable to remember how many shots I took last night in secret, and falling back into the trap I thought I escaped. \n\nLast month I went through the cycle again and decided I wanted to take a break. I took it a step further and got a script for naltrexone, started taking kudzu root and l-glutamine, and was dry for about a week. Then it started up again. Slowly at first, and then last night I got into a fight with my partner that I just know I started. This morning I knew I made a mistake but shamefully couldn\u2019t remember what I even said or did to genuinely apologize. I\u2019m coming to the realization that there is no \u201chealthy relationship\u201d with alcohol, and I\u2019m ready to cut it out of my life for good. \n\nI\u2019m feeling nervous, very scared, but I know it\u2019s different this time because in all the emotions there\u2019s excitement. And it\u2019s largely from reading all the stories and support in this page. I feel like even if I don\u2019t have the support from friends or family, I can find it just scrolling through this page, and that\u2019s something I didn\u2019t have before. It\u2019s only day 1, but I\u2019m determined to make this the last time I have to start counting. ",

I didn\u2019t ask for it, but ended up with an accountability partner, which is really helpful. I\u2019ve also been very vocal with those closest to me that I\u2019m choosing to stop drinking. I\u2019ve turned to herbal supplements like kava and ashwaganda to keep drinks interesting. I picked up journaling to help with reminders for why I\u2019m doing this and what I\u2019m experiencing, being extra particular with the positive emotions as they come, so I can reread them when the hard times test me. So far that\u2019s it!",
