    "selftext": "I haven't had a drink since Feb. 28. I have gained at least 20 pounds just from drinking IPAs and Margaritas in the last several years. I decided to stem the tide for my health. I can't tell you the last time I went 4 days without drinking. It feels just weird.\n\nI'm really not feeling cravings, but I'm noticing I've been very irritable and angry in the last 24 hours and all of today. Part of it is that I've been sick 9 days with chest cold and I simply want to feel better, but is it normal to have an increase in anger when you begin sobriety? How long does it last?\n\nI recognize that in the past I would drink to dissociate from this discomfort, but I want to sit with these feelings. \n\nI'm grateful to have found this community. It's inspiring to read everyone's shares. Thanks! IWNDWYT.",

It's great to hear that you're sitting in those emotions and feeling them, however, you need to let them out eventually but in a healthy manner. I found that journaling has been the best way for me to manage and understand my emotions, so maybe it'll be helpful for you too!\n\nAim for about 5 minutes a day and see how that goes for you. \n\nI hope this helps a bit! You can do this! :)",
