    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI\u2019m feeling really anxious about my upcoming birthday and could use some advice. I\u2019ve been working on having a healthier relationship with alcohol, and as part of that, I no longer feel comfortable in bars or clubs. The problem is, before I started my sobriety journey (I\u2019ve had one slip since January), I\u2019d already set up a birthday group chat with the intention of planning a big night out. Now I feel stuck because I don\u2019t want to do that anymore, but I also don\u2019t want to disappoint people or make it a whole thing.\n\nI\u2019ve decided to change my plans to something smaller and more in line with where I\u2019m at, but I\u2019m worried about how my friends will react. A lot of them still enjoy drinking, and I don\u2019t want to seem boring or like I\u2019m judging anyone. At the same time, I know I need to prioritise what\u2019s best for me.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you navigate changing plans or setting new boundaries around drinking without making it awkward? \n\nAny advice would be massively appreciated!",

If my health, i.e. sobriety, is not important to them then they are not important to me. Full stop.\n\nSo what would I do if i were you? I'd tell my mates that at this point in my sobriety recovery journey I am not comfortable around alcohol. I would ask for their understanding and help. I would invite them over for pizza and a movie and some games like Scrabble or Pictionary. Explain how helpful this fellowship will be to my recovery health and how much I want them to be a part of my life and how right now I am feeling scared and vulnerable, so their understanding is appreciated deeply. \n\nBirthdays do not have to be a massive blowout. Real friends know this. \n\nIWNDWYT and Happy Birthday. Sobriety is a great gift!",

Your TRUE friends will be down for whatever you want to do, and there will be no judgment or perception of judgment present. I promise.\n\nHappy [almost] birthday. You're giving yourself a great gift. You've got this. IWNDWYT! \ud83e\udd0d",
