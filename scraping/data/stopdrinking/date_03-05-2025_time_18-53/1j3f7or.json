    "selftext": "Today marks one week since I quit. I had been hungover or drunk for 25 years (I turn 50 in June). I averaged 15 beers a night for the last 20 of those sometimes drinking up to 25 beers in 24 hours. I've always held jobs, raised 5 kids and kept on trucking despite being horribly hung over every day. I've had the goal of giving up the booze (and smokes) by my 50th birthday. With the exception of the first three nights I've found it to be easier than I thought it was going to be not that it's easy. I'm motivated to be done with it for good. I realized I don't know what it's like to be an adult without being influenced by alcohol and I want to see what that looks like. I want to understand what I'm capable of without hurting every day. My partner turned me on to this site and I'm grateful for that. We are all struggling or have struggled with similar issues around alcohol. I appreciate you all's input. It's been helpful. \n\nI'm going to keep on trucking and I hope you do too. ",
