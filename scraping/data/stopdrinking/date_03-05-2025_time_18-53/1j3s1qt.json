Alcohol depletes our body of sooo much nutrients, more than just dehydration or blood sugar, but much more than we realize. I recommend implementing a vitamin into your routine for a little while as well as it can make a hell of a difference, but it sounds like either way it's onwards and upwards and I'm glad you're feeling better!
