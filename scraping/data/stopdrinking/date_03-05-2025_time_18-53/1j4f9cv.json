I\u2019m testing myself for a month to be sober and the fact that it\u2019s so hard to stick to it really, really scares me even if I only have a few drinks every few days. I just want to stop ",

I would go a few days and then it would be like, \"I feel good, I can't have a problem if I can go a few days without drinking, why am I even depriving myself like this anyway?\" I think at that point I knew I \"should\" stop theoretically, but mostly I was running away from the hangovers, so once those were gone it was hard to abstain.",

            "body": "That day 4 struggle is so common. It\u2019s often the day alcohol has been out of your system for a while, so you\u2019re starting to feel better, your brain forgets the pain of drinking, and all the regular triggers are still there, so it pulls you back in. That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want to quit\u2014it just means your brain is still wired to expect alcohol as part of the cycle.   \n  \nI wonder if instead of saying \u201cI\u2019m testing myself\u201d say, \u201cI\u2019m choosing this.\u201d If you frame it as a willpower test, it will feel like a constant struggle. But if you see it as a decision to create something better for yourself, it becomes an act of self-care, not restriction.   \nand talking about willpower - What if you shifted your focus from trying to white-knuckle through cravings to getting curious about them? Instead of thinking, \"I want a drink so badly,\" try asking yourself, \"What do I think that drink will do for me right now?\" Is it stress relief? A way to unwind? A distraction? And then, what else could give you that same feeling?   \nAnd just remember\u2014alcohol doesn\u2019t actually make life better. It just numbs discomfort temporarily and then hands you a bigger bill later. You can break this pattern. Keep going, keep learning, and be so kind to yourself in the process. You got this!",
