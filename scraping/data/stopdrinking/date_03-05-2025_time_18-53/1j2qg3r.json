    "selftext": "I feel like the first 30 days went pretty smooth minus the first week of constant cravings. But now that I\u2019ve hit a month I feel like every single day I\u2019m trying to talk myself into celebrating that I\u2019ve made it this long\u2026\n\nnot really sure if I\u2019m looking for advice or just asking if anybody else has been in my shoes? I expected it to continuously get easier, but it definitely isn\u2019t. This week has been the hardest week yet. \n\nOn the bright side, my fitness level has skyrocketed in my sleep is finally leveled out. So for today I will not drink you. ",

But then when you achieve it you think \u201coh shit,  ow I need to keep doing this? Forever?\u201d And enough time has passed that you maybe start to romanticise drinking and think \u201cI wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d\n\nBut it got better, for me at least.\n\nBy the way, I know what you mean about talking yourself into celebrating but for what it\u2019s worth\u2026 I read your post and I\u2019m not celebrating your achievement. What you\u2019ve done is well worth a celebration.\n\nIWNDWYT",

Keep pushing, it gets easier again and comes and goes, the last 20 days since then have flown by now and I've honestly stopped counting. I still think about it and check in daily, but the hard days are further apart now. \n\nI compared it to learning to drive, for me. The first few weeks I concentrated sooo hard on working the pedals, the gears, reading the road, buttons etc that I didn't really have many mistakes because making the car drive was my sole focus. Then after I got the hang of the \"tricky part\" I started having to think less about all of that and that's when I'd start to have a few mess up moments, stalled the car etc but I carried on regardless, focused a bit more when I needed to and didn't just get out and give up.",

That means you can drink again and maintain control over it\". I have to keep telling myself no. Why throw away all this work? Why jump strait onto the slippery slope of addiction? Hell, the more I think about it, the more I realize it will be harder to control my habit after I start again than it is to just abstain from it altogether.",
