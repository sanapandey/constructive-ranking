    "selftext": "I've been thinking about this a lot. Before I became a massive alcoholic I used to deal with my problems head on. Sure, I'd get massive anxiety but I would always come through. Now, every time I even have the slightest challenge or inconvenience in my life I take a drink to cope with it. It astounds me how cowardly I've become.\n\n  \n",

Then I tried working on the problems, but the drinking dehabilitated me, so I kept drinking and was stuck in a vicious cycle, where I'd always find reasons to drink.\nOnce I found the courage and support to stop drinking, I could start thinking about the problems again, wouldn't be for a few more months till I could start working on solving the issues. One thing I realised was the stress never went away, but without the drink, I could deal with it and put it aside and concentrate on the problem at hand. As we say here often, there is no problem that alcohol cannot worsen. It's been a little over 6 months for me, and now I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, so I certainly won't go back to creating a mountain of trouble again.\nTake it a day at a time friend, it works and you're worth it.",

I hope you\u2019re able to find some solutions and move towards a better place.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",

One of my early mantras was alcohol never, ever made any of my problems better or made me better able to deal with said problems. Ever. Once sober I could do little baby steps of working on the big pile of shit my life had become. And with little successes I actually felt proud. Hope you come to this sub often - I lived here my first couple of months. IWNDWYT \ud83e\udd8b\u2665\ufe0f",
