    "selftext": "So. Got real sick a long time. Didn\u2019t get good health care. Got dumped by ERs for being a drunk.\n\nI had d3compensated cirrhosis. I entered the er with a hemoglobin of 5.8 and a BAC of .39. They saved me, banded my esophagus, medical assisted detox. I mumbled and shook and cursed the hidden cameras and microphones and vowed I would never feel that way ever again. I thanked the staff profusely. For treating me like a suffering human. I barely remember any of it. I was ok sort of I think after for a week or so.\n\nI was trying to garden again. Next day during the debates\u2026.\n\nI woke up and they are yelling squeeze my right hand if you can hear me! And I\u2019m like\u2026. Shit this is bad. I squeeze. And they say squeeze the right! I squeeze. Good they say. Now open your eyes for me. I opened my eyes saw the er room and immediately left my body and went to interstellar space.\n\nI was in a coma for a week and a half. Hemoglobin was 5.5 on admittance. I had vomited 1.5 liters of straight blood. I was at immediate risk of death. They poured so many units of blood into me I can\u2019t even understand. There were so many antibiotics they were crisscrossed across my arm going into my iv port. My blood pressure crashed.a lot. My hemoglobin crashed a lots more blood units. More antibiotics. I came out of the coma in stages. I didn\u2019t know who I was. I was in pain. The nurse was cleansing my sinuses because of infection and it was painful. I couldn\u2019t move. I was just that weak. I didn\u2019t understand any of it but I decided to jist trust in animal sort of way. I came out of the coma intubated. I was restrained. My first thought was escape. My friend was there. I couldn\u2019t believe she betrayed me. They finally took the tube out.\n\n1234 this is fuck8 g class war was the first thing I said.\n\nThey asked me what year it was and I said 1996. They looked sad, so I tried again and they said closer. My friend asserted that my commitment to class war was proof that I was still there.\n\nI don remember a lot at the hospital. It all blurs now, people took me for walks. The end of life people came a lot. I knew I was in a lot of trouble, the drs never gave me solid answers. They moved me from icu but I crashed again the next morning, bad. Bleeding out again I was rushed into emergency esophageal banding and TIPS. No blueberry muffin. I cried. I thanked the \u201clittle drs.\u201d Who often me onto the stretcher to Ive me. \n\nI\u2019m 8 months sober from alcohol today. I struggle with massive up\u2019s and downs. I was on oxygen. Things were super hard. I kept falling. I fade off into a trance frequently. My brain jist collapses and I start wobbling and my head starts lolling until I snap out of it. But I\u2019m 8 months sober.\n\nThere is no safe amount of alcohol today consume . It is a solvent best used for sterilization or extractions.\n\nPlease. I beg you. Do not wake up with a tube up your butt spraying lactulose everywhere. Drink8 glactulose is beyond disgusting and I have to drink it 4 times a day? Think you can take shots? Line up some lactulose with me. You pull shit yourself. No kidding.\n\nIWNDWYT\n\nTo everyone struggling today. You can do this. If you find it hard to do it for yourself. Do it for me as a favor to me please. A random person who is lucky to be able to type this today.",

He\u2019s in a hospital right now, restrained and intubated, bright yellow and getting dialysis daily in the hopes that getting levels sorted out in his body will make him coherent because he has no idea where he is or what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re just praying every day that he\u2019ll come through.\n\nThank you for sharing. Not sure how much his experiences matches yours, but if anything this sorta gives me a little insight as to what could be going on in his head right now. \n\nIWNDWYT.",

Not only can you not communicate because you have some plastic tube going down your throat, but you can't move your arms or legs and completely feel helpless. Every time I tried to swallow my saliva, tears would roll down from my eyes. Not sure if it was from discomfort or just sadness because I knew that drinking had put me in that situation. \n\nThe good news is that is in the past and I have the choice to never go back to that again as long as I don't pick up that first drink. \n\nIWNDWYT",
