    "selftext": "I read from others how alcohol robs them of time to be able to do the things they want to be doing with their lives, and I agreed.  I read about how boring early sobriety is because you're stuck with all this free time and no activity to fill it, and I agreed.\n\nI thought I appreciated those things in my own life, but I didn't really get it until just now.\n\nIn trying to figure out what to do with my life, I have been meandering through Stoicism and Buddhism.  The stoics do a lot of journaling, and the suggestion came to me to journal every night--just to reflect on the day.  I knew I couldn't set up an evening routine because my evenings are for spontaneous fun and activities.\n\nHaha--that is 100% not true and has not been true for many years.  My evenings used to be filled with drinking and tv watching or doom scrolling.  Anything that didn't require me to think properly, because I wasn't able to.\n\nAfter over a month sober, alcohol is still robbing me of half of my day just out of habit.  Now my late afternoons and evenings are just boring.  I'm a morning person, I just am not productive later in the day, right?  I internalized that for so long that it's become a habit.\n\nI just realized that those things I've told myself aren't inherently true about me.  I was tipsy and stupid from 3pm until bed.  That's why I haven't done anything useful in the evenings for over a decade.  I'll always be a morning person--but starting now, I'm not shutting down halfway through the day.\n\nIt'll take time and effort to change the habits I've created, but truly understanding where they come from will help--it has to.  I'll start with 5 minutes of journaling tonight and go from there.",

            "body": "We're very similar with the journaling, Stoicism and Buddhism interests. I've been journaling for years and the way I do it now is to come here first thing then review yesterday's journal before writing today's entry. 15 minutes seems to be enough time while not going too long. Buddhist meditation figures in well as it can surface some things that go easily into future writings. The process has evolved and that's been interesting in its own right but ultimately it's led to a lot better understanding of how I operate and what I find meaningful in life.",

I think it was Buddhism's and Stoicism's way of allowing introspection and seeing the world for what it really is that finally brought me here to end my dysfunctional relationship with alcohol when I couldn't bring myself to get here before.\n\nGlad you're here too!",
