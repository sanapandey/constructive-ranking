I was in a similar thought pattern when I first dabbled with sobriety but I\u2019ve since learned there is a big difference between clean time and sobriety for me. I can\u2019t say I felt better when all I changed was the liquids I drank. I actually felt much worse and I resented pretty much everyone and everything because I felt like I had it much worse. I was the ultimate victim in my own mind and I grew tired of faking it. I went back to drinking with predictable results but it got much worse in a shorter amount of time. I don\u2019t think relapse is necessary for sobriety but it\u2019s pretty fucking common. I guess I needed to be beaten to a pulp before I was willing to listen. It doesn\u2019t have to go that way but I\u2019ve never been one to take the easy route. I\u2019ve heard some people call it the gift of desperation. For me, it was about accepting that I have shit ideas about sobriety and i could use some help understanding what that actually means.\n\nClean time was just the time in between drinks for me. I got clean a several times  in the past for other people, doctors, courts, partners and family members, etc. but i always went back because I didn\u2019t change very much about me. Sobriety, on the other hand, is a change of everything for me and it\u2019s something I do for myself. I haven\u2019t had a drink in 5 years but I was pretty far from sober for at least half that time. I used to shit on sobriety too but the truth for me was that I hadn\u2019t really ever experienced it. I had to get to that point of willingness to work on it on my own just like everyone else I\u2019ve ever met in recovery. I believe I needed every last drop of alcohol I\u2019ve ever \ndrank in order to understand that it\u2019s not for me. I know first hand there isn\u2019t much anyone can say or do to convince someone who doesn\u2019t want it so good luck and know you\u2019re not alone if you ever want to come back.",

Things were beyond bleak, it\u2019s the only time in my life that I\u2019ve ever wanted to die. And one day during it I realized I had zero desire to drink, and hadn\u2019t for a long time.\n\nSide topic- I did get through it: changed careers, adjusted the antidepressants, leaned into my relationship and worked through what other stuff I could, which all helped a little. It turned out to be perimenopause and was fixed by HRT in about 2 weeks after 2.5 years of feeling absolutely dead inside. Had no idea that was even a thing.\n\nSo on that note- if anyone reading has hit a wall, don\u2019t be afraid to see a doctor. It could be something completely unexpected.",

The precepts align well with sobriety because they\u2019re not commandments but guidelines to explore for yourself\u2014just like recovery. The precept against intoxicants isn\u2019t about blind obedience; it\u2019s an invitation to see how substances affect your mind and well-being. It asks, Does this lead to suffering or clarity? instead of just saying, Don\u2019t do it. The same goes for truthfulness, non-harming, and mindful relationships\u2014all crucial in sobriety. It\u2019s about direct experience: you don\u2019t take their word for it; you live it and see the truth for yourself.",

It\u2019s only been _in the last 2 months_ but a shift has occurred where I really do connect on a level with my friends and others in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before. Now, in almost every interaction with people I feel present, engaged, honest, true-to-myself, and genuinely interested in them, as people. It feels bad to say that because I realize how preoccupied I was before, but I forgive myself. It was a real mess with the anxiety and the alcohol. \n\nIt\u2019s true I never get drunken euphoria, and sometimes I am a bit nostalgic for that quick, intense hit of elation, as you accurately describe it. But what I have now is so much richer, deeper and novel (to me) that it makes it much easier. The elation is a poor facsimile of the real connection. \n\nI hope you find this thing too, I think you might.",

But it's just how the universe is right now.  \n\nMost things are unpredictable, everchanging, and we are all on our own journey here. \n\nI've come to accept that nearly every aspect of life is out of my control, and the only true thing in my control is my actions in the world. Everything else that happens is just sensory information given to me from my body to decide what to do next.  Drinking for me just adds my actions to the list of things I don't have control over anymore.   \n\nAnd when I was drinking, my suicide idealation only got worse.  Sure, I'd feel amazing after several drinks.  But by the end of the night and the next day, I'd feel even worse.  Staying sober gives me the best shot I have at living my life the way I want to live it regardless of the world I live in.  \n\nThis community is always here when you're ready to come back, whether it's tomorrow or years from now.
