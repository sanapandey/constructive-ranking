It\u2019s a diuretic, etc. etc.\n\nBut yeah: I looked at my feet today and said \u201cWhat the hell ?!\u201d Because as an almost 50-year-old, I had noticed my feet getting progressively dryer and cracked over the last several years.\n\nI simply never connected it to alcohol. \n\nWow. That\u2019s pretty mind blowing for me actually.\n\n\ud83d\ude2e \n\nWhat are some other things did you were surprised to see improve after you stopping drinking?  ",

I\u2019m always colder than she is, wearing more clothes in the house etc. \n\nI see now that without my body constantly churning away to process alcohol. I run cooler. It makes sense!

I'm very hygienic, the rest of my body smelt fine, it's just my feet were gross. I tried all kinds of things; different socks, different shoes, alternating shoes after a few hours, going bare foot when I could, anti-perspirants, powders, multiple showers a day, footbaths, everything I could think of. And then a few weeks ago I randomly noticed my socks didn't stink at the end of the day and I can't think of anything else in my life/diet that has changed other than I don't drink anymore. I know alcohol affects people in different ways and I just figure that was some weird side effect that I had. Makes me laugh how many different things I tried to remedy the problem without actually solving the problem.",
