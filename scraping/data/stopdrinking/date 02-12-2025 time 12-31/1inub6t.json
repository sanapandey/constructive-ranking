    "selftext": "Seen quite a few messages on here lately about starting on the sober journey. I want to reply to as many as possible... but too many, so hopefully a few asking for advice will see this. \n\nI'm not going to lie... it's not easy to begin with. And there are days when all I want to do is drink. There are days when the desire to drink consumes me.. \n\nBut because I know I don't want to drink anymore I get through them.\n\nAnd I'm finding it's getting easier. Once I let go and I now say \"I don't drink\" it's like a huge relief. \n\nI have to check into my journal of reasons why, now & then. I have to re-read passages of 30 days to sobriety or alen carr... I listen to podcasts and other people's journeys.  I read posts on here for inspiration.  \n\nAnd I'm so happy not to be drinking. My life is better.  Taking alcohol away has only improved it. My fears of losing friends, my social life etc were not met. In fact I've got a better social life now than I have for years (definitely less time alone in dives, pubs, parks etc drinking) \n\nAfter 25 + years of being an alcoholic, I never thought I would be able to stop. But with belief, hard work, a lot of honest conversations and tears, I did it. If I can then you can. \n\n",

I\u2019m sure they come and go but I have to assume it\u2019s easier or at least be hopeful. I\u2019m on day three and keep coming back to say three and four thinking I have a hold on drinking. I\u2019m trying to commit to just thirty days this time and then go from there. Each time I say I\u2019m never drinking again, I just get down hearing cravings stay this way. IWNDWYT",
