It tries to tempt me with \"Just one drink\" or \"You've shown you're under control, you can moderate.\"  \n\nI can't moderate and I won't.  I know that I'll have all the drinks after that first one.  I can't resist that second drink, but I can resist the first one.\n\nBest wishes, friend.  I will not drink with you today.",
