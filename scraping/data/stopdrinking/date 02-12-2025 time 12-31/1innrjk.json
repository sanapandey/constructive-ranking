In my early 30s and family doctor bluntly warned me if I don't stop I would ultimately need a liver transplant.\nI'm on a week now exactly since my last drink. The first few nights were an ordeal but I've finally acclimated and I'm hoping I can keep this going.\n\nDon't take your body for granted. It's frankly miraculous how much it takes to keep us conscious every day, and how fragile it is.",

I'm sure others with more experience will give e you some good advice but here's what I've learned so far. \n\nIt's harder to start over than it is to stay sober.\n\nEvery day gets easier, some more than others. Find your why.\n\nI've relapsed 3 times so far. Every time I regret it. \nIf you think one drink is fine....it's not find something to take your mind off of it and push through the urge. You will be 100x happier when you wake up the next morning and will be even stronger to say no to your temptation the next time. Good luck! You got this",

I keep starting over these past three months and I feel utterly exhausted from starting over. It almost feels worse than my everyday drinking. I know it\u2019s better for me to take that time off but the starting over is mentally and physically exhausting! I\u2019m hoping this is what saves me and keeps me sober. On day three and I really want to stay sober. Going back to day 1 terrifies me!",

Liver enzymes were a mess of course but he told me the body is extremely resilient, as well as our livers.  Your body will thank you.  I took it easy for the first few months and allowed myself sweets and caffeine to kick the cravings but for the last few weeks I've gotten back into the gym and already seeing huge improvements.  Keep at it, we are pulling for you and I promise it will all be worth it.",
