Thanks everyone for sharing your experiences - the successes, the setbacks, the guilt, the shame, the pride, the good the bad the ugly. It\u2019s all so useful to read and learn from.\n\nI\u2019m so ill with flu right now but I\u2019m happy because I\u2019m sober. Look after yourself whoever is reading this. ",
