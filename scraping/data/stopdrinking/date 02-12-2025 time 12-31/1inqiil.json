I refuse to go to my doctor's office hung over, so today is going to be a milestone day one.\n\nI'm reading *This Naked Mind* \\- or at least I was before my binges this weekend and the past couple days. Funny how when you essentially pass out from drinking you're not interested in reading.  It really is a great book and I need to take some of its lessons more to heart going forward. \n\nI'm with you - IWNDWYT!",

So, the next day, I was like \u201cf this\u201d and doubled down. When you KNOW it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s your time. I started a fresh day one that next day, and I\u2019m now at 26 and feel so freaking proud, confident and strong. It\u2019s not easy of course - the urge is still there and I just deal with it because I am committed and I NEVER want to go back to the drinking life. Hope that helps. Many of us have had more than one day one, but we CAN do it. Sending you strength and support \ud83d\udc95",
