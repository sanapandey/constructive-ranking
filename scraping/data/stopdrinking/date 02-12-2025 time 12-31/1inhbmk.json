Every day.\n\nShe asked how many years I drank before quitting.\n\nMe: All of them. \n\nWho can relate? Who can't remember their first drink, which was likely a \"beer puppy tax\" - a sip of Dad's beer that you just got and opened for him. Or a beer very big taste of his huge after work \"Russian back medicine\" Greyhound you just made for him in the biggest Big Gulp cup imaginable, to be delivered to him in the shower where he was working to get all the construction dirt off of him. I think my favorite was big swigs of Mom's frozen margarita with salty rim. I'd suck down so much my throat would freeze. \n\nIt's almost like being alcoholics,  teaching your kids to drink at a young age, and demanding respect upon threat of violence wasn't such a good idea. \n\nAs Noah Kahan sings, I'm still trying to forgive my parents for what their parents did to them. \n\nOh, and I will not drink with you today. If you're sober, congratulations, you fuggin' rock.\n\nStill drinking? Tomorrow can be your Day One. You can do it! \n\nOne day at a time. \n\nOne hour at a time. \n\nOne moment at a time.\n\n#IWNDWYT",

The word is SO loaded, and the idea behind the word so misconstrued, it's no wonder people like me, (nay EXACTLY me) can be so resistant. Unless we've become a caricature out of Dickens book, a Bukowski story, or a Bugs Bunny cartoon, we're fiiiiine. \n\nTactically it's an amazing gambit alcohol has constructed for itself. \n\nHere's a highly addictive drug. We're going to normalize using this drug. Then were going to attach a moral stigma to becoming addicted. And just to be shitty, we're going to make it so that anyone who quits will judged and labeled. But hey, if you want to prove you're not addicted to this addictive thing, just keep consuming it. Just don't quit, as that will tell the world that YOU failed alcohol and not the other way around.",

My partner had a few complications during her pregnancy and by the third time we were getting a panic stricken taxi to the hospital because I'd had a drink, she basically said if I want to be there for the child id have to stop drinking so I can drive if needed.\n\nShe was absolutely correct, I wasn't available in the times she needed me most. It honestly was one of the best things that happened to me as I now have a wonderful child and it proved to me I could go without alcohol. At my child's first birthday my partner's family were all drinking to celebrate and honestly I felt a bit crappy about it because it's a kids birthday, why do we feel the need to crack open a can or bottle to celebrate everything?\n\nNeedless to say I didn't drink because it didn't feel right to and I had a much better time than most because I got to enjoy it completely with my child.\n\nI haven't completely got over the alcoholism, I slip every now and then (last one was the superbowl a few days ago actually). But every time I do slip I look at my child in the morning and it becomes incredibly easy to say I'm not drinking today and stick to it.",
