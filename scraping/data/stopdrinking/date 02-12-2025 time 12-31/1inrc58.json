I don't like what I've done with my life, and I want to change it. \n\nI'm at that point in sobriety where I've realized it's not actually about the alcohol. ",

The point of a conference really should be to learn ways to improve your work and to make new contacts. \n\nIf one attends the conference with the first concept in mind and being sober will be a bummer. The flipside is if one were to attend that same conference intent on approving their work, well might be a different story. \n\nPlease don\u2019t take this as a judgment on your behavior as it\u2019s not intended that way at all. Simply an observation. I have attended many work related offsite events, and general. Leave you them in the farmer category. Sure, I get a lot of good work done but I\u2019m usually bringing plenty of things to have fun as well \n\nOne time I even selected a training that I kinda wanted, but it was being held in Yosemite Valley in the spring time.\n\nAll of that said, maybe your job does suck and it\u2019s not well suited for you. Maybe the drinking was a way that you dealt with that and now that you\u2019re sober, you have higher aspirations. \n\nGood luck to you",
