    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I went to my first aa meeting tonight and couldn't introduce myself without crying, felt embarrassed but everyone seemed nice, looking forward to feeling better and hopefully overcome this and learn to love myself without alcohol. I have kept my problems hidden and have been very secretive, I feel relieved knowing other people have similar issues... having a rough time with migraines/nausea and other things I'll leave out right now. But I know that I only have to stop once, just one time. I would love to hear how other peoples first meeting went, and was there something that someone said, that made you come back? Thanks for reading.\n\nAll love,\n\nZoe",

Keep going, because a lot of people don't (admittedly I only go sporadically now but I have a young baby and don't have the time these days). My first meeting was good, everyone was really friendly and everyone is in the same boat.\u00a0\n\n\nYou'll earn your monthly chips, and hear some tough life stories, many worse than your own possibly. The first few months are pretty rough, you might get depressed, but having a group to hold on to and people to be accountable to is really useful. I'm 19 months sober now and can't imagine going back.\u00a0\n\n\nPhysically, I don't feel too different, I've lost a lot of weight but that's mainly through dieting and self discipline. However, the mental benefits are insane. Clarity of thought and mental stability are much better and my anxiety is basically gone. I used to struggle with basic things like speaking on the phone, was always negative and stressed out, and the morning after a bender and a blackout I couldn't leave the house because I was afraid I'd done something horrible and someone was coming to get me.\u00a0\n\n\nHonestly, alcohol sucks. If I do go out, I can stick to alcohol free drinks and know that I'm gonna make it back without overspending, losing my wallet or keys, falling out with anyone, and spending the next week or so hungover.\u00a0\n\n\nPlease stick with it.\u00a0",

I was out of detox but my head was a mess, everything ached and I couldn\u2019t think straight. \n\nWhat I do remember is that I left with some hope. The folks who talked to me had done and felt and said all the awful things I had. They didn\u2019t give a shit about the lies I had told or the selfish ways I had acted. I walked in truly feeling worthless and I walked out feeling the relief of knowing I wasn\u2019t the only one who had been to those depths. \n\nIt sounds corny, but I just wanted to be able to look myself in the mirror. I had zero integrity, zero morals, zero self esteem. I saw guys who had been in the same place and had done the work to get clear of all that mess. And I was willing.\n\nWhatever recovery group or method works for you, if it gives you hope I say stick with it. \n\n\ud83d\udc4d",

I found it to be uplifting hearing about other women\u2019s stories about how sobriety has been such a gift for them and also hear stories of struggles similar to my own. My boyfriend is leaving me because of my drinking so I\u2019ve been non stop crying for the past 3 days (but at least sober) and I also couldn\u2019t introduce myself even virtually. The meeting though is 24/7 and I\u2019ll plan to hop on anytime I\u2019m needing support. We got this!",

I kept at, eventually found a home group, and acquired some sobriety.  I don't regularly attend meetings anymore, but it was an essential first step in my sobriety.\n\nGood luck!  I would suggest looking for a women-only meeting.",

My first meeting was like being plunged into a fresh, clear pool of water after living inside a volcano. It was like something just broke within me and finally allowed me to feel and see what\u2019s true. It was perhaps the first time in my life I didn\u2019t feel like I needed to prove or be anything. Been going for nearly nine months now (almost 1 year sober) and it saved my entire damn life.",

It's a great place to understand you're not unique. It's a great place to not be judged (for your drinking). It's a great place to organize your thoughts and set yourself a solid plan moving forward.\n\nIt's a solid first step. If it's working for you,  great.\n\nSomething that made me go back while I still went?\n\nI had relapsed and when they asked if anyone was there since their last drink, I raised my hand. Got an ovation and a few hugs. Someone whispered in my ear. \"Good job. Most never make it back.\"",
