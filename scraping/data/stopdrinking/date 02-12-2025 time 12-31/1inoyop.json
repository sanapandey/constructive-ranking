    "selftext": "Looking for some practical advice here, because alcohol brain is a noisy little shit and currently it\u2019s trying its hardest to convince me why I can keep drinking.\n\nFor context, I have been struggling with alcohol since Covid. It went from a few drinks a week to 2-3 every night. 50lbs later I\u2019m pretty disgusted with myself and trying to make some changes. I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and have been taking Vyvanse for that purpose. It\u2019s all but extinguished my appetite during the day. I also recently switched from IPAs and wine to the lowest calorie drink (with the highest ABA) I could find. I\u2019ve seen the scale go down about 10lbs which feels like a win even though I still look like a bloated walrus in the mirror.\n\nI started Naltrexone today and was amazed that it beat my craving. No desire for a drink, not even the diet kind. Went to the gym, went home, and went to bed sober.  \u2026Yay me? \n\nAnd so, light of the minor wight loss, I feel my quitting psychology is in the the bargaining stage. It\u2019s like my brain is saying \u201cOk, I admit alcohol is terrible for us, but you\u2019re losing weight, so, hey, why don\u2019t we skip Naltrexone tomorrow night, and plan to just get drunk every other night?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s like my brain is sad the Naltrexone worked today. I miss my coping ritual and it\u2019s barely been 24 hours. \n\nI\u2019m just nervous. I have tried so many other things. Therapy, telling my closest friends, sheer willpower, and I\u2019m still in this rut. The Naltrexone feels like my Hail Mary. I really don\u2019t want to screw this up\u2026. please help. ",

It can\u2019t hurt to just go and listen. You don\u2019t have to say anything if you\u2019re not ready just listen. Good luck!",
