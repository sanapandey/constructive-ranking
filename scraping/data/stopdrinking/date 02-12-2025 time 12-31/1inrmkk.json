    "selftext": "I was pricing out some all inclusive vacations for my family, and the value proposition seems so bad when you don\u2019t drink alcohol. I\u2019ve gone on them in the past and have drunk sun up to sun down and \u201creally got my money\u2019s worth\u201d lol. \n\nIt\u2019s funny, I\u2019d rather spend more on a self-directed trip than spend less at an all inclusive and \u201cmiss out\u201d on the full offering of booze. In my case it shows how much the decision to go to a crappy resort you just get stuck on for a week without really experiencing much other than drinking in the sun is influenced by limitless alcohol. \n\nEvery day more reasons not to drink reveal themselves! \n\n",

Focusing on how much happier and more energetic I am in every situation without alcohol and being grateful for that is way more helpful for me.
