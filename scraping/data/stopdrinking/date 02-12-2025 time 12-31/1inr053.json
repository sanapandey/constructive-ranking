    "selftext": "So, some context. I\u2019m 23 and live with my parents while I work through undergrad. My parents have found alcohol in my room before, and I\u2019d promised to stop drinking. \n\nIt is so difficult to admit this, but I was lying to my parents about not drinking. I was hiding alcohol and drinking alone in my room. God, writing it out makes it sound so much more pitiful. I don\u2019t even want to post this on my main account, but I feel like I need to accept that this is my problem and not something I can hide. \n\nAnyways. This morning before going to work, I put a cup in the sink that had had wine in it last night. I guess my mom smelled it, because she called me up asking what had been in the cup. I fessed up and explained that I\u2019d had wine the night before. She said that when I get home tonight after my classes, we\u2019re going to talk. She was\u2026really angry. \n\nI\u2019m honestly so scared to go home. I don\u2019t want to talk about this with my family. And I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll put me in rehab or something. I have a therapist who I see for my anxiety and depression, but she\u2019s actually a rehab specialist who works with a lot of alcoholics. I finally talked to her about my problem with alcohol a few weeks ago, but I was so ashamed that I downplayed it. I even asked to do telehealth because I couldn\u2019t bear to look her in the face while I admitted my issue. \n\nI know my parents are going to force me to be completely truthful with my therapist after this. And even though I know she\u2019s not going to judge, I\u2019m still terrified that she\u2019ll be disappointed in me. I developed an alcohol problem under her nose for the past nearly two years I\u2019ve been her patient. \n\nI said it before but I really really don\u2019t want to be confronted by my parents tonight. I know they\u2019re going to be disappointed and angry and concerned. It\u2019s just going to be the same stuff they\u2019ve said before. I know my mom is going to blame herself for this because she\u2019s said in the past that she doesn\u2019t want me to go down this road. \n\nI just feel really alone right now. I don\u2019t feel like I have anyone to be completely honest with about my problem, and I just feel so ashamed and guilty. I don\u2019t know what to do. Normally this is something I\u2019d be really anxious and probably even cry about. But I don\u2019t really feel much of anything other than this overwhelming dread for the conversation tonight. ",

They have been patiently waiting for you to become ready. \nWhy would you put the cup in the sink without rinsing it from the faucet that is Right There, unless you were reaching out to your mom?\nClearly you have reached a point where alcohol is affecting your relationships. It is creating isolation in your ability to hide away. \nIt\u2019s ok to be really scared. Keep going and create room for this to be better. IWNDWYT.",

I think it might be easier to confess to my therapist with the knowledge that she might know my problem is worse than I\u2019ve made it seem. Thank you for your comment",
