    "selftext": "Not one to post much of anything anywhere, but I'm proud of myself.  This is the longest I've gone without alcohol since 14 years old (I'm 39).  I feel amazing.  It all started out of nowhere really.  Started dating my current girlfriend and she mentioned that she'd rather me not be around when I've been drinking.  So I stopped on the spot and haven't looked back.  I do miss drinking and the bar scene, but not near as much as I'd miss my girlfriend and her awesome kid.  I don't plan on drinking again.",
