I am in shock honestly, I keep writing and deleting the things I want to say. I don\u2019t know what to say honestly expect I am 2 weeks away from 100. \nI couldn\u2019t get past 3 days to save my life for the longest time and here I am on day 687. \n\nIt\u2019s possible, it really is. Tell the people around you that you are getting sober, reach out, you don\u2019t have to do this alone. It is possible to get to this point because I used to scroll this community endlessly in awww of the people that were able to stay sober. I was jealous of their strength all while discrediting my own. I am strong, I just didn\u2019t believe in myself enough to feel it. \n\nYou are strong enough, you can do this and you are worth loving yourself more than the alcohol. \n\nIWNDWYT \ud83d\udda4",
