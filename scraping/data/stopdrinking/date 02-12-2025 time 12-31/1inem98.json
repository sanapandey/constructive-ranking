    "selftext": "For the first time in my life at 39 years old, I\u2019ve made it a full year clean and sober. It feels pretty good , but I still get cravings\u2014sometimes I can taste and smell whiskey, and I still have dreams about drinking and using.\n\nSobriety changed my life seemingly instantly, and I\u2019m in a much better place mentally. It wasn\u2019t easy getting here. I spent 12 years in and out of treatment, trying and failing more times than I can count. Before this, the longest I ever made it was five months.\n\nNow, after a full year, I\u2019ve realized that sobriety is sort a cheat code to a happier, more stable life. \n\nThat\u2019s the experience and hope that I can offer you all today.",
