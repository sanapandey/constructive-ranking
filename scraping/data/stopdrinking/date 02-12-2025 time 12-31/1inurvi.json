    "selftext": "I had my last drink  on February 17th., 2024. And while it took all my resolve to finally quit (lots of soul searching, staying awake at night, crying, etc.) I haven't looked back. I know it is most likely the best decision I made in my life, second perhaps only to marrying my husband, and yet. \n\nI am tempted coming up on my 1st soberversary. I know nothing good will come of taking a drink now and I'll relapse harder snd worse than before, but I'm beginning to reminisce about the good times, that warm glow, (especially this time of winter when everything is cold and dead) and I'm wondering if I made the right decision. \n\nI will NOT drink. This is not a hope, it's a commitment. But I'm wondering why I'm craving it. Why am I questioning my best decision? \n\nIs this something that I will have to battle again? ",
