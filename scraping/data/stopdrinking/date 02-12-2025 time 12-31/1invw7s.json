    "selftext": "I've been struggling with alcohol for at least a decade, probably two if I am honest. Recently I've had great success with my sobriety - normally going for a month or so before relapsing and this current streak feels like it is \"the one\" that will succeed.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is a strange feeling recently, now that I am no longer fogged up with booze. I am beginning to feel... like myself? Specifically my old self that was actually optimistic about things, enjoyed life, and didn't hide from problems. \n\nRight now I am trying to focus on those positive feelings and let go of my self-directed pity of 'oh how I wasted all those years' - yeah, my alcoholic self wasn't fully present for so many events in my life but there is no sense on dwelling on that other than as a lesson to not drink and to actually live my life.",

I got the job but I had to quit because I couldn\u2019t concentrate, felt overwhelmed, inferior and was making errors. I hope I didn\u2019t permanently damage my brain. I drank heavily for about 15 years.",

It was hard for me to not dwell and beat myself up over the past at first. The more I learned about alcohol and what it does to us, I came to realize I was doing the best I could with the tool I knew how to use, just turned out I was using the wrong tool. No reason to beat myself up over this, too late to change the beginning of my story but not too late to re-write the ending. IWNDWYT",
