Tens of thousands of state and public sector workers have been dismissed, and many public institutions have been liquidated, worsening the economic and social situation. Additionally, discrimination against citizens based on their beliefs and affiliations is on the rise. Kidnappings, assassinations, theft, looting, and extortion have become commonplace.\n\nOn January 29, 2025, the features of the political tyranny of the dark forces became even more apparent. On that day, an expanded meeting was held with the leaders of armed groups who had seized most of the country by historical coincidence, without any qualifications other than the power of their weapons.\n\nDuring this meeting, an agreement was reached to solidify the authoritarian pattern of governance. One person was granted full executive and legislative powers to manage the state, confirming a blatant dictatorial regime subordinate to Turkish mandate. It is worth noting that this dangerous step was preceded by numerous meetings with representatives of imperialist centers and reactionary Arab regimes, along with the constant presence of the Turkish overseer, indicating that this transformation was carried out with the blessing of these circles. All promises of establishing democratic freedoms and taking steps in this direction have been thrown into the trash. Syria is now without a constitution, controlled by the whims of the dark forces and the interests of the powers behind them. The 2012 constitution, which was abolished, contained no reference to the ruling party but enshrined general social rights, making it an obstacle to transforming our country into a haven for reactionary dark forces and their masters. The Turkish colonizer seeks to impose extreme dark transformations in Syria, which it cannot achieve in its own country.\n\nThe ominous January 29 meeting also decided to dissolve several national parties, including the Syrian Communist Party. We see this measure as a first step, to be followed by further steps to suppress all genuine national and democratic forces.\n\nThe Syrian Communist Party, which has been in existence for over a century and has fought through various struggles under different circumstances, will not submit to this unjust decision to dissolve it. It will continue its struggle to defend the rights of the popular masses and to restore the independence and sovereignty of the homeland. We, the Syrian Communists, do not fear repression and persecution, and our history bears witness to this. The Syrian people know us for our steadfastness to principle and our integrity in serving the people.\n\nIn this critical phase, we consider it one of our primary tasks to unite all good forces in our country, regardless of their backgrounds, to confront dark tyranny and oppression.\n\n**Together in the struggle for a free homeland and a happy people!**\n\n**January 30, 2025** \u00a0\n\n**Central Committee of the Syrian Communist Party**\n\n\nTranslated by DeepSeek AI",

Were the Mujahideen in Afghanistan fascist? Or comprador-led government/faction that wasn't fascist? What about the Taliban, factions of the Iranian revolution?\n\nEven if the Syrian government is fascist, why use the term \"islamofascist\"? The earliest use seems to be by Akhtar Husain who criticized the demand for Pakistan's independence as \"islamofascist\"(implicitly supporting the compradors who wanted to create India). The current use of the term draws it's roots from the RAND corporation and Manfred Halpern's work. In light of all of this, I'm sympathetic with not using the term at all and think it's more than just semantics here given the term is used to characterize *what Syria is*.",

The reactionary usage implies that Islamism or even Islam is inherently fascist.  But it could also just mean that fascism sometimes expresses itself in an Islamic or Islamist form.  I usually associate the term with Islamophobes and was surprised at first to see it here, but what really matters is the content, not the form.\n\nIt kind of reminds me of the term \u201cMohammedanism,\u201d which many Muslims find offensive on the grounds that it wrongly implies that Muslims worship Muhammad, although I have also heard of Muslims who have no problem with the term on the grounds that Islam was spread by Muhammad and that Muslims revere Muhammad.  But today the term is mostly used by Islamophobes and smacks of orientalism and so should be avoided (even if its emphasis on Muhammad is more in line with materialism than the emphasis of \u201cIslam\u201d on submission to God).\n\nI personally would avoid \u201cIslamofascism\u201d as a practical matter because of its association with Islamophobia.",

Or do you not think the use of Islam is worth a distinction?\n\nSee here, u/smokeuptheweed9 already has problems with their mention of the Muslim Brotherhood. For a long time, Hamas was the militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza and emerged out of that. In addition, in Egypt, for example, there has to be proof of the rule of the Freedom and Justice Party(linked/emerged out of the Muslim Brotherhood) is a fascist rule rather than a bourgeois-democratic one. I don't have much sympathy for the Muslim Brotherhood, but it's not really what it seems and slapping the label of fascist onto all of it's derivatives because some of it's derivatives are pro-US misunderstands a lot. \n\nI'm not arguing out of practicality, but because of the harmful mischaracterization of movements under blanket labels. This is not even getting into the fact that the \"Islamo\" part of the term misdirects from materialist analysis. The practical arguments are actually deeper than just hatred against Muslims, but the fact that social fascism uses these terms/language to spur repression against Muslim communities. At this point, the term itself cannot be meaningfully revived as u/DashtheRed proposed/hinted in current circumstances. Even if it was, it'd be a poor descriptive term to refer to just any Islamic movement that is pro-US, especially given the complexities/divided nature of the factions that emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood. \n\nNot many would point out Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to be a \"Islamofascist\" but Zia-ul-Haq would be considered. This is despite the use of Islam to justify both of their rules despite both using Islamic justifications(both maintained being an Islamic republic at core) and receiving backing of the US to some extent or another. Now what about Jinnah? How is their rule different from Mohamed Morsi? I don't mean these questions as just rhetorical, but ask for some basis in the use of \"Islamofascism\" because I see none, and only harmful bases and uses.",
