I have heard Vygotsky, who is influential in child psychology even in bourgeois circles despite having been a Marxist, is interesting when it comes to child development and pedagogy but I haven't read him yet. I've also read an essay / small book by Ilyenkov on child pedagogy which was interesting https://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/articles/school-learn.pdf",

            "body": "You'd probably be better off providing more specific questions, although parenting is more of an individual relationship between you and your child. My father was a communist but I wouldn't say there was anything inherently \"communist\" about his parenting style -- he raised us \"normally\" albeit he had his flaws (anger management issues, for instance, he had been very abused as a child). He challenged us a lot intellectually, made reading a big priority, and frankly tried to not force his political beliefs on us, would even go so far as to play the Devil's Advocate against us if he felt like we were simply trying to parrot his opinions. Of his four children I'm the only one with views that are particularly \"communist\" -- one of my siblings is a liberal small business owner, and the other two are largely \"apolitical.\" We are all very close to one another in spite of these differences.\n\nI think the best you can do is not try to raise a child as a political experiment with rigid application of socioeconomic theories, but instead try to raise a happy child who thrives. Be encouraging, supportive, challenge them, and maybe along the way instill baseline values re: the importance of equality and responsibility to others.",
