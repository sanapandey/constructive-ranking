    "selftext": "What class are salaried/wage-earning doctors, engineers, software engineers, lawyers, teachers and professors in semi-colonialised semi-feudal countries? \n1. Do these professions even have anything to do with eachother, or is it a case by case scenario?\n2. If they are proletarians, is there a significant distinction between them and industrial workers? If they are petite-bourgeois, why, they don't own private property(?), and are they primary part of the left wing, right wing or center of the petite bourgeoisie? Can the term labor aristocracy be applied to the global south?\n2'. What actually is the intelligentsia?\n3. Are these professions unitary, or can there be distinctions within them?\n4. What were they considered historicaly by marxist theoreticians (marx, engels, lenin, stalin, mao etc.) and did they change their class nature (I know for example that doctors in the past owned their practice, but today it's mostly no longer the case) ?\n5. What should be our political attitude towards them (as communists in preparation or in the process of a new democratic revolution) ?",

            "body": "As a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist cadre living in a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country, this is what the Communist Party of the Philippines teaches us:\n\n1. These professions share a petty-bourgeois class character (urban middle strata), but contradictions arise based on their role under semi-colonialism. Those serving imperialism (e.g., corporate lawyers) differ from those aligned with the masses (e.g., public lawyers).\n\n\n\n2. Petty-bourgeois, not proletarian: They lack ownership of production but reproduce bourgeois ideology and enjoy relative privilege. Most are left-wing/centrist petty bourgeoisie (exploited by low wages, anti-imperialist). Right-wing elements serve comprador and haciendero interests. Labour aristocracy does not apply here; even \u201cprivileged\u201d professionals are oppressed by imperialism, such as the national bourgeois. The intelligentsia, on the other hand, are prone to the errors of reformism, but they can be progressive elements to advancing the revolution by providing propaganda, education, and urban organising. Hence, they must undergo \"ideological remoulding,\" shedding bourgeois individualism. \n\n\n\n3. They are not unitary. Progressive are public-sector workers, rural professionals, while reactionary are those embedded in imperialist corporations or feudal institutions like the padrino system.\n\n\n\n4. Historically, our great teachers saw them as vacillating petty bourgeoisie; their class stance depends on whom they serve (masses or rulers). Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sison redefined them as key allies in the National Democratic Revolution (currently being waged by the New People's Army) if they broke from bourgeois individualism. Today, semi-feudalism binds them to imperialist exploitation despite salaried status. \n\n\n\n5. As communists, we should unite progressive professionals (e.g., teachers, doctors) to serve the revolution (through legal and underground mass organisations). Struggle against those aiding big comprador bourgeoisie/landlord interests (e.g., anti-worker lawyers, people quarrying the Sierra Madre). Demand class \"suicide\" by urging them to reject their bourgeois tendency, integrate with workers/peasants, and dedicate their skills to overthrowing the semi-feudal, semi-colonial rule caused by US-China imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and establish a people's democracy.\n\nI highly recommend reading [Philippine Society and Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/history/philippines/cpp/guerrero/1970/psr.htm) by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sison!",

            "body": "They would be considered part of the Labour Aristocracy. This is a portion of the proletariat that exists within capitalism that has less of its surplus value furnished by the bourgeois due to its high skill/high education. It is more difficult to reproduce Labour Aristocrat professions due to the nature of their work (takes much more to train a doctor and a lawyer than an industrial proletarian). They still are proletarians if they are employed for a wage, their relation to production is not one of ownership. If they own their own practice than they are (petty) bourgeoisie. A lot of labour aristocrat jobs open up the pathway to proprietorship (petty boug) due to its high degree of skill and comparatively low reproducibility.\u00a0\n\n1. They have as much to do with each other as far as they are labour aristocracy, which isn't its own class - its a section of the proletariat - and so is a quantitative and not qualitative distinction.\u00a0\n\n2. There is a distinction in that their class outlook tends to be blunted by their relatively eased exploitation. They may have a bourgeois class outlook if they have aspirations to proprietorship (temporarily embarassed millionaire).\u00a0\n\n3. There can be distinctions within them. Resident doctors - doctors who just got placed out of med school - seem to be more exploited than full doctors. Senior workers tend to pass off more of the grunt work and dirty work to junior workers, this is called \"paying your dues\". You see this a lot in skilled trades, which may also be labour aristocracy if unionization is high.\u00a0\n\n4. I don't know what the historical position is, I assume theres a lot of vacilating between considering them petty bourgeois vs proletariat. They often have elitist attitudes, given their often elite education, so that may have been construed incorrectly to determine their class. Industrial workers have reactionary outlooks too. I think pretty simply they are part of the proletariat - if you do not own the means of production and sell your labour power for a wage, you are a proletarian. They are just not part of the industrial proletariat, who will form the Vanguard of the working class.\u00a0\n\n5.\u00a0They can and should be united with, their interest lies in the overthrowing of capitalism. You can find tons of examples through out history of doctors and lawyers and teachers especially organizing en masse for revolution.\u00a0",
