    "selftext": "I\u2019ve been hitting up against more and more limitations of my understanding of which classes exist in Amerika. I\u2019ll drop the various articles that I think have marginal value and try my best to explain their limitations. Usually it\u2019s just a combined refusal to contend with the idea of a labor aristocracy or the idea of a really international proletariat. \n\nhttps://goingagainstthetide.org/2024/12/02/the-specter-that-still-haunts/\n\nThis series of articles is probably one of the more comprehensive attempts I\u2019ve seen, which makes sense because it at least understands the question of \u201cWho are the Proletariat\u201d is not an intuitive one. I think the fact that they remove the idea of exploitation from the definition certainly opens stuff up, especially in Urban Centers subject to the demographic inversion they talk about, but I don\u2019t think that this series really demarcates a revolutionary subject that can be seen as bigger than the current status-quo.\n\nhttps://maoistcommunistunion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/neomercantilism.pdf\n\nthis is a pretty recent analysis, I think their concepts are overall incredibly flawed and this flows from the MCU\u2019s outright rejection of the idea of a labor aristocracy. It\u2019s not a class analysis per say, but I\u2019ve included it because the question of if the Amerikan Bourgeoisie is preparing for a qualitative shift in the conditions of how they rule seems relevant and under examined. I at least think the empirical data is worth looking at.\n\nhttps://newlaborpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/final_on_us_state_unionism.pdf\n\nI\u2019m including the \u201cState Unionism Thesis\u201d because it seems relevant to the broader discourse, but I find the concept more or less ridiculous even within a conception that rejects the Labor Aristocracy as a significant portion of the population. I really can\u2019t wrap my head around how there could be an equivalent between the Brazilian or Mexican State Unionism of the 20th Century and what is currently occurring in Amerika. \n\nI\u2019m going to post this now and come back and expand on this/link to more analyses in the comments later. I\u2019ve been pressed for time recently and I know that if I don\u2019t do it in this more piecemeal fashion I\u2019ll just never get around to it. Sorry for the half-baked analysis but I just kinda need to write this out for myself like this to even get it done. ",

I do thank you, however, for such an interesting discussion prompt.\n\nI think a lot of these attempts at qualifying class structures on the land that was once known as Turtle Island, and contemporarily referred to as the USA, fail to consider intersectionality. \n\nThe American proletariat is stratified along many identities that bifurcate class struggle into different bespoke struggles. A rich Black Muslim woman has a different casted status than a rich white Christian man, both of whom have different status to any poor person comparatively, but that does not mean each member of their own group feels the same oppression or the same privilege\u2014at present, in the past, or in the future. \n\nIe, my sister is an intelligentsia-class, college-educated trans woman who does not have access to robust health insurance and who works 50-60 hours a week. \nIn her 30 years of life she has existed in several different castes\u2014an upper middle class upbringing, the white male experience and privilege until she was 23, the white transfemme experience and resultant oppression from her mid-20\u2019s on, and now she is a bona fide member of the prole by definition of her employment status and condition.\n\nSo my point is that to reduce one\u2019s lived experience to just their present or past monetary class, within a revolutionary framework, does a disservice to the experience and influence that their lives have on former or future revolutionary thought. \n\nI think American class structure is so unique and fails to fall squarely into any discrete European thoughts of class structure, because most of the lived experiences of its proletariate class experience more than just class oppression, especially when white proletarians so widely subscribe to counter-revolutionary ideas of a mud-sill class upon which they can punch down to elevate their social status (that is the thought of \u201cI may be in poverty, but at least I\u2019m not Black,\u201d etc. etc.). A divided proletariate is exactly what the proto- and neo-Fascist leaders of the US intended and have successfully achieved. \n\nLastly, I think that a real revolutionary framework that is bespoke to the United States\u2019s current power strata, can\u2019t be reduced to just class. Intentionally-discussed intersectionality, as proposed by Angela Davis and her collaborators, colleagues, and comrades, will lead to true American class liberation. As paraphrased from Qween Jean, when we free the impoverished disabled Black trans women in the US\u2014by merit of her liberation\u2014then and only then will all be free.",

Read Marx&Engels and Lenin&Stalin and Mao, Read Settlers and MIM Theory. That will be much more productive than what you spent learning in bourgeois Sociology.\n\n\n> I agree that race gender etc. are social constructs\n\n\nThe ideas about Race and Gender that grasp the truth are Social Constructs in as much as they are Social products of generations of practice trying to get at the Absolute Truth of Class Society and the universe in their relative truth. But Private Property, the family, and the State, etc are all objective phenomenon.\n\n\n> I\u2019m arguing is that previous attempts (as far as I was aware) failed to meaningfully interact with the different social strata in the US that further subjugate people besides class.\n\n\nAgain, you'd get much more benefit from reading Sakai's Settlers in understanding why this is wrong.",

Some religious figure declared that Christians couldn\u2019t enslave other Christians, so from here being black was intrinsically related to labor relations, but this would obviously evolve overtime. The labor relations are more fundamental than race relations and race relations exist in a way that demonstrably upholds the fundamentality of relations of labor. I\u2019m sure a Marxian anthropologist (even if this itself is a contradiction considering the laws he described pertain to capitalism) could probably draw on the evidence we had to perform this analysis of these social dimensions and how they extend from previous modes of class society. Sorry if this is inadequate, but I also believe an education in sociology through the American academy was very inclined to support this view, they describe Marx as a conflict theorist and frequently, and inappropriately, project inadequacy in theory even though it has clearly developed from his time with only more evidence that paints an even greater picture of one of the most important phenomena within our species: class society. Again I will find the video if I can",

I would think if one occupies the position of man in patriarchy then one belongs to the oppressor gender and has the relevant privileges (at the expense of women and other patriarchally oppressed groups). To draw a parallel with capitalist class relations if one feels bad about occupying a privileged position as a first world labor aristocrat, a settler or a member of the bourgeoisie that doesn't mean they don't have the privilege associated with those classes (mainly the ability to store and consume surplus value extracted from the proletariat of the world / the third world). I'm not trans, I'm a cis man, and I don't particularly enjoy the fact that I am one for its implications (belonging to the oppressor gender), nor do I enjoy the expectations that come with it (if you're a man you're expected to be predatory, oppressive, sexist, capitalist, etc.) (though I don't think what I have would be pathologically classed as dysphoria, at least not in the same sense as that experienced by trans people) though I think I would be delusional to believe that I don't experience privilege in the form of occupying the oppressor gender in patriarchal society just because I don't like it. That would very much veer into \"men suffer cos of the patriarchy too!\" territory which as we all know is reactionary bullshit. Again not to say \"not liking it\" and gender dysphoria are identical, my main point is that I still socially occupy the position of man whether I like it or even if it caused me dysphoria, because when we talk about privilege we talk about structural things and not how much you enjoy being an oppressor. I think however that the argument that a pre transition trans woman would not be entirely considered a man has an actual solid foundation since that has to do with masculinity and how one conforms to its standards, not the fact dysphoria somehow doesn't allow you to fully enjoy the privileges of manhood. But then don't people who are considered to be men or occupy that gender position yet aren't particularly masculine also experience that kind of thing too, at least to a certain degree?\n\n\nEdit: to be honest now I'm wondering if I'm spewing reactionary bullshit due to lack of investigation and my own oppressor position biases (a dangerous combination).\u00a0I was thinking of deleting my comment but I've decided to leave it up since I've already posted it and someone may have already seen it. If I am spewing bs then perhaps it can at least serve as a reference point once I study the subject better and an object of critique for others.",

The line between feminine gay men and trans women isn't very rigid. That's not to say trans women are actually men, but rather we still live in a world divided by sex (which is socially constructed, to be clear) which shapes people. The problem is when sex is turned into a line of demarcation and you have trans women expelled from women's shelters under the grounds of \"being male.\" Hence the (understandable) negativity that person is getting for saying their sister had male privilege. The line is even more vague when it comes to trans men and masculine lesbians.\n\nAnd then to complicate things further, you have the the US' settler-colonial nature. Mitchfest excluding trans women was an event that spurred trans people to organize, and the justification given for it was because masculine lesbians of colors kept being confused for men:\n\n>  A: When did you develop your policy, like your specific policy, for example, \"women born women?\" Did you feel a need to have it after the first year?\n\n> L: The first year we articulated it was 1978.\n\n> A: So after 2 years?\n\n> L: Yeah. There was not a trans movement but you know there was a dynamic that was happening, and there certainly was an issue, and there was a dynamic that was kind of two-fold. There was this whole process that was happening about questioning women of color, butch women of color. Women would come up to me, \"there's a man on the land.\" And the first question out of my mouth became, \"is she a woman of color?\" Because white women who weren't used to being around African-American women, specifically, or Mexican-American women, would read butch African-American women as men. \n\nAgain, this isn't to imply transphobic feminists as being anti-racist heroes, but to make a point about how American femininity and whiteness.",
