            "body": "Watching this, it's unlikely the RCP survives the death of Avakian. Not that the party matters at all even while he's alive which is sort of the point. I approved this because, other than the rhetorical commitment to actually existing socialisms of the past (which comes in a media-friendly sound bite - presumably their real opinion on Stalin is buried in Avakian's collected works and isn't for us) and the name of Bob, there's no difference between what is said in this video and any other revisionist organization. The party members come off well enough and at worst they appear overly eager and slightly scripted which is expected of being in camera and having to articulate yourself quickly and live. They are clearly not cult fanatics which makes sense since there is no substance to the cult of Bob and he seems to have modest pretensions of being worshipped by his small group as a smart person (rather than any serious efforts toward revolution or legitimation in the heavens).\n\nI almost feel a bit of affection towards the party, since they are right that Avakian is old and stayed committed in some form. It's hard not to feel that way when one's critics are mutual-aid liberals, at least these people are out here talking about socialist China. Of course I would never advocate joining the party but that's no different than any other party treated as part of the acceptable \"left.\"",
