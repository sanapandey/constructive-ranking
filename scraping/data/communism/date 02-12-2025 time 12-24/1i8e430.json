Does anyone know:\n1) where he sources this claim?\n2) what Lenin might have read on the topic?\nor 3) what Lenin took away from his studies on the insurrection?\n\nThanks in advance",

            "body": "Prior to the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution was one of the chief topics of historical study among revolutionaries, both Marxist and anarchist. Lenin referred to aspects of it repeatedly in his writing, and so did Luxemburg, Plekhanov, Kautsky, and basically everyone else Lenin knew. [Per Lenin's personal secretary](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/kropotkin-peter/1917/a-meeting.html), Lenin considered Kropotkin's book especially good (though Petey's ability to apply the lessons of history when he encountered an actual revolutionary situation left something to be desired).",
