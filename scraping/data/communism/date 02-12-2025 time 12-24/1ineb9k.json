    "selftext": "I recently read a short book on the politics of the Malaysian CP up to the beginning of the first Malayan emergency (1948)\n\nhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/jj.19850076\n\nApparently their popularity among the proletariat and their access to unions were dominant from the 30s until after Japan\u2019s occupation. However, Lai Teck, who rose to power during the late 30s wanted to work within the trade unions, popular front, and took the party in a less confrontational direction with the British (he was by most account a spy for British and Japan, but the author of the book denies it). Nevertheless, seeing CPC offensive after WW2 and the international atmosphere, Chin Peng won the line struggle to abandon the popular front and launch guerilla war against the British; we now know they were defeated.\n\nWas China successful because they had more work done already on the countryside, whereas the Malaysian CP was a more sudden turn? Or was there something else? I am tempted to conclude with the author that Lai Teck\u2019s line was correct in the context Malaysian CP found themselves after the war; even though they were heavily targeted, they were the only dominant political party with access to all the unions.\n\nDuring the transition to guerilla war from union, striking action with the working class base\n, they were forced into the jungles and many union organizations dissolved (trade off the urban base for the rural base).\n\n\n\nThere was also the fact that the majority of their support came from Chinese Malaysians peasants and Indians workers, with Malaysians less represented as one would expect. I\u2019m not sure if this experience still maps on modern immigration and the difference between the local proletariat and the immigrant proletariat.",

The same strategy of revolution was tried in many places, some successful and some unsuccessful. Nevertheless some strategies have never brought successes and the subsequent change of course was not the whims of a few leaders but a concrete necessity facing a concrete dilemma. One doesn't need to look further than the neighboring countries where the policy of \"less confrontation\" and \"working within trade unions\" under a false distortion of the popular front policy has universally lead to catastrophic failures for the Communists. In the Philippines, the peaceful, city-centered line of Lava-Taruc led to the massacres of unarmed Communist activists and leaders nearly destroying the entire movement. In Burma the same happened under a nominally pro-Communist government. In Indonesia and Japan, Communist Parties quickly liquidated the armed struggles (which similarly arose from the impossibility of the urban-centered line of peaceful coexistence) which led them into total annihilation and political irrelevance respectively. If you insist, you can similarly observe the Communist movements in literally every single country in the post-WWII period for the exact same results, and its effectiveness is demonstrated by the fact that we don't live in Communism today. The international atmosphere was one of peace and coexistence and not one of civil wars like you had claimed - only the SEA Communists took up armed struggle as a rupture from this line.\n\nA revolution can never be won without violence and without having its main focus on fulfilling the interest of the majority of the population through destroying and replacing the dominant relations of production, which in a semi-feudal context means waging an agrarian revolution, a peasant war. The concrete conditions of Malaya demanded as much, regardless of Chin Peng's personal beliefs.",

                    "body": "With that being said the result of the Malayan revolution's failure is complex seeing it lasted all the way until 1989.\n\nThere are a few things that contributed to the failure, overall it results from a persistent right-opportunist line of the MCP leadership.\n\nFirst there is the demobilization of the People's Anti-Japanese Army after the war. Without a people's army the people has nothing. Gains of the national-democratic revolution, organs of political power and the people's army were dismantled. Even though some of the support would be recuperated, this dealt a devastating blow on the revolutionary movement.\n\nSecond, it is important to mention that the MCP completely neglected developing solid bases of support among the peasantry and carrying out the agrarian program and instead opted for a \"left\"-adventurist line of attempting quick military successes, and it was in the military field they were defeated. Support for the MCP was deep rooted among the Chinese ones (which made up close to half of the Malayan population and was by no ways a minority), but the MCP was easily frustrated by \"hamletting\", a rudimentary tactic overcame every other time it was applied (in China, Vietnam, etc.), precisely because the failure in developing solid, militarized structures outside of its main force. The program of land reform was not carried out and feudal relations of production, especially big British landownership, were not destroyed. The majority of Malay peasants were not mobilized in this way. This is a problem also shared by the Communist Parties of Thailand and Burma, which can be easily compared to the fast advance of the Communist Party of Peru in just 10 years of guerrilla war. Towards the end the MCP was reduced to a Chinese-Thai ethnic armed outfit cut off from the support of the majority of the population. Organs of political power were not established to replace the old state but rather in distant areas the state doesn't bother to reach.\n\nThere are a few other considerations. Complete neglect of the urban democratic movement as work in the urban areas was reduced to providing limited material support and primarily of a reformist nature, without a clear defined path forward; this led to its eclipse by the socialist party and the people's action party. Another issue is the Chinese Malayans saw themselves as guests who welcomed being deported to socialist China in the first phase of the war. The leadership also never understood Marxism; the Party failed to give any theoretical consideration to the development of bureaucrat capitalism and evolution of semi-feudalism in Malaya and the change in strategy and tactics demanded by this change, which is also reflected; it also did not understand the role of the United Front. It was not able to criticize revisionism and the cult around Chin Peng who was never a great leader is a representation of it drowning in its own historical baggage.\n\nThe modern-day surrendered Malayan Communist Party has authored several books analyzing the failure so I suggest you study them as well.",

Marxist works are now being openly sold in Sanam Luang (at the heart of Bangkok) and by 1976 the student's movement had become basically part of the communist party. This ended up being a fascist coup and massacre in October 6 however. But I think the real failure of the CPT-PLAT is, as you said, had never carried out land reforms even in their stronghold territories.",

Also your post agrees with mine in a sense that their transition from right-opportunism to left-adventurism was abrupt, pulled by the atmosphere of the moment\u2014also guilt from Lai Tecks missed opportunities\u2014rather than well thought out; it may feel forced to launch a counterattack when your party is heavily targeted, but in Malay CP case, their support was not built up enough where victory was even considerable.\n\nI haven\u2019t read in detail, but the right-wing Malaysian nationalism and Malaysian bourgeoisie emerged in the post-war with the UMNO gaining power as the MCP got bogged down in guerilla war. In that sense, they reminded me of the Palestine Communist Party composed of Jewish, but little to no Arab members in the 1930s. The failure to engage with local nationalism yields room to the reactionary sort.\n\nThe urban work consisted of striking for basic democratic rights, and the right for unionizing up to the WW2, with the hopes to establish independent Malaysia so Im not sure if its \u201creformist\u201d. Despite the repression, their work in urban areas developed a union network that was isolated after the Malayan Emergency; if the trade off was engaging with the Malaysian nationalism question, that would be fine, but in this case they failed to obtain support from the Malaysian population and got their urban network destroyed.\n\nLai Teck\u2019s disarmament was a tactical mistake, but you can get back arms; it\u2019s much more difficult to get back the network and trusts of the masses if you fail an uprising like the Malayan Emergency",

He was a triple agent working for the British and Japanese and of course he had to answer to his Special Branch masters. CPM had built significant military strength during the Japanese occupation period and had amassed a significant stockpile of arms, both delivered by the British to fight the Japs and also from the Japanese themselves.  \n  \nWhen Lai Teck changed course and decided to adopt the right capitulationist line 'legal struggle' instead of resisting the British return, he ensured the CPM would never have that kind of strength again as the MPAJA had to surrender their arms and disband. This weakened their ability to launch an armed revolution and also destroyed their best chance at securing independence on their own terms. More importantly, most people were just too tired to fight again after the war, especially after all the suffering and violence they went through under the Japanese.   \n  \nYes, they still kept a few stockpiles of arms hidden underground but the lost momentum was far harder to recover. Also, yes it's true that CPM failed to establish solid bases of support among the three major races in Malaya equally. In 1947, more than 90 percent of CPM's formal membership was Chinese. Out of 11,800 members, 11,000 were Chinese, 760 were Indian, and 40 were Malay and Indonesian.   \n  \nI am not sure where I read this information but I can give a few details in relation to the land reform programme by CPM. They declared in their Outline of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Malaya that they wished to redistribute land to Malaya\u2019s peasants, however CPM drew a sharp line between agricultural land (that is, land occupied by those who grew foodstuffs) and the land of rubber estates. The former was to be handed over to peasants; the latter was to be nationalised. The reason why they did not want to redistribute rubber estates was because on British plantations, most workers were Indians. The next largest racial group working in rubber estates was Chinese and the remainder were Indonesian Malays. Chin Peng believed this would create communal tension since if we followed a 'land to the tiller' or rather 'estate to the tapper' policy, redistributing estates to one group would create ethnic conflicts rather than unifying the working class. That is why CPM stuck to its policy of nationalising the estates rather than redistributing them to individual workers.\n\nThis was the complex ethnic composition and economic realities of Malaya that the Communist Party of Malaya was presented with.\n\nThe goal of the revolution would be the establishment of a Malayan People\u2019s Democratic Republic in which a united front of all races would enjoy equality. There would be freedom of speech, assembly, association, press, religion, and so on. Industries and rubber estates would be nationalised, miscellaneous taxes and levies abolished, education provided for free, and national and social insurance introduced. Land would be distributed to peasants, a policy that was declared to be \u201cthe only correct land policy for the liberation of the peasants and the improvement of their standard of living.\u201d Agricultural assistance was to be provided by the government in the form of agricultural implements, fertiliser, and seed, as well as agricultural credit. The political system would not be a dictatorship of a proletariat or the bourgeoisie, but rather a New Democracy in the mould of that established by the Chinese Communist Party.",

The war put pressure on the British that they had to grant independence to Malaya or risk having more Malays join the armed struggle. They chose and supported more friendly parties like UMNO as Malaya's first government. Malaya's first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman was also an anglophile which gave them more reason to leave Malaya in his hands. Even after independence, majority of the big businesses were still under White control and even the Inspector General of police was a British man for many years.",
