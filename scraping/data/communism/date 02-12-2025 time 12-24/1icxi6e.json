This might seem alien to petit-bourgeois leftists whose idea of revolution is the DSA or Star Wars, but communist parties, especially ones actively fighting a peoples' war, have standards of discipline and morality, and yes, this includes sexual and romantic conduct.",

He has no qualifications, his voice and appearance are not particularly attractive, he does not edit his videos well, the presentation is poor, and the information and analysis is superficial and ignorant. Everything about him is amateurish and repulsive. \n\nSo what is appealing? If it's that people are so hungry for knowledge they'll scrape the bottom of the barrel, why don't you make your own videos? What is stopping you from becoming an influencer yourself? By trying to \"debunk\" this minor content creator you're actually just advertising them for free. It could just be you making content instead. I choose to reject content as a concept because of everything that was mentioned in this thread. If you think it is still an arena of importance it's bizarre to me to then act like you're just part of the \"community.\" I would imagine that anyone watching him talking into a visible microphone  in a dingy basement wearing a v-neck T-shirt showing off his gross chest hair about other gross content creators thinks \"I could do this and even wear a shirt.\" Your mentality is fundamentally contradictory because we're dealing with politics. If the importance is to reach as many people as possible, as you claim he does, why then reduce your own efforts to reddit posting? In fact it should be content creators who respond to reddit posts on this subreddit, as a single post here is worth more than all of their output together, but of course they are interesting in making money primarily. In that regard your mentality is also confusing, as you should be inspired to leech off internet scams and donations for a living by this person's success despite their incompetence and laziness. Why debunk for free?\n\nThis is true of all of them. Anyone could do what they do. So why don't you? The answer is that it's entertainment. But if that's the case just admit it, don't act like there's a greater political purpose. Once politics enters the picture you have a real responsibility, it's not acceptable to reduce yourself to an unthinking person who needs to be fed content in the form of entertainment. By posting here about real historical events of great importance, you've opened Pandora's box. Now politics actually matters, it's no longer a game, and truth is what matters, not form (which, as has been pointed out, is itself a question of truth; it is not a property of human nature to experience politics as a form of passive entertainment, this indicates a certain class interest). Buy a camera and a microphone and start making videos. Or take seriously those who've told you that content creation is a waste of time. These are the only two options, otherwise you're just lazy and irresponsible.",
