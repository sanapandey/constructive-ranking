    "selftext": "A question similar to this recently came up in a *Settlers* reading group I'm in, and I figured I'd ask here as well.\n\n\"Integrating with the masses\" is, in Maoism, one of the key principles of communist development and of maintaining ideological soundness. Mao explains time and time again how a communist, especially one from a privileged background, who is disconnected from the masses, will degenerate ideologically and politically. The \"sending down\" of intellectuals to learn from the poor and middle peasants was one of the great innovations of the GPCR.\n\nHowever, as we all know here, if there are \"masses\" in the United States today they are few and far between, and many times are revolutionary along national lines but lack true proletarian consciousness (the New Afrikan lumpen, for example, or the urban homeless, or the undocumented immigrant underground economy). Given such, has there ever been a serious discussion on here about how Amerikan communists should \"go to the masses\"? I ask not in order to echo those obnoxious \"what job should I go into\" questions that plague the subreddit, but rather because I don't think I've seen a thorough analysis on what \"going to the masses\" looks like, in a country without a large subsection of revolutionary classes.\n\nShould communists seek out the lowest-status jobs bearing some semblance of proletarian character, go analyze the conditions in Amazon warehouses and street sanitation and just bear in mind that these jobs still are by and large labor-aristocratic? Should we be moving into slum housing in big cities (I know Kites Journal did a study on Queensbridge Houses) if possible? Should we be embracing imprisonment? Should we simply maintain a labor-aristocratic lifestyle but be extra vigilant against theoretical degeneration, in absence of a proletariat to integrate with? None of these answers are particularly satisfying to me, but then again, if this were an easy question with an easy answer, this subreddit would likely be far quieter.\n\nAnyway, since this seems to be the last serious, anonymous, public forum for communist discussion, I thought I'd bring the question here.",

It takes much more than mere willingness to live with those in poverty to build class consciousness. It is important to remember that Mao did not send the intellectuals to the masses blindly, but with a theoretical foundation.\n\nYour question, though, is about first world communists, not liberals. They would likely benefit from spending time with the third world proletariat if only to prevent revisionism. However, given their class character it risks turning into some dehumanizing saviorism (white or otherwise), one ought to be aware of that before engaging.\n\nAnother area of focus can be within the nationalist movements you mention, for at least they weaken imperialism.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03a.htm",

FNFI, for example, has as one of its key conclusions that settler communists should *not* attempt to integrate with such movements.",

If I had an answer to your initial question, I'd already be doing it myself, though. I'm still trying to learn the basics myself, and the more I study, the more I understand how incomplete my knowledge is.\n\nI don't think the approach in the Kites article about social investigation is going to be a particularly productive one, since it seems to amount to \"go out, do a survey, and then vanish back up your own asshole.\" They don't even mention that you should show the results of your investigation to the people you interviewed, when they should be the first ones to see it, and getting the report in any kind of condition to send off to a publication like Kites should involve their input. There's a major disconnect in that article between paying lip service to concepts like \"Many proletarians think, care, and have opinions about all sorts of things beyond their immediate neighborhoods and survival needs and can often relate to proletarians in other parts of the world quite easily\" and the approach they actually suggest, which is treating the proletariat as an object of anthropological investigation rather than a revolutionary subject who are more advanced than you (tailism is the perennial problem of the communist movement, after all).",

From somewhere between several months (at a minimum, for sent-down youth) to one\u2019s entire life. Social investigation is necessary, yes, and I might have blurred the lines here by saying \u201cgoing to the masses\u201d instead of \u201cintegrating with the masses\u201d, but I\u2019m wondering more about the long-term reshaping of one\u2019s life. If the small and scattered first-world proletariat lives in public housing, on the rez, and in homeless shelters and camps, this undoubtedly looks different to mass integration in China, where practically every peasant commune would be grateful for a teacher who worked the fields or a doctor who tended to animals.",

Instead, the love based organizing that creates the next American Revolution will recognize that all these \u2018isms\u2019 are the logical outgrowth of a system whose internal logic is shaped by the loveless contradiction between technological overdevelopment and human underdevelopment. Therefore, the only way to secure freedom from these forms of oppression to create the freedom to develop and practice new types of more human relationships. Only by developing these kinds of loving relationships can we as humans heal ourselves\u2014and each other\u2014from the damage done to us by an economic and political system bent on creating wealth at the expense of all living things.\n\nI've been seeing this humanist sentiment crop up more frequently particularly in conjunction with the phrase \"organizing, not mobilizing.\" My fear since that Kites article came out has been for social investigation to turn into the next mutual aid. I don't think it encouraged that sentiment but given the waning of the Left's enthusiasm around mutual aid, my prediction was social investigation would be the next concept cannibalized in the name of \"doing something,\" and I can already see that start to happen.\n\nWhat you're doing is the same \"advertising\" we see all the time here when questions of practice come up. You didn't even respond to the OP nor the reply above, you just gave a mechanical prescription with a text that really does not answer any concrete questions about reality today.\n\nYou're technically (or perhaps accidentally correct) that social investigation will precede the understanding of a problem, but the question was about *c*onsolidating a group. Sure the text answers that on some level but your answer of \"like-minded\" people is insufficient. What is \"like-minded?\" That is too vague to be useful, but nonetheless it is a common sentiment among the Left. An actual answer for u/turning_the_wheels  is that you will need to ideologically consolidate those around you who before engaging in social investigation. How that actually plays out in practice will be trial and error currently, as I haven't yet seen a synthesized line appear on this particular question, though I may be wrong. Regardless, ideological consolidation around Maoism (anti-revisionist Marxism) will be the most important practical action when organizing, as the primary force driving most collapses is the lack of ideological coherence preceding. This doesn't mean everyone *must* have the same line or thoughts on everything (that would actually indicate another form of the same fundamental issue) but instead everyone *must* be able to explicitly articulate their line and be able to engage in line struggles. Without this, as soon as you move toward other practical activities, like social investigation, you'll find yourself and everyone you're working with tripping over internal contradictions you didn't expect, and without proper training and discipline on how to overcome this (something that would be built through ideological consolidation), the group will collapse through frustration, unspoken hierarchies (which fill the void of an absent political line), disorganization, etc. \"Loving/Human relationships\" is not the answer, nor is it original, it's simply one of so many articulation of humanism.",
