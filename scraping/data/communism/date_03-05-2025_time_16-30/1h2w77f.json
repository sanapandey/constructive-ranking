Every demonstration I have seen them at, there is no attempt to organise, or again with the substance of the class struggle at hand. The organising strategy seems to be entirely focused on selling The Communist newspaper, to fundraise so the party can pay their staff, or squeeze members for dues. \n\nThe RCP is focused on self-reproduction and not making interventions in the class struggle to build the subjective forces to make revolution. (I'm personally not even sure that is possible in a country like Britain but that's beyond the scope of this.)\n\nThe RCP, and the SWP and so many other groups organise this way. They substitute the party for the masses, focus entirely on self-reproduction, on keeping their staff hired. They suck money from members for no real benefit. They grow the way cancer grows. I mean that in an honestly descriptive sense, not as an attempt to insult them. I want to be proven wrong about these organisations, but in Britain anyways, the left seems to be totally moribund. Better off spending time in organisations building solidarity with the struggles abroad i.e in the Philippines, Palestine, Turkey/Kurdistan ext.",

Their efforts to organise revolve entirely around a vaguely define 'working class' (it was a joke in the Palestine coalition I was in that RCP always chats about the \"workers\"), which is better termed as the white labour aristocracy of britain. For all their bs about the 'workers' and 'trade unions' they never once even give lipservice to the migrant proletariat, let alone organise with them. Their analysis of Palestine is pitiful and involves settler apologia, talking about how there exists a 'israeli working class'.\n\nAgain, your other points are all valid. Much like SWP and other socialist parties in Britain, the focus is blind recruitment (including those with potential) and make them mindless drones for the party that repeat the same empty platitudes about 'the workers' and 'internationalism' and 'Stalinism'.",

My knowledge of Trotskyism is from other people who have interacted with them and from the internet. I\u2019m trying to be as fair as possible in my answer, but you should know where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nThe Revolutionary Communist International (RCI) is a Trotskyist organization. Trotsky claimed that the Soviet Union was no longer communist and was exiled and eventually killed (probably) by the Soviet Union. Trotskyists declared that the Soviet Union and parties in other countries that were affiliated with the Soviet Union were not truly communist and were following a false belief. The animosity between the groups has continued to this day. \n\nIn my cursory reading of the Manifesto that you mentioned, I believe that the RCI is specifically referring to the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) as their \u201cso-called left.\u201d The Communist Party has been pretty vocal in opposing Trump and declaring that Trump represents a fascist threat. The RCI is dismissing this conclusion and rejecting that the CPUSA (along with, probably, other groups that RCI disagrees with) are \u201ctrue\u201d leftists.\n\nWhat you are reading in the Manifesto is not a widely-accepted redefinition of \u201cthe left.\u201d Colloquially, the definition of the left you described in your OP still applies. \n\nThe RCI, in their manifesto, are simply saying that their party line is more correct than other leftist\u2019s groups, to the point that they are saying other groups are not truly leftist.\n\nSorry, can\u2019t talk on Zizek as I\u2019m unfamiliar.",

Stalin and Trotsky died 70+ years ago and the USSR collapsed 30 years ago. It\u2019s not coming back. I think that Western marxists who want to continue litigating that debate are LARPers. \n\nThe international and domestic landscapes faced by the USSR in 1919 or 1939 or 1953 or 1991 or whenever were unique to those times. It seems to me that the failings of the Soviet Union were primarily concessions they made due to the realities of their situation. Perhaps those concessions were too much at times. I wonder often whether the USSR was doomed from the start but that question is unanswerable.\n\nAny new socialist states or movements will encounter entirely different problems. If it\u2019s a movement in the fully-developed seat of capital (the West), it\u2019s pretty unlikely that questions like peaceful coexistence will even be relevant.\n\nI broadly agree with the Chinese analysis that the Soviet Union\u2019s decoupling of the party from ML ideology was a mistake. Beyond that, everything is context-dependent.",

            "body": "The term 'the so-called left' often reflects a critical perspective on what is perceived as a watered-down or compromised version of left-wing politics. This phrasing can suggest disillusionment with mainstream leftist movements that have, in some cases, abandoned radical or revolutionary principles in favor of more moderate, reformist approaches. Similarly, \u017di\u017eek's reference to 'what remains of the left' in the context of contemporary politics underscores the sense that the left has fragmented or lost its way, particularly after the challenges of neoliberalism and the decline of traditional socialist movements.\n\nThe Manifesto of the Revolutionary Communist International might be critiquing this shift by distinguishing between revolutionary communism and the more mainstream or reformist factions that call themselves 'left' without actually advocating for a true break from capitalism. When it questions the risk of fascism, it\u2019s probably differentiating between the true radical left and the center-left or liberal factions that may be complicit in capitalist systems, thus weakening their stance against the rise of fascism.\n\nYou\u2019re right to feel that the documents could clarify their interpretations of 'the left.' A useful resource to better understand this distinction is *\"The Communist Manifesto\"* by Marx and Engels, which offers a foundational view on the left in the context of class struggle. For more contemporary takes, *\"The Left: 100 Years of Radical Politics\"* by Jeremy Gilbert might provide insights into the fragmentation of the left in the modern era.",

The fact of the matter is, the only real leftists in Britain are groups like GIK-DER//RWCA, or maybe the UVW union, - basically the organisations that have a base in the migrant proletariat. Any group that is made up of a majority British working class background, seem to be automatically revisionist. \n\nBy and large, the \"native\" working class in britain form a reactionary, exploiting class, not anything that can be constructive in terms of building the vanguard of a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and genocide.",
