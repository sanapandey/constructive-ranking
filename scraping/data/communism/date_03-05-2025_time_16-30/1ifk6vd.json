            "body": "I'm trying to parse out the situation developing within klanada (and Mexico, though that aspect has its own contradictions).  I'm a long way from an adequate class analysis, and really struggling to search for the correct way to process this. I even briefly posted a rushed and tired write up last night that I'm not at all satisfied with, and I'm going back to the drawing board before I hurriedly say something (too) poorly thought out.  This might be an error, but I'm increasingly of the position that amerika is actually intent on annexing the kanadian landmass (secures resources, land and sea that will soon be open for exploitation thanks to global warming, completes \"Manifest Destiny,\" and 'doubling the size of amerika' would be Trump's presidential legacy after his death), and that the tariffs are a prelude to the conditions to bring this about.  Unless the tariffs are actually a short term bluff, or maneuver to get rid of Trudeau (which doesn't make much sense because, despite his rhetoric, Poilievre is basically an equally vapid neoliberal carbon copy of Trudeau and the differences are minor, and that process was already underway anyhow) then the actual choice being imposed is whether kanada takes seriously the proposal to become the 51st state, or whether it takes heightened and potentially war-like measures to insist on its own sovereignty and independence.  This is a rare moment in kanadian politics where tailing the amerikans isn't actually an option.  The trade war ultimately will break kanada far faster than it will the amerikans which the kanadian bourgeoisie are now counting on to pressure Trump to end the tariffs, but if that doesn't occur, and the tariffs go on, then kanadian capitalism will be in real crisis (this will certainly burst the long growing kanadian housing bubble).  This is where I'm really having trouble because I'm not sure what historical comparison I should be drawing from here.  I'm reading into this shades of Britain-Ireland or Germany-Czechoslovakia on one hand, or even the Anschluss on the other (given a similarly reactionary settler-colonial state and arguably now even a proxy-headquarters for the last stand of the dying neoliberal world order).  Or should I be ignoring the kanadian settler-state altogether and simply insisting on the oppressed internal colonies, and the potential change is simply new management and the overthrow of settler-colonialism and imperialism by those oppressed internal colonies is the primary struggle here and remains essentially the same. Then again, I'm known for over-reaching and I might be reading into it too much already and overblowing the situation. I'm making the mistake of reacting to to this news too soon, but now that it's sitting in front of me, I'd like to request help to construct the right framework to make a good analysis, that might point towards a revolutionary line.\n\nedit: added a line of evaluation",

ICE raids have trickled in and there appears to be a flood on the horizon. My local cadre circle was fortunate enough to preempt this near the end of last year by making inroads with local migrant organizing groups and activities but we were just barely ahead, and now I'm afraid we're already behind (or at least not as far along as we would like to be given the sudden jump in intensity here). The need for a proper class analysis to ground all of our questions and thinking is making itself very apparent now, especially since we have mostly been focusing on the national question. The possible annexation of kanada coinciding with the militarization of the southern border presents a rather unprecedented circumstance which I don't think (in my very limited historical knowledge) has any immediate parallels other than superficial appearances so far. I'm hoping to come here with more to report on but so far it's just been a mad scramble by the local revisionists and opportunists here to push their way to the front of the spontaneous movements that arising. We are trying to march a steady path forward guided by our principles but this will be a serious challenge for us to step up to.",

Not just flawed because of the usage by liberals who want to associate Trump with Hitler and that this is part 1 of his master plan of world domination or anything.\n\nBut flawed in the sense that Austria had an active mass movement to join with Germany post ww1, where there's no similar situation in Canada. Austrian Fascism however for a time was also quite against joining Germany up until the very end, which is often forgotten too.\n\nCzechoslovakia is perhaps the most similar but still off for a few reasons.\n\nI really dont know what to compare this situation to, its all happened suddenly which gives off the appearance of it being a bluff, but contradictions have been sharpening all over the world as of late.

But I should have made clear, I only see similarities of form here, not the essence.  IRA violence was/is ultimately a good and progressive thing, whereas I'm not actually quite sure what to make of hypothetical kanadian settler nationalist violence against an encroaching amerikan settler empire.  Maybe the Boer War would be something to look into here?  Hence the need for a framework.\n\n>Austrian Fascism however for a time was also quite against joining Germany up until the very end, which is often forgotten too.\n\nThis was the part I was actually thinking about to make the comparison here.  Is there going to be several months of \"buy kanadian\" or whatever, the last gasps of kanadian nationalism faltering and wheezing as the economy collapses, the kanadian settlers will just capitulate and say \"ah, fuck it, we're amerikan now, Greater Germany 2\" and suddenly turn to an embrace of this thing which is currently being met with broad hostility across kanada (other than the handful of naked compradors like Kevin O'Leary already trying to sell it).  Even the reactionaries within kanada who had previously been pro-Trump to a significant degree seem to be suddenly torn between their own nationalism and their support for Trump (I see a Dolfuss vs Hitler parallel here as well, though it isn't 1:1).  You are right that I don't want to feed neoliberalism (perhaps one of the worst errors Marxists could make would be to help save the old neoliberal order here, but yet is there an opportunity to use the contradictions between these forces?) with Trump=Hitler comparisons either, but there really aren't many close historical situations like this to draw from.  \n\n>What have internal colonies in Canada said about the situation?

Again, I'm responding to a developing situation far too quickly, so I don't think there's been time for many responses yet.  Everyone is still processing the situation.  I don't even think most people in kanada have even yet understood quite how much this is going to hurt, or how quickly the nation might be thrust into escalating crises, and the responses will only start to emerge when the level of economic pain that kanada is about to be in becomes more apparent and felt.  The housing bubble is going to destroy a lot of kanadian fictitious capital and homeowners who previously thought themselves to be millionaires will be shocked to rediscover that they are poor, and entire business sectors are going to utterly collapse along with jobs and incomes.  kanadian financial capital already migrated into amerika to fill the holes left by amerikan banking after the 2008 crisis, so they've already got one leg stuck on each side of the fence, as it were, though I suspect they will be the among the first to commit to joining the comprador forces.

I was only trying to delineate the difference between British Setter Colonialism in Northern Ireland and the lack of American settlers in Canada in comparison.\n\n>but rather the parallel I see is for the potential of something similar to the IRA (again, not as progressive, since the kanadian state has no legitimacy while the Irish one does, but it it outrageous to suggest that a faction could be composed of something similar to the right wing of the IRA, absent the more progressive minded nationalists and Marxists), which would respond to the possible occupation (though this might be closer to the late-Austro-Hungarian Empire now) with some sort of insurgent movement against amerika.\n\nI agree something like this could occur. A Reactionary movement of Canadian Labor Aristocrats against american occupation is very much possible. The issue is whether or not this movement is progressive? (More on that in a sec)\n\nObviously the american takeover of canada makes very little difference. Canada is just as much as an imperial power as america and the reactionary classes might benefit in many ways from the takeover. The two economies are incredibly linked and this overall makes very little difference to the world strategic and demographic composition of Imperialism\n\nRemember it took to the very end of the war and complete devastation for any formal austrian resistance to hitler to emerge, and even then it was very small. I dont discount the possibility of opposition to america emerging but the longer and longer it goes on the more and more canadians will defect over to perpetuate their class. The fantasy of Canadians imagining themselves as Partisans is insane. They are not going to give up their labor aristocratic privilege (which will not be upended by america ) to wage guerrilla war or any other resistance except mild nationalist protest.\n\nThat all being said, we should ask ourselves what possible benefit could be brought from this?\n\nIf we ask ourselves the position of internal semi colonies in Canada and their reaction. Is it likely that this will embolden them? (without much investigation on my half i must add) likely not. What difference does it make for them if am American or Canadian flag is flying above them, and if it does and they identify more with Canadian nationalism then its obviously reactionary. (The same could be said about the Quebecois Labor Aristocrat settler nationalism too)\n\nWhat could be progressive about this is how Europe responds to this. America taking over another NATO member by aggression (tariffs or the 1% chance of invasion) is definitely a catalyst to cause a split in NATO. Many European NATO states have been trending more and more away from American Imperialism in response to clashes in the US position in Ukraine. Im not trying to preach some fantasy of multipolarity or anything, but the largest camp of World Imperialism being potentially fractured is surely beneficial in many ways.\n\n>don't even think most people in kanada have even yet understood quite how much this is going to hurt, or how quickly the nation might be thrust into escalating crises, and the responses will only start to emerge when the level of economic pain that kanada is about to be in becomes more apparent and felt.

I feel about the same about this whole situation as I do the Anschluss, 2 fascist regimes uniting, indifference.\n\nI hope someone can criticize our line of thought to find a correct line out of this. But the probability of creating a Left Adventurist analysis out of this situation is too dangerous. Im curious if MIM plans on writing anything about it. They are the first to write about the position of oppressed internal colonies and how now millions more are going to join an enlarged empire (though millions of white settlers will now join in lock step with their american allies)\n\n Its the first time imperial contradictions have sharpened towards a redivision of the worlds borders between 2 imperial powers in a long time.",

The biggest is the demographic minority of the Afrikaner and the even smaller British settlers in the eventual South Africa as a whole.\n\nIm not knowledgeable enough on south african history, but these 2 settler stratas remained hostile because the Afrikaner population needed to sustain its class with open terroristic Apartheid and segregation, bur the British settlers were more reformist and willing to treat south affica more akin to other colonies. (But mind you Racial segregation was still present prior to the formal adoption of Apartheid in 1948)\n\nIn the final analysis the settler populations remained hostile politically to another, with the Afrikaner section ultimately winning over and instituting Apartheid because they had material differences, and the strategic situation of colonial imperialism wasnt split down national (Afrikaner and British) lines between the settlers by coincidence.\n\nThats why I ultimately think this *Canschluss* wont produce any real material backlash from the canadians because the stakes are unbelievably lower than the very real destruction the Afrikaners faced as a settler nation if they couldnt dominate the Black population thoroughly. As much as I want the oppressed nations to overthrow the canadian settler regime of the anglos and quebecois, the demographic situation is a lot more challenging than in south africas case.

                    "body": "Thanks for posting this - as someone living in Canada this is also something I have been thinking about.\n\nI have long struggled to understand the material explanation for the Canadian state. There are not meaningful differences between the Canadian and American nations, and even the way they have exploited the internal colonies are incredibly similar. Neoliberalism and free trade have even allowed American MNCs to profit greatly off the extraction of natural resources in Canada (US is a major financier of natural resource extraction infrastructure in Canada). I do not think the Canada-US situation is entirely comparable to any historical examples in Europe because of their settler colonial nature, which essentially skips many of the precursors to developing a coherent national identity and, since the American and Canadian settlers both came predominantly from England, there is simply not enough that materially distinguishes them from one another. Canada being part of the commonwealth does not seem to have meaningful implications these days that would otherwise distinguish it from the US (culturally, I actually think anglo-canada is more similar to the US than it is to Quebec)\n\nIt would then follow that the existence of a Canadian state is nothing more than an inefficiency for the North American bourgeoisie. This inefficiency becomes greater as Canada's geographic becomes of more strategic importance due to the effects of warming on the arctic, as you mentioned, which will only further deepen the contradiction. I don't think the contradiction is one that is necessarily antagonistic yet, despite Trump's rhetoric. Trump is a real estate mogul after all, and if there's one thing I know about real estate developers, it's that they ask for everything and then concede a little to show your their \"good will\". \n\nThe Canadian labour aristocracy is opposed to annexation now because it has immediate consequences due to differences in Canadian and American social policies, healthcare being the biggest example. Canada's vast trove of national resources and its pillaging of the natural resources of the third world have allowed for significant wealth accumulation, which has been able to immensely subsidize the Canadian labour aristocracy both directly and indirectly. Therefore, of course the labour aristocracy would be opposed to annexation right now. However, capitalism can only allow these inefficiencies to persist for so long, and with the interests of Russian and Chinese capitalism starting to conflict with those of Canadian and American capitalism in the arctic and in Africa, and with Canada's continued lagging productivity relative to the United States caused by an economy so heavily focused on buying and selling of real estate, the Canadian government will lose its ability to subsidize the labour aristocracy at its current rate (and this is already happening all over Canada). Annexation will then become less and less consequential and, with there being virtually no differences in national identity, there will be little reason for opposition.\n\nAll this is to say, I don't believe there is revolutionary line to take other than anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. The temptation for Canadian communists to take a revisionist position on this will be very great, especially as the contradiction heightens. I think we must oppose that.",

            "body": "**Just a brief report on some of the migrant struggle protests arising:**\n\nThe southwest has erupted with a wave of spontaneous protests centered around increased oppression brought forth by the Trump administration via ICE. These developments have already been building since last year with the passing of new border bills in Texas and Arizona. For Arizona, at that time there were smaller, sparse demonstrations against these bills by those of the more principled remnants of the SB1070 - there were likely similar developments in Texas with those around SB4. Regardless, some of my observations of what has immediately emerged are as follows:\n\n* Student activism has reignited since its low smolder in the aftermath of the encampments.\n* Some of the street protests seem to have no immediate ties to any particular organization. Or at least not one that's keen on publicly presenting itself.\n* There is a mad scramble between various organizations to act on these developments with various NGOs and Socialist orgs cobbling together know your rights trainings (with recycled material from SB1070) and various protests and events.\n* The Mexican flag is the most prominent at all of the spontaneous street and student protests. What this means regarding the national question is immediately pressing but there is no clear answer yet. This also brings into question the national composition of migrants versus the overwhelming presence of the Mexican flag and Mexican culture (i.e. crowds singing or playing [corridos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrido)) and what should be gleaned from that.\n* One of the student protests was specifically against a campus republican group working with ICE to report their hispanic classmates. At the forefront of this group were \"white Latinos\" who were acting as the shock troops of the white nation, proving their loyalty similar to how Irish and Italian amerikans would engage in violence against Eastern European migrants.\n* Within all this, there are still attempts at organizing that exist outside of the chaos of the spontaneous movements and opportunists which are trying to unite the masses involved into a more concrete, organized form.\n\nThe one additional thought I'll add is the differentiation between this and the spontaneous Pro-Palestine protests that emerged. Back then, the movement was infested with NGOs right from the beginning with many well prepared to neuter any momentum that was building (think JVP's immediate call for \"Ceasefire Now\"). Which brings things further back to the George Floyd Uprisings. I get some sense that we may see a return to that style of spontaneous *uprising* as many of these protests seem to clash with police as they pass into curfew hours. NGOs and opportunists will similarly have to play catch up to try and corral things. These are all initial thoughts and I have limited, off-hand memory of the George Floyd Uprisings so only time will tell.",

There are many lessons to be learned from all of these historical encounters that are of central relevance to communists.\n\nStill, the recent victories delivered to the west in Syria and Lebanon as well as Russia and China's failure to significantly advance in Ukraine and Taiwan respectively have ostensibly recalibrated the situation far beyond what even the most optimistic analysts in the west would have previously predicted. Though new forces will inevitably form to oppose and confront the European imperialist hegemony, much of the existing infrastructure that was built up and accumulated over decades to fight the U$ and NAFO currently lays in tatters.\n\nRussia is going into overtime in the Ukraine war with pitiful gains far beneath the scale that anyone would have desired from a war that has consumed this much of their precious time, manpower and resources. China's economic growth has stalled, a severe demographic crisis is knocking on their door, they face increasing competition in the chain of global supply from south and southeast asia, and their overall demographic and economic situation has shifted to a downward trajectory. Iran's regional sphere just got torched and Syria lays in ruins as the strength of Hamas and Hezbollah has been severely diminished. My assessment is that the task of communists at this moment is to pressure and confront the hegemonic status of bourgeois nationalist factions in Russia and China in carrying the banner of anti-imperialism while reshifting focus towards the successes of factions such as the Houthis that may be useful to a resurgent communist movement in the future.",

The struggle of the Palestinian National Liberation movement is not comparable to Russia's war in Ukraine. One is a National Liberation war between an oppressed nation and a settler-colonial one and the other is an imperialist war between an imperialist nation and a semi-colony controlled by a fascist comprador regime.\n\nThe narrative you have presented here is identical to the Dengist one, but instead of their delusional optimism you realize the weakness of Russian and Chinese imperialism and are pessimistic about it. You can't expect anti-imperialism from imperialist countries, Russia and China can only be anti-imperialist again when a second revolution occurs in each nation and puts them back on the Communist Path.",

It will not be capable of rising to the level of it's imperialist competitors and things will come to a head eventually. The weakness of Russian imperialism is more immediately obvious to all except the most delusional and the Ukrainian War is but a prelude to the major conflict that is forming, like the Manchurian War in WW2.",

The so-called \u201canti-West\u201d states today are not a real alliance but rather free agents making deals and opportunistic maneuvers where they can and each of them is currently facing major setbacks and declining. The short term economic growth in China that was scrapped from the defeat and selling of socialism has been near entirely if not fully exhausted and the looming crises are becoming unavoidably severe; currently no one expects China to mount a successful offensive against the western sphere and their capacity to do so will only be further diminished overtime on the current trajectory. Simultaneously, first world whites have near universally united across the range of political factions to focus on confronting China due to Russia and Iran's sinking relevance as competitors, not unlike how internal Zionist factions (regardless of whatever internal friction they have) unanimously rally to attack their unambiguous enemy of Palestinians and defend their settler interests during periods of open confrontation.",
