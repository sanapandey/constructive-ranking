    "selftext": "I have been mulling this over a lot for the past two days now.\n\nUSAID was basically created to contain and destroy communist movements across the world. It has been an arm of CIA interference for most of its existence.\n\nThe heavy irony of someone like Elon Musk calling it a \"far leftist Marxist organization\" while posting stories about its disruptive activities in Cuba has not been lost on me. But... this is kind of serious. USAID being dismantled is a GOOD thing, and something a Marxist-Leninist party would also dismantle. It's literally a Cold War tool of containment. Can working class people who somehow believe it's \"Marxist\" ever be convinced that it is actually anti-communist and dismantling it serves the interests of socialist movements, especially in the developing world? Liberals are going to want to immediately prop it back up when they have their next cycle in power. That's actually very disturbing to me.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Though maybe other's here can explain if I'm wrong on this or not.",

The empire is cutting you off, entirely of it's own volition and economic necessity, which is the question you should be reckoning with -- what is actually possible if the upper limit of your politics is to beg the very empire which destroyed and ruined your country to toss you crumbs from their table as your primary lifeline for survival?  Just subsist and keep your head down?  Again, the empire it cutting your lifeline entirely of their own accord -- they are closing that door on you and for you and didn't think enough of you or the Cambodians to even consult you first.  Do you think if you beg them really hard they might restore it? And if so, for how long, and to what end?  Amerika is now counting the crumbs and even the welfare for it's own settler populace is getting slashed, and these people cheer the notion of abandoning Cambodia and other parts of the world to die if it might save a few more crumbs for themselves; despite already being the richest humans on the planet.  Less for you is more for them and belts are tightening.  The empire is the one telling you how to live your lives (now without USAID), not the communists who are longing to help you escape this horrible trap.",

The other side of it is yes we were using it to do bad things but in the end it is all accomplishing the same task! \nI think what's baffling me the most are those celebrating the funding cuts but not even questions where that money is now going to go? Because it's not like the trump admin is going to relocate these funds to boost social programs",
