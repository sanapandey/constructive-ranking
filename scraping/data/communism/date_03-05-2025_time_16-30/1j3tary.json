    "selftext": "Is the dialectic operative within nature, or only society? *History & Class Consciousness* says it\u2019s only a *sociological* law.\n\n> It is of the first importance to realise that the method is limited here to the realms of history and society. The misunderstandings that arise from Engels\u2019 account of dialectics can in the main be put down to the fact that Engels \u2013 following Hegel\u2019s mistaken lead \u2013 extended the method to apply also to nature. However, the crucial determinants of dialectics \u2013 the interaction of subject and object, the unity of theory and practice, the historical changes in the reality underlying the categories as the root cause of changes in thought, etc. \u2013 are absent from our knowledge of nature.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm\n\nThis doesn\u2019t just deviate from Engels. Hegel, Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao all thought that dialectics of nature exist.\n\n> The Idea is truth, for truth is the correspondence of objectivity with the Notion\u2026 But also everything actual, insofar as it is true, is the Idea... The individual Being is some one aspect of the Idea; hence it requires also other actualities, which likewise appear as existing specially for themselves; it is only in all of them together and in their relation that) the Notion is realised. The individual by itself does not correspond to its Notion; this limitation of its determinate existence constitutes its finitude and its downfall\u2026\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slidea.htm\n\nThis raises an explicitly political question. The division between bourgeois and proletarian science is key here: if we cannot use the dialectic to distinguish between the two, is there any method by which to determine if Soviet agronomy etc. is correct? Lenin at least argued that it was important.\n\n> For our attitude towards this phenomenon to be a politically conscious one, it must be realised that no natural science and no materialism can hold its own in the struggle against the onslaught of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of the bourgeois world outlook unless it stands on solid philosophical ground. In order to hold his own in this struggle and carry it to a victorious finish, the natural scientist must be a modern materialist, a conscious adherent of the materialism represented by Marx, i.e., he must be a dialectical materialist.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1922/mar/12.htm\n\nTo be a dialectical materialist in science. Lukacs originally rejected the dialectics of nature, but his essay *Tailism & the Dialectic* is the one that makes an argument as to why nature *is necessarily dialectical.*\n\n> So, the dialectic would not be a subjective thing, if it were a product of the economic and historical development of humanity. (Comrade Rudas would appear to understand objective as meaning the opposite of socially determined. Therefore he speaks of the 'objective process of production' in contrast to its 'capitalist husk', which obviously represents something subjective for Rudas (Arbeiterliteratur IX, pp. 515-16).) Clearly according to my conception, it is no such thing. The 'conundrums' that Comrade Rudas poses (ibid., p. 502) are very easy to answer. Self-evidently society arose from nature. Self-evidently nature and its laws existed before society (that is to say before humans). Self-evidently the dialectic could not possibly be effective as an objective principle of development of society, if it were not already effective as a principle of development of nature before society, if it did not already objectively exist.\n\nSociety arose from nature. Nature and its laws existed before society. How were did the dialectic poof into existence if it\u2019s purely sociological?\n\nI call this the \u2018accounting problem.\u2019 If dialectics applies to society, and society came from nature, how did the development of nature give rise to dialectics? That\u2019s what anyone who rejects its universality has to explain. The problem is that arguing an undialectical world gave rise to dialectics leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nCould an undialectical world be *negated* and create a dialectical one? The problem now is that negation is itself dialectical, and an undialectical world having the capacity to negate itself is a dialectical proposition. We run into a logical contradiction: dialectics both did and didn\u2019t exist at one-and-the-same-time, in the same sense. We have P and not-P simultaneously.\n\nIf someone did overcome the contradiction then we will have other questions to deal with. Why do society and nature follow two distinct metaphysics, while others can describe the world with only one, including that dialectical materialism is universal? At least these theories don\u2019t violate Occam\u2019s razor, making them better by default.\n\nWe have the answer to our political question: dialectics is universal. Accounting for how it isn\u2019t is the task of \u201canti-Engelsists\u201d etc. ",

Nature is not dialectics' starting point (a certain universality waiting to be negated, the world before God created man), because dialectics does not start.\n\nWhat is a \"natural\" state of things? Hegel's point is that it's *reality* which is contradictory/dialectical.",
