You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The class character of freemasons is obvious and the historical association between [freemasonry and fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_Due) is well known.",

Please explain why the mass base of freemasonry in Chile was wealthy families of bourgeoisie physicians and not the revolutionary proletariat or indigenous population. Then, in light of this, ask yourself why the greatest contribution to \"socialism\" by a freemason to date was a catastrophically failed attempt at reformism. You would be wise to avoid making bad faith arguments defensively here, there is no contradiction between this phenomena and the historical relationship of freemasonry to fascism nor was such a contradiction even semantically implied.",

What an utterly sheltered and out of touch take. You then proceed to describe the reactionary bourgeois \"egalitarian\" philosophy of these organizations without further comment and believe this somehow redeeming. It doesn't even occur to you that there is actually less space for the global masses to participate in this \"egalitarian\" philosophy than there is in Silicon Valley libertarianism. Forbidding \"discussion of religion and politics\" is not an advancement of proletarian class interests and nothing that transpires at these \"meetings\" serves the global masses in any way. The only interest proletarians have in relation to this matter is the violent suppression of freemasonry at the hands of the revolutionary masses (which you already conceded was the position of the global communist movement three responses ago).\n\nYour emotional defense of obviously reactionary \"religious beliefs\" coupled with your offensive and chauvinistic characterization of Arabs as irrational and ignorant (quote: *\"*[that would destabilize them internally to allow infidel troops on their holy land](https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/1eilq3m/comment/lgm8tem/)*\"*) masked as a criticism of \"religious fundamentalism\" lead me to doubt your ability to seriously engage with and interrogate these concepts. You are simply a fascist with an ignorant and patronizing perception of third worlders and you have failed to contribute meaningfully to this discussion beyond reacting, despite being given multiple chances to do so.",
