    "selftext": "The absolute bare minimum a socialist United States could do is give ALL federally owned land back to the respective nations that it occupies. Furthermore, granting First Nations complete and total sovereignty, recognizing the crimes the polity of the United States has committed (and continues to), and removing \u201cThanksgiving\u201d and \u201cColumbus day\u201d and other insidious holidays from being nationally observed.\n\nThis is not radical, it\u2019s the bare fucking minimum. In fact, this should\u2019ve happened well over 100 years ago. \n\nPersonally I think all judicially recognized treaties should be recognized and respected, but this includes giving the entirety of California, and many other states back to the First Nations which is unfortunately not very realistic anymore, but at the very least a socialist \u201cUnited States\u201d could recognize the sovereignty of First Nations in heavily populated with reparations, name changes, endorsement of a decolonial culture, etc.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why is it unrealistic to give \"the entirety of California, and many other states back to the First Nations?\" I suspect the answer to the latter question is informed by the assumptions you are making when about the former.\n\nAnd more importantly, what does \"bare minimum\" actually mean to you? I don't think anyone here disagrees that all of this needs to happen but everything you've proposed could conceivably happen under an exceptionally \"progressive\" form of liberalism - that should be taken as a sign that you aren't hitting any of this at its substance. You are conceding too much when you have no reason to.",
