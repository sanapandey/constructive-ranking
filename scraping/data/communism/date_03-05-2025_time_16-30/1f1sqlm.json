You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Marxism-Leninism has proven itself as the most effective weapon against capitalist imperialism. We are not sectarian and will work with any allies who wish to fight against capitalism, but we do not view Trotskyism, Maoism, Anarchism, or any other leftist philosophy as an effective model to adopt for ourselves.\n\n  \n>**Our Solidarity With Existing Socialist Countries is Unshakeable**. The People's Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam are models to the world of what can be achieved by working and oppressed people with the leadership of a communist party. We express solidarity with these countries, and with all countries who struggle for socialism and against imperialism.\n\n  \nSeems to be just another Dengist party.",

            "body": "First, you incorrectly posit organizing as a zero-sum game and suggest that revolutionaries cannot walk and chew gum at the same time- that we cannot rise to the occasion of running a campaign while also organizing workers. In fact, in many cases running a campaign actually allows us greater reach and increased flexibility to organize new workers - including those we cannot reach on a shop floor. \n\nIn that same section, you also suggest that the singular or at least primary metric for success a communist could hope to have in the presidential elections is measured in votes. This is another incorrect framing. Sure, votes are great - it\u2019s nice to see people really reject the capitalist system and cast their votes for a socialist program. It\u2019s a useful piece of data. But the success of a campaign is measured in many ways - how many and what caliber of organizing conversations do we have? How many people hear about socialism for the first time? How many new contacts have we made? How many of those become volunteers or otherwise engage with promoting the socialist solutions to the problems of our society? How many campaign volunteers turn into organizers for a whole new system? How many existing organizers learned new skills and were stretched and sharpened to be stronger, more capable than before?\n\nLater, you suggest that engaging with workers around bourgeois elections because that is where their attention is placed is incorrect and amounts to tailism. The fact is, the major elections are still the one time a majority of our class are trained to think of themselves as political actors with any political power. To accept your line of thinking is to throw away an opportunity to say: \u201cyes you are political actors but you are political actors in a rigged system that lies to you about your power. Your real power isn\u2019t a vote once every 2 or 4 years, but every day. We want your vote, sure, but more than that we want you to join the struggle - 365 days a year, we can be political actors!\u201d \n\nWithout a campaign and a campaign platform to give concreteness to our demands and to shape people\u2019s understanding of class struggle, without the opening that the election presents, workers will see us telling them to boycott their \u201cpolitical power\u201d, they won\u2019t be open to us, they will not see our seriousness, and so we will unnecessarily limit our reach. \n\nFinally, we agree that it is useful for communists to engage with elections to expose how undemocratic our system is - but this argument undermines the rest of the article. How else will we expose it other than to run in earnest? We have to demonstrate that we are working tirelessly to engage with workers, to build support, to promote a socialist program. We have to get the signatures and pay the fees and to pursue rightful access to ballots and debate stages - only to be undemocratically suppressed. That is how our class learns. Not because they are lectured from the sidelines, but by the experience of shoulder to shoulder struggle against the system, in all its manifestations.",

If you have a 30 minute meeting with a worker to go over how many of their coworkers signed union authorization cards, you can\u2019t have a 30 minute meeting to talk about your presidential platform. You can do one or you can do the other or you can have a 1 hour meeting. \n\nI was really specific about time in the article for exactly this reason. I\u2019m talking about hours per organizer per organization. *No party* has enough organizers and organizing hours to get millions of workers into a union or out on strike because no one has. \n\n>In that same section, you also suggest that the singular or at least primary metric for success a communist could hope to have in the presidential elections is measured in votes. \n\nI did not. This is further clarified in the last section.  \n\n>How many of those become volunteers or otherwise engage with promoting the socialist solutions to the problems of our society? How many campaign volunteers turn into organizers for a whole new system?\n\nWhy are you asking me these questions? I would love to know how many election volunteers became organizers for socialism \u2014 and more specifically \u2014 what exactly being an organizer for a new system means and what does it quantifiably produce? Workers organizations? How many? Unions? Strikes? Workers councils? Direct seizure of bourgeois firms?\n\n>Later, you suggest that engaging with workers around bourgeois elections because that is where their attention is placed is incorrect and amounts to tailism. The fact is, the major elections are still the one time a majority of our class are trained to think of themselves as political actors with any political power.\n\nI dealt with this directly in the last section, \u2018When should Marxist Leninists participate in bourgeois elections?\u2019\n\n>Finally, we agree that it is useful for communists to engage with elections to expose how undemocratic our system is - but this argument undermines the rest of the article. How else will we expose it other than to run in earnest?\n\nI recommend reading Lenin\u2019s \u2019Two Tactics of Social Democracy\u2019 as well as the chapters of \u2018History of the CPSU(B)\u2019 which deal with bolsheviks in the Duma (Russian parliament). The way the parliaments work is very different from congress. Elections are also very different and the Bolsheviks selected their candidates by having members of already-existing workers organizations elected as delegates and sent to the Duma. The equivalent in the US would be to have UAW workers in every congressional district pick one of their members to run for congress on a platform that the UAW wrote. There\u2019s no socialist party that has a workers organization from which to draw such delegates. Running a candidate in the hopes that exposure to socialist ideas will spur workplace organizing is putting the carriage several miles in front of the horse.",
