You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": ">In the contemporary era, access to abortion, even in legal states, remains problematic. Working women are dying in areas where the nearest obstetrician or gynecologist is hours away, and the window to get seen is months or a year away. For instance, in Mississippi,\u00a0[the closure of the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization](https://www.npr.org/2023/06/23/1184071362/dobbs-forced-a-clinic-to-close-but-it-hasnt-stopped-the-owner-from-opening-more), the state\u2019s last abortion clinic, has left women with no in-state options for abortion services, forcing them to travel long distances and navigate numerous legal and logistical barriers to obtain care. This situation is exacerbated in U.S. territories like\u00a0[Puerto Rico and Guam](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/27/1101700379/hurdles-to-abortion-will-mount-on-remote-u-s-territories-without-roe), where healthcare infrastructure is often inadequate, and legal restrictions further limit access to necessary reproductive services. On\u00a0[Native American reservations](https://19thnews.org/2023/10/indigenous-people-abortion-access/), the Hyde Amendment restricts the use of federal funds for abortion,\u00a0[severely limiting access for women who rely on the Indian Health Service](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-hyde-amendment-and-coverage-for-abortion-services-under-medicaid-in-the-post-roe-era/). These examples underscore the systemic inequities that persist in reproductive healthcare, highlighting the urgent need for revolutionary change to address these conditions.\n\nThe article isn't really that good but this passage gives base contradiction to it's own title. As we are all sorely aware of, there is no Communist Party that exists here and given this basic fact, it's unclear what defending, \"every working class conquest\" represents. At least with the example given of the difficulties of abortion on the rez, the article they share says this:\n\n>\u201cRoe has never been accessible for Native women,\u201d said Lauren van Schilfgaarde, a tribal law specialist at UCLA who\u00a0[has studied](http://journals.law.harvard.edu/jlg/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2023/04/Tribal-Nations.pdf)\u00a0abortion care in Indigenous communities. \u201cWhen you add in the rates of violence and the complete gutting of tribal governments\u2019 abilities to respond, you have a real dangerous recipe in which Native women have a lack of reproductive health.\n\n[https://19thnews.org/2023/10/indigenous-people-abortion-access/](https://19thnews.org/2023/10/indigenous-people-abortion-access/)\n\nWhich begs the question of what that, \"working class conquest\" really is, or more bluntly, which working class? Returning to the article, the prior example they gave was with Arizona:\n\n>In Arizona, the struggle for abortion rights exemplifies the broader national conflict between state-level protections and\u00a0[entrenched legal challenges](https://www.azpm.org/p/headlines/2024/11/25/222783-legal-challenges-loom-as-abortion-is-enshrined-in-arizonas-constitution/). Despite voters approving a measure to expand abortion access, the implementation of this constitutional amendment faces significant obstacles.\n\nThe worry is on the impermanence of the reforms but that almost feels like a silly thing to focus on considering what was also passed was Prop 314, a further expansion of state violence on migrants. It's truly a false victory and displays clearly the hard limits of legal reforms *for* the u.$. What good does the legalization of abortion do for those who, by the letter of the law, exist outside of it and lack any meaningful protections. That doesn't immediately necessitate reforms to immigration, but instead shows the contradiction of thinking within the bounds of the nation state (specifically the u.$. here) versus the nature of what, \"the working class\" here is composed of (at least the true lower and deeper aspects of it). Having seen the somewhat sad aftermath of the 2022 Roe v Wade protests, Communists need to seriously address that contradiction and consider the seriousness and necessity of swimming past the safety of legal sands beneath their feet and into the dark precipice where the ocean floor drops out below them.",

            "body": "It's so frustrating that rather than respond to any of the good criticisms in the OP's multiple posts from this website, they instead ignored them and tried to spam every new article at once. This is one of the major difficulties of a communist discussion space. Most people involved in movements are simply not interested in discussion and see us as nothing more than resources to be harvested and the site as free advertising and the closer they are to having something interesting to say, the more they will only abuse your generosity. It's annoying enough when it's one group doing this, but worse when one gets away with it all the others think they can too and the subreddit quickly becomes a spam competition. Though given half the front page of r/socialism is PSL articles right now, I assume eventually the situation resolves itself when one group worms its way into moderation and then the struggle for ad space moves to behind the scenes. \n\nUnfortunately, this means this will be the last time this site is allowed unless a poster I recognize posts it for discussion and criticism. It also reflects poorly on the site and its members, who are incapable of acting like human beings rather than vectors of marketing logic. Which, to be fair, happened with the previous iteration of this org.",
