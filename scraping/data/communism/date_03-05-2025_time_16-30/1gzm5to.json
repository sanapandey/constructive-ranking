    "selftext": "Hello comrades! As many have recommended since the election I picked up a copy of \u201cOn Tyranny\u201d and well so far, I hate it. Snyder keeps talking about communism in the same breath as fascism, often equating the anti-democratic nature of the Nazis with communism in the 20th century. Often he specifically mentions Czechoslovakia, making me think he must have emigrated from there as a kid or something. He has some serious beef with communism but never clearly articulates what\u2019s so anti-democratic about it. Literally he gives not a single example. Anyway maybe if anyone has an opinion about what was so anti-democratic about Czech communism from 46-89 that would be appreciated.",

He's a huge proponent of the Holodomor myth, and his primary concern during the Gaza genocide has been to tweet incessantly about how bad Trump and Vance is and make vague allusions to future \"authority\" that the Americans might suffer under (or, most likely, to sell his wretched book), and he's refused to express himself publicly on the matter even as his lectures have been shut down by protests.",

            "body": "This is an incomplete answer as while I'm Czech I've only recently started educating myself, so a lot of this is still based on public opinion, and thus likely some parts I might be unaware of being propagandised yet - and it's almost impossible to find information that isn't highly sensationalized.\n\nThe biggest thing people point to were the political trials - Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1 in 1950, Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd, Oatis and Zen\u00e1hl\u00edk in 1953 (among other lower profile trials).\n\nHor\u00e1kov\u00e1 was a national socialist and feminist, she had a favorable view of the USSR through a feminist lens, but turned against the communist's takeover of the country through the National Front coalition, she continued contact with NatSoc politicians in exile and was senteced to death. This is the most polarizing one, her buddies were happy to flee to the western capitalists for help, but she did seem like a well meaning person, that's going into personal opinion of course, but that was reflected in public's view of the trial, as the sentence was seen as unncessarily harsh.\n\nSlansky and co. were said to be Trostkyists but I don't know about them tbh, Oatis was in fact in contact with the French, and I don't know much about Zenahlik. \n\nSource (in Czech): https://www.nacr.cz/verejnost/badatelna/digitalni-badatelna/politicke-procesy\n\nThe trials were carried out in Soviet style with (allegedly, didn't check primary sources) rehearsed testimonies, with the current (western) explanation for them being that the KS\u010cM needed someone to blame for failed economic policies (that was part of Slansky's trial) and to drum up support for the goverment by swiftly pointing out enemy spies.\n\nThen there is the Warsaw Pact \"invasion\" of Czechoslovakia in 68, which was in response to (then head of the KS\u010cM) Dub\u010dek's reforms, which ranged somewhere between Dengist and full liberalizationthough Dub\u010dek decided to lead with free press, which quickly turned to \"lets talk about those trials from the 50s again\" and followed by Two Thousand Words manifest by Vacul\u00edk, a liberal author, calling for further reforms and accepting blame on the part of the communists, while the manifest didn't call for liberalization as policy, it did allude to it, so while Dub\u010dek probably didn't foresee this going that far, the \"conservative\" communists within the party wrote a letter to Moscow to come and stop the counter revolution that was brewing in Prague (and they were not wrong, one of the leading members of Prague Spring would go on to become our first lib president, V\u00e1clav Havel, also a prominent member of the CIA-backed (admitted a few years ago by their correspondent) Charta 77 movement).\n\nSorry that I don't have much connective tissue between these events, I still need to learn more.",
