I also want a vibe check from our English and Scottish comrades.\n\nThe WUN began 5+ years ago as a response to all the leftists and nationalists (who in Wales are often both or run in the same crowd) who only wanted to talk about what was wrong, and do nothing about it. We started fixing up buildings, repairing community spaces in working class communities, and doing free food/goods to those that needed it.\n\nThis work and the comrades who formed around it went to form the base of Plaid Gomiwnyddol Cymru (the Communist Party of Wales) in 2023. It\u2019s been pretty successful for both groups so far in Wales, whilst other groups have formed and disappeared, we\u2019ve managed to stay healthy and growing.\n\nWe\u2019re a Marxist-Leninist party, quite strong anti-revisionist which translates into quite an anti-electoral position. We think this is why we\u2019ve done well as voter turnout is around 40-50% in Wales in Senedd or Westminster elections. \n\nThis year we want to break out of our bubble a bit we particularly want to open up discourse and discussion on the future of Britain.

I know what the end looks like but I'm powerless to do anything about it or even accelerate the timeline. Will we have to watch an entire generation of liberals turn to \"Marxism-Leninism\" in the form of NGO charity work? Are we really powerless to do anything except watch these people waste a decade of their lives? Apparently so, these politics pop up over and over again and I've run out of things to say.",

I\u2019ll point to two organisations as examples, one with correct political and the other with correct action, both within the \u201cBritish\u201d Isles. The first is Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland and the other is Palestine Action. In the the case of the former, their primary action seems to be through the \u2018Revolutionary Housing League\u2019 and their Republican and Palestinian solidarity, and while they are the most politically correct organisation in the \u201cBritish\u201d Isles, they don\u2019t seem to differentiate themselves from any other party beyond just having more principled stances. On the other hand, Palestine Action, while not being, nor claiming to be, a communist organisation, is far better at what might be considered revolutionary action in the first-world. So what alternative is there for first-world communist organisations that exist without a mass support base? Wasting time with charity or doing correct action isolated from a revolutionary class? Or is this a false dichotomy?",

They are of they are of immense value in further study of communist politics and are a great help in understanding the objectively non-revolutionary nature of the first-world working class. Rest assured, this conclusion is not one that is come to with any joy, but it is the reflection of the facts. It is for this reason that despite all the communist organising in the first-world, a revolutionary situation has rarely arisen and never succeeded.\n\n> The Welsh Underground Network said: \u201cThe network applauds and supports all involved in the occupation of this factory. Action like this is critical to ending the apartheid regime in occupied Palestine.\u201d\n\nThis is meaningless. Who cares that WUN supports Palestine Action? Why is WUN not taking this action themselves? The fact that a supposed communist organisation is taking less revolutionary action than an organisation that doesn\u2019t even claim to be communist says a lot. This was my point in juxtaposing Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland with Palestine Action; while the former clearly has a better theoretical understanding, this is not reflected in its activities. Correct revolutionary action is the result of correct revolutionary politics. If you do not have the former, it is likely because you do not have the latter either.\n\nTo be fair to you and your organisation, as a \u201cBritish\u201d communist myself, I do have sympathy with Welsh and Scottish communists, and I appreciate any communist who looks beyond the moribund arguments put forward by the Social-Chauvinists that by simply reconstituting the CPGB on revolutionary lines then everything will work out. Clearly the CPGB did not work in its own day, it certainly won\u2019t work today. More work is needed in the study of or communism in the \u201cBritish\u201d Isles and there have been revolutionary points, but nothing revolutionary has come from the Social-Chauvinist who cling to the idea of a \u201cBritish\u201d nation. It is for this reason that Welsh and Scottish communists are all the more important, but that doesn\u2019t mean they should be doing the same thing as other revisionist organisations except exclusively within their own nation. The first thing that must be done is to really look into the history of communism in the \u201cBritish\u201d Isles and to find where the revolutionary line has been. Only then can proper politics begin.",

We did examine the core of how British communism \u2018began\u2019, we\u2019re lucky to have had a great deal of first hand material on that as one of the two largest bases of members in the first years were the coalfields in south wales and up in Glasgow. We saw how very early on there was an attachment to electoral victories and a refuting of utilising national movements to break up the imperialist British state (see: John Maclean vs Willie Gallacher in Scotland). This, combined with the 100ish years that followed, showed that every tactic attempted had not worked, so by taking it back to the core, we believe that the weakest link in the imperialist chain in Britain is likely the national movements.\n\nI simply don\u2019t agree that there is no revolutionary potential - because one thing was or wasn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean that something will be or not be. As Marxists, we continually examine conditions as they are now, not as they were then. A mistake made is an opportunity to change tactic and mine, we have identified mistakes (an attachment to Britain and to bourgeois elections as a means to victory for the working class) and have changed our course.\n\nI\u2019d like to ask: what is your parties line on Britain, England, Wales and Scotland? This is actually why I shared this, I want to deepen understand and dialogue between our movement and our comrades in England and Scotland\u2019s political organisations.",

It\u2019s not like ideological lineages can be imposed from an international center, and so the only recourse is for people to fumble in the dark. \n\nI think what\u2019s interesting about the present day is that process of adoption and development leaves groups like this functionally irrelevant. At least within the anglophone world, the only real spontaneous proletarian trade-union struggles occurring today are based on/around guest/migrant/refugee workers. \n\nI think your reference to the SDS is apt, because the SDS was at least conscious of the fact that they were white and non-proletarian. However, groups like this don\u2019t seem genuinely conscious of that fact. The SDS was unique because they developed in concert with and subordinated to RAM and the BPP. \n\nThe Welsh nationalists being posted about here don\u2019t seem to have anything comparable (besides, perhaps, Hamas and the wider struggle for a free palestine).",
