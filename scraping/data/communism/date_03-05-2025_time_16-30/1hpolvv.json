    "selftext": "Comrades,\n\nI live in Czech republic and I'd like to share my concerns about our primary communist party, \"Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KS\u010cM)\". I'm afraid the party is starting to move away from Marxism-Leninism.\n\nWhile KS\u010cM identifies socialism as its ultimate goal, its current program emphasizes \u201ca democratic society of free and equal citizens\u201d built on \u201cpolitical and economic plurality\u201d and explicitly rejects \u201crestrictions on democracy, discrimination, or repression for opinions.\u201d Although I understand their effort to adapt to the modern era, several issues deeply trouble me:\n\n**1. Lack of focus on class struggle**: The KS\u010cM\u2019s program hardly mentions class struggle, a fundamental pillar of Marxism-Leninism. Without emphasizing the central role of the working class and their fight against bourgeois exploitation, the party risks losing its revolutionary foundation.\n\n**2. Western influence on Stalin and the cult of personality**: The KS\u010cM seems to have uncritically absorbed Western propaganda about Stalin, dismissing the critical role he played in building socialism, defeating fascism, and leading the USSR. Their outright rejection of \"the cult of personality\" appears more like a concession to bourgeois narratives than a principled stance.\n\n**3. Democratic socialism over revolutionary action**: The party seems to prefer a democratic path to socialism, which often leads to reformism instead of genuine revolutionary change. This is at odds with the Marxist-Leninist understanding that bourgeois democracy is inherently a tool of the capitalist class.\n\n**4. Pluralism and compromise:** Political and economic plurality, as highlighted in the KS\u010cM\u2019s program, risks allowing counter-revolutionary forces to infiltrate and undermine the foundations of socialism.\n\n**5. Weak commitment to proletarian internationalism**: KS\u010cM focuses heavily on a national context, often neglecting the importance of global solidarity among workers. Marxism-Leninism teaches us that socialism cannot thrive in isolation and requires coordinated international efforts.\n\nI fear that KS\u010cM has become overly influenced by contemporary bourgeois political norms and has lost its revolutionary spirit. A communist party should be the vanguard of the working class, leading the fight against capitalist exploitation, both nationally and internationally.\n\n  \n**Have you seen similar trends in communist parties in your country?**\n\n**Do you think it would be better to try and reform the party from within or to start a new communist party that fully respects the core principles of Marxism-Leninism?**\n\nThank you all for your thoughts.",

If its a bureaucratized and anti-democratic sect where the line is fixed from on-high and not open to criticism and change from the rank and file, if, in other words, there's no mechanism for reform built into the party, then that only leaves one choice. If you believe such change *is* possible, then you'd want to agitate for your views among the rank and file, in party publications, etc. At the end of the day continually splitting and ignoring the existing left wont get us anywhere but a proliferation of sects, which is how things stand already here in the US, so if it can be avoided it probably should be.",

I have and I seem to be coming increasingly to the conclusion that there is no point to it. Albeit perhaps AKEL is somewhat unique in that it was never supposed to be the CP itself but a legal front, therefore its very foundations may be built on uncommunist ground. Of course the Filipino and Peruvian Maoists managed to reconstitute the CPP and PCP but are those a general rule or an exception? Finally I don't know what it's like inside the KSCM but everything I have seen of them from the outside doesn't inspire much if any confidence.",

Second, the revolutionary line is probably always going to be fighting as a minority. The Bolsheviks, despite the meaning of that word, we're the minority faction in the RSDLP. If we're not willing to be in that position then all we'll ever have is sects",

I've read that a lot of the former Eastern Bloc countries have outlawed certain phrases, symbols, and praise for socialist figures and I thought that was why KS\u010cM doesn't use the hammer & sickle symbol. I'm wondering if this is also why they don't talk about class struggle, revolution, or say positive things about Stalin? I don't live in the Czech Republic so I don't know first hand.",

For example, publicly displaying symbols like the hammer and sickle or swastika can be prosecuted under laws against promoting totalitarian ideologies, depending on the context. This legal framework might be one reason why KS\u010cM avoids using the hammer and sickle and refrains from openly praising figures like Stalin or discussing class struggle and revolution. However, I think the primary reason lies in their strategic choice to appeal to a broader electorate. Since the fall of socialism in 1989, the majority of Czech society has been heavily influenced by anti-communist narratives, which dominate public discourse, education, and media. As a result, KS\u010cM has softened its rhetoric and moved closer to a social-democratic position to survive politically. Unfortunately, this shift has distanced them from the principles of Marxism-Leninism, which I find problematic. While I understand their need to adapt to the political climate, it feels like they\u2019ve compromised their revolutionary foundation to the point where their connection to class struggle and socialism is almost nonexistent.",
