            "body": ">Is there any historical precedent for contradictions among Labor Aristocrats being turned into an out-and-out battle?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"out-and-out battle?\" Israel is not devoid of political struggle. Neither was apartheid-era South Africa. But these are not struggles that communists are particularly interested in. Even moving beyond social fascist politics among whites, are communists more interested in political struggles between \"colored\" people and whites in SA? Or Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jews in Israel? The record is dismal and one has to question why such peripheral, reformist struggles get so much attention over the much broader and more obviously revolutionary national liberation struggle. \n\nThe answer is, in this framing, we are the \"colored\" people, those who have been driven towards radical politics because we are excluded in some way from normative class reproduction but are not organically linked to the much larger struggle that conditions our lives and lurks behind the otherwise minor threat we pose. At least within Amerikan borders, the demographics are not as favorable to national liberation as in SA (though our situation is not that different from Israel). More fundamentally, our apartheid borders are the global system of national borders itself (without minimizing the specific nature of Amerikan internal apartheid and national oppression), meaning a \"native republic\" thesis is not obvious and there are no reformist solutions to apartheid. But demographics are irrelevant to taking a principled line since our goal is to redefine them until a revolutionary subject emerges, not take bourgeois sociology at face value. \n\nI think the term \"crypto-Trotskytist\" is useful for so-called \"anti-revisionist\" politics that are primarily concerned with the labor aristocracy, since in South African this explicitly fell on racial lines:\n\n>Groups in South Africa that adhered to the International Left Opposition were always minuscule and poverty stricken. There were only branches in Cape Town and Johannesburg, with a handful of supporters in Durban and Port Elizabeth. This was not very different from the spread of the Communist Party: it reflected the sparseness of population and the siting of transport, colleges and industry. The different social structures of the provinces inevitably affected the perceptions and activities of the groups; they had to find their constituents from the local population and had to advance ideas that would get a response.\n\nhttps://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/trotskyist-groups-south-africa-retrospective-view-baruch-hirson-encyclopedia-trotskyism\n\nWhereas the communist party fused with the national liberation movement, the most important result for Trotskyism was\n\n>the multiracialist, Trotskyist Unity Movement which, in large numbers, dominated Coloured politics in the Western Cape.\n\nhttps://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0018-229X2010000200022\n\nYou can read more about it here (from an extremely biased, racist Trot)\n\nhttps://www.sahistory.org.za/article/non-european-unity-movement-neum\n\n>The basis for the programme of the NEUM was conceived within the ranks of the Workers Party of South Africa (WPSA), a small group of Cape Town based Trotskyists who stressed the centrality of the land question and the demand for the vote in their programme...\n\n>The WPSA was a Trotskyist organisation and many of the points in its programme were similar to that of other anti-Stalinist, socialist, groups. It attacked international finance capitalism, warned of an impending imperialist war, condemned fascism, and so on. In analysing South Africa the WPSA tried to break new ground, partly to condemn the Comintern instruction that the CPSA work for a 'Black Republic', a slogan that the WPSA found repugnant.\n\n>The WPSA programme commenced with an account of land possession in South Africa and pointed to the concentration of land holding in the hands of big capital. The vast majority of farmers, particularly African cultivators, owned little land. Consequently the programme writers concluded that the central question in the country was the land question, which was 'the alpha and omega', the axis around which the revolution in South Africa would revolve. They called on the white workers to support the black peasants in their demands if they were to have any stake in a transformed society, but gave little attention to the black workers, viewing them mainly as peasants who worked temporarily in the mines.\n\n>The WPSA also accepted the criticism [of Trotsky] that their rejection of the Black Republic slogan had been a polemical exaggeration arising from their criticism of the Comintern. But this too did not lead to any changes: the Black Republic slogan was not used in WPSA propaganda nor is it certain that this slogan ever persuaded members of the WPSA to concentrate their work in the nationalist movement...\n\n>They did not appeal to pan-Africanism, to a glorification of blackness; they did not discuss problems of language, or of common nationality, because these were not issues that were thought to bear on the future struggle.\n\nDo not be confused by the \"land question,\" without national liberation this was just a reflection of petty-bourgeoisie ambition to land ownership and intellectual leadership of the masses \n\n>The [NEUM's 10-point] programme (in its expanded form)... avoided all the questions of how the new democratic state was to be brought into existence and, consequently, how the land would be redivided. But, in fact, that was not the crucial question that had to be posed at the time. If the movement was serious in its intent it had to send its organisers across the country to speak to those 'working the land' and provide tactics for opposing existing land legislation. Except for one corner of the eastern Cape this was never done. Point 7 remained abstract and academic without organisational content. Not unnaturally this was eventually one of the points on which the NEUM split in 1958 - Tabata saying that land could be bought, Kies and others claiming that there could be no private property in land.\n\nThe rest of the program being generic reformist demands. Notice that the practical effect of ignoring black national liberation was reformist politics within the intermediate colored strata despite Trotsky's own criticism of \"Trotskyism\" in practice. If you absolutely refuse to take liberalism in Israel seriously, South Africa is the next best case study for politics within a settler context\n\nhttps://www.google.com/books/edition/Not_White_Enough_Not_Black_Enough/qLw8KzRbRdQC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover\n\nThis book has a much better discussion of the NEUM movement. Its goal is to understand why colored people became the bedrock of the Democratic Alliance despite their racial oppression. Though since the American \"left\" mostly corresponds to relatively disenfranchised \"working class\" whites, this book is probably more relevant to understanding the mainstream of labor aristocratic social fascism rather than the \"communist/colored\" fringe\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/ordinary-white-south-africans-and-apartheid-bound-to-a-racist-system-they-helped-prop-up-232774\n\n>the history of \u201cordinary\u201d whites shows that, from its early months in power, the state first sharpened its social engineering methods on whites it considered \u201cproblematic\u201d. Drunks; chronically idle and itinerant men; those employed in jobs positioned on the same levels as Blacks.\n\nAll political efforts oriented around these \"problematic\" whites obviously failed except to advance the relative position of \"working class\" whites. But that doesn't mean their struggles were fake, you have to accept that taking a principled position means you will not always be involved with what appears to be \"possible\" because it is legal and corresponds to ideology of the status-quo.",

History proved that the Trotskyist line was wrong and that colored people defended their privileges in alliance with whites once they shared the common threat of African political power. At best you will get individuals who are able to commit class suicide and nevertheless should be treated with suspicion and kept away from leadership positions. Every single attempt at forging an alliance with white radicals and black proletarians in the US ended in disaster, and Sakai showed there were many attempts. Notably, this extends to all the populations that became white in the American context, of whom there are probably many more than the original settlers.\n\n>The dominant political expression of every oppressed nation today is one that abuses and exploits its most oppressed stratum\n\nThere is still a fundamental difference between South African black workers taking out their frustration on other African workers and the imperialist relationship between white labor aristocrats and black proletarians. The existence of the Black Hundreds and national chauvanism in Russia was not sufficient to prevent the Bolshevik revolution because for the mass of Russian peasants and workers exploitation was the primary contradiction. National chauvanism and bigotry have a much longer history than monopoly capitalism. But once revolution was not successful in Western Europe it was clear that imperialism is decisive once a labor aristocracy forms. This is the foundation of the theory, I think you've forgotten the fundamentals in your attempt to try to understand the seeming complexity of politics today. While we can indulge in a concept of a \"consumer aristocracy,\" this only makes sense in the context of monopoly capitalism putting certain populations in the position of \"post-industrial\" management of the surplus value of the third world, by itself existing in a world of global commodity production is not sufficient as the basis of a labor aristocracy. This is I think one of the fundamental flaws of Torkil Lauesen's thought and why he has become a Dengist, since he has lost the ability to find a revolutionary subject (since even Chinese people \"exploit\" each other by buying commodities within an uneven national space).\n\n>If we are really intent on globalizing this \u201ccolored\u201d conception then we have to take it seriously and consider what it means to group those most oppressed stratum together, unite with their friends, and attack their enemies.\n\nThe point of the comparison is that the colored population was even smaller than the white population and equally irrelevant. It may have taken more radical forms, even acting like a place for dissident communists when white society was hostile to all communists, but that was just petty-bourgeois politics in a different form.\n\nRadicals in the labor aristocracy are barely a drop in the bucket in the face of billions of proletarians worldwide and in today's age of widespread literacy and decades of communist political history in every country, they don't need us. So why do you care? Obviously because we're talking about ourselves as \"friends.\" But there's no reason to build a theory around this and doing so leads to chauvanism very easily. If our lives come and go it will make no difference to the movement of History.",

While it is true the latter made itself immediately irrelevant and hopelessly reformist, the former did eventually turn into opportunism, where the CPSA became the right flank of post-apartheid SA integrating into global capitalism (and global white supremacy). In that regard you're not wrong to point to a kind of \"imperialist pyramid\" where, if not the masses of South Africa, the black ruling class serves as a sub-imperialist regional force with the \"black republic\" thesis as an excuse. I've said much of what you've said in the OP myself, and you pushed it to its logical conclusion so I can see the opportunism inherent to a broad, amorphous definition of the labor aristocracy based on consumption or wage levels vaguely above a world average.\n\nThat is, while I think the essence of monopoly capitalism hasn't changed, there is danger in ignoring the specifics and applying crude third worldism to every situation in the hopes that we can just pick up where decolonization left off (and in Dengist fashion deny its limitations, blaming everything on the CIA and the IMF and whoever convinced the CPSU to restore capitalism against their own interests). Apartheid South Africa is a useful case study because, in its own fucked up way, it was a post-colonial state. \n\nStill, compromising with the labor aristocracy is not the way. The primary contradiction today remains the relative and absolute growth of the proletariat across the globe and if the labor aristocracy has grown as well as a result, we'll just have to go deeper. I do think we have to draw lines in the sand though. Defining the Chinese working class as non-proletariat is too much and we do have to differentiate between older forms of discrimination and those that derive \nfrom monopoly capitalism.\n\n>I think that my lack of care led me to a deviation where I assumed there was no proletariat at all within the borders of Amerika.

Even with Hamas filling the void, it is de-facto limited to Gaza, and while it has leveraged that territorial control well and there is no organic connection between the \"axis of resistance\" and the actual operation of Hamas as a political actor (the same contradiction has been noted in Hezbollah's sectarian role in domestic Lebanese politics and its ideology of resistance to Israel which gives it a base legitimacy beyond the Shia bourgeoisie).\n\nBut Palestinians are still a refugee population and the dispersed nature of Palestinians against the territorial control necessary to wage a war of resistance is a contradiction they have navigated with more general lessons. I don't think there's a shortage of case studies of combining the continued relevance of the nation-state form and the migration of proletarians in the age of globalization, you just have to think creatively about what is new instead of what is old.",

Though the definition holds by and large true today, I think that using the term prescriptively instead of descriptively leads to an extremely circular definition of the labor aristocracy, and also to some bizarre historical retrospective analysis - the working class in England that Engels described was most certainly not \"majority labor-aristocratic\" for much of England's existence as an imperialist power. \n\nActually, as I'm writing this I see how it relates to the recent discussion on whether South Korea is imperialist that me and u/AltruisticTreat8675 and u/whentheseagullscry were having.",

The study put China on the cusp between exploited and exploiting.\n\nMR goes further and says that China is \"net exploited.\" Although MR is also a Dengist and the king of applying bourgeois statistics to Marxism to made broad, spurious claims. So I would fall back on Lenin's consideration that imperialism is composed of 5 different categories and that, without diluting the centrality of monopoly capitalism too much, there is room to be stronger in one category than others. This is the solution the CPI Maoist came to, where they basically list the characteristics of imperialism and show how China fits them without bothering to compare them to a global standard. I've criticized their articulation before but I'm willing to reconsider after the last few years. If there is another world war, you don't win a prize for saying \"well technically China loses more surplus value than it gains.\"",

Portugal is an independent sovereign state, but actually, for more than two hundred years, since the war of the Spanish Succession (1701-14), it has been a British protectorate. Great Britain has protected Portugal and her colonies in order to fortify her own positions in the fight against her rivals, Spain and France. In return Great Britain has received commercial privileges, preferential conditions for importing goods and especially capital into Portugal and the Portuguese colonies, the right to use the ports and islands of Portugal, her telegraph cables, etc., etc. [10] Relations of this kind have always existed between big and little states, but in the epoch of capitalist imperialism they become a general system, they form part of the sum total of \u201cdivide the world\u201d relations and become links in the chain of operations of world finance capital.\n\nThe point that is implied but not explicitly stated is that Portugal *also* gets the privileges of its colonies under the tutelage of Britain. So it is a link in the chain (or rather block in the pyramid) with England at the head because the concrete history of the transition from colonialism to imperialism imprints on a world that already exists. I'm not the first one to make this point of course, anti-communist frontier states like Korea and Taiwan have often been thought of in these terms. The only difficulty is generalizing it since\n\n>commercial privileges, preferential conditions for importing goods and especially capital\n\nIs now a universal feature of a system of formally independent sovereign states.",

A theory of competing pyramids, which would capture inter-imperialist competition (which is, ultimately the point of the theory) would better but it would have to have a venn diagram like structure where inter-imperialist pyramids overlap without being identical. At a certain point, as u/Particular-Hunter586 points out, were starting to get away from an already coherent theory and terminology without sufficient cause. I'm only considering it because the KKE is one of the few forces in the world seriously confronting pro-Russia opportunists in the communist movement, a phenomenon more important than its numerical support because its internal logic requires a theoretical response.\n\n>Though the definition holds by and large true today, I think that using the term prescriptively instead of descriptively leads to an extremely circular definition of the labor aristocracy, and also to some bizarre historical retrospective analysis - the working class in England that Engels described was most certainly not \"majority labor-aristocratic\" for much of England's existence as an imperialist power.\n\nThis is the inevitable result of starting from bourgeois sociology and working backwards. One encounters the same problem when bourgeois scholars point out that for most of colonialism's history, it was unprofitable, at least on a balance sheet, and therefore a theory of colonial exploitation makes no sense. Or when it is pointed out that social democracy was an inevitable result of Marxism because the \"working class\" never became an absolute majority of the population, necessitating parliamentary compromise. This supposedly also counters some crude idea of absolute polarization of the population into bourgeoisie and proletariat. It has long been pointed out the dangers of relying on wages for a theory of imperialism. It is fine for an approximation to make a general point but, as u/urbaseddad pointed out earlier, it is only one form of superexploitation and possibly not even the primary one in the American settler context. Profits are not immediately ascertainable and the proletariat has never been a simple numerical value, Marxism is better than that.",

No equivalent (i.e. healthy, single, childless working minimum wage) proletarian in a Third World country could ever do such a thing.

There is an absolutely ridiculous amount of surplus value circulating in the US economy that even the poorest White workers have access to. Now guess where this surplus value comes from. The Third World and the internal colonies of the US, so the \"poor\" White worker still has an exploitative relation to labor on a global level since they receive net positive amount of surplus value.

They may benefit from the exploitation of the third world but they aren't actively profiting off unless they own stocks.\n\nYou're confusing yourself. We are discussing the labor aristocracy, that this class is not able to leverage its wealth into becoming bourgeois is true by definition. That the labor aristocracy are \"wage laborers\" is again true by definition, that is not what you yourself were previously discussing (since union officials are also wage laborers). \n\nRegardless, the point is not whether the labor aristocracy has sufficient wealth to no longer be considered proletarian. The point is that the definition of proletarian includes class consciousness which is oriented towards the revolutionary abolition of class society. You are defining things backwards, where a mechanical definition of \"wage labor\" is applied to society and then you are forced to explain why that class lacks any inkling towards revolutionary politics and accommodate yourself to the inevitability of reformism. The point of communism is to find the proletariat as a revolutionary subject for politics (as we have seen historically, this has always involved finding the proletariat where it was previously hidden, in the Russia and Chinese countryside, in the national liberation movements, in the jungles of Cuba, etc.). If you cannot find it, then your analytic framework has failed. The theory of the labor aristocracy is a late addition to Marxism (and a theory of a broad consumer aristocracy even later) because it observed what was actually happening and tried to find a material basis for it. Your insistence on wage labor is 200 years too late and has no value. It is completely alien to Marxism which has always been the minority tendency in the worker's movement until revolutionary ruptures force it to the front.",

Where did you get this from; can you elaborate?",
