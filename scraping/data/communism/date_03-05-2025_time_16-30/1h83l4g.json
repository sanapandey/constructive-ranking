    "selftext": "I did a bunch of online reading last night to argue that it's not. Well over half of their GDP comes from their private sector, they certainly have money and classes and a state so they're a far cry from Marxist. The working class doesn't really own the means of production; even for the argument that they have state socialism, the SOE's are run for profit. \n\nI can't seem to find information about if the individuals who run the government or occupy high party ranks are the wealthy elite or not. I can't find specific information on how the products of SOE's benefit the working class there. I sew that SOE's are becoming more privatised over time in the name of efficiency, which seems like a step away from socialism.\n\nIn my head, the picture I've painted of modern-day China is a state that tried to be socialist, but today does a lot of state capitalism and flat-out capitalism. What am I missing? ",

            "body": "One of my favourite things about the bigger posts on this subreddit is how people in the comments manage to present genuinely banal, tired arguments as daring new insights. It\u2019s always in the folksy tone as well for some measured distance from the take when a regular poster eventually calls them out. \n\nI always try and go back to the basics. What are the fundamental concepts of Marxism? What does it mean make and test a hypothesis according to dialectical materialism? If you really think through these ideas, 95% of what has been said will melt away. Pros and cons, personal beliefs, anecdotes and subjective position, all of these simply don\u2019t factor into a question like this because Marxism has developed so much further as a science. The only point that has some staying power within the bounds of Marxism is the Domenico Losurdo (and subsequently the Roland Boer book as well) NEP productive forces line but even that we can understand as a faulty hypothesis based on incorrect history and a revision of fundamental concepts. Its continued existence and recent popularity can be shown to have a real material base as well as another user hinted. \n\nOP if you are genuinely interested in these questions, I can find relevant posts from the sub. There\u2019s no point retracing the debate though because it\u2019s been had a million times before and there\u2019s nothing new about the way the question has been asked.",

Even so, the jargon is so alien and vacuous that I can't imagine it convinces anyone of much of anything. \n\nOP what are you reading? Every single serious work of scholarship defines China as capitalist, the alternatives are twitter posts in the form of books. The point is not to read them, which no one does, but the existence of one's argument in book form (with its historical aura as a medium) and the performance of reading to distinguish oneself as superior to everyone else online with the exact same superficial talking points and argument formula.\n\nOf course you could say works of bourgeois academia are incapable of understanding Marxism-Leninism and biased against China. That's true but there's a difference between petty-bourgeois sympathy for Maoism with the weaknesses of its class perspective and and a conspiracy to ignore facts that anyone can find on twitter. It may be comforting to imagine you don't need to do real research on subjects because academia is just a scam but unfortunately it's not true. There are not enough Marxists* to substitute for your own ability to read critically (I am using the Marxist definition, not the liberal pragmatism one) and too many subjects happening too fast. There really are no subjects left where scholarship is worthless, you just have to understand the relationship between the general class perspective of the petty-bourgeoisie and its specific application to a field. I understand that it takes confidence to sift through the genuinely useless work for the serious ones but that's what we're here for, I actually find helping people with that to be a productive use of my time whereas very broad questions like \"is China socialist?\" are understandable because of political immediacy but never go beyond the surface where twitter ideas can flourish.\n\n*Though there are plenty of serious works from real, revolutionary parties which also define China as capitalist. The alternatives are from pseudo-Trot groups which are fundamentally dishonest about their own political line and ideology. This is not a matter of sectarianism, before anything else there is simply a vast difference in the quality of the CPI-Maoist works on China and American Dengist junk cranked out very quickly in the last 5 years.",

I haven't read *Tyranny of the Weak* because I assume it's junk, it's not like he found some new trove of sources. You may notice that all of the books on North Korea that are any good are about the same time period 1945-1960. That's because that's what the sources that are accessible to scholars are about. Basically they go over the broadly popular nature of the revolution, which was violently suppressed in the South and allowed to continue in the North. Soviet documents have only reinforced this story by showing how hesitant the USSR was in Asia and the autonomy of the masses themselves in forcing a revolutionary solution to post-war compromises (though everyone already knew this, Soviet compromises after the war aren't exactly a secret). The liberal twist is to then whine about Kim Il-sung hijacking the revolution or whatever. But all serious scholarship begins from these premises. You read the works for specific facts, events, and figures and any work which claims to explain \"the regime\" is junk for airport bookshops.\n\n>it wouldn't be unreasonable to suspect that any liberal pushback against his 2013 edition would have reflected in the newer one. Have you noticed any such change in his later work?\n\nArmstrong got into trouble for plagiarism, presumably because he ran out of things to say for the reason explained above. That he also got into trouble for sexual harassment is, unfortunately, just an excuse to push him out by those opposed to his work, harassment is widespread in academia and I'm sure everyone was aware of his actions for decades. Armstrong's work is inferior anyway so it doesn't really matter, Suzy Kim wrote the better version using the same sources. There's even a new version of the same book that came out this year, 20 years later, this time the \"mundane\" revolution instead of the \"everyday\" one. From what I can tell, the person who pushed Armstrong out is a typical academic grifter, his work is not made up but of no importance and he works in South Korea where there is no academic freedom.\n\nAnyway the point is the \"revisionist\" event already happened in studies of the DPRK, there's not much left to say. Though unfortunately, most of the work on the arduous march is quite bad and in every field the discovery of documents from former socialist countries was a complete bust since social structures are autonomous and there is no one pulling the strings in secret. Like if we found a bunch of documents from the Trump white house showing he knew Ivermectin didn't cure covid this might be of historical interest but it wouldn't fundamentally change our understanding of the relationship between capitalism and the pandemic. Trump is just some guy, we already know that capitalism has its own logic.",

                    "body": ">Think the NEP but lasting significantly longer\n\nThe USSR had ended the NEP as early as 1928, and fully socialized the economy by 1936. They did so at a level of development (both relative and absolute) which is far inferior to modern China. They were less integrated into the world economy than modern China is. They were more isolated and had more enemies than modern China has. And yet, they managed to fully nationalize/collectivize their economy, and went on to give us 5 more glorious decades of socialism.\n\nLet's not forget that China also had a 7 year NEP period under Mao, from 1949-1956. Since then, China has had two decades of socialism and over four decades of \"NEP\"... There are no firm commitments to return to the socialist mode of production, and no major milestones offered to the Chinese masses so that they may keep their state accountable. Im sorry, it's a bit ridiculous to pretend that China needs \"NEP\" for 60, 70, 80 years in total. At what point do we stop making excuses for obvious opportunism?\n\n> \"We must under no circumstances turn our back on addressing blindness of the market, and we must not return to the old path of a planned economy.\" \n\n~ Xi Jinping, 2020\n\n> \"Socialism means the abolition of classes.\"\n\n~ Lenin, 1917",

Think the NEP but lasting significantly longer.\n\n''Material conditions'' is not a phrase that should be used to just hand-wave important details away and restrain the need for investigation. The situation in China just before the time of Deng's reforms was almost the opposite of the situation that the USSR was facing during the NEP; The Bolshevik party was preparing to implement collectivisation, and needed to socialise and consolidate their control over urban industries in the Soviet Union before liquidating the Kulaks in the countryside. China, on the other hand, already had collectivised agriculture which Deng was trying to dismantle and privatise in order to prepare for the restoration of capitalism in China",

A dictatorship of the proletariat is when the capitalist class is disenfranchised and the proletariat has a monopoly on power. The inverse of a capitalist state where the proletariat is disenfranchised and the capitalist class has a monopoly on power.\n\nIn a capitalist country the state answers to and serves the interests of the capitalist class. This is not the case in China, capitalists answer to the state in China. It's not just prosecuting  corruption, capitalists have no power over the state and when the Communist Party tells them to jump they ask how high.\n\nWhen it comes to the economic structure of China you should really read *Critique of the Gotha Programme* by Marx and *The State and Revolution* by Lenin, in particular chapter 5 where he breaks down what Marx wrote in *Critique of the Gotha Programme*. To quote Marx:\n\n>What we have to deal with here is a communist society, not as it has\u00a0*developed*\u00a0on its own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it\u00a0*emerges*\u00a0from capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges.\n\n>But these defects are inevitable in the first phase of communist society as it is when it has just emerged, after prolonged birth pangs, from capitalist society. Law can never be higher than the economic structure of society and its cultural development conditioned thereby.\n\nBut that's not even an accurate description of what we are dealing with here. We are dealing with a communist society as it emerges from a feudal society. An impoverished agrarian society devastated by over a century of being pillaged by colonizers and constant warfare.\n\nSo, as Marx says, law can never be higher than the economic structure of society and the economic structure of Chinese society with the founding of the PRC was impoverished feudalism. The concrete material conditions of society determine how it functions.\n\nMarx goes on to say (emphasis mine)\n\n>In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and with it also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished, after labor has become not only a livelihood but life's prime want, after the productive forces have increased with the all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly--**only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois law be left behind in its entirety** and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\n\nSo, until the higher stage of communism has been achieved you are going to see these inevitable defects. China has still not developed their productive forces (relative to the capitalist powers) to the level that Marx had envisioned for the lower stage of communism.\n\nThe path to the higher phase of communism is uncharted. Marx envisioned communism would arise out of the most advanced industrialized capitalist states. Instead it has arisen in the most backward and impoverished of agrarian states. Marxism is scientific. How the productive forces necessary for the higher phase of communism are developed should determined by the actual material conditions and should be open to experimentation, not dictated by idealism.",

Marx specifies exactly what bourgeois *right* he is referring to:\n\n>the individual producer receives back from society \u2013 after the deductions have been made \u2013 exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.\n\nI don't know what translation you're using but \"law\" is a poor term for what Marx is discussing, he uses it either to discuss abstract forces that determine incentive structures (the law of the rate of profit) or the literal meaning of bourgeois legality (which I think is what you're trying to smuggle in). Regardless, he then elaborates on the more fundamental issue of mental vs manual labor\n\n>But one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right. Right, by its very nature, can consist only in the application of an equal standard; but unequal individuals (and they would not be different individuals if they were not unequal) are measurable only by an equal standard insofar as they are brought under an equal point of view, are taken from one definite side only \u2013 for instance, in the present case, are regarded only as workers and nothing more is seen in them, everything else being ignored. Further, one worker is married, another is not; one has more children than another, and so on and so forth. Thus, with an equal performance of labor, and hence an equal in the social consumption fund, one will in fact receive more than another, one will be richer than another, and so on. To avoid all these defects, right, instead of being equal, would have to be unequal.\n\nHe specifies that this is very specifically *not* a society that produces commodities according to the market:\n\n>Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of total labor. The phrase \"proceeds of labor\", objectionable also today on account of its ambiguity, thus loses all meaning.\n\nAll of this was dealt with by the cultural revolution. In fact, I already addressed it elsewhere in the thread by defining socialism. \n\n>I never said the underlying mode of production in China is socialist. A dictatorship of the proletariat is when the capitalist class is disenfranchised and the proletariat has a monopoly on power. The inverse of a capitalist state where the proletariat is disenfranchised and the capitalist class has a monopoly on power.\n\nThis is quite literally a tautology. You've also changed to \"the capitalist class\" which is a dishonest reframing of \"capitalists\", your original term, and \"the bourgeoisie.\"\n\nAnyway your post is offensively bad and I no longer wish to talk to you. I only posted here in the first place because I was shocked to see one of the oldest posters on this subreddit emerge from the catacombs to defend China on pragmatic terms. I would rather drink mercury than debate with a Dengist telling other people to read the Critique of the Gotha Programme. Luckily, I have the power to do something about it.",

Everyone has their individual complaints and criticisms, of course, but the government and the Communist Party enjoy high levels of support due to their active involvement in improving the lives and living conditions of the average working people in the country. I can personally attest to seeing Communist Party officials dealing with poverty, aggressively pursuing the improvement of their local areas, and listening attentively to the concerns of the public when shaping policy. I lived through COVID in China and consider the CPC as having safeguarded my life through the difficult and dangerous extreme situation. In my area of China, they were communicative, nuanced, cautious, and self-sacrificing. I came away with a very high opinion of the Party members I met.\n\nI can also attest that, while there naturally are career politicians in one of the largest political parties in the world, the CPC is internally stacked with doctrinaire, intelligent Marxist-Leninists, bolstered by the leadership of General Secretary Xi Jinping. While revisionism exists within the country as it unfortunately does in most major leftist political parties today, the CPC is still a vital, powerful revolutionary force in the world today - seeking to build socialism in a world where the counter-revolution is stronger than ever. We cannot follow them blindly, of course, but we cannot reject them outright without throwing the baby out with the bath water.\n\nWestern Marxists MUST learn from modern China, as the experience of the Chinese revolution and its reform shows how to successfully conduct reform without the political instability and insanity of policies like Perestroika and Glasnot. Reform of political systems is a normal and indispensable process in maintaining the vitality, effectiveness, and popularity of governments - and this is no different in a Communist country. \n\nI would recommend you study the reform process, read the works of Deng Xiaoping, learn about the trial of the Gang of Four, study the seminal work China\u2019s Socialist Economy by Xue Muqiao, and read the works of Cheng Enfu. Learn about the ideological struggles in the CPC over the years, from its birth to today, and follow their reasoning in tackling issues within their systems which were preventing them from growing effectively.\n\nGo to China, visit the Red Areas, learn from the Chinese revolution, and pay your respects to Chairman Mao. Within China there is a massive market for vintage books from the USSR and, internally, for books from the reform process - all in English. Any state-owned bookstore in a major city will have English language books about Marxism and the CPC, detailing the intricacies of their system. You will learn more from a personal deep engagement and a personal journey for Marxist analysis in the country than you will on the western internet, trust me.\n\nHostile western source detailing Chinese support for the CPC:\n\n[Harvard found that ~95% of Chinese people approve of the CPC and the government.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/07/long-term-survey-reveals-chinese-government-satisfaction/)",

I have heard good things about you. Despite any minute political differences, I believe a cordial and comradely relationship between us would be fruitful.\n\nOne of the biggest detriments of the modern western Marxists is that they are nihilistic, quick to turn on each other, and metaphysical in their thinking. Things are good or bad, black or white, virtuous or evil. Worse yet, once something is shunted into the negative category through rhetoric, it no longer exists outside of its most shallow existence - it transforms itself into a caricature in the mind of the westerner and can safely be opposed and disengaged from without regard for the crucial nuances and details. This produces shoddy, out-of-touch, backwards analysis - analysis which, because of the historical makeup of the western left, trends towards ultra-leftist thought and tendencies.\n\nIn fairness, this exists on the other side of the equation, where slogans are taken for the full character of a movement, where labels matter more than content. A red cloak is all that is necessary for some supporters. I assume you I am not, nor have I ever been, this sort of so-called \u201cMarxist\u201d.\n\nModern socialism has suffered terrible setbacks - the tragedy of Black October, the pushbacks against the Maoist movements in the global south and the deaths of important monumental figures like Sison, the push-and-pull of the reform process in China and the contradictions therein, as well as the continuing threat of counter-revolutionary war against the DPRK from the US Imperialists. One of the most important lessons I took from my travels and my experiences is that the most neglected aspect of Communist thought in the west is Party-building - a struggle necessarily fraught with conflict, contradiction, and tactical considerations.\n\nWe should never forget the revolutionary essence of the Chinese revolution, a burning torch that still rages even today. While modern China is not a structure that Communists would ideally choose in any stretch of the imagination, it remains what it is. We can choose to engage with it, to open the Party\u2019s literature and to critically consider what lessons their successes and missteps can teach us, or we can abandon the path and write them off - losing valuable insight due to our stance. We are not Chinese Communists, at least most of us, allowing us a degree of freedom in our engagement with Party literature and theory but also limiting our engagement since a lot of modern Party literature is either untranslated or difficult to obtain outside of the borders of China. I came out of the country with a trove of Communist literature, both domestic and historical from the USSR, gifted to me on many occasions by sympathetic Party members and by those who lived through the revisionist era of the Soviet Union. It was very eye-opening as to how diverse the range of thought was throughout the reform process and how it was not a simple switch to capitalism, as it is often portrayed. \n\nI found that there was a broad mass of people, Party members and members of the public, who longed for the age gone past and for a new synthesis of the Party\u2019s older methods with the successes of the reform era. People tired of private ownership dominating light industry, fed up with corruption, and looking for answers as the class struggle - no longer considered the primary contradiction in society by many domestic theoreticians - nevertheless reared its head once more. People feared the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, where the lack of the rule of law lead to many excesses, but still longed for the return of proletarian power in the cultural sphere, where it had been drowned out by traditionalism, the bustle of modern working life, and nationalism (both progressive and its more rank variant).\n\nOne of the most impactful moments for me was paying my respects to Chairman Mao and witnessing the rural poor flock on National Day in droves to lay flowers at the feet of their dearest Chairman. The silence and emotion in the air was overpowering. I attended this with many non-Communists who were nevertheless all moved (some to tears) by the intensity and power in the people\u2019s longing and love for Chairman Mao, their respect for him, and the political meaning that was transparently shown in the countless eyes laying on the body of the leader of the Chinese Communist revolution.\n\nChina is a battleground where many dynamic forces are at play. It is my opinion that many western theoreticians are very black and white with how they engage with the Party. No one who has spent a long time engaging with the Party, gone amongst its members and spent time reading its literature, held an open ear to its theories, studied the reform process, and held the well-being of the working people of the world in their hearts can hold either a blindly worshipful or a fully negative view of the Party. And, unbeknownst to many of the western left, there are benefits that one can gain from engagement with such a Party, if one is not so easily swayed to one position or the other.\n\nThe coming years will be illuminating, I suspect. We shall see which way the wind blows.\n\nAs an aside, I see that Ksan is still the lead mod. Do give my kind regards. It has been a long time since the old comrades spoke and many have disappeared. It is good to see that he is still present.",

My question then is how do you take those experiences as a positive? It sounds like people wish for a return to socialism, albeit in a manner that lacks clarity because there is no revolutionary party to concentrate scattered feelings and ideas systematically.\n\n>it transforms itself into a caricature in the mind of the westerner\n\n\"Westerner\" is not a meaningful category. Both Mao and Deng were \"Easterners\" and both you and I are \"Westerners.\" \"Western Marxism\" is a very specific historical phenomenon (which has become a term of abuse by the ultimate western marxist, Losurdo, given the PCI was one of its major innovators) and is not synonymous with a geographical or cultural demographic, since criticism and defense of the Chinese system today can be found throughout the world. Was Lenin an \"Easterner?\" It's strange to reify racist accusations levied at Lenin and Stalin and Mao meant to diminish them at face value when they saw themselves as figures of universal truth.\n\nThe funny thing is, it should be easy to find Chinese people to weaponize American identity politics against American self-hatred in this way but Chinese people care so little about questions of socialism and Marxism (because, as you imply, it doesn't impact their lives at all except the cynical repetition of the state's ideology in rote, meaningless language - no different of course than asking an American what their favorite Federalist paper is or their opinion on Ulysses S. Grant) that \"Westerners\" almost always have to speak on their behalf. Chinese people are the first to tell you their \"Marxism\" classes are useless and the only ideology that matters is money.\n\n>how diverse the range of thought was throughout the reform process and how it was not a simple switch to capitalism, as it is often portrayed.\n\nRight, some factions were influenced by people like Lee Kwan Yew and Park Chung-hee, some were influenced by Milton Friedman and Pinochet, others Hungarian and Yugoslavia. Interestingly, these factions do not always line up with what you would think, for example Pinochet was seen as a \"conservative\" force, closer to \"Asian capitalism\" than \"neoliberalism.\" But as you can imagine, \"West\" vs \"East\" is not very meaningful, unless you take Singaporean fascism at face value and, even more problematically, determine that China had some \"Eastern\" plan which distinguished it from market reforms throughout the socialist world in the 1980s when all historical evidence points to the contrary. The full restoration of capitalism had multiple stages (although Maoism can fully account for the difference between capitalist roaders and the restoration of the capitalist mode of production) but it is complete and irreversible even if the capitalists responsible for it and who benefited from it wished otherwise. The \"Western\" institution of the WTO and its ideology (which I'm sure you're old enough to remember was once the main object of communist criticism especially in the global south) were essential to this process.\n\nWhat was clear was there was only one thought that was not allowed in this hundred flowers blooming: Maoism and class struggle by the proletariat against their enlightened leaders deciding they don't get healthcare anymore because they are needed as superexploited labor for a Taiwanese company on the coast. That's the reality of these \"pragmatic\"' decisions as I'm sure you heard from the children of hundreds of millions of migrants.\n\n>No one who has spent a long time engaging with the Party, gone amongst its members and spent time reading its literature, held an open ear to its theories, studied the reform process, and held the well-being of the working people of the world in their hearts can hold either a blindly worshipful or a fully negative view of the Party.\n\nIt's not hard to live in China. China is a nation state with sovereignty, a functional economy and government, and a long history of stable identity and culture. Anyone who speaks English can go and teach and purge themselves of being \"western.\" People in the party are government bureaucrats and most of them are wealthy. What is hard is making revolution, especially after all those events you mentioned. In China it is nearly impossible. Your desire for what actually exists is misplaced, while every revolutionary movement worth anything believes China is a counter-revolutionary force, China's supposedly pragmatic survival has inspired zero revolutionary movements and contains no inspiration for revolutionary practice and thought. The only groups that have changed their view on Chinese capitalist restoration, which was unchallenged even a decade ago, are useless eurocommunist parties, revisionists and trots trying to elbow into the DSA's space as \"anti-imperialists,\" and genuinely fascist forces and grifters that follow them. Sometimes all 3 are in the same party.\n\nFor those of us who have to make revolution instead of being satisfied with daily life being conveniently revolutionary, the consequences of capitalist restoration is clear. At best, we can resist the worst anti-China propaganda and observe objectively its economic growth leading to a new situation in international relations. But you don't need to muddle Marxist committment to things being true or false to do that. The Maoists in the Philippines are inspiring to me as a privileged \"Westerner\" for their brilliance, courage, and fortitude. How can you stand to be in the same ideological space as those who call them \"ultras\" and mock people's war?\n\n>The coming years will be illuminating, I suspect. We shall see which way the wind blows.\n\nXi has been in power for 11 years. I have not seen any indication that fundamental economic policies have changed. If anything, privatization has gone even further. The only notable thing was the zero covid policy which did distinguish China, at least in how the state thinks of its own legitimacy. That was then thrown in the garbage when it interfered with the accumulation of capital.\n\n>As an aside, I see that Ksan is still the lead mod. Do give my kind regards. It has been a long time since the old comrades spoke and many have disappeared. It is good to see that he is still present.\n\nSadly I haven't heard from Ksan in a long time, I'm the oldest mod left.\n\n>Comrade, you and I haven\u2019t had that much personal interaction, so I will be brief and polite. I have heard good things about you. Despite any minute political differences, I believe a cordial and comradely relationship between us would be fruitful.\n\nI do understand how a certain concept of Marxism-Leninism becomes pro-China today. Parenti was against China only because he no longer writes and has dementia, the logical endpoint of his ideas is clear (though again, that even he believed China's changes were reactionary tells you how ubiquitous these ideas were until very recently despite no real changes to the underlying Chinese model). I don't hate Parenti, I feel bad for those people that were made fools of by Gorbachev because of their fundamental misunderstanding of Marxism and I've always defended actual socialism under Stalin and Mao against idealism. So I know that supporting \"actually existing socialism\" is comforting. But we're too young to delude ourselves the collapse of the USSR didn't happen except as a contingency with no deeper theoretical consequences if only China will take its place. We were born after socialism, it can either be terrifying or liberating.\n\nOn the other hand we're too old to believe in Dengism. We remember, even if vicariously, the anti-globalization movement (since China today is the main force in favor of globalization), the RIM and Maoist people's war (where there was a direct relationship between one's position on China and one's revolutionary line), and the role of China in allowing the DPRK and Cuba to starve (in Korea, they encouraged it). We remember when questions of revisionism were tied to living experience, even if that experience became increasingly abstract and unserious on the early internet. The Maoist people's war may not be a direct presence in communist imagination today, hence people who never experienced it don't consider it an immediate option. I'll grant that reflects real experience but it's also the fetishism of the internet where Maoism was doomed to be out-memed. I don't see the alternative, a single thread about Peru in a Dengist space should be enough to cure you of any illusions that supporters of the PRC today are communists or even progressive in a basic, ethical sense.",

Do you think the Moscow Trials against the likes of long-time Bolsheviks such as Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, etc. was a simple engagement? They had previously been close allies of Lenin, and if they still managed to hold counter-revolutionary and anti-Leninist lines then you should also be critical of the people whom you have had ''simple engagement'' with. I don't understand what you mean by conspiracism either; I don't think that every member of the CPC is cynically pretending to be a communist as part of some con, it's very much possible for Xi Jinping to genuinely think of himself as being a Marxist-Leninist while not actually being one in practice because his conception of what it means to be a Marxist-Leninist is divorced from its theoretical foundation, merely being a historical relic that is associated with lifting China out of its century of humiliation and unifying the nation which is the ''70% good'' of Mao's legacy, while his insistence on upholding revolutionary principles is part of the ''30% bad'' of his legacy.",

Nothing that is has to be, that is why I am a revolutionary.\n\nAs for your concrete claims, they are factually inaccurate. China under Mao and the USSR under Stalin did integrate into the US led world trade bloc. The question is whether this will be done in a way advantageous to socialism or capitalist restoration. There has only been one socialist country in history that resembled autarky and that was Albania. But they only banned foreign debt by law which, given the collapse of socialist Korea's economy after it reneged on its debts (or Romania implementing austerity to pay for them), seemed wise. The cause of the overthrow of socialism in tiny, courageous Albania lies elsewhere. Revisionists fundamentally misrepresent their ideas because they are not interested in truth. The issue in China was the collectivization of land, the use of market prices and profit incentives, and the system of privileges for the children of those who had won the revolution. FDI played very little role in Chinese economic development until well into the 90s, the main source of growth were the TVEs and market prices for crops. Basically the robbery of the wealth built by socialism. These were then destroyed in the 90s for cheap migrant labor for international investors. In fact, the SEZs were chosen because they were marginal to the actual Chinese economy of the 1980s, it was only retroactively that the relationship between Hong Kong/Taiwan and Guandong became central to geographical uneven development across the whole country. That's why Xi Jinping's right wing father got stuck there (who, if you remember, was purged by Deng later for being too liberal).\n\n>which was the fundamental criticism of many in the Warsaw pact \u2014 \u201cwe don\u2019t have blue jeans and Coca Cola\u201d it sounds silly but people really cared about that stuff until they realise the costs associated with doing it the bourgeoise way like the west\n\nThis only reflects your misanthropy and petty-bourgeois ideology.

Neither China pre Nixon nor the USSR had much of trade balance with the west during the height of the Cold War\n\nTrade was conducted in order to gain access to advanced technologies. The size doesn't really matter, the point is that the justification for post-Mao reforms is false since the Maoist period already did this without mass exploitation of the proletariat. Lenin explains this in *The Tax in Kind*, the only differences in Soviet policy under socialism were based on the openness of the world economy to trade, not ideology. No one has ever disputed that socialist countries will have to trade with capitalist countries in some form.\n\n>On the last point, genuinely, what is a \u201cpetit bourgeois ideology\u201d distinct from regular bourgeois ideology?\n\nThe petit-bourgeoisie is an unstable, insecure class that in crisis supports the worker's movement but is fundamentally opposed to revolution and a real socialist reorganizion of society. Instead it seeks to gain ideological leadership of the proletariat and leverage this to its own gain. The bourgeoisie has no need for this since it is a secure class with ownership of society as it exists. In this case, you are trying to turn the proletariat into morons who are only motivated by base desires, unlike your enlightened understanding of socialism, in order to justify your personal advancement in the system that has arisen in China and enriched everyone across the world except the proletariat while disempowering real revolutionaries of the proletariat that their politics is \"unrealistic,\" against \"human nature,\" not \"pragmatic,\" beyond the limits of the objective stage of History, etc. This can all be found in Marx and Lenin and has not changed in 200 years, if you know Draper I'm sure you're familiar with the Mensheviks who said the same things, making me wonder the point of this song and dance.\nto overcome it first on their terms \n\n>to overcome it first on their terms\n\nFirst of all, we already did this under Mao. I do not accept your false framing of history full of mysterious gaps. Secondly, Marx's point is to critique the terms of political economy, not extend them further.

No, they cannot.\n\n>Can classes be abolished if the theory and practice of the capitalists growing into socialism prevails? No, they cannot. Such theory and practice can only cultivate and perpetuate classes, for this theory contradicts the Marxist theory of the class struggle.\n\n>But the passage from Lenin is wholly and entirely based on the Marxist theory of the class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nTheir comparison of \"socialism with chinese characteristics\" to the USSR's NEP was unmasked 100 years ago and traces back to the Menshevik opportunist theory of developing the productive forces.

Much like the Soviet Union was, they are state capitalist, and neither ever came close to socialism. They were both unindustrialized countries with peasant economies, so they basically tried to speed run industrialization through ruthless capitalist exploitation of people and land, so they could transition from feudalism, to capitalism, to socialism, to communism like Marx said (when talking about already industrialized capitalist countries), but the purpose of a system is what it does, and our means eventually, inevitably become our ends, and as their means were centralization and rapid industrialization through ruthless capitalist exploitation. And capitalism is self propelling machine. Not only will it not stop itself, it is incapable of stopping itself. China will need a second revolution to overthrow the new capitalist and political class, and make no transitions but immediately implement communism if they ever want to see communism, as must we all",

Because a lot of CCP members themselves are sitting on the corporate board and they also have \"profit incentives\" because when the companies they're running return bigger profits and increase the company's values, those CCP members also get the benefits and the only allowed union is basically controlled by CCP.\n\nModern China is basically state-run capitalism.
