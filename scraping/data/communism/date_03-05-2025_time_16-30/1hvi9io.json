You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Very hardworking people, an increasingly educated workforce (US has comparatively zero college graduates, especially among men) and impressive infrastructure that will undoubtedly be useful for future proletariat/anti-american logistics.\n\nI suppose my question to you is (as well as my warning to you), do you feel that most Chinese people have an accurate understanding of the depths of evil that America has inflicted on the world? Are they prepared for the kind of violence that the western world has inflicted on them in the past? Is it as prevalent in their minds as, for instance, the war they fought against japan? \n\nThe reason I ask is that I have traveled to Vietnam and spoken with young people there. Many of them know that America gassed their country, but a lot of them fail to understand why it happened. They don't know what imperialism and capitalism really means as a function of violence, and a function of gaining wealth.",

But I think someone owes you the courtesy of at least trying to explain the contradictory landscape you see among Western Marxism-Leninism (and \"Marxism-Leninism\").  In fact, most of the users *who frequent this subreddit* think that Mao's Cultural Revolution and struggle against revisionism contains universal lessons for all socialism, and thus Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, or just Maoism, is the current and highest stage of Marxist understanding in the world.  And in our estimation, most of the Westerners calling themselves \"Marxist-Leninists\" on the internet today -- often the people with extremely pro-modern-China, pro-revisionist-CPC views -- are not actually Marxist-Leninists, but a relatively recent liberal phenomenon that is appropriating the name of Marxism-Leninism, while slinging the very revisionism that Mao (and Marx and Lenin et al.) fought against.  \n\nedit: And to be clear, the reason I bring this up is because I suspect any sincere Chinese Marxist-Leninists in China must wonder why Westerners calling themselves \"Marxist-Leninists\" keep telling them how great the CPC is and how Chinese capitalism and their \"Communist\" Party are actually building socialism, while Chinese Marxist-Leninists are asking how this condition in China can be overcome, not sustained.\n\nedit 2: I will add, that from a recent article I read on the Bo Xilai affair, the Western \"\"\"Marxism-Leninism\"\"\" (sometimes derogatorily, but accurately, called Dengism) most closely aligns with the centre-right faction of Chinese politics: *the narrow nationalists,* and that's probably the nearest approximation you can draw from to understand what \"socialism\" they see in China.",

On the one hand, Marxism-Leninism as a term has become totally bastardized today, where the Marcyites of PSL are now \"Marxist-Leninists\" and the Brezhnevites of the \"Communist\" Party of Canada are \"Marxist-Leninists\" -- these formations are so obviously revisionist and need to be opposed and struggled against and I'm in a perfect position to do it because this battle takes place on the internet and have history and experience with these and similar orgs.  I think it's safe, at this point, to write off most of the \"Marxist-Leninist\" organizations in the West as being revisionists.  Even the better revisionist parties, like KKE, for all the good and correct things they do, still should be subjected to the criticisms of Maoism, and see what responses are yeilded.  What is the response to revisionism? How will it be overcome this time?  What is the understanding of Khrushchev and Brezhnev and Deng?  All of these questions are going to come up again on the road to socialism, so I think brushing them off because they \"aren't pertinent or relevant\" or whatever is a weak excuse, unless you are actually locked into some sort of more urgent, pressing struggle. \n\nOn the other hand, what right do I have to tell FARC rebels who have been fighting a grueling guerilla war for decades that they are revisionists (and even if my criticism could reach them, why would they care?  I'm some random stranger on the internet).  Heck, even the KKE takes bolder and more daring actions that I ever have to date, so I am throwing stones from glass houses here.  But on the other hand, how does FARC think of itself and how does it conceive itself in the present?  What do they think of their historical engagement with the USSR or China, and the historical paths taken. Those questions have actual answers and understanding that will ultimately be crucial to the success of FARC and Marxism in general, even if it's not immediately obvious.   \n\nI think at the very least, when you encounter a Marxist-Leninist (or \"Marxist-Leninist\") organization, you ought to at least challenge why they are not Maoists.  And I think that does apply even beyond the West.  If the problems of the party are deeply rooted in revisionism, the response to *\"why aren't you Maoist?\"* might make the revisionism come bubbling to the surface pretty quickly and there it can be identified and criticized.  And if there is a worthwhile answer, I don't know what it would be (other than preoccupied with other more urgent matters, but even in those conditions, historical rectification movements were the key to realigning the party toward revolution), but I'd be interested in hearing the explanation. I don't know if an alarm bell will help though, there's still plenty of terrible Maoist organizations, but I do think this question is a serious one for communist parties in the present and answering it is part of how Maoism can overcome the present disarray of its forces.\n\nedit:  Also I should add, while parties are a different matter, people calling themselves Marxist-Leninist shouldn't automatically be dismissed.  Obviously Dengists and Brezhnevites and rebranding-Hoxhaists and most of anyone on reddit who says something like \"well I identify as a Marxist-Leninist and voted for Bernie\" -- that can all be dismissed, but I also get that it takes some time for Maoism to click and for the real weight behind anti-revisionism to register, so there does need to be space for people who are learning.  I've even said before that it's a bad idea for someone to call themselves Maoist if they haven't yet grasped why Maoism is so important.",

For one it is rich coming from me when I've been a self-proclaimed Maoist for a year (i think, maybe less maybe more) but only vaguely understood its core tenets for a while. It took me a bunch more reading and thinking for it to 'click' like you said. I've definitely improved in my understanding but still it's not up to the standard I want it to be in. And like you said, my opinion about Maoism literally does not matter to any organisation that is fighting the forces of capital, especially coming from me considering my class position. \n\nWith that aside, I don't think you even needed to say 'beyond the West'. I say that because one of the examples in my mind when I wrote my initial comment was CPI(Marxist) in India being a Marxist-Leninist org or whatever, and in general there being many \"ML\" orgs that ignore/denounce Maoism for obvious reasons. But like you said, there are several horrible Maoist orgs too. \n\nFinally, just wanted to ask; what do you mean when you say people shouldn't call themselves maoist if they dont know why its so important? I'm not asking because of a disagreement, I just want to know what you mean by grasping its importance? What would a Maoist who doesn't grasp its importance look like?",

                                            "body": "I think that one of the best examples of this was a really common trend in Maoism about 4-5 years ago (and before that) when I was first becoming a Maoist (and which I played a significant role in helping reverse, to the extend that one can influence the internet with minor social media).  This subreddit is quite good at defending and apologizing for DPRK and Cuba (which they deserve, for their protracted commitment to resisting capitalism) -- but given that they are both revisionist, you would often see Maoists of the internet condemning and disparaging Cuba and DPRK as social-fascists, or in the same derogatory negative way that should be reserved for people like Khrushchev and Deng.  There was no nuance, or real discussion, they were simply echoing verbatim some of the most vulgar criticisms of the 60s and 70s without contextualizing them or understanding them.  \n\nAs posts in this subreddit have pointed out, DPRK and Cuba, despite their revisionism, have actually been able to teach meaningful lessons about the socialist struggle (DPRK's achievement of nuclear weapons shows that even a small isolated state can achieve this breakthrough, and whichever Maoist movement seizes state power is going to have to embark on a similar trajectory to do the same, because there isn't anyone else coming to help them).  Similarly, from the Third Worldist perspective, Cuba and DPRK show examples of what life can look like without imperialism, but even under the yoke of imperialist aggression and sanctions.  Cuba can have successful healthcare, which means it is a worthy model to emulate -- that lesson is true regardless of Castro being a bourgeois nationalist in essence or Cuban revisionism.  When Maoists become to narrow and vulgar, all these lessons are lost and anti-revisionism starts to become the same dismal trends of left-communism or Trotskyism, where nothing is possible and all you can do it offer empty, shallow, non-constructive criticism and every project is doomed from the start.\n\nPerhaps another clear example that I recall is Dubcek of Czechoslovakia.  Since we can now all understand with hindsight, Dubcek was a traitor (basically a strikebreaker) and a hyper revisionist, and what he was trying to do was flank Brezhnev from the right by pulling a Tito and switching allegiances to the West (he saw the trend of revisionism and rushed to the front of the line), and the while the West had no use for the revisionist USSR as an ally (why share), having tiny Czechoslovakia in your pocket was both affordable and undermined Brezhnev's attempt at counter-empire.  This is all pretty clear today, but you need to engage and think about what was happening.  The problem is that if you go back to the Maoist sources of the 60s and 70s, their perspective was not clear, even if it was trying to tap into something revolutionary.  To them, Brezhnev was a cruel fascist (still correct) who was oppressing poor Dubcek, whom they valorized (incorrect), with the underlying goal of getting the rogue Dubcek to find his way into the revolutionary Chinese/Albanian alliance and fight for socialism, and this is how Maoist sources of the day framed this situation, and why they are apologetic and generous to Dubcek.  But this was never going to happen.  We can understand why Maoists in the 60s and 70s might have hoped otherwise or missed this, but we don't live in the 70s and we can conduct a better and more thorough Maoist evaluation.  And, like the Cuba/DPRK thing, there was a vulgar trend in modern internet Maoism, where instead of trying to look at history and figure out what was actually going on, the role of these \"Maoists\" was simply to regurgitate whatever historical Maoism said, because that must be correct and that is Maoism.  So you have Maoists defending Dubcek, and the result is that is just makes the revisionists look like they are the authentic representatives of socialism and the Maoists are CIA stooges, because that was all Dubcek was actually capable of being.  The power of being a Maoist in the present is that you can look back and understand this situation in its totality, rather than being trapped by the woeful misplaced optimism of historical Maoism, but that requires you to understand the situation, rather than just echoing what Maoism once said about the situation.",

It was extremely violent and fascist takeover by the bourgeoisie.  \n  \nIf this is really the position of CPA (ML), then they are apologizing for Chinese revisionism.\n\nSince you mentioned CPA (ML), I will point out they have a very open and obvious settler-chauvinist line. First, they believe the Australian settler-nation is imperialized by the U.S. and even include independence of the Australian settler society from all imperialisms as part of their program! This is like arguing that Israel is also imperialized by the U.S. because Israeli economy is dominated by U.S. capital exports.\n\nAnd in their program, one of their only examples of so-called Australian subservience to Amerikan capital is:\n\n>An expanding number of US bases, of a permanent presence of US marines, of Australian facilities made available to the US for use by its B-52 bombers and submarines (both of which can be carrying nuclear weapons), the use of Australian territory for US-led military exercises, and the storage of US fuel and equipment are symptomatic of that subservience. \n\nBy this logic, are Germany and Japan also imperialized by the U.S., because they host U.S. military bases and other installations? \n\nOn another point, CPA (ML)'s mention of First Nations is only point #9 of their general program. Here, they make all kinds of liberal statements like \"we need to decolonise our minds and actions\" and \"For First Peoples, decolonisation reaffirms who they are and where they belong\". Or see the land acknowledgements: \"We acknowledge that First Peoples have never ceded their lands\". This is the framework of the white settler liberal who merely mentions First Nations to grant legitimacy for their own struggles. In fact they even promote the idea of settler land treaties as a form of First Nation liberation: \"the rights to autonomy and genuine and enforceable Treaties.\"\n\nIndeed, there is no mention of any special program to bring about First Nation liberation except for empty promises that will presumably happen only once the party has power. There is no mention of settler-colonialism as a mode of production in today's Australia.\n\nThis is a party bound up in Australian settler-nation interests desiring an independent and competing imperialist Australia. It doesn't encourage much confidence in any line they have about China or elsewhere.",

This means there is a lot of prosperity to be had.\n\nAs was already pointed out, this is one of the clearest articulations of what Dengism is (orientalism + social fascism) I've ever seen and why its fundamental premises are rooted in bourgeois economic theory. Few openly admit that what is occuring in China is proletarianization and that the fundamental claim is that this proletarianization will bring \"prosperity.\" Marx believed the opposite, that proletarianization is an extremely violent process called \"primitive accumulation\" and that the development of capitalism creates class polarization and pauperization but we're far away from that. Your attempt to avoid neoclassical economics with the idea that \"imperialism\" warps otherwise perfect markets is somewhat interesting but undercooked, more important is the irrelevance of the state to this explanation beyond allowing markets to function. This too is part of neoclassical economics, which has long understood the need for the state to disrupt market distortions and ensure, through force if necessary, the ideal functioning of capitalism. That is why a major reference point for the CCP was Pinochet and Milton Friedman, neoliberals understand perfectly well that a state dictatorship is required for the \"free\" market. \n\nSo thank you for that, unfortunately as was also pointed out you're not even engaging with the OP and are just looking for any excuse to spill your brain on the floor. There's nothing really to be gained encouraging that.",

I also think it's applicable to Latin America and Turkey but the consequences of their attempts at import-substitution played out differently unlike South Korea. \n\nThe problem is that the book was published during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (where everything went to shit) so it couldn't explain the failure of Thailand to live up to the imperial Japanese \"flying geese\" theory nor it could explain modern-day China.

The economic blockade would definitely be a major thorn in China's side had it not done the reforms. Especially after the sino soviet split, and the fall of the USSR, China would no longer have any trading partners without \"opening up\". How are they supposed to compete with the imperialist war machine without a well developed industry, which gets very hard to develop under siege?\n\nThis question has been plaguing my mind for a while. All socialist experiments get deformed by these conditions placed on them, is there no way of avoiding it?",

                    "body": "Why is deepening the struggle against revisionism not a valid alternative in your mind? Why is it important to \u201ccompete\u201d with the capitalist countries, and what does that look like in practice? Khrushchev famously tried to out compete western capitalism on its own terms, how did that work out? \n\nThe USSR was the first socialist state. When it came into being it had no other socialist countries to trade with, and was invaded by the combined forces of reaction. Still, they built socialism and went on to defeat the Nazis and go to space. What should they have done in your view? The DPRK was in a similar boat when it came to trading partners when the USSR fell, and yet for some reason they didn\u2019t (or couldn\u2019t) recreate the supposed success China had with capitalist reform. Why do you think that is?\n\n\nI feel like this often comes down to the fact that defenders of capitalist reversal don\u2019t really believe socialism in one country is possible, nor do they truly consider socialism to be an elevated mode of production over capitalism in terms of developing productive forces. \n\nWhy is it that relying on the masses and deepening the struggle against revisionism within the communist party is never even considered an option? Why does anti-revisionism always seem to imply poverty to the people making arguments for Deng\u2019s reform? Have you ever noticed how much overlap there is between outright anti-communist arguments and Dengist attacks on Maoism?\n\nOne more thing, I\u2019m assuming you got this \u201csiege\u201d socialism thing from Parenti. Michael Parenti had very flawed politics and there are discussions on this sub and communism101 detailing his specific errors. \n\nThis concept of \u201csiege\u201d socialism is used to imply that an isolated, pure, metaphysical socialism could exist in which \u201charsh measures\u201d (or whatever weasel word he used) would not need to be taken by Stalin/the revolutionary masses if it weren\u2019t for all of those pesky capitalist countries ruining what would otherwise be a peaceful and harmonious system. (According to Parenti, this type of socialism would even have small businesses!!!)\n\nGenerally this whole siege socialism idea is used to push the narrative that any defeat of socialism (or Dengist pragmatism) is the result of external forces rather than internal forces. It\u2019s kind of like how people often fantasize that the fate of the Black Panthers was ultimately determined by COINTELPRO and not internal line struggle. The capitalist reversal in China was not a consequence of the revolution being defeated from without, it was a defeat from within the Communist Party of China itself.",
