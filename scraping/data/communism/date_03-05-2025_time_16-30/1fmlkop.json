                    "body": "> **As the public denial of the revolutionary and scientific nature of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh\u2019s ideology has gradually lost its logical ground and proven to be ineffective, recently, hostile forces, reactionary elements, and political opportunists have resorted to a different tactic to undermine the Vietnamese revolution. This tactic involves using certain historical events to make distorted claims in an attempt to prove that \u201cin essence, Ho Chi Minh\u2019s ideology is nationalism\u201d. Their ultimate goal is to create a rift between Ho Chi Minh\u2019s ideology and Marxism-Leninism, thereby undermining the ideological foundation of our Party. This is an illogical argument that must be firmly refuted.**\n\n\n\n> \"Furthermore, they \u201cpretend\u201d to acknowledge President Ho Chi Minh\u2019s contributions to the struggle for the liberation of the Vietnamese nation to downplay and incite the rejection of Marxist-Leninist ideology, asserting that the Vietnam Communist Party\u2019s adoption of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh\u2019s ideology as the ideological foundation and guiding principles for all actions is inappropriate because these are two entirely opposing ideologies, etc. However, historical facts prove the opposite. Throughout his revolutionary career, Ho Chi Minh consistently stood with the working class, and creatively applied and developed Marxist-Leninist principles in the reality of the revolution in Vietnam.\"\n\n > \"*First, the drive that motivated the young Nguyen Tat Thanh to embark on a quest to save his nation and embrace Marxism-Leninism was patriotism, not nationalism*. Patriotism involves emotions, feelings, and a positive affection for one\u2019s homeland and nation. In contrast, \u201cnationalism is the psychology, ideology, worldview, and policies that favour one\u2019s own nation over others, exalt one\u2019s own nation, incite animosity towards others, and promote racial enmity\u201d. The fundamental difference between patriotism and nationalism lies in this: patriots take pride in their country for what it rightfully deserves, while nationalists take pride in their country regardless of anything (even committing crimes against other nations), which is a blind and extreme form of pride\"\n\n> Second, *Ho Chi Minh consistently stood on the proletarian class viewpoints when approaching and addressing national issues; he was someone who always fought against manifestations of nationalism and rejected bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism within the international communist movement*\n\n>Third, Ho Chi Minh was one of the pioneers in defending and advancing the Marxist-Leninist ideology regarding national issues and national unity in relation to humanity, all in pursuit of common goals of justice, progress, and peace\n\nI do find it interesting that the CPV is taking time to write this article out in the era of reactionary nationalism being predominant in oppressed countries instead of the progressive nationalism that defined the 20th century. I'm guessing it's in reaction to Vietnamese Communist members pointing to China as an example of why the party should pursue a nationalism in the same vein as the reactionary Chinese nationalism that is growing stronger in China. \n\nI will compliment that the CPV genuinely cares about its history and I think is the only ruling communist party today that still has to justify their ideology to historical events within the communist movement instead of recent history or an abstract universal language of culture. Though this is coming from a position of weakness rather than of strength. Ho Chi Minh wasn't the thinker Mao was and that's ok, but the invocation of Ho Chi Minh and his thoughts to current Vietnam are not very useful. Really this same article could have came out 50 years ago during a time when oppressed nations needed a founding father figure to confront their own enlightenment on their own terms. But it was the people that made the history of Vietnam, what are the masses thinking right now to continue the socialist revolution? The CPV needs to be directly exposing these propagators of \"Nationalism\" and make concrete actions opposing them. I think this article is really serving to cover up deeper problems within party and this type of article could only exist in such a backwards country like Vietnam where the Party's legitimacy comes from the past, the capitulation to imperialism being fast, and the need to still ideological oppose China that the Party appears frozen from the past.",

If the revolution is a socialist one, then the revisionists currently in power would be the first enemies of Ho's political beliefs. If it is a national one, then the vestiges of Ho's communism are a fetter to the full potential of the Vietnamese national bourgeoisie. I think the issue has already been decided in China and it is a matter of time until Marxism and communism disappear entirely from the state's discourse. I agree with the article that Ho really was a communist and envisioned a socialist Vietnam. Does the current necessity of referencing his ideas and life create a contradiction with the actual system of capitalism in Vietnam? Or have all of these terms become completely vacuous in contemporary Vietnam? They at least produce better theoretical articles like this one than anything coming out of China.",

As a Vietnamese citizen, I only feel safe to answer certain questions. \n\n>the revolution can be interpreted as a socialist revolution or one of national liberation.\u00a0\n\nAccording to current offical view of Vietnamese gov, it was both national liberation and ML victory. How about current view of that time? [declaration of independence](https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5139/), [1946 constitution](https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Bo-may-hanh-chinh/Hien-phap-1946-Viet-Nam-Dan-Chu-Cong-Hoa-36134.aspx), you should also look for parties participate in August revolution to reach your own conclusion. Also, according to Ho in \"\u0110\u01b0\u1eddng K\u00e1ch M\u1ec7nh\", most of Vietnamese are peasants at that time. (If  you're interested in Ho, you should read \"\u0110\u01b0\u1eddng K\u00e1ch M\u1ec7nh\", especially the part about First International). But if you believe in \"socialism in one country\" then each country have their own part to socialism. National liberation at that time can be historically progressive if you agree with Lenin on national question. \n\n>Does the current necessity of referencing his ideas and life create a contradiction with the actual system of capitalism in Vietnam?\n\nDo you believe in \"socialism in one country\"? Vietnamese gov believes they can reform until Vietnam reach socialsm!\n\n>Or have all of these terms become completely vacuous in contemporary Vietnam?\n\nTo common people, \"communism\" means loyal to government because the goverment is communist. I don't know what the politicians believe but there is one gentle man tried to make the goverment abandon communism and ML. He failed but managed to create a reactionary movement in Vietnamese youth (r/trochuyenlinhtinh, r/VietNamNation ). \n\n>They at least produce better theoretical articles like this one than anything coming out of China.\n\nI'm sure there are things from China that they put more effort to than this one.",

Ho says Annam revolution is a national liberation (by no means abolish any classes) which would weaken French capitalism so the French workers can unite with the workers in the colonies on a proletarian basis, free of Second International social imperialism.\n\nE: This is similar to Marx on the [Irish question](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1870/letters/70_04_09.htm)\n>>If, on the other hand, the English army and police were to be withdrawn from Ireland tomorrow, you would at once have an agrarian revolution in Ireland. But the downfall of the English aristocracy in Ireland implies and has as a necessary consequence its downfall in England. And this would provide the preliminary condition for the proletarian revolution in England. The destruction of the English landed aristocracy in Ireland is an infinitely easier operation than in England herself, because in Ireland the land question has been up to now the exclusive form of the social question because it is a question of existence, of life and death, for the immense majority of the Irish people, and because it is at the same time inseparable from the national question. Quite apart from the fact that the Irish character is more passionate and revolutionary than that of the English.\n\n>>Hence it is the task of the International everywhere to put the conflict between England and Ireland in the foreground, and everywhere to side openly with Ireland. It is the special task of the Central Council in London to make the English workers realise that for them the national emancipation of Ireland is not a question of abstract justice or humanitarian sentiment but the first condition of their own social emancipation.",
