            "body": "I feel like most communist parties in the periphery of the EU (Cyprus, Greece, Portugal, and the Eastern Europe countries which i don't know well, etc) have a hard time explaining why the EU is bad because they stick to putting the bourgeoise as the only beneficiaries of the Union.\n\nThe truth is, even if it's hard for communists to work with that, the EU has benefited a great number of people (perhabs a majority) in this countries. It has accelerated the process of integration of these countries in the Imperialist center.\n\nOf course we should still oppose the EU, but it is mainly because what it does to Third World Countries and to the workers it has hurt in the member states.\n\nIn Portugal it is the same: the communist party PCP understands that the EU is of course bad, but at the same time tries to explain to the portuguese people that it has hurt them which is something that doesn't make that much sense for a majority of the population.\n\nI honestly dont know what should be done. Doing the opposite, that is saying that the EU is good for a majority of the population but that we should still oppose it because of what it does to other countries might be more unpopular but perhabs it is more close to the truth.",

                    "body": "Yup, there is a lot in this text that can lead to, if not _is_, social fascist populism. I'm using social fascism in the sense that it is socialist in form because of the language and pretense of Marxism, fascist in content because of appeals to reactionary, exploitor classes, including as you point out, labouring classes which themselves are parasitic off the third world proletariat (apparently, important works for reference here are Zak Cope's _Divided World, Divided Class_ and Sam King's _Lenin's Theory of Imperialism Today_ although I haven't read either yet myself). I say populism because of further obfuscation of the fascist content through vague rhetoric about \"the people\", \"popular strata\", and so on.\n\n\nPerhaps Southern Europe does have its particularities along with say Eastern Europe (or, perhaps more accurately, I should use the term European periphery, so as to not lump in Spain, Italy, France, Czechia, Poland and maybe more countries which are often included in those categories but which I think are much more \"senior partners\" of imperialism than say Greece and Portugal). However the question of how to wage revolution in countries with a large population of parasitic imperialist classes goes far beyond the peripheral EU countries, of course. It is certainly a central question for communists in the imperialist core. It seems it's at the very least important in the immediate periphery, despite its particularities.\n\n\nThere was [the thread you made recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1csr35w/comment/l4d64xr/) where u/smokeuptheweed9's comment is likely of interest for this. They claimed that the revolutionary situation in Portugal in 1975 arose not _despite_ Portuguese imperialism's successes but exactly _because_ of its failures and eventual collapse, and also that revolutionary moments arise when there are transitions between capital accumulation regimes and so the real question is how to seize on those moments. Perhaps that is something that we can work with. Imperialism is bound to go through periods of decline and the current decline of neoliberalism indicates that a change in the capital accumulation regime might be coming, so the question really becomes \"how can we in the imperialist or semi peripheral countries prepare to seize on those moments successfully\". Of course Maoism offers answers for that but honestly what the CIC is writing is so far removed from those answers (or even offering answers to that question at all) that I don't even know how one would begin to take the discussion over strategy in that direction.",

                            "body": "I agree, we need to find the specific thing that makes revolution possible in each country. I don't know Cyprus that well, but I would guess the question of the division of the island is very important. Perhabs a revolution in Cyprus is dependant on a revolution first in Greece or in Turkey (or both).\n\nThe problem with economic crisis in the imperial core is that they are as (or more) likely to result in fascism than in socialism. It is very probable than in 10 years the main European countries will regress to fascism due to the drops in the standards of living of the privileged working classes of this countries. Once Germany industry collapses all of the EU economies will most likely collapse too.\n\nBut I think we can be optimistic. The European Union is weaker than it was during the Troika years in the early 2010s and I don't think Germany has the same strength to suppress the masses as it did in Greece in those years. Even if europeans support the EU in the periphery countries we are mentioning, a lot of them still remember  the impositions Europe made and there is still lot of ressentment to the way we were treated, the northern countries calling us PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Spain, Greece) and all the [prejudiced comments that came along](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39350113). We have to take advantage of this feeling while also not falling in fascism and chauvinism, which is something very hard to do in Portugal's case in specific were even \"left wing\" parties have some sort of \"pride\" in the Discoveries.",
