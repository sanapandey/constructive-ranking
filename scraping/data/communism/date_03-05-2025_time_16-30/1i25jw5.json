You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

This ceasefire, which was already proposed months ago, being accepted now is only because the resistance factions forced such an unfavourable situation.\n\nAll the resistance groups, not just Hamas, that called for a permanent ceasefire are under no delusion that israel just stops bombing or stops being settlers. They also know that countries like Qatar and Egypt are only mediators, not allies and their bourgeoisie remain to benefit from the subjugation of Palestinians. Nor do they need a reddit user to remind them that national liberation is still the only objective. \n\nLike the other user said, the Palestinian fighters are ready for a protracted war. Thousands of prisoners being released is an achievement that you are understating here. What do you think the point of Operation Al-Aqsa flood was? What was the purpose of taking hostages, including soldiers that are going to be exchanged for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners?",

All the liberals can go home now.\n\n\nJokes aside locally we had decided to support the call for a permanent ceasefire (in this context permanent meaning Israel exits Gaza vs temporary meaning it stays) to end the genocide and since the fighting factions were calling for it. My immediate reaction seeing these news was to not believe that Israel will stick to the ceasefire one second and to doubt if it will even be achieved or if the war will continue. However even if it is achieved and the war ends the struggle obviously doesn't end. There will need to be a war against the Zionist entity again until its destruction, next time with a stronger correlation of forces and certainty in victory.\n\n\nEdit: something that is worth examining that I didn't is why the deal was signed in the first place. There's hearsay it's to prepare for war with Iran, I've seen someone analyze it as that since Israel failed to import workers from South Asia they need to stop the genocide and try to reintegrate the Palestinians into the labor market as superexploited labor. Otherwise, perhaps the war was too costly and Israel decided to cut it's losses.",

Still, it must be stressed that this agreement was only possible because of the heroic efforts of the Palestinian resistance factions, irrespective of alterior motives.",

The degree to which the current power balance in the APF can persist in the wake of this qualitative shift is an open and critical question but as you point out the communist line seems clear.\n\nThe ceasefire should be celebrated, but it\u2019s doubtful it will last and what comes after is critical.

Starting with the tactical victory, \"Israel\" lost military, the JOR was able to inflict serious damage to the IOF's military equipment and armor and inflict serious casualties on a large scale to the point of overflowing hospitals for wounded soldiers and vehicle shortages during the war. At the same time \"Israel\" failed to achieve any of it's military objectives throughout the war and was unable to inflict any debilitating damage on Hamas, and in fact has provided little evidence of any tactical victories. The largest strategic victories the IOF can claim right now are rescuing just 3 hostages, the killing of a few replaceable top commanders and destroying some smaller groups' rocket launch sites, which didn't even stop them from firring rockets. On the JOR's side, the JOR carried out a number of successful complex operations, consistently won large battles and carried out thousands of successful smaller operations. The ceasefire deal that looks like it will be signed was the JOR's deal, and fulfils most if the JOR's demands and none of \"Israel's\". \n\nOn the Strategics side \"Israel\" has been humiliated, suffered a serious economic crisis and is losing population as many settlers flee. The regime's reputation has tanked and it is starting to be isolated globally and internal contradictions are sharpening. Aa for the resistance, Hamas makes it weapons primarily out of unexploded IOF ordnances, which they now have more of than they could ever dream of. The JOR and forces of resistance have consolidated, the PA is now weaker than ever and actively starting to crumble, recruitment has and will likely continue to skyrocketed for all resistance factions. Overall there is chaos under zionist heaven and the situation is very good.",
