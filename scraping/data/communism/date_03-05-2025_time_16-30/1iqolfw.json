            "body": "When it comes to revolutionary theory, Fisher is not a guide. He was perpetually looking at the Labour Party as a path to 21st century social-democracy which was one reason he fell into nihilism. It wasn\u2019t going to happen and he knew it.  I\u2019m not going to quote him and counter his arguments because I believe this has been done on this sub previously. Use the search function to see more.\n\nHe was a kind of big tent anti-capitalist yet held Marx in high regard. However, I can\u2019t recall him ever taking the idea of a labor aristocracy or him benefitting from imperialism seriously or making it a talking point at all. He didn\u2019t side with Leninism or Maoism and talked of Leninism in very distorted ways. Instead, he points to \u2018Stalinism\u2019 and often equates economically dominant capitalist states to this vague Stalinism which I gathered him to simply mean overly bureaucratic states.\n\nI\u2019ve read most everything that has been published by Mark Fisher except for many of his music reviews. His blog under the name **kpunk** is a fascinating read as are his other books besides *Capitalist Realism*:  *The Weird and the Eerie*, *Ghosts of My Life*, and the post humous *Post-Capitalist Desire*. His writing about pop-culture mixed with philosophy and politics is descriptive and thought provoking. However, there is minimal use-value here when it comes to revolutionary politics and actual 21st century Marxism. \n\nSpend your time reading actual communist theory instead, unless you\u2019re the type that reads and studies many dozens of books per year. Life is too short and conditions are too difficult for an overwhelming majority of workers outside of the imperial core to spend time reading a nihilist social-democrat.",

Think of it more as a novel than a theory book, in terms of what time you'd like to spend reading it.\n\nRather than go into more complex critiques, like most post structuralist/modernist thinkers he suffers from the- \"ok, and now what?\" Problem. He knew this himself as he was intending to have a whole thing of acid communism but he wasn't able to finish it.\n\nIt's an enjoyable work- and it will help you understand why things like marvel movies are utter trash (in case you needed that), but it's a very global north centric and navel gazing work that is essentially a critique of modern Western society without really offering anymore . The main theme, is essentially how in the post-soviet world capitalism/neoliberalism are so- totalizing (totalitarian) that it's impossible to imagine a future without capitalism- (I think it's zizek [edit: a comrade has informed me it was in fact Jameson], not fisher, who says it's easier to imagine the end of the world than it is capitalism- but Fisher is  effectively investigating this).\n\nMy personal highlight is the passage on Kurt Cobain, the punk ethos of 'not selling out'- how completely contradictory it is- and then how hip hop inverted that. \n\nThis probably ends up as being a back handed compliment, I do like it, It's a good book but it doesn't really do anything. I'm also sure that for people who aren't interested in or who don't get  the  pop culture references- it would be an interminable read",

Did Marx and Engels not already struggle over the need for Scientific Socialism vs. Utopian Socialism? Also, who is this Left that Fisher seeks to win over in his works? The petty bourgeois of the Labour Party?\n\nOnly a few pages into *Post-Capitalist Desire,* Fisher immediately dismisses the idea of a vanguard party and gives reactionary terms such as the \u201cHarsh Leninist Superego,\u201d claiming the \u201cfailure\u201d of the Bolsheviks (what he means exactly by this \u201cfailure\u201d he does not expound upon).\n\nThe need for cultural struggle and an actual Leftist political culture itself isn\u2019t invalid\u2014culture should be scientifically analyzed, but as mentioned, it is *Postmodernism\u2026* by Fredric Jameson that actually predicates itself on the basis of Marx and Lenin and diagnoses the cultural logic ingrained within Capitalism, rather than just alluding to some petty bourgeois milieu like Fisher\u2019s \u201clost futures.\u201d",

            "body": "You should read the book for yourself. I just want to say that up front. But because you are asking, I'll give you my answer. The book is largely garbage. It reads as something a Trot would write and want a round of applause for. Anything that heavily quotes Zizek positively and shakes a fist about \"stalinism\" is both unserious and anti-Marxist.\n\nI read it for the first time a couple of years ago after seeing it constantly deified on other \"Marxist\" sub-reddits. It is pure dreck. Honestly, it is so bad that I don't agree with the sentiment from someone else in here that it is worth reading for its cultural critique. It's only value is to read it for yourself so that you can argue about it from a standpoint of knowledge. \n\nHere are just some excerpts from the book itself that highlight what I mean when I say that the book is terrible:\n\n**Page 23:** \"The system by which the college is funded means that it literally cannot afford to exclude students, even if it wanted to. Resources are allocated to colleges on the basis of how successfully they meet targets on achievement (exam results), attendance and retention of students. This combination of market imperatives with bureaucratically-defined 'targets' is typical of the 'market Stalinist' initiatives which now regulate public services.\"\n\n**Page 42-43** - a chapter titled 'Market Stalinism' which should make any serious Marxist's eyebrows rise automatically: \"What late capitalism repeats from Stalinism is just this valuing of symbols of achievements over actual achievements.\" He then quotes from Marshall Berman who goes in on Stalin's White Sea Canal Project of 1931-33 to say that Stalin seems to have been so intent on creating a highly visible symbol of development that he hindered actual development.\n\n**Page 44:** \"It would be a mistake to regard this market Stalinism as some deviation from the 'true spirit' of capitalism. On the contrary, it would be better to say that an essential dimension of Stalinism was inhibited by its association with a social project like socialism and can *only* emerge in a late capitalist culture in which images acquire an autonomous force.\" (Italics is his doing)\n\n**Page 49:** \"This is why Khrushchev's speech in 1965, in which he 'admitted' the failings of the Soviet state, was so momentous. It is not as if anyone in the party was unaware of the atrocities and corruption carried out in its name, but Khrushchev's announcement made it impossible to believe any more that the big Other was ignorant of them.\"\n\nWhenever so-called \"Marxists\" online recommend the book as something solid to read, I have serious doubts about their reading comprehension skills (among other things).",

I also think he got a little too absorbed in the idea of the cancellation of the future. Like, he said all modern music sounds the same and, like, no? Not even a little bit? He was so focused on rock (which is dead) that he failed to notice that hip-hop has evolved to be unrecognizable to its early iterations, and it effectively embodies a whole class of subgenres at this point. And electronic music is so sprawling and diverse it's positively mind-boggling.\n\nHe got so wrapped up in his pessimistic philosophy that he killed himself and missed out on the new revolutionary century. And that's a real tragedy imo",

Like 3/4's of Jameson's book was nonsensical to me, or at least so unbelievably verbose and abstract that itw practical value is non-existent. \n\nJameson had some interesting observations/predictions in terms of Nostalgia being a simulacrum that would increasingly dominate aspects of capitalist cultural commodities. To me that was really prescient. As well I seem to recall him saying somewhere in his Post.odernis. book that people consuming reviews of commodities would become just as prevalent as people consuming commodities themselves. For someone writing in the late 80's/early 90's that was really insightful. But the book he wrote is so inaccessible that it's usefulness to most people, especially working class people, is essentially zero.\n\nI found Mark Fischers book to at least be far more accessible. Apparently he claimed he was describing something similar to what Jameson did in his Postmodernism book. I didnt really get anything out of it and think your time is 1000x better spent reading someone like Parenti to start thinking in terms of class about our society and the world. Parenti is simple and super accessible and a great introduction to a practical understanding of our capitalist world. Using him as a spring board to other more co.ex writers is a much more worthwhile endeavor. The cultural \"critical theorists\" of the west aren't worth much in my opinion, and this is coming from someone who did a degree in sociology and so have read a lot of them.",

I would look at reading Democracy for the few, Power and the Powerless, Inventing Reality, To Kill a Nation, Against Empire, The Face of Imperialism, The Sword and the Dollar. Parenti has a great understanding of the class-based nature of our society and our political system. Democracy For the Few is a great breakdown of that, and the sequel Power and the Powerless is a great follow up read.",
