Country or yourself? You choose! How can anyone talk of business when we are all slaves in our own country? \n\nThere are more strong quotes, but this one overall depicts the ideology of the movie.

I respect making an account solely to challenge some of these lame comments. The OP question seems silly anyway considering someone is just asking to consume an imagined aesthetic, almost like it's pornography. For example, Star Trek fans are able to meld their space post-scarcity obsession with their political leanings - best of both worlds!\n\n>Im looking for stuff that really show them how they are, made by someone who truly understands how it really works\n\nThe notion that there are few, rare films that portray the U.S. as 'bad' seems odd since American movies do that constantly anyway.

It always does one of the following:\n\n1. Criticizes America, but also frames it as a lesser evil (e.g. Team America, Stranger Things, almost all Marvel movies with any political side to them, anything where the Soviets, Russians, or Chinese are the baddies);\n\n2. Shows their system as extremely fucked up, but also self-correcting. Examples: Horrible Bosses, Frost/Nixon (which is also category 3).\n\n3. Criticizes America heavily, but implies (in some way) that the issue is partisan, and that if The Good Party wins the problems will be fixed. This is particularly insidious, because it creates intense complacency by implying voting will fix all of America\u2019s problems. Examples: The West Wing, Frost/Nixon;\n\n4. Heavily criticizes America, but implies the cause is \u201chuman nature\u201d and thus that the exact same problems exist everywhere and it\u2019s all just forever been a gigantic clusterfuck of corruption everywhere and always will be (e.g. House of Cards);\n\n5. Acts like America *used* to be fucked up, but that they\u2019ve learned from their mistakes and won\u2019t do it again (e.g. any Vietnam movie made after the war ended, any movie or show about Antebellum chattel slavery), or that the problem is on its way to being fully fixed (e.g. Milk, which is also category 3);\n\n6. Correctly identifies a major problem in America, then also identifies Great Heroes fighting it within the bounds of the existing system. Examples: To Kill a Mockingbird (at the time), Just Mercy (also category 5). These just create liberal reformists. Sometimes the Great Hero is the director themselves (e.g. any Michael Moore film);\n\n7. Acts like America has flaws but is mostly good (e.g. Top Gun, Independence Day, almost every police show and movie);\n\n8. Treats another Western country as superior or even utopian, but in a \u201cwe could do this too!\u201d way (e.g. Sicko, Bowling for Columbine); or\n\n9. Acts like America is great, but with one specific part of it that is extremely evil and needs expunging (often for being \u201cUnamerican\u201d). E.g. documentaries about ICE.\n\nYou will *never* see a Hollywood movie (or a movie from any Western country) where America and the West are painted as completely irredeemable (unless all of humanity is) and worse than any of America\u2019s actually-existing enemies.\n\nThe Act of Killing (which is about The Jakarta Method) is the very closest movie made in the West that I can think of that isn\u2019t one of the above, but it still veers extremely close to #1 (\u201csee how bad Indonesia is?\u201d) and #9 (\u201cthe CIA working in cahoots with Hollywood is evil\u201d)",

As such, every WW2 film about America is category 7 or 1, or maybe 4 if it\u2019s particularly cynical (I can\u2019t think of any examples, but maybe Iwo Jima is one of them - like I said, I haven\u2019t seen it).",

Come and See had barely any appeal to Soviet movie-goers, probably because it was traumatising, especially since it was made only 40 years after the war had ended, and all they could take away from it was cynicism rather than celebrating the victory that many had sacrificed themselves to achieve, instead, the movie has largely been picked up and praised outside of the USSR, why is that?  \n\nI watched a British movie that has a similarly harrowing portrayal of war without glamour, Threads, a few years ago, but I believe that movie had more utility to those who watched it. Mainly because it was directed towards British movie-goers who were complicit in the posturing and aggression of their bourgeoisie during the Cold War, reflected by how the protagonist initially tuned themselves out of the beating drums of war caused by the British and American imperialism in Iran until it became a problem that they could not ignore because of the raised threat of nuclear war with the USSR, and the movie effectively demonstrated how vulnerable we would be to the collapse of global supply-chains that had been built through imperialism and will be destroyed by it.",
