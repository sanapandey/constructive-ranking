Jim Jones and best describes what I\u2019m feeling:\n\n\u2018Martin Luther King died for his love! Kennedy died talking about something he couldn\u2019t even understand, some kind of generalized love, and he never even backed it up! He was shot down! Bullshit, \u201cLove is the only weapon with which I got to fight\u201d. I\u2019ve got a hell of a lot of weapons to fight! I got my claws, I got cutlasses, I got guns, I got dynamite, I got a hell of a lot of fight! I\u2019ll fight! I\u2019ll fight! I will fight! I will fight! I will fight! I will fight!\n\nLet them hear it in the night! Yes, we\u2019ll fight! They\u2019re listening. Let the night roar! Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it. We\u2019ll kill them if they come!\n\nMao Tse Tung said change must come Change must come thru the barrel of a gun\u2019\n\nDo you feel the same?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "That's not a paraphrase of Mao. That white liberals want to discuss \"violence\" does not mean the subject is interesting, only that they are not the target audience of Maoism. That's why even Jim Jones can say it without thereby contributing anything of value to political thought.\n\nTo anyone else in the world the necessity of force in political change is obvious and banal. The actual contribution of Mao is the second part of the quote\n\n>Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party. \n\nThat is an original concept of political power\n\n>Do you feel the same?\n\nThere's nothing to feel. The quote is \"Every Communist must grasp the truth, \"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\"  The truth can only be grasped, not debated.",

A non violent protest only works because it represents the threat that violence from the protesting side would be devastating. Otherwise it's just a bunch of people going for a walk. Violence is a part of revolutionary action. If a revolution can succeed without having to use it, great. But how likely is that?",

If we could rally and vote our way to change, we would have done it already. Our current system is one that we cannot change from the outside, only the ultra wealthy can change from the inside, and fully and completely ignores the will and voice of the proletariat. Violence is used on the working class all the time, it is only a matter of time before the people use violence in return. Part of why we should be organizing en masse is to support the vanguard that does choose to use violence to change the system, and to fill the void left when the current bourgeoisie is pulled down before something worse takes its place.\n\nViolence is not the answer, it's a tool in the toolbox.",

Properly educating people on why capitalism is horrible is the first step. You need support from a vast majority of people to be able to start a revolution, Mao and his homies weren\u2019t just a few random people committing acts of violence, they had major support from a large number of people. To get to the point where violence would be necessary to overthrow capitalism it would take a large number of supporters. To get there you first need to educate people, get them on your side, build up and then overthrow\n\nAnd just like how you remove your self-accountability or the entertained, violated agency of the women in the filmed-rape cartoon media you consume, you remove even the possibility of conceiving a working set of communist politics, as you reduce broader social phenomena (how does one's relationship to the means of production under capitalist-imperialist society influence their class interests for instance) to left-wing conspiracy (Americans are brainwashed by BIG CHRIST and PragerU, we Americans need to fight back with our own brands and grass-roots activism poetry slams).",
