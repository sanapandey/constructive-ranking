    "selftext": "Hi everybody,\n\nI just want to preface to write that I have been trying to find methods I could do to organize, but I really have not been successful. Because I live in rural America, away from any big cities, most organizations have no reach here. \n\nI have been reading through Lenin's works about praxis like What is to Be Done? and Where to Begin?, and he in multiple works of his states that what would be best to create an organization would be an All-Russian Newspaper. Now, the obvious thing to do is to take this into modern times with the internet with social media; however, I see an obvious problem with this. Using social media would mean using bourgeois platforms designed to stir controversy and the posts that are the most controversial (especially TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram) which is why political discussions are so terrible online. Even though I personally don't have the resources to start an independent newspaper, I'm beginning to think it might be good to use posters or something similar to reach matters on the local level.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Lenin was responding to a concrete political situation with a thorough criticism and definite action, what is the political situation you are addressing and have you even thought of criticisms of it? (Really, the most important part about *WITB* is Lenin's criticism of the economists, not the formation of an All-Russian newspaper.)",

A tutorial is a checklist/schema, you do not need a tutorial, in fact that would be detrimental to you. You need principles which you learn by understanding universal lessons that can be drawn from your study of Marxism. Again, I emphasized Lenin's criticism of the economists as an important lesson to understand about anti-revisionism. Why did Lenin criticize the economists and went to such lengths to expose them among the movement? Why did the economists exist in the first place and what was the historical context (or really conjecture) that allowed them to emerge? What are the parallels of this for today? Every time you read a text or learn new information, you should start with asking these sorts of questions.\n\n>I thought that my situation is that we're living under capitalism which is oppressing wage workers by alienating them from their labor and leaving them barely above poverty which is a looming threat.\n\nWho is we? What does alienation entail and is this really what drives capitalism? What does barely above poverty entail, and is this a condition that exists in the same way between all countries?\n\nI ask these questions only partially rhetorically, I genuinely do want you to consider them, but I don't want you to try and provide an answer right now. You'd instead be better off searching through r/communism101 to see if there are other discussions on them there, and if you are still stumped, write up a post presenting your understanding of *WITBD* and allow that to be criticized if people find it worth responding to.",

So your main goal should be to find or recruit other communists to organize with. Then you can discuss as a group what to do next and how to gather founding. The next goal would depend on how much money and people you can gather. \n\nHow do you find other communists? Well, that'd depend on you and your town and other factors. The methods are endless, use your creativity. Any method that works for finding people for other activities would work for finding communists. \n\nDon't ditch social media. Yes, it's a bourgeois platform, but it's still useful; and more importantly, that's where the people are.",
