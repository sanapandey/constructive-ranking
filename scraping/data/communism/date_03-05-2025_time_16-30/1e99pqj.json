    "selftext": "Just came across [this](https://acp.us/declaration), apparently the 32nd national convention of the CPUSA was enough of a shitshow that the patsocs (Noah Khracivik, Haz, some PCUSA clubs) ~~and surprisingly degrowth socialist Jason Hickel~~ created a \"plenary committee\" to reconstitute the CPUSA as the ACP.\n\nThey list 16 points as proof of a weak and inoperable party, from obvious ones like tailing the democratic party despite the outright genocide in Gaza, to more nebulous ones like \"the ruling clique refuses to abide by the rules they themselves establish\", and some esoteric ones like giving up the \"sacred historical archives\" to New York University.\n\nAny comrades here know what happened during the CPUSA national convention and the validity of these claims? I'm very curious as to why the patsocs are conducting this coup now, after the CPUSA has long been revealed as revisionist and FBI-infiltrated.\n\n[Bonus](https://youtu.be/nv9dv9S2O-M): Their introduction video, a 1-minute+ long compilation of machinery overlaid by a civil war song (also known by the Christian hymn- Jesus loves the little children). It seems very vacuous.\n\nEdit: Mistook Jackson Hinkle as Jason Hickel, huge mistake on my part.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Communists, socialists along with labor unions were able to corner FDR to come up with new deal in early 20th century. They were powerful enough to start a revolution as well. \n\nBlack Panthers picked up the slack and were able to significantly move the needle to the left before they were destroyed. \n\nThen came along DSA, CPUSA, PSL and the likes. I have yet to see a long term strategy and necessary tactics to combat and end Capitalism behemoth. \n\nI am not saying that there aren\u2019t lefties in various forms busting their tails to inform and struggle but a revolution needs a revolutionary ideology which is missing from the picture.",

They'll just specifically be outside agitators against the people within CPUSA that wish to bring change",
