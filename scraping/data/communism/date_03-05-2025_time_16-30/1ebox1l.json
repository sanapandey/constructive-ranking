Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "It's the opposite. The Soviets capitulated to German social fascism as a matter of survival. Once Stalin was gone this was the foundation of revisionism in the DDR. This led to the historically unique situation of a leadership relatively hostile to the population and aware of the widespread persistence of fascism rather than one that capitulated to it, though perhaps the phenomenon only exists because Soviet realpolitik forcef the revisionist leadership to tolerate some level of political independence in the DDR compared to the rest of Eastern Europe where \"Stalinists\" were purged, rather than something unique to the DDR. Nevertheless, it is true Germany is the only first world country to experience a socialist revolution, even if only in a fraction of the country, and as a result the only place where fascism had a mass base. Honecker was as revisionist as K\u00e1d\u00e1r and just as much a Soviet plant so it was the objective situation that must have suffered.\n\nHad Stalin not been in such a weak position after the war (the best he could do was displace political struggle onto Yugoslavia and minor issues in the USSR which is why they are often seen as conspiracies and persecutions when decontextualized), perhaps socialism could have been established in the DDR and the entire world could have caught up with the German standard of living. That would be a world where revolution would be immanent and we would not need to worry about surviving from a position of weakness and compromise with revisionism.\n\n>I watched a video on East German semiconductor industry \n\nThis is the problem with watching \"apolitical\" analysis of technology. Even on a foundation of revisionism, the accomplishments of the socialist bloc in the realm of semiconductors was remarkable. They simply lacked the global manufacturing system that developed in the neoliberal period and could not keep up on price. Being backward technologically is fine in a planned economy (and expected in the periphery) but being undercut on both price and technology is death, at least if you are reliant on the world market for imports.\n\nThe problem is that Soviet revisionism was not revisionist enough. It's at least conceivable that the USSR could have been the ones at the forefront of the \"global socialist division of labor\" in which China and Vietnam became outsourcing destinations for manufacturing. It would have been difficult to imagine them maintaining obedience rather than turning to the US as they did, especially after the Sino-Soviet split, but we should remember that American penetration into China and Vietnam didn't come until well after the USSR fell. The primary investors were the Chinese diapora and Japanese capital, the former much weaker than the Soviet state and the latter politically hated in its former colonies. But despite overtures to this, in actual practice the USSR maintained the regime of subsidies Stalin had set up because of bureaucratic infighting between countries and Soviet political weakness in the third world.\n\nWhat I'm proposing is in no way desirable, to the masses there's little difference between the USSR or China as rising imperialist challenger in the same system of global labor arbitrage. But if you are particularly fixated on the political survival of the revisionist regimes in Eastern Europe without breaking with social fascism (that is, socialism with today's cheap made-in-China commodities) that's the hypothetical I can envision.",

But you can understand the Soviet decision; European Russia and the other European republics had been essentially razed by the Germans, so the Soviets had to rebuild with *something.*\n\nBoth Albert Szymanski and Austin Murphy talk about this in their books Is the Red Flag Flying? and The Triumph of Evil (respectively) if you want a more in-depth view. Murphy in particular seems to think East Germany could have economically outperformed and eclipsed West Germany had the Soviets let them keep their industrial base.",
