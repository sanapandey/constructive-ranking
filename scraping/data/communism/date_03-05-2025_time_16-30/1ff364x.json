            "body": "Odd, it is odd that the article does the job of \"who can cite more quotes\" while also saying the Nazariya article selectively quotes classic texts. They seem to go a great length citing Mao and Lenin and others to say the comprador cannot be industrial bourgeoisie, yet ignore the analysis of the actual Chinese Communist Party in Maoist China, which classified the big bourgeoisie of India as one of a comprador character. The article also brings up the protectionist nature of the industrial Indian bourgeoisie even before 1947 independence. In the same Chinese Party's analysis of Nehru at the time (1960s, especially with Nehru's increasingly anti-Chinese and pro-US policy), India's big bourgeoisie is quite definitively analysed as a comprador bourgeoisie that is anti-people.\n\nThis [paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3516427.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3Aaaf713207141c15cebf964e236aeb0bf&ab_segments=&origin=&initiator=&acceptTC=1) does a good job of showing how, while initially, the Chinese party presented Nehru as a vacillatory entity, it eventually classified Nehru as an agent of the comprador and the feudal landlords. I mean the Hung-chi'i article that the paper cites quite blatantly stated that Nehruvian 'socialism' was \"planning to develop bureaucratic, comprador monopoly capitalism\" Note that the Anvil article states that the Indian capitalist class was \"walking a tightrope\" during Nehruvian 'socialism'.\n\nNone of this is a political economy analysis from me, just some research to see what has been omitted to serve the purpose of the article. \n\nAlthough, the Anvil article did raise some questions in me which I could not answer because I am not developed enough. Especially on the point of tariffs and protectionism. This whole aspect is confusing since the Nazariya article talks about India losing its protective tariff shield by the WTO, and Anvil retorts by pointing out that India has some of the highest tariff rates right now and during Nehru's time it was a lot higher (also lends itself to their point that the initial protectionism and later transition to free trade is another evidence of proper capitalist development). Could someone explain this?",

Could someone explain this?\n\nFrankly, I just skimmed the article. I do not want to waste my time on such nonsense. But even then, i could glean that it was simply an amalgamation of different quotes from here and there, which seems to RWPI's signature move. What is more interesting that these people have found their way into this sub and are advertising themselves so boldly. But returning back. \n\nHow can tariffs be evidence of capitalist development? It provides a simple blanket protection the the small and medium industries here. The argument is circular - since tariffs are present, india is capitalist and tariffs can only be present when india is capitalist. (Also note that these are protections against imports, not FDI/FII, which does not even need to be declared at once through the government's \"automatic route\"; they only need to be declared in the annual statement - this is how imperialist capital penetrates the country) But the question of tariffs here is specifically related to agriculture and the question of MSP. The Indian landlord classes had for long fought against erosion of the MSP system since it would also adversely affect them. The demand for removal of MSP systems also came from the WTO in 1992, which itself is led by the big four FMCG groups. Interestingly, the MSP itself was a result of the green revolution:\n\n>MSP was introduced in 1966-67, when India was desperately in a food deficit. The government was keen to boost domestic food grain production through input-intensive \u2018Green Revolution technology\u2019, which included improved high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice with chemical fertilisers and pesticides, better irrigation systems, mechanisation, among other methods. \n\n>The adoption of these input-intensive technologies needed guaranteed financial support of MSP to the farmers. Thus, the food security of India is ensured by adoption of Green Revolution technologies supported by MSP since 1967 onwards.\n\nhttps://www.downtoearth.org.in/agriculture/denying-msp-legal-guarantee-threat-to-india-s-food-security-94528\n\nComing to its impact, the MSP is not a legal guarantee, although the farmers are protesting at the sambhu border for the same. And while the awareness regarding MSPs are low, it acts as the price setter in indian agriculture. Farmers are often fooled by traders into selling for lower than MSP because of lack of infrastructure in supply chain networks and agricultural markets. But this does not translate to them being useless. Rather, it guarantees, however poorly, that the working class can get their food and that at least some farmers can almost make a living. \n\nAll this could be learned from RUPE's issue on farm laws:\n\nhttps://rupe-india.org/aspects/aspects-no-75-76/\n\nOn another note, I find it hilarious that cotton has been mentioned in one of the quoted texts in the word salad as showing growth of market penetration which is evidence of capitalist development. 87% of cotton in india by 2009 was grown from bt cotton seeds:\n\nhttps://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/biotech_crop_profiles/bt_cotton_in_india-a_country_profile/download/Bt_Cotton_in_India-A_Country_Profile.pdf\n\n Bt cotton itself is owned by Monsanto, which has landed itself in a legal dispute because the government had to take away its license some years ago. Bt cotton has made normal seed use unviable and is itself producing problems such as pink bullworm pests. This is hurting cotton farmers heavily.",

Why were protectionist policies in effect before? The answer, as thoroughly explained in the Anvil article, is that protectionist policies are always used by bourgeoisie to develop capitalism and stand on their feet, as the policies help the bourgeoisie in being protected against imperialist powers. When that was no longer required, the Indian bourgeoisie started liberalizing, as once it had stood on its feet, protectionist policies acted more as a hindrance to their growth rather than aiding it.

I've done a lot more reading now and I'm ready to answer back.\n\nThe shitty quote loving Anvil article claims the semicolonial semifeudal thesis is 'dogmatic' and blindly applies Maoism to Indian conditions, while shamelessly citing Mao and Lenin quotes and uses the narrow interpretation of their writings (based on their struggle in their nations) to justify its argument.\n\nAt the same time the article doesn't bring up one document or publication from the Chinese Communist Party in the 1960s which characterised the Indian big bourgeoisie as comprador and Nehru as an agent of imperialism. You and this article talk about dogma yet ignore the actual **concrete** analyses by Maoists during Mao's time on the Indian bourgeoisie. I'm quite sure that studying their analysis is better than selectively citing quotes. Another example is the Anvil article reply to Suniti Kumar Ghosh's point about non-antagonistic contradictions between the comprador and the imperialist monopoly capital:\n\n>First of all, Mao does not mention anywhere the\u00a0*independent*\u00a0struggle of\u00a0*comprador*\u00a0bourgeoisie against the imperialists. Rather, he defines\u00a0*comprador*\u00a0as those who \u201cserve imperialists directly\u201d and who are \u201c*wholly appendages of the international bourgeoisie*\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile the Chinese party publication itself:\n\n>Of course there are still contradictions with foreign monopoly capital and sometimes under the pressure of the people Nehru showed a certain degree of difference from imperialism. But the class nature and economic status of the Indian big bourgeoisie and big landlords ensure that the Nehru government depends on and serves imperialism.\n\nAs stated before, Anvil takes the more narrow interpretation of every quote (not even the essence behind it, but literally the words used in the quote especially considering Anvil's obsession with the words \"wholly appendages\") to paint a false picture. There's a reason Ghosh specifies that comprador and imperialist contradictions are non-antagonistic. Basic dialectical materialism. \n\nu/shashank9225 and u/smokeuptheweed9  have already done a better job of explaining why tariffs and protectionism alone doesn't make a bourgeoisie not comprador. But one of the points I want to reemphasise is your narrow understanding of tariffs on import goods as proof of the big capitalists \"standing on their own feet\". Meanwhile in this so called \"standing on their own feet\" period the bourgeoisie were [begging](https://www.marxists.org/archive/guha/indian-bourgeoisie.pdf) for American investment in the 1960s (note that anvil hilariously states that the Indian bourgeoisie at the time was walking a \"tightrope\" between Nehruvian socialism and public sector capitalism). The big capitalists like Tata and Birla during the \"standing on their own feet\" period of 1950s-60s could not have survived without foreign loans and capital. [Nagi Reddy's](https://www.marxists.org/subject/india/apcccr/india-mortgaged/reddy-12.pdf) work on this is quite clear. How many important industries today in India have a 100% FDI allowance in the automatic route (no need for government approval)?\n\nMy question about tariffs was simply a question isolated to that point, yet you have pounced on the opportunity to characterise the whole essence of the argument based on tariffs.",

What sort of perfect \"self-sustainable\" capitalism in the national boundaries are you expecting in the era of imperialism? I really need an answer to this question, what do semi-feudal thesis holders believe the perfect Indian capitalism would look like in the time of imperialism and unequal exchange? This IS the nature of capitalism, especially in backwards capitalist countries, who get the short stick of unequal exchange. Again, as I have noticed many times before, what you have is a perfect image of capitalism and all you do is compare the current Indian economy with that image, and when you do not come to the conclusion that both match, your inevitable point is to say that semi-feudalism must exist. This is a gross mistake of an \"analysis\" that the semi-feudal thesis offers at the end of it all.",

The argument being this: \n\n\"Moving on to the second point, the foreign policies of the Indian ruling class are against the interests of the national bourgeoisie which is struggling for independence. Marx in the \u2018German Ideology\u2019, mentions that manufacturing was always sheltered by protective duties in the home market. In India, this shield was completely revoked after the WTO forced India to remove protective tariffs. This led to the complete ruin of the MSME sector, which was run by the national bourgeoisie(middle bourgeoisie) of the country. This section aspires for independent capitalist development but is restricted by a government that backs the interests of imperialism. What independent foreign policy does the Indian state have, when it extinguishes its own indigenous manufacturing sector at the behest of the imperialist institutions?\" It is funny how Nazariya itself pretends that IMF policies were \"accepted\" by India willing so as to term the Indian bourgeoisie comprador while you guys yourselves are saying that they were FORCED on India. Your own arguments seem not clear to yourselves.\n\nSubsequently, \"Engels wrote: \u201cThe bourgeoisie in Germany requires protection against foreign countries in order to clear away the remnants of the feudal aristocracy.\u201d This brings into question another aspect of the analysis made in Anvil, the analysis that India follows the Prussian path to capitalism, where feudalism was removed using reformism. If Germany, a country that followed the Prussian path had a protectionist foreign policy, to ensure the end of feudal fetters, why doesn\u2019t India also have the same policy? The answer to this question lies in the fact that Indian feudalism is not being removed by reformism. India continues to be a semi-feudal country.\"\n\nThis was answered to clearly in anvil article, which evidently you yourself have not done a good job of reading, because you are not even replying to any of their arguments. I would really love if Nazariya folks make a reply to the Anvil's article.",

Not to mention, my citation of the Chinese party was not to repeat my original comment but to add to it.\n\nThe reason for my choice to bring up the Chinese Party's analysis was to focus on antagonistic vs non-antagonistic contradictions, one that Anvil blatantly ignores in its article while you claim they already responded to it. When in fact, it is based on a mischaracterisation of Ghosh's words (by the way, I didn't even mention how Ghosh's point about non-antagonistic contradiction based on the share of profits was twisted by Anvil when it uses the word \"struggle\" and \"independent\", to make it seem like Ghosh is making some obvious contradiction when he isn't). The actual Chinese Party itself acknowledged existing contradictions between the big bourgeoisie and imperialist capital, yet classifies the former as comprador. (This time, I am actually repeating my point because you seem to be hell bent on 1: not addressing my points, 2: mischaracterising them).\n\nAnother reason which was also not included in my original comment, was me bringing up the accusations of dogmatism by Anvil. Yet you, much like the Anvil article, ignore any sort of concrete analysis made by the Maoist Chinese Party. Which is why narrow interpretations of Mao and other leaders quotes throughout the article is convenient.\n\nAlso I think you've made a reading mistake. You bring up Nazariya's mention of the WTO protective shield to say that Nazariya states that the comprador \"accepts IMF policies\" (for one, Nazariya mentions WTO) while we are saying it was forced on India. Firstly, you don't seem to understand the essence of our arguments in the first place, neither the concept of contradictions. Secondly and more embarassingly, the Nazariya article itself uses the word \"forced\" with regards to the removal of tariffs. You have done so little study of anything in this conversation that you are getting your own words jumbled. Which is why you also have not engaged with India's FDI policies, the need of foreign capital for the basic functioning of the so called non-comprador bourgeoisie like Tata and Birla (during its \"standing on its own feet period\"), etc.\n\n\"You are not replying to any of their arguments\" except I have continued to do so since my first comment. I am actually giving you an opportunity to do so but you hide behind the shield of \"Anvil talked about it\" except it didn't. If they did they would understand the a comprador being \"wholly appendage\" to imperialism but also having contradictions with it isn't some sort of illogical mistake.",

It seems like Nazariya article say 1. Prussian path in India wasnt taken because that requires protectionist policies, and India doesnt have them, then continue to question India's independent foreign policy because WTO's policies were forced upon it (along with the REMOVAL of protectionist policies.). What kind of argument it is? 2. Also, is the fact that the policies were able to be forced on Indian big bourgeoisie the proof of the fact that India doesnt have an independent foreign policy? 3. Taking back my argument, let me rephrase it. The Nazariya article says \"This section aspires for independent capitalist development but is restricted by a government that backs the interests of imperialism.\". This is the reason I jumbled up my words, because saying that the WTO policies were \"forced\", but then making this argument which makes it seem otherwise.",

This is twisting of words to an insane extent. The nature of indian bourgeoisie was comprador even before 1947 as was seen in the deals between the tatas and the british during the first world war. \n\n>Why were protectionist policies in effect before?\n\nBecause there was a big bad maoist China right up there which had inspired the Naxalbari and many others across the world. India went to war over some territory that wasn't even ours historically because it wanted to stand up against the hopes and aspirations of the working classes and the peasantry here. But you cannot know this, you have already denounced suniti ghosh without even opening his book.\n\nTo anyone else reading this:\n\nSuniti Kumar Ghosh's The Himalayan Adventure on marxistorg\n\nSome industry was needed and the working classes needed to be given some discount. It wasn't that India never had any foreign investment - we had so much even in the 80s that we had to borrow from international agencies to pay it back. Just because the economy was opened up in the 90s doesn't mean we didn't have foreign capital flowing here through donations and what not. This is a fact which I learned in high school economic textbooks itself. \n\n>When that was no longer required, the Indian bourgeoisie started liberalizing\n\nYes, the WTO and IMF documents that clearly spelt out that either India could open up or starve was just for show because it is India's bourgeoisie acting as junior partners of imperialism that dictate IMF loan conditions! Pathetic - your twisting around of basic facts.\n\nEdit: u/turingmachine4, since you are here please also explain to us why has India's manufacturing sector stayed the same in terms of value added if the \"capitalist\" class has \"stood on its feet\" after liberalisation:\n\nhttps://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?locations=IN\n\nAlso, tell us why has the labour force percentage in the agriculture stayed more or less the same, and why some of them have moved to construction work and not manufacturing since capitalist mode of production entails movement from farms to industries.",
