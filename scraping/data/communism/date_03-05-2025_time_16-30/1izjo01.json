    "selftext": ">PKK leader Abdullah \u00d6calan's Calls for Disarmament and the Dissolution of the PKK. The PKK was born in the 20th century, in the most violent epoch of the history of humanity, amidst the two World wars, under the shadow of the experience of real socialism and the cold war around the World. The outright denial of Kurdish reality, restrictions on basic rights and freedoms - especially freedom of expression - played a significant role in its emergence and development. The PKK has been under the heavy realities of the century and the system of real socialism in terms of its adopted theory, program, strategy and tactics. In the 1990s, with the collapse of real socialism due to internal dynamics, the dissolution of the denial of Kurdish identity in the country, and improvements in freedom of expression, led to weakening of the PKK\u00b4s foundational meaningfulness and resulted in excessive repetition. Throughout the history of more than 1000 years, Turkish and Kurdish relations were defined in terms of mutual cooperation and alliance, and Turks and Kurds have found it essential to remain in this voluntary alliance to maintain their existence and survive against hegemonic Powers. The last 200 years of capitalist modernity have been marked by primarily with the aim to break this alliance. The forces involved, in line with their class-based interests, have played a key role in furthering this objective. With monist interpretations of the Republic, this process has accelerated. Today, the main task is to restructure the historical relationship, which has become extremely fragile, without excluding consideration for beliefs with the spirit of fraternity. The need for a democratic society is inevitable. The PKK, the longest and most extensive insurgency and armed movement in the history of the Republic, found social base and support, and was primarily inspired by the fact that the channels of democratic politics were closed. The inevitable outcome of the extreme nationalist deviations - such as a separate nation-state, federation, administrative autonomy, or culturalist solutions - fails to answer the historical sociology of the society. Respect for identities, free self-expression, democratic self-organization of each segment of society based on their own socio-economic and political structures, are only possible through the existence of a democratic society and political space. The second century of the Republic can achieve and assure permanent and fraternal continuity only if it is crowned with democracy. There is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realization of a political system. Democratic consensus is the fundamental way. The language of the epoch of peace and democratic society needs to be developed in accordance with this reality. The call made by Mr. Devlet Bahceli, along with the will expressed by Mr. President, and the positive responses from the other political parties towards the known call, has created an environment in which I am making a call for the laying down of arms, and I take on the historical responsibility of this call. As in the case with any modern community and party whose existence has not been abolished by force, would voluntarily do, convene your congress and make a decision; all groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself. I convey my greetings to all those who believe in co-existence and who look forward to my call. '' \n\nhttps://x.com/clashreport/status/1895119291566960785",

I think i must add up to this in a separate comment to give you a chance of reply:\n\nYou have multiple posts in r/anarchism and r/anarchism101, which means you are likely emotionally involved, as \"rojava\" is the manifestation of mythology in reality, as the idylic myth anarchism is not without any kind of actual meaningful strength since 1937.  But this is not necessarily a reason you have trustworthy information to the subject of the post.\n\n I also saw you are anti-vanguard parties and consider marxism as some kind of libertarian distortion, in this comment:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1iownbh/in_modern_context_who_are_the_proletariat/mcy9z0e/?context=3\n\nMarx supported a \"authoritarian\" centralized state in some way or another and his materialist method applied to politics simply cannot be dissociated from authority and coercion, so,\n\n \" If you mean the process of historical/dialectical-material analysis that is used to discover the best methods in pursuing liberation from class violence, then no. I believe that dialectical analysis is the best method through which to interpret and make sense of class history\", \n\n...You would be already wrong, but: \n\n\"If instead you mean the ideology of scientific socialism as specifically practiced by the Bolsheviks and Soviets in the form of socialist Vanguardism, then yes. I'm not convinced Vanguardism is the correct conclusion to draw from a historical and material analysis of Europe either, but that's irrelevant. What I'm saying is that the specific history and material conditions of the colonized and subaltern necessitates a different path to liberation.\", \n\n...Is just a gross misreading of marx:\n\nMao didn't thought vanguardism should be abandoned because it is the logical development of the dictatorship of the proletariat to the imperialist era as a higher stage of capitalism, as a consequence of his understanding of lenin contributions to political economy, developing what marx developed. You could at least attempt to present an alternative to imperialism as a general understanding of monopoly capitalism today, but there aren't any which are convincing enough, as even liberal literature refuses to try in a serious way\n\n\"marxist/hegelian\" is not applicable to marx materialism (which also means you misread marx in his ontology and epistemology), but it also follows \"and the continued existence of Anarchic and decentralized liberation movements suggests that to be a better model.\", \n\nWhich is just a delusion, as there is no large-scale continued existence of anything. EZLN is not libertarian nor anarchist and operates by indigenous traditions of political life, rojava is a micro-states confederation, and the rest are smaller and less population dense than the slum i was born in. \n\nThese \"liberation movements\" are spread thin in the last 50 years. In the meanwhile the CPI Maoist had at a moment the double of land area of \"rojava\", has multiple ethnicities fighting, with the founding of the party having happened in 2004, but as a proletarian force instead of petty-bourgeois, are fighting the indian fascist hindutva juggernaut, and are not pawns of the U.S, are not having mercenaries and western labour-aristocrats taking flights to fight for them as voluntaries, are not getting funded or given weapons. \n\nI understand how being threatened in \"rojava\" existence as a state harms the academic cathedral first-world labour aristocrat anarchist dream that marxism is a past of the 20th century because we supposedly are in \"post-postmodernity\", libertarian left politics are alive and not in life support, the future is insurrectionary and not revolutionary (post-structuralism is a great of a drug in rejecting; universalism, beings and nature predating and conditioning essences, or general hypothesis of anything as credible), and that the savage, \"authoritarian\" third-world \"idiots\" will be tutored and civilized by the \"libertarian\" eurocentric white \"intellectuals\". \n\nBut, we all know, in reality and not in a fictional universe, we are still in modernity, imperialism is still here in the way it was decades ago, class struggle and dialectical materialism shapes history (instead of only being a lens to interpret it), and anarchism, left-libertarianism are dead.",

                            "body": "No, that would make you someone who is wrong.\n\nFirstly, the PKK *is* the Kurdish struggle; no other party or institution has been willing to take up arms and fight for Kurdish liberation. The Kurdistan Workers' Party has been the vanguard of the Kurdish national struggle since its founding. If the PKK were to disband, the Kurdish struggle would collapse, and in time, so too would the Kurds as a people. Even the Kurds who support the *actual* imperialist Kurdish puppet parties know this to be true...\n\nSecondly, the PKK has never been an ally of American imperialism. This claim is pure Turkish propaganda, amplified by the ethnic chauvinism of the very states oppressing Kurds (see: our friend to whom I was replying). In reality, Kurdish forces have spent the past decade deepening ties with Assad\u2019s Syria, Russia, and Iran. The weapons they\u2019re using to counter Turkey's S\u0130HAs come from Iran. In Iraq, the PKK collaborates closely with the PMF. In pre-HTS Syria, the SDF and Syrian government jointly administered cities, while Syrian, Russian and Iranian forces patrolled other cities in Rojava and established military bases througout the region, all to deter an invasion from NATO\u2019s second-largest military (resistance against which is central to our national struggle, might I add). These are things I criticise the PKK for as a Maoist, but which makes it all the more frustrating to see e-socialists uncritically parrot the talking points of their Syrian/Iraqi/Turkish/Iranian internet buddies (or alternatively, 2016 Leftie Twitter/Reddit takes on Rojava).\n\nBut it doesn't even matter. Even if we entertain the absurd idea that reality isn't real and your fiction is real, only a heartless person would condemn a people subjected to national oppression for trying to survive by any means necessary. Forgive me if my anger is misplaced, but we're talking about colonial nation-states whose borders, institutions and identity are built on the bones of our ancestors and sustained by continued death, destruction and misery that we've been enduring for a century now... But we're supposed to just let ourselves be subjected to shit that most people reading this can't even begin to imagine, to let others brand our saviours with words you don't even know the meaning of like \"fascist\", to let you belittle and reject our history and our struggle just because some losers on Reddit cling to nonsense Manichaean vibes-based conceptualisations of ideologies, ideologies whose greatest heroes would spit on these people for disgracing? Do you even have any idea what the Kurds in Syria have been through?\n\nLook, I've had a peek at your profile and you don't seem like a bad person. I can only assume that your views are rooted in ignorance rather than malice, and I really hope that's the case. Anyway, your role as a \"communist\" should be to offer critical support to the progressive forces in the region, while trying to persuade them not to rely on imperialist forces for their survival. Not to denigrate them at a time when millions of people around the world are in despair at the possibility of the party being forced to disband at the hands of a NATO state. Be better.\n\nYou do not know our history, nor the history of the PKK, nor the reality on the ground as it is today. Our Syrian friend here says what they say out of chauvinism, but what's your excuse?",

So we aren't \"writing off\" the struggle, since that implies adjusting it to count for zero; it's far worse than that.  We are instead calculating the enormous human deficit created with the total betrayal to humanity and service to imperialism, and trying to figure out where all the future spilled blood will come from to offset the damage of PKK's \"strategic decision\" and the net cost which now must be borne by the rest of humanity and the revolution so that the PKK could survive a mere moment longer as amerika's comprador stooge before coming undone all the same.  Ask yourself here who sold out the Kurdish National Struggle by handing it over to amerikkka on a platter to be remade, used-up, and exhausted in loyal service the empire (and then discarded like disposable cutlery once the imperial victory was secured); why do you need to defend this organization? \n\nIt's not fair, but if you are Jewish and the Gestapo shows up to take you away, selling out the other people hiding in the walls and falling on your knees before the Nazis to try and get yourself some degree of clemency or protection will ultimately save neither you nor them (in fact, with this sort of capitulation, you are betraying everyone else everywhere in the world, including all the other revolutionaries presently being tortured by amerika and it's proxies). You are advancing the objectives of the enemies of humanity and entrenching their position of domination over humanity, and the battle for humanity to free itself will now cost all those extra lives and hours required just to take out and neutralize the now amerikan-aligned proxy forces and the gains for fascism they enabled and provided.  All the PKK's \"strategic necessity\" and abandonment of communist principles did was doom everyone and help secure a capitalist victory across the board. Even this point about torture is actually pretty standard for Maoism: Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao are fearless heroes for refusing to break after years of torture, while Wang Hongwen and Yao Wenyoun both broke under torture, forever reducing their importance and significance, tarnishing their legacies and earning them contempt.

To be reductive, you have to delete the rest of the human struggle from the equation, presenting any compromise, [no matter how beneficial for imperialism](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-oil-usa/syria-says-us-oil-firm-signed-deal-with-kurdish-led-rebels-idUSKBN24Y0FD/) and damaging for revolution, as necessary despite it being a net gain and win for imperialism, and a permanent setback for the global movement to topple imperialism. You have to lie to yourself that the SDF aren't receiving imperialist aid and weapons and support and training, etc, or pretend this isn't being an agent/pawn of imperialism when that's exactly what it is -- self-imaginings are irrelevant in the face of these real actions taken by the PKK leadership.  You keep making this emotional appeal about what the Kurds have been through, and that isn't in dispute, but the entire point is that the PKK leadership has betrayed that struggle and you are defending the betrayers (even if many Kurds themselves haven't fully grasped the betrayal -- the Russians didn't realize what Khrushchev did to them and many of them still dont to this day), and keep trying to imagine them as your allies/heroes/leaders rather than the revisionists who abandoned Marxism (which itself is a crime worthy of violent opposition by the most basic logic of Maoism) and sold out the struggle to the empire.",

But if you are attacking the politics that have been endorsed here (which is antithetical to \"the average western leftist\" space) and specifically with regard to the PKK over the past decade and beyond, telling them that what they were doing was incorrect and that abandoning Marxism was wrong and leading to this very outcome, then what's the point of even engaging if you still refuse to listen to what we are saying.  You're obviously close to the PKK, but this is where you may need to be brave and interrogate your own relationship to them.  If this is too much to ask, you have no shortage of anarchists who swear the YPG did everything right and some of them are even celebrating this rejection of armed struggle as a good thing.  The entirety of Western \"Leftism\" (the very people the PKK made their appeal to on an international scale, and even had some become celebrity tourist-soldiers go bat for them) cheered on the PKK at every turn and refused to criticize or condemn or ever insist on an alternative course -- and now the PKK is here at disarmament and one of the worst possible outcomes for everyone has been reached.  The lesson of how this could have been avoided begins at the same points where the Marxist criticisms emerge.  Why do you want the people who were correctly criticizing and confronting the mistakes of the PKK as they were happening to shut up?  We were trying to help and out advice and criticisms went completely unheeded.  Treating you like you can do no wrong is not respect, respect looks like being able to confront and oppose mistakes, and stand for Marxism, even when it seems counter-intuitive or difficult at a pragmatic level, and do so unapologetically.  If you just want empty, hollow words that feel comforting, why not go back to the anarchists, if you dont want to hear truths that might cut?\n\n>How will Marxism be able to solve the current regional militaristic truth, if there\u2019s so little support? he betrayal comes from the international left, that ignored the circumstances, rested their ass on a comfortable chair and enjoys their life that imperialism enabled them, while others were fighting for their life.\n\nThe entire power of Marxism is that when you have correct Marxist politics, you have the capacity to find and grow support from the masses, from the oppressed classes, by being the authentic expression and representation of their real interests.  Marxism is the only thing capable of solving the current regional militaristic truth, and there is no other actual solution to the problem, and all of the non-Marxist solutions are doomed to failure, or at best, relocating the problem elsewhere and hoisting it upon someone else.  And if you want to complain that the white labour aristocrat \"left\" will not actually help you, I would say that's correct and a good lesson to have internalized, and if your revolution depends on that class for your victory, then the politics are incorrect and the revolution will not succeed -- at least I have the integrity to state this openly and I'm still here discussing it with you honestly.  The people who deny that divide are the ones who pandered to the YPG for the last decade -- do you have no contempt for them for doing nothing but cheerleading and good vibes and toxic positivity, as the struggle arrived at this dead end, and all of their supposed support amounting to even less for Kurdish nationhood than my ruthless criticisms? \n\n>Go and blame imperialism and those who benefit from it, but not the individuals that are victims of it the most. How is it living in the west? Do you have to fear losing your loved ones?\n\nI do blame imperialism, and me speaking to you now is me trying to fight it.  Imperialism is a gigantic beast machine devouring the world -- it is the \"loved one killing machine\" responsible for more lost loved ones for everyone, everywhere of anything ever to exist.  One of the benefits (undeserved and unearned) of being safe behind a desk is that I can see imperialism in it's full, globe-spanning horror, and from this wide perspective I can see the gaps and collapse within the defensive lines of the global forces trying to resist it, and I can try and communicate and help coordinate that defence, *which begins ideologically.*  Imperialism is a gigantic machine, the size of the planet, ripping resources and labour power from the Global South, processing them into consumer goods in Asia, and then shipping them to the West for consumption, while leaving behind a trail of death, waste, destruction, pollution, and misery.  As more systems are captured and assimilated by imperialism (presently most of the planet), it incorporates them into it's own processes, and uses them to sustain, repair, maintain, and expand itself.  Again, you are not wrong that I'm attached to this machine and I benefit from it, that's an objective problem for both me and worldwide communism to ultimately contend with, but I'm in full acknowledgement that being a communist means severing my connections to the machine and comes with significant cost.  And if I can't sever myself from imperialism, then imperialism still must be destroyed and my recommendation to the entire communist movement is and always has been to take me out along with it. I have no reserves or conditions if I'm taken out in the blast that takes down the machine, but the machine must be stopped. \n\nBut the problem is that this applies for the PKK as well (or the Communist Party of Vietnam, if we want to draw the comparison of being forced to become revisionists and abandon Marxism -- nothing changes: Vietnam is presently revisionist and the current CPV needs to be struggled against).  If the PKK was dying and the situation was grim, and the only option -- the absolute only way for the PKK to survive -- was to go to the imperialism machine (the very one looming over them; the very machine they had once organized to fight against) and ask to be connected to the life support system of the imperialist machine to save the PKK, then the problem remains that the PKK is now connected to that machine and dependent on that machine (and even benefitting from it to some degree, like me, and coming at someone else's expense) and for the PKK to ever resume the struggle against the machine, it will need to sever itself from that machine, which will come at great cost and be much more difficult and demanding than if they had never been connected to the machine in the first place.  And as we are seeing with USAID and other forms of imperialism, even being connected to imperialism for life support is no guarantee of survival, as they can and will cut you off at any time when they feel you have become a burden on their systems or have served your useful purpose.  Where the PKK is now at is a much more massive setback (both for Kurdish nationalism and for destroying imperialism) than if the party had fractured ten or twenty years ago and started a fight over these mistakes, and as Maoist organizations around the world have shown, it is still possible to soldier on against imperialism completely alone, but it does require correct politics.   And when a sufficient number and size of Maoist struggles emerge, imperialism will be strangled out, but abandoning everything that leads to the creation of the Maoist movement, to the accumulation of sufficient mass for Maoist struggle is a setback that now requires rebuilding everything over again.  But what is even the point if you aren't going to hear the lesson or recognize the revisionists and abandoners of Marxism as a real enemy?\n\nWhen the genocidal amerikan expansion across Turtle Island was happening, Indigenous nations would sometimes form great alliances and coalitions to try to beat back the amerikan advance.  The amerikans could win against most tribes one on one, but as a vast chain they posed a real threat.   But the amerikans would offer bribes or clemency or even \"life support\" to certain nations to try and get them to break rank, and when the chain broke down, the entire alliance collapsed.  It's possible that there was no stopping the amerikan empire, but if the chain had held there would surely have been more of a chance. Not to mention, the Indigenous nations that defected for amerika didn't get any better outcomes; most of them were wiped out to the same extent as those who fought -- imperialism will not honour its agreements.  Defeating imperialism in the present is the same task, forging a great chain on the world scale.  You are correct, pointing out that there are so few other links, and that there has not been any white chain for almost a century now (and wont be; if some white people join the revolution they will be few in number and you must not count on some significant mass of whites to come to the rescue and help save the day -- they wont be there, and this is an obstacle to overcome not something where you can guilt white labour aristocracy into becoming proletariat), but the terrible conditions for connecting and holding the chain at present cannot function as an excuse to completely abandon your link to hand it over to imperialism.  Revolution will need many links and everyone needs to stand their ground even through the worst adversity.  If you want to forge the chain that can finally kill the imperialism machine, then all the links need to hold out and interconnect as much as they are able -- submitting to imperialism breaks the chain, and then you have to go all the way back to the forge and start over again.",

I'm not attacking the PKK for no reason.  Clearly the PKK, who are now putting down their arms, needed to be struggled *against* harder in the much earlier stages, and perhaps just as much now in the present, and if depicting revisionism as a betrayal (which it is, by the basics of Maoism) is too harsh for you at present, then pretend I'm using nicer words and apply the same lesson.  When I first began studying Maoism, I didn't like the realization that the USSR from 1957 onward was basically taken over by fascists and that it had to be struggled against, and was upset when it was called this (even by Mao).  But by learning the lessons of Marxism, you understand why that is correct and why that offers a real historical explanation for events, and how to fight the revisionism which generated and produced that undesirable outcome -- a lesson applicable to both the USSR and the PKK.   Again, if you want someone to pander to you so that you feel good, the anarchists will do just that for you -- if you want to destroy imperialism once and for all, there is only Maoism.",

Im not telling you to shut up and not share your valid criticism nor am I denying PKKs shifting course, potentially, if not already, making it a profiteer of imperialism to an extent, where it ultimately needs to be struggled against akin to the mentioned CPV. I\u2019m also not criticising your right to criticise, but the lack of humility, honesty and responsibility in regards to the victimisation caused by imperialism and the resulting unreachability of political ideals. \n\nOur discussion doesn\u2019t change a single bit to the current truth on the ground, only mobilisation and fighting under the pretext of the already existing ideals will. If Communism gets detached from reality and reduces itself down to a theoretical science, it\u2019s a sign of defeat. The undeserved position perhaps provides you a more complete understanding of imperialism and its devilish nature, but what it won\u2019t and can\u2019t do is provide you with the real experienced psychological and physical suffering. The detachment makes one view everything through a rational/scientific scope, making the psychological and physical components that lead to the revisionism/resignation getting completely neglected. The least a communist should be capable of is recognising their own failure and responsibility for the outcome, otherwise you are just giving orders and advice from a privileged position that are to no practical use.\n\nIn a globalised world, and this I believe is crucial, the proletariat can only effectively function if it interconnects globally. I couldn\u2019t care less about who does or doesn\u2019t contribute to the struggle, the criticism emerges with the growing globalism and technological advancement that make resistance increasingly more difficult to achieve. If Marxism requires the attraction and mobilisation of the masses, mainly the proletariat, to struggle against imperialism, how can one be a Marxist if not part of this struggle? If you don\u2019t make yourself part of the struggle, you aren\u2019t contributing to it and  therefore just as the PKK are submitting to imperialism! You are becoming a participant of the betrayal and severing yourself from it, while having the awareness, moreover comes off as extremely arrogant; a non-Marxists attribute. \n\nAnd that\u2019s where my criticism is stemming from. Again, it isn\u2019t you pointing out and acknowledging the revisionism that upsets me, nor am I denying it, but your detachment from the cruel reality that has led to this point, without showing any sign of responsibility nor participation! I don\u2019t expect you to fight, but as a self proclaimed communist you should at least be able to recognise the truth beyond regional developments. Anything else is just an additional form of \u201efuelling the imperialist machine\u201c. \n\nAs you\u2019ve outlined, this machine is an enormous destructive beast. The first step is to acknowledge and internalise that this is an international and not regional fight against this beast, which becomes increasingly difficult to topple if the international community fails to offer some significant material support to initially well intentioned movements, so that again revisionism doesn\u2019t become an option, (indicating defeat against imperialism), and withstanding becomes more prosperous. \n\nBetrayal starts at a position of power and ends at a position of defeat. The latter needs to be prevented, a legendary status doesn\u2019t help. It\u2019s either OUR loss and betrayal or no one\u2019s. Currently, a fight against the world can only be won with the support of the world. Globalisation will always win against isolation. \n\nYour perspective lacks fundamental ideological elements (mainly conviction and willingness of sacrifice) and reduces communism down to a regional struggle of the suffering, making it extremely exclusive. The inclusion of well off ideological driven individuals is crucial in the current world order, and if your view relies on their exclusion, this should be were Marxist criticisms should emerge!",

I've never denied responsibility and I stand by the statement that *everyone everywhere is responsible for all that exists.*  There is no exception and the point of the example about the alliances of Turtle Island is not to single out and blame everything on this or that tribe for breaking the chain of the alliance, but to make clear the lesson that this outcome leads to defeat and even the ones who broke rank didn't get any better outcomes -- this is a mentality that everyone needs to internalize for revolution and must be insisted upon the same way a striking union needs to resist strikebreakers.  You can point out the suffering of the strikebreaker or that they really needed money or that I'm much better off than them so I don't know how they feel, and that's all well and good, and even the existence of strikebreakers often indicate a failure of the union itself, but the overarching point remains that breaking with the strike will lead to a worse outcome for everyone.  If I'm insisting on that *too rudely,* very well, I'll add it to a long list of character flaws to work on, but the point remains the same and is the thing to be taken from this -- I'm not important and if I disappeared tomorrow the entire communist movement wouldn't notice or care. \n\nYou also aren't going to find the international support you are looking for.  There is no more USSR.  China is revisionist and despises communist movements and the prospect of People's War and armed revolution.  We don't live in the 1950s where we can get guns and support from superpowers to shift the scales, we live in an era where socialism has been totally set back, nearly completely wiped off the board, and now needs to start from below zero and break out from the prisons once again -- it will come at great cost and the first movements through the glass have no choice but to go it alone and get bloody because there is no help on the way, least of all from privileged white people.  Places like DPRK have shown you actually can hold out alone against imperialism and even develop nuclear weapons to protect and sustain yourself, and CPI(Maoist) and the CPP-NPA continue to struggle against vastly more powerful enemies backed by imperialism, and they've done this absent any substantial international support for decades (not unlike the PKK, which makes the incorrect politics, the turn, the set back and starting over so upsetting, and maybe even where some of my rudeness comes from -- since very few of the PKK supporters have even come to terms with the fact that they did something incorrectly and needed to be struggled against harder).   The other aspect to this, is that asking for some guarantee for victory as a precondition for struggle has always been a hallmark of revisionism -- revolutionaries have nothing to lose but their chains.  They are not scared of defeat, and because of this they dare to struggle and dare to win.  If this is callous then I'm sorry, but it's also the mentality that generated the struggles which are still fighting and resisting imperialism.\n\nI'm not ignorant of the suffering of the Kurdish people or what they have been through and I'm not ordering them or anyone (and nor am I in some position to do so), but at the same time the Kurds are not the only people suffering or being oppressed and killed by imperialism and their suffering does not supersede the suffering of, say, the Assyrians since they are people who themselves suffered at the actions of the YPG undertaken under the imperialist shadow. My empathy is not reserved for one specific group, and in order to apply that empathy to the totality of humanity, then in needs to be a representation of proletarian interests, since those are 1:1 the interests of humanity, and thus applied in a way which confronts and is hostile to imperialism.  When the news first broke, your response in this thread was that it was all a lie or Turkish propaganda, but now it's confirmed and it's happening and you either now need to lie and believe in liberalism again (maybe Kemalism will work out this time), or recognize that this has been a real setback for the battle against imperialism and for Kurdish liberation, and that maybe there's space for some rudeness in confronting that fact and shifting the perspectives of people close to it, who may still wrongly be defending the people and the ideas which actually mislead the movement and brought it to this undesirable endpoint.",

Perhaps you are confusing me with the initial person you were arguing with? \n\nYou make the impression that an interconnected force called imperialism should be detached from international support, while this is in fact, and it\u2019s what you even acknowledge, but just on a regional level, precisely what is needed. I\u2019m not desperately hoping for the golden hand to safe us (meaning the struggling world), and id like to distance myself from the self centred accusation, but the isolation ultimately leads different struggles to much more likely become self centred. It\u2019s a natural transition that has to be prevented at all costs. The very moment the PKK showed first signs of revisionism, is the very moment the international and internal community has failed. The same applies to every initially well intentioned resistance movement. The lack of support encourages a shift towards compromise taking and hence demonstrates first signs of defeat. I\u2019m not claiming that this is a justified approach, but simply one that has shown to be the case multiple amount of times, causing repeated set backs that could\u2019ve been prevented, at least in terms of their severity. \n\nYou emphasise the fact that the reliance of significant mobilisation from non struggling individuals is doomed to failure, but I ask you how are regional struggles able to counter global forces today? Here I\u2019ve to tell you the unfortunate truth that many Marxists for some reason don\u2019t like to acknowledge, which is the fact that regional resistances in modern circumstances are doomed to failure. Alliances will always be able to crush a resistance which they are able to outnumber and outgun. The preconditions of the DPRK in no way can be compared to the circumstances the proletariat today has to face. The fact that the CPP-NPA is able to withstand an ongoing resistance against imperialism is indeed a sign of successful internal mobilisation and resistance (although, here also completely different preconditions that make revisionism less necessary), but again it just proves the point that they would be much better off if there was more significant support from the international community. If their movement at some point is being pushed to complete isolation, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain its integrity to a point of complete irrelevance and ineffectiveness.\n\nResistance has to come from every corner of the world simultaneously, including the privileged spectrum. If the latter cannot be mobilised by ideologizing them, it becomes increasingly difficult to topple imperialism. By that logic your approach is no different to mine, in that it relies on mobilisation.",

When you imagine this class will be won over (or let white settlers sell the lie that they actually are revolutionary) it leads to incorrect conclusions where you also don't have a plan to overcome them when they line up against the revolution.  The 'international community' that you want to depend on is only going to be composed of those few movements which can breakthrough on their own, get their heads above water, and then stabilize and sustain and reproduce themselves even under imperialist pressure and adversity.  If you want to say that can't be done, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and the only way to prove this defeatist notion wrong is to break through and win (which also ignores that it has happened before, and almost happened recently, several times in the age of hegemonic neoliberalism: Peru and Nepal).   And the CPP-NPA didn't escape revisionism because it was \"less necessary\" (revisionism just means being wrong; it's never necessary) -- the CPP-NPA had to conduct a serious, severe, and sometimes even violent Rectification Campaign to forcibly remove the revisionists from the ranks of the party and ensure the correctness of the party line.
