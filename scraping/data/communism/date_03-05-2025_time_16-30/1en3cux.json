    "selftext": "Text: The first man to attempt a synthesis between Socialism and Zionism was Nachman Syrkin (In 1904 found the 1st socialist group named \u2018Heirut\u2019 (not to be confused with \u2018Herut\u2019 \u2018freedom\u2019, which was the revisionist party founded by Menachem Begin in 1948, which in 1988 merged with the Likud), interestingly his ideas were independent of Moses Hess, and the approach unlike Borochov was non-marxian in nature. But nonetheless the May 1901 pamphlet of Syrkin titled \u2018an appeal to the Jewish youth\u2019 became the 1st official manifesto of Poale zion (different from the Minsk group also under the name of Poale zion, which denied the connection between Jews and the Socialist revolutionary movement.) (Duker, Abraham,\u2019theories of Ber Borochov\u2019,p.27, p.28. \u2018Ber Borochov (1916). \u2018On the Occasion of the tenth Anniversary of the Poale Zion in Russia\u2019, 1906 - 1916 ). For Syrkin, anti-semitism manifested itself within both classes of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, landowners ect\u2026, but it acutely expressed itself within the landless peasantry, therefore, the Socialist struggle for Syrkin entails essentially a dual negation for Jews (this concept of \u2018dual negation\u2019 is expressed in Borochovian strand), the first, primary negation is that of \u201cclass struggle\u201d or the abolition of class \u201c*aufhebung\u201d*, and the second is the negation that will provide a concrete solution to the Jewish national question, he later explains that after the Liberal bourgeoisie, who until now enforced this equality, began turning their backs on their principles, the Jews must first join the proletarian party, and carry on the class struggle. (Syrkin, Nachman (1898). \u2018Die Judenfrage und der socialistische Judenstaat\u2019, p.22, p.27, p.28 )\n\nQuestion: From the citation of Syrkin's work it is Clear that he agrees with the 'instrumentalist understanding of class struggle' ( focus on the word 'instrumentalist', not necessarily the same interpretation within Marxism (i.e those of Lenin and Marx) itself ), same like how Borochov views the class struggle... however Duker Abraham's work suggests that Syrkin is not a 'Marxist' and differs from Hess, while Borochov is ( but even Borochov disagrees with the claim that he is a 'Marxist' on the most principled sense, and even goes as far as to state that \u201cWith regard to this question ( on socialism ) I am an anarchist-socialist. I regard the politics of state and organized coercion as a means of protective private property which will perforce be abolished by a collective organization of labor. I am a Marxist without the\u00a0*Zukunftsstaat ( purely theoretical distinctions, which he considers unessesary to and*\u00a0second\u00a0*importance to praxis ).*\u00a0Be that as it may, I regard the differences between socialists and anarchists as\u00a0*Zukunfstsmusik (to be later discussed),*\u00a0as a question for the far off future, not a question that warrants the split in today\u2019s labor movement\u2026Equally unimportant for Poale Zionism are the philosophical differences between various revolutionaries.\" (Ber, Borochov (1915). \u2018Two currents of Poale tzion\u2019)... so how is Syrkin any less of a \"Marxist\" ( in the philosophical sense ) then Borochov?",

It's nearly incomprehensible.\n\n>how is Syrkin any less of a \"Marxist\" ( in the philosophical sense ) then Borochov?\n\nBecause he's wrong and Marxism is true. You are not a Marxist because you claim to be, it is not an identity. Like all revisionists, he hides a reactionary theory behind a feigned indifference to theory as such and a false distinction between \"philosophical differences\" and \"praxis.\" Such posturing is was not worth taking seriously then or now. The only value is seeing someone 100 years ago also use \"touching grass\" as an excuse for fascism, showing how unoriginal and uncreative revisionism actually is.",

Is it rooted in religion or is it secular? were somewhat interesting at the turn of the century. They were answered comprehensively by Marxists of that era (Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky) who, with some relevance, all had Jewish heritage. They were also answered by the vast majority of jews who rejected Zionism.\n\nBut they're really not interesting now. The existence of the Zionist Entity has decisively answered any questions about Zionism and show great foresight from the Marxists who rejected it on seemingly abstract, theoretical grounds.  Jews are not a nation, they have been assimilated, their oppression is historical and secular, and Bolshevism did wipe out anti-semitism in the former Russian Empire.\n\nIt's sort of like asking \"do you think the Linz program was correct for Austrian social democrats?\" Like, you know what happened next, right? Now, it is now interesting to ask whether Austrian social democracy necessarily led to fascism just like one can ask whether Bundism necessarily led to zionism, that's more abstract. But anyone who begins by identifying as a zionist (or anti-semite) is not worth anyone's time, it is a rotten foundation.",

Didn't this prevent full assimilation in bourgeois states (at that time)? \n\nI ask since a book I'm reading (Enzo Traverso's *The Jewish Question: History of a Marxist Debate*) argues that due to a 'positivistic' and 'teleological' conception of history, the 2nd International failed to see this process of racialization of the Jews because it considered Jewish oppression to be exclusively a remnant of pre-capitalism and therefore capitalism would make it disappear.\n\nBut of course this is something on which the Bolsheviks differed from the 2nd International, while they both advocated for assimilation only the Bolsheviks grasped that imperialism prevents the end of national (and racial) oppression in capitalist states in general and therefore the possibility of assimilation is always subordinate to the concrete needs of imperialism.",

Lenin has written so much on self-determination ( especially on the flawed bundist idea of \"cultural-national autonomy\" ) that the Zionist idea should appear to be absolutely contradictory to this principle of self determination... also with regards to assimilation, I have heard Zionists state that they needed a fast and concrete solution then socialism, that's why Borochov, even goes as far to say, that the idea of a social revolution, emacipating and assimilating jews was 1) A idealist sentiment, which could/could not work and 2) Jewish cultural identity will be eroded by assimilation, therefore it is better to form a Jewish state first, before the 2nd revolution against capital will begin in earnest, a pretty flawed idea, if you read what Lenin wrote.",
