    "selftext": "On one hand, I\u2019ve read **\u2018Socialism Betrayed\u2019** by **Roger Keeran and Thomas Kenny**, the masterwork in which they explain that the cause for the lethal reforms of the traitor were 3: economic problems (though they clarify there was no economic crisis at all), political problems (such as the ossification of the leadership of the party and state), and foreign pressure (the many many many policies Ronald Reagan undertook to cripple the Soviet economy, which honestly were quite successful in harming the USSR).\n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019ve just finished reading **\u2018A Normal Totalitarian Society\u2019** by **Vladimir Shlapentokh.** He\u2019s very clearly neither socialist nor pro USSR, he almost always refers to the USSR as \u2018the empire\u2019, but unlike the great majority of western authors, he is very objective, and his book is a gold mine to understand how many things actually worked and functioned in the USSR.\n\nUnlike Keenan, he rejects the idea that perestroika was initiated because of a faltering economy (and many many other theses he cites and debunks), but instead for the sole reason of keeping the military parity they had achieved with the US in the mid-70\u2019s and that was now being threatened by RR\u2019s SDI (the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 program):\n\n*\u2018If perestroika was* ***not*** *initiated owing to the lack of order, the faltering economy, the discontent masses, ethnic conflicts, separatist movements, conspiracies, or military defeats, what then led to the emergence of these reforms?*\n\n*The real cause of perestroika stemmed from the leadership\u2019s ambition* ***to preserve the military parity between the USSR and the West****, which had been attained in the mid-1970\u2019s. By the early 1980s it became evident that the growing technological gap placed this parity in serious jeopardy\u2026.*\n\n*By the early 1980s, the Soviet leaders were forced to make a very difficult decision. They must either relinquish the USSR\u2019s status as a superpower\u2026 or adopt the social and political measures necessary to accelerate technological progress* ***and prevent American military superiority.*** *Mikhail Gorbachev was chosen by the party leadership* ***to initiate the latter choice\u2026***\n\n*But Gorbachev and other ideologues of perestroika never publicly acknowledged that the SDI was the impetus behind Soviet reforms. \u2018The first impulse for the reforms\u2019, Gorbachev stated to Margaret Thatcher in 1990, \u2018was the lack of freedom\u2019. Countering the general secretary\u2019s rhetoric, Thatcher responded forthrightly,* ***\u2018There was one vital factor in the ending of the cold war: Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision to go ahead with the Strategic Defense Initiative\u2026***\n\n*Gorbachev was supported by the Politburo, the KGB, and most of the regional secretaries\u2026 and was given the mandate to modernize the Soviet economy and* ***maintain military parity with the west\u2026***\n\n*Had the Soviet leadership abandoned its goal of* ***military parity with the West*** *and focused only on protecting the status quo, the empire could have persisted for many years with is inefficient yet \u2018normally\u2019 functioning economy\u2019*\n\nAll authors agree (though in different degrees) that perestroika was not inevitable.\n\nWhich thesis do you think is the most accurate one?\n\nI know I deal with a what if, but do you think the USSR would still exist today, 2025, if perestroika had not been carried out?",

            "body": "Both are wrong.  You've created a false dichotomy because you haven't understood what you are asking, and instead of trying to understand the historical materialist basis that lead to Perestroika, you've instead consumed two wrong answers and are now trying to choose between which might be less wrong.  *Socialism Betrayed* is a revisionist work, written by social-fascists and apologists for \"actually existing socialism\" when that term was still being used to defend Brezhnev rather than Xi.  I'm less familiar with Shlapentokh, but the term Totalitarian is racist and fascist and basically all academia is well aware of this, and the title was a deliberate choice, so that should be your first warning.  The fact that his explanation differs not-at-all from the centre-\"left\" liberal common sense explanation means that it's basically vacuous assurance for liberals to confirm what they already \"know,\" with the heightened bonus that it's coming from an ex-Soviet cashing in on generic anti-communism at the end of the Cold War.   Whomever recommended you *Socialism Betrayed* probably also recommended Parenti (who was one of Gorbachev's last defenders, ironically) and is a revisionist with no real understanding of communism, while whomever recommended you Shlapentokh is probably just a fascist. \n\nShlapentokh is wrong above all, because external causes are never an explanation in and of themselves, and external pressure to socialist construction can only find success if there is an internal cause enabling it.  Socialists with correct politics are invincible and people and people alone are what is decisive in war. But revisionists are not socialists and the problem you have missed is that socialism was overthrown in the USSR in 1953-56 and it ceased to be a socialist project from that point onwards.  You are thirty years too late to try and save socialism and the revisionist rot had destroyed the essence long before Gorbachev even got his hands on power.  The revisionists are also wrong, as they try to pin the blame solely on Gorbachev (though he deserves no sympathy nor mercy, only pitchforks) but this is because their historical legacy of revisionist-apologia (as \"C\"PUSA shills), and had to explain their own ideological failure by blaming it on this one bad guy who ruined everything, rather than this one bad guy being a continuation of capitalist restoration dating back to Khrushchev, with Gorbachev merely revealing and exposing what actual communists had already known decades earlier -- that socialism in the USSR was long dead.  The question of whether revisionist-USSR could have persisted is a different matter, and with some reforms it probably could have but this is where it becomes layers of counterfactuals and we are simply playing alternate history games at that point. It's also worth noting that the people arguing against Perestroika were not socialists either (there were basically zero socialists left at all in the CPSU by the 1980s,it was revisionists all the way down), but rather this wing of revisionists recognized the rightward scramble of the most pro-capitalist revisionists toward full capitalist restoration, each leapfrogging the last one further right to more damaging and dangerous consequences for the Warsaw Pact, and these were basically the 'conservatives,' who wanted to preserve and sustain the existing revisionist system and their seats of power, and realized the rightward rush was rocking the boat and threatening to rip it asunder (and send many of them overboard) -- which proved to be a rare correct prognostication from the revisionists.  \n\nThe reason Perestroika occurred is because the revisionist, social-fascist USSR and its emergent capitalist class had been seriously fettered in their pursuit of profit by the weakened but still-persisting, lingering legacies of revolutionary socialism and the Stalin-era, and by the 1980s, the limits of what was possible from mere capitalist oriented reforms within a planned economy (such as the Kosygin Reforms, both waves, which had put the law of value back in command) had reached their upper limit, and were stagnating with their results by the end of the Brezhnev era (largely because they had applied the reforms to the largest and most prosperous industries first, making the reforms appear successful when they weren't, and then expanded outwards with diminishing returns as what remained of socialism became increasingly cannibalized by the revisionists in search of more profit).  The revisionists now needed a battering ram to smash down the last remaining barriers to capitalist accumulation such as central planning, nationalized industry, and restrictions barring private enterprise, and Perestroika became that weapon.",

            "body": "You can read \u201cStand for Socialism Against Modern Revisionism\u201d for a concise and sharp understanding of how the Soviet Union dissolved and became a bastion for capitalism. The decline started with Khrushchev reversing many socialist policies and paving the way for private property ownership. Brezhnev put a lot of money into foreign wars which caused less money to be spent on things that would actually help the people of the Soviet Union (like buying grain from local farmers instead of importing it from abroad). By the time Gorbachov came to power the CPSU was riddled with rich and corrupt bureaucrats who took kickbacks from trade deals with foreign capitalists. You\u2019re right that there was no \u201ceconomic crisis\u201d in the acute way that the Great Depression or the 2008 crash were, but there was a lot of stagnation and there was an immense amount of debt around the year 1980. In the eyes of the people, what Brezhnev was doing, in the name of communism and socialism, was making them suffer more and more. These are the conditions that Gorbachov came into during his reign. Really though read the book, it\u2019s really short and there\u2019s an audiobook too if you want to learn more (it\u2019s only 2 hours long)",
