You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I\u2019m quoting this bit because it deals with material incentives, which have been a recurring discussion point on this subreddit recently.\n\n> Let us take the thesis of the Program of the CPSU on the entry of our\nsociety into a period of extensive building of communism.\n\n> We [the cpsu] deny the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat in connection\nwith the transition to this period. Let it be. But nevertheless, we are\nbroadcasting everywhere that \u201cthe Party proceeds from the Leninist\nproposition that the construction of communism should be based on\nthe principle of material interest. Pay according to work will remain\nthe main source of satisfying the material and cultural needs of the\nworking people over the next twenty years\u201d (Program of the CPSU) .\nIs it possible to combine two, in my opinion, mutually exclusive\nprovisions of the Program of the CPSU - one about the uselessness of\nthe dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. a socialist state, and another\nabout the need to strengthen and expand in every possible way the\nsocialist principle of distribution according to work?\nV. I. Lenin saw in the consistent and daily implementation of this basic\nprinciple of socialism the most important condition for the \u201ccorrect\nfunctioning of the first phase of communist society\u201d (emphasized by\nme. - GM. T. 25, p. 444).\n\n\u2026.\n\n> The dictatorship of the working class is an organ created by the\nsocialist revolution not only to suppress the resistance of the\noverthrown exploiting classes, not only to destroy them, but mainly\nfor the speedy and unswerving implementation of the basic principle\nof socialism \u201cfrom each according to his ability, to each according to\nhis work\u201d, for the education masses in the spirit of a conscious attitude\nto work as the first and most necessary duty, in order to compel those\nwho are trying to evade the conscientious fulfillment of this sacred\nduty to society.\n\n\u2026\n\n>Rejecting the dictatorship of the working class on the grounds that,\nwith the liquidation of the exploiting classes, there are no more classes\nin our society in respect of which dictatorship is necessary, and, as\nalready mentioned, emphasizing its violent side, the theorists and\ndefenders of the Program of the CPSU for some reason forget about\ninevitable bourgeois character of the state of the transitional period\nfrom capitalism to communism, that **the basic principle of socialist\ndistribution \u201cto each according to his work\u201d necessarily needs to be\nput into practice in bourgeois law as a regulator of the distribution of\nproducts and the distribution of labor.**\n\n> V. I. Lenin in his work \u201cThe State and Revolution\u201d explains these\ncircumstances as follows:\n\u201c... In the first phase of communist society ... \u201cbourgeois law\u201d\nis not completely abolished\n\u2026\n\n> Further, Lenin writes:\n\u201cBourgeois law in relation to the distribution of consumer\nproducts inevitably presupposes, of course, the bourgeois\nstate, for law is nothing without an apparatus capable of\nforcing observance of the norms of law. **It follows that under\n(first phase of) communism not only does bourgeois law\nremain for a certain time, but even the bourgeois state\nwithout the bourgeoisie!\u201d**\n\n\u2026\n\n> What a striking difference is the position of V. I. Lenin, who in the first\nphase of communism inevitably **assumes a bourgeois state in the\nsense of coercion to comply with bourgeois norms of law, contained\nin the socialist principle of \u201cdistribution according to work\u201d**, from the\nposition of supporters of a \u201cnationwide\u201d state, who do not notice the\nforced dictatorial character proletarian state!\n\n\n\nPg. 193-195",
