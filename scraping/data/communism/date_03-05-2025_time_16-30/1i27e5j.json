You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I'm really glad you shared this. Besides it being great to see that an organization like this exists in Vietnam, the interview raised a number of interesting questions and their blog\n\n\nhttps://vidanphucvu.wordpress.com/\n\n\nhas some great resources.\n\n\nA few things that jumped out at me:\n\n\nI agree with their line on H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh, which differs from some of the anti-revisionist critiques I've come across that exaggerate his opportunism and, in the same vein as liberal apologists, paint him as a nationalist.\n\n\nhttps://vidanphucvu.wordpress.com/2024/05/19/ho-chi-minh-va-dia-vi-cua-nguoi-trong-lich-su/\n\n\nThey say that\n\n\n>There were no representatives of the left line, only opportunists.\n\n\nWhy was this the case?\n\n\n>Regarding the influence of Chairman Gonzalo and his ideology in Vietnam, initially, he was only mentioned through campaigns to try to degrade his reputation by the government in power.\n\n\nI am surprised to hear that the Vietnamese state has said anything about Gonzalo. I would be very interested to hear about that in more detail.\n\n\n>Those petite-bougeois groups uses memes to propagate and agitate, which is an action of bastardizing Marxism, for Marxism is a revolutionary science, and could not be expressed by memes.\n\n\nThis is an idea I've tried to express before:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1ezjdrn/comment/ljnc16s/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1cw1pgp/comment/l6cn5aa/\n\n\n>Inside the peasants and the proletariat, we are not really sure, but from what we see, but most of them do not support the state outright, being mostly neutral about the situation.\n\n\nWhy are they not really sure? Why be more familiar with the standpoints of the petty bourgeoisie than of the proletariat and peasantry?\n\n\n>That settler-colonialism was called \u201cNam Tien\u201d, March to the South, and happened for centuries.\n\n\nIt is interesting to see the Southward March considered through the lens of settler colonialism, although I tend to be skeptical of the tendency to project settler colonialism back into pre-capitalist modes of production. It's a question I should consider more carefully.\n\n\n> We recognize the national liberation of the Kampuchean people led by the Communist Party of Kampuchea against the military dictatorship and the American imperialists. We hold a neutral view of the policies implemented during their government, however, we understand that Pol Pot betrayed the Kampuchean Revolution by supporting the revisionist clique of Deng Xiaoping and the arrest of the so-called \u201cGang of Four.\u201d Pol Pot fell to revisionism in his final years. We also oppose the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea and the Chinese Invasion of Vietnam, it was just a repeat of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviets. It was a war that served nothing but the profits of two social-imperialist blocs.\n\n\nThis is the fairest assessment of Cambodian history that I've heard from any Vietnamese source.\n\n\n>Sau khi H\u1ed3 Ch\u1ee7 t\u1ecbch t\u1eeb tr\u1ea7n n\u0103m 1969, b\u00e8 l\u0169 L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n \u0111\u00e3 nhanh ch\u00f3ng l\u1ee3i d\u1ee5ng th\u1eddi c\u01a1 \u0111\u1ec3 ti\u1ebfm quy\u1ec1n l\u00e3nh \u0111\u1ea1o \u0110\u1ea3ng, th\u1ee7 ti\u00eau \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng l\u1ed1i c\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng, bi\u1ebfn \u0110\u1ea3ng C\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n Vi\u1ec7t Nam t\u1eeb m\u1ed9t ch\u00ednh \u0111\u1ea3ng c\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng tr\u1edf th\u00e0nh m\u1ed9t ch\u00ednh \u0111\u1ea3ng x\u00e9t l\u1ea1i, bi\u1ebfn ch\u1ea5t.\n\n\nThis would appear to be at odds with u/smokeuptheweed9's assessment of L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n:\n\n\n>Though I don't know that much about inter-party struggles, it is my impression that the clique around Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Linh were the Dengists of Vietnam and unsurprisingly were all from the South whereas L\u00ea Du\u1ea9n was from the North.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/18cf4xw/comment/kcf2o6y/\n\n\nAlso, this\n\n\n>Qu\u1ed1c gia X\u00e3 h\u1ed9i ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a hay Qu\u1ed1c gia-X\u00e3 h\u1ed9i ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a?\n\n\nhttps://vidanphucvu.wordpress.com/2024/06/20/quoc-gia-xa-hoi-chu-nghia-hay-quoc-gia-xa-hoi-chu-nghia/\n\n\nis a great pun.\n\nEdit:\n\nI also really appreciate this decision on their language policy.\n\nhttps://vidanphucvu.wordpress.com/2024/10/02/thong-bao-dac-biet-cua-ban-bien-tap-vi-dan-phuc-vu-ve-van-de-thay-doi-hinh-thuc-bai-viet/",
