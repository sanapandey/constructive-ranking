You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "I find myself conflicted on this article.\u00a0\n\n\nFirst, shitty Trot rhetoric about imagined \"neo Stalinists\" and promoting their shitty International aside (and also all other problems with the WSWS such as literally defending bourgeois rapists), I sympathize with the WSWS / SEP's efforts in this specific case, to attack the Ukrainian state which persecutes their comrade, and with their efforts to free him, because I sympathize with the anti war and anti imperialist position that they and this Bogdan person espouse, since in essence it denounces both NATO / Ukraine and Russia and calls for solidarity with the Ukrainian and Russian proletariat, which I think is a correct position. Especially the latter because both Ukraine and Russia _are_ majority proletarian countries, not labor aristocratic and petit bourgeois ones, like say Israel or France or Amerika.\n\n\nSecond, I do not sympathize at all with the revisionist and chauvinistic RCWP and CPRF (both of which this article stupidly calls \"neo Stalinist\") and their pro Kremlin, pro war positions. There is nothing redeemable in their positions and I am in agreement on this conclusion with the WSWS.\n\n\nFinally, what I'm mostly conflicted about is the Russian organizations being cautious about publishing statements of solidarity for Bogdan. I symapthize with the WSWS's argument that they should show internationalist solidarity but also sort of sympathize with the caution Maoist or other anti Kremlin groups, mainly on the basis of the argument that doing so as Russians will only add fire to the flame that is the pro Kremlin war propaganda machine (which does not only exist in Russia but which me and comrades here in Cyprus also face issues with, for example). But perhaps that is liberalism / revisionism on my (and their) part and honestly from one perspective it does seems silly to me, so I'm leaning towards that a statement of solidarity would be the correct thing, but perhaps only if accompanied with a clear polemic against the pro Kremlin position.\n\n\nAnd I guess I'm interested more broadly in where the dividing line is drawn between focusing on attacking your own country's bourgeoisie and attacking the other country's bourgeoisie, which your own country's bourgeoisie is also attacking. From the perspective of Russian communists criticizing the Kyiv regime while living in Russia, of us Cypriot communists criticizing the Moscow regime while living in a pro west EU member state, etc.\u00a0\u00a0",

                    "body": "The issue is that for Russian Communists, regardless of what nomenclature they use, the line is clear and has already been used before in the same place: revolutionary defeatism. Any attempt at hiding behind arguments of repression, threats to national existence or propaganda was present during WWI, and the Bolsheviks had to fight it nonetheless. Bogdan\u2019s trial ultimately will be determined by the strength of the fascists and of Communist support, not by the presence or lack of evidence linking him with Russia, which is already a concession to bourgeois law as if it were fair and impartial from the beginning. Furthermore, their argument also makes no sense in their own terms. A statement for solidarity will be distorted by fascists as proof of connection, but the same statement can also make this clear in its text beforehand in order to support Bogdan\u2019s defense and prevent/contradict the fascist distortion in a trial, thus allowing for better Communist mobilization. \n\nWhat this shows is that the difference between these parties isn't as big as it may seem. They all converge on social-chauvinism, which requires some sort of monopoly and finance capital basis for the alliance between the bourgeoisie and LA. The Trots trying to paint this as immanent of \"Stalinism\" or Maoism is bullshit, and signals where Trotskyism\u2019s false commitment to Leninism ends, but if everyone, from the revisionists of the CPRF to the Maoists of SMU, refuse to display proletarian internationalism and revolutionary defeatism, then there is a problem that needs to be further analyzed. As it stands, if the line is that Russia is not imperialist, usually hiding behind euphemisms of national oppression like semi-peripheral country or multipolarity, results in the war being justified and Communists should rally for it.\n\nThe Dengists all cling to the generic multipolarity crap, there aren't that many questions there to be solved; what I find weird is why Maoism leads to the same thing in their context, while supposedly coming from the left and from anti-revisionism. There\u2019s also a dangerous generalization made by WS which is dishonest: does the SMU and RMP\u2019s line represent all Maoists in Russia in this regard? Probably not. Still, they remind me of some Brazilian Maoists and their horrible, similar track record: UV (not a Maoist org proper, but claimed by some of today's Maoists and revived as UV-LJR by them) collapsed into the fascist Nova P\u00e1tria, who declared they would support an invasion of Uruguay if the country was the equivalent of Ukraine; URC, the local affiliate of ILPS, never even daring to consider agitation against Embraer military jets being used against the people\u2019s war in the Philippines; and AND, that tried to spin the Brazilian military occupation of Haiti as \"forced\" by US imperialism for years (their line on Ukraine is also the same as the SMU and the ICL, that this war somehow fights for Ukraine\u2019s national liberation, instead of furthering even more imperialist domination). Similarly, not a single one of them has so far attacked PT\u2019s reindustrialization policy that is pouring billions of dollars into military projects, ignoring the bizarre particularity that Brazil has the second, formerly the first, largest arms industry of the Third World, only behind Turkey.",

I also believe that the campaign in support of Bohdan is correct, and his position on the current events is truly internationalist.\n\nHowever, it's funny that 90% of the article is devoted to dissecting the Russian left's response to the proposal to join the campaign. There was one big communist organisation that did join the campaign for Bogdan: the IMT. But it is mentioned in one line.",
