    "selftext": "It seems to me like in Europe the classes who would be the target audience for communist ideas have disappeared, thus giving rise to the horrible working conditions we see in: Bangladeshi sweatshops, Qatar's migrant workers or cobalt miners in Congo.\n\nMy question is why under these conditions where people have the most to gain by unionizing and fostering communist political movements, haven't we've seen new communist movements showing up. The idea is already out there, so why hasn't it inspired reforms. \n\n  \nIs it because people in these countries don't have access to the information? even though it is easily reachable on the internet. Is because of bad education on communism or are their governments restricting access to resources?\n\nIt also most likely has to do with the US shutting down any genuine attempts at building communism. What do you think are the main reasons? or do I have it wrong in assuming the movement has to come from the workers in the global south? ",

TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics.

The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

Second, they do not take the form they do simply because of repression, it is because a people's war is a necessity that arises out of semicolonialism and semifeudalism. Third, armed insurgencies and political campaign goes hand in hand. Guerilla war in the countryside doesn't work without political education, and campaigning.",

The problem is that there was no genuine communist party with enough influence and manpower to push it farther than a social revolution. And thus it was redirected into a pro western liberal and reformist bloc. Also the tactic of popular frontism which is utilized by Stalinist parties is a revolutionary dead end as it forces the party to tail end liberal movements and take more moderate positions. After the collapse of the USSR many of these parties became openly reformist. It took an entire lifetime for Lenin and the Bolsheviks to overthrow the Tsar. Without communists who understand the need of mass organizing it will take a long time to gather the ones and twos. Not to mention the mountains of slander and revolutionary dead ends the imperialist camp/s push new communists into. I\u2019m incredibly hopeful for the future as the contradictions of capitalism have begun to intensify. It falls to the leadership of the movement to apply the knowledge of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Trotsky to the present conditions.",
