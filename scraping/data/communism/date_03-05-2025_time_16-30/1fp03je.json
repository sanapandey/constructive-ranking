I suggest you study Ethiopian socialism and the civil-war in Ethiopia if you are interested,",

I'd tend to give them some slack given the difficulty of building socialism in the context of such a brutal civil war, but I can't help but feel there must be some truth the criticism coming from Maoist/Hoxhaist groups of the era.\n\nThough even with the TPLF's ideological turn I find it hard to believe that had the Derg won it wouldn't just fold similar to other African socialist governments and become no different than Angola or Mozambique.",

The current coalition government in the Bundestag in Germany is dominated by the SPD as they have the most seats, thus the German chancellor is from the SPD and so are most ministers. Does that make Germany a one party state then?",
