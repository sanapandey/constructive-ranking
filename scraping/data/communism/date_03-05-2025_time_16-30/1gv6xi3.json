    "selftext": "Short and to the point: I'm getting old, and I want to get involved, but given the myriad of parties I see in making the rounds of social media and whatnot I'm at somewhat of a loss as to where to direct my energies. Short of analyzing the position papers of every Tom, Dick, and Harry Party and comparing and contrasting them all, how is a M-L (with a dash of -M) supposed to know what Party is compatible with my views, or if I'm just off on my own trip, or what? Should I throw in with the RCP, RCA, ACP, CPUSA, or any other 'letter party' and hope for the best or start from a blank canvas and form my own local outfit? \n\nFor reference, I suppose if I were to label myself I'd say \"Classic M-L with tankie characteristics\".

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "Seeking to not emptily shill an organization without practically demonstrating how it is a worthy organization, I suggest reading works on how the Communist Party is structured by Lenin and then coming to your own conclusion as to which organizations are actually carrying this out in the U.S. You said that you were Marxist-Leninist and somewhat Marxist-Leninist-Maoist aligned. That's an essential start, it means that you have an ideological basis to evaluate an organization. As Lenin covered in *What is to be Done,* ideological unity is primary over organizational unity.\n\nSome works I'd recommend to look into how a Communist Party truly operates and how Communists should handle the foundation of a Party is *Theses on Fundamental Tasks of The Second Congress Of The Communist International*, *Foundations of Leninism* (Particularly Chapter 8)*, Where to Begin, What is to be Done, The Proletarian Class and The Proletarian Party, History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)* (Chapters 1+2). I'm of the opinion that there is no Communist Party in the U.S., and that it must be reconstituted. Indicative of this opinion is that is I'm not aware of any Communist Party that both acts as an advanced detachment of the Proletariat and carries out both legal and illegal work, which are both fundamental to how a Communist Party functions as outlined by Lenin.",

Would the Communist Party of China organise like the PCUSA? Would the Communist Party of the Philippines or Communist Party of India (Maoist) act like these \"parties\". What would they do?

If so, I can certainly see the merit in this and admit the thought has crossed my mind as well; having less of a profile would make certain actions more likely to succeed as opposed to a highly visible movement that all but invites infiltration. \n\nBeing in my early 60's I regret not taking action earlier; as I responded to another about my posts on serving in the military, I did have a life prior to becoming a would-be Red Threat. My thoughts are clear now, though, and I will do what I may to help the Cause- when I can discern where the Cause may best be served.",

The Chinese Communist Party under Mao, for example, had very close ties to the Australian Communist Party, a classic parliamentary labor-aristocratic party; though that (and in general alliances with first-world revisionism) was a tactical era of Mao's, that didn't detract from the great achievements and antirevisionism of Mao's CCP. And the CPP had close ties to the obviously revisionist RCP-USA; there have been no perfect revolutionary communist parties with zero links to first-world revisionist parties, so why do you think that the CPP's links to WWP means it's \"acting like\" revisionist parties? And how does the CPI(Mao) come into play? Unless maybe I'm misunderstanding you, and your assertion that the CPP and CPI(Mao) \"act like\" the PSL is a criticism of their actual practices rather than just due to their fraternal relations. \n\nIf you have any sources regarding what you see to be the deviations of the CPP and the CPI(M) stemming from them acting too much like the parties you're criticizing (in particular, any sources regarding how they have suffered from infilitration, open organization, and a lack of clandestinity), I'd be interested in seeing them.\n\nFurthermore, I think that associating relations between the NDF and the WWP with necessary relations between the CPP and the WWP misunderstands how the NDF functions abroad. But maybe I'm the one who's too optimistic or too uninformed about the NDF's functions.",
