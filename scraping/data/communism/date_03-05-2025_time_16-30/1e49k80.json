    "selftext": "I consider myself a Marxist, although as a woman of color, much of my study also comes from de colonial third world/Black feminist thought. Lately I have been analyzing my relationship to capitalism in regard to relationships. I was dating someone new for a few months who was not doing well economically and it created a lot of strain on our relationship and some of the basic things I currently partake in (obviously everything costs money). I didn\u2019t mind it as much until emotionally, he was not putting in as much \u2018work.\u2019 It made the relationship almost feel exploitative, because I had to pay for a lot more things (I am actually in school) but I knew he actually needed the help. How do your principles show up in your dating life?",

You do have to also make sure you are taking care of yourself. \n\nIn general I'd say, it wouldn't be very marxist of you to just entirely avoid people who aren't well off. But you do also have to be realistic about what you can handle. The stress of someone in a very poor financial situation might not be something you can handle when your financial situtation isn't that great either. But also there are people who are poor but won't necessarily put the expectation on you to help them financially.",

It made sense in the 70s/80s where 1) radical feminists and communists were feuding over BDSM and homosexuality and 2) radical feminists were able to pass legal reforms. Neither of these are really true anymore. Despite the talk of how Americans' leisure-time activities are irrelevant, even MIM expects some sort of conduct from its members, eg not lying to obtain sex. \n\nYou should still read what MIM has to say about the topic for history's sake, [but this newer piece by Freya B is also worth reading as well.](https://web.archive.org/web/20150707020254/http://anti-imperialism.com/2015/07/06/lets-talk-about-consent/) I think if people are serious about the \"All Sex is Rape\" polemic then they should read MacKinnon, who was quite influential on MIM and Freya B. MacKinnon is insistent that her theory is incompatible with Marxism and I think there should be more rigor in trying to synthesize them. Can MacKinnon give us the tools to address gender inequality or should Marxists find their own way? I have my own thoughts but I still have more to study and dumping them in some poor lady's thread about her shitty boyfriend is probably the worst place to put it.",

The link I posted also does explicitly talk about how romantic and sexual relationships become money relationships (a thing Engels talks about extensively in his work as well, AFAIK -- haven't read it yet) which I thought was directly relevant to OP's experience. That being said I didn't know about this historical context at all (as I said, I found the work interesting with respect to today and the thoughts and experiences of myself and people around me). But perhaps it's not as useful or profound as I thought it was. Could you elaborate on the context under which this MIM line was formulated? You said it had to do with feuding between communists and radical feminists about homosexuality and BDSM but I don't know much about this beyond that the u.$.

The historical context is:\n\n* Homophobia from US communists and feminists. MIM Theory 2/3 has polemics against this, and MIM uses the unequal nature of heterosexual sex as a defense for queer relationships\n\n* Feminist politicization of relationships and sexuality, which BDSM was a part of. This is more important\n\nFeminist reformism was significant in the 70s-80s. Roe vs Wade, the attempts at banning porn, divorce laws were amended to benefit women more, the age of consent was raised, stricter laws were enacted against domestic violence, and IPV shelters were increasing in number and funding. MIM saw women using the existence of misogynist violence as a justification for reformism, and formulated a line in response to this. This reformism was also often tinged with settlerism, since these laws coincided with the expansion of prisons and strengthened cultural notions of black men being rapists. Outside the realm of reformism, you had feminists retreating into lifestylism, like Jill Johnston who thought all heterosexual sex was exploitative and thus we needed a \"Lesbian Nation\". \n\nNow, the internet has made the idea of getting rid of porn through legal decree a complete joke, and allows for women to be sexually terrorized (and prostituted) in new ways. Roe vs Wade has been repealed, IPV shelters are facing a funding crisis, marriages have perpetually declined for decades, and the kind of lesbian separatism MIM criticized is basically non-existent. First-world women aren't revolutionary proletarians, but I think the US is losing its ability to accommodate \"psuedo-feminism\", I think the bigger threat for feminists is either being used by NGOs and/or revisionist parties or surrendering to nihilism.\n\n>  Can you also clarify what you mean about the right-wing appropriating the politization of women and queer people to smear queer people? \n\nTERFs come to mind but this is admittedly more of a thing outside of the USA.

Obviously their line against lifestyle politics is important, and in a time when supposed communists were putting questions about - as you said - homosexuality and BDSM over questions about labor aristocracy, China's imperialist status, etc; I see why it might have been useful. It also serves as a repudiation of the idea which was prevalent even in the USSR and China that there is \"bad\" (extramarital, homosexual, etc) sex and \"good\" sex, and sharply highlights the way that no relationships are free of a power dynamic. Additionally, I see why MIM(Prisons) has continued to uphold this idea; any organization that attempts to organize among prisoners will be forced to confront what to do with perpetrators of sexual violence.\n\nAnd yet in every socialist experiment, as well as in the current peoples' war being waged by the CPP and in that in Peru during the '80s and '90s (I won't pretend to know if the same is true about India; I simply haven't read enough about it), rapists and abusers have been persecuted with deserved harshness. And, whentheseagullscry, as you point out, the first-world communist movement is rife with abuse, and with \"chewing up and spitting out\" women, especially by way of sexual violence (either actual coerced/forced sex, or sexually violating acts of transmisogyny). Perhaps \"All Sex Is Rape\" was an adequate line on sexual violence for a very small, decentralized, anonymous organization that dealt heavily in sharp and cutting theory and polemics to take; for the above reasons, I do not find it conducive to actual organizing.\n\nFurthermore, even users on this sub who claim to subscribe strongly to MIM gender theory still do *frequently* distinguish between \"sex\" and \"rape\"; for example, I doubt any frequent poster here would deny the statements \"the PSL covers up rape scandals\" or \"Caleb Maupin is a rapist in addition to being a first-world chauvinist\", whereas \"Chairman Mao was a brilliant leader, but he raped Jiang Qing\" would no doubt be seen as a comment made for no purpose than trolling. \n\nIn my opinion, \"all sex is rape\" and \"first-world women are male\" are polemic statements that attempt to pack the same punch as \"there is no first-world proletariat\", but ultimately just aren't backed up by either a similar level of facts, nor serve the same purpose in orienting oneself towards issues of gender in first-world organizing. Like many others on here, I think that a deeper analysis of gender in the first world, without falling into either the crude and transmisogynistic essentialism of radical feminism nor the liberal status quo of \"a woman is anyone who says she's a woman\" \"consent is sexy\" phrasemongering, is due.\n\n(For the record - not that this gives my input any more importance - but I was formerly, in the last year or two, quite a frequent poster to this subreddit; in fact, whentheseagullscry, I was the one that you messaged that one thing about the rhizzone. I deleted my account because it had led to some bad habits and I didn't feel discussion on here was productive anymore. I will likely delete it again for similar reasons, but I felt like giving my two cents here, and I hope that this leads to an interesting discussion of some sort.)",

But yeah, it is somewhat out of touch with how third-world maoists handle it. I understand that you can't rigidly copy tactics, but MIM argues that the division between labor aristocracy and gender aristocracy can be utilized for progressive purposes, which seems like it'd open the door for, to use MIM's terminology, organizing women to go fight back against the more heightened forms of rape?\n\n> In my opinion, \"all sex is rape\" and \"first-world women are male\" are polemic statements that attempt to pack the same punch as \"there is no first-world proletariat\", but ultimately just aren't backed up by either a similar level of facts, nor serve the same purpose in orienting oneself towards issues of gender in first-world organizing.\n\nI don't think \"first-world women are male\" is much of a polemic, MIM really does consider first-world women to be oppressors in the strand of gender, which may as well be described as \"male\". MIM derives their stance on gender from a synthesis between Marxism and MacKinnon, which is supposedly necessary because of her criticisms of Engels' work on gender. In MIM's review of MacKinnon's *Towards a Feminist Theory of the State*:\n\n>  [Marx & Engels] saw women\u2019s role in the reproduction of labor-power, in agriculture, and in housework, as naturally derivative from biological givens, as opposed to\nlabor-roles historically enforced on women through social control and sexual terrorization. Marx and Engels tended to one sidely see Patriarchal relations asprimarily feudal, guided by the transference of private property through male lineage, and as remediable by bringing women into the public work-force.\n\nThis is so wrong it seems like the reviewer never read *The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*, only MacKinnon's critique of it. Engels says patriarchy is pre-feudal, emerging alongside class society itself as its byproduct. He's quite clear about how women's roles are enforced through control and terrorization:\n\n> Such a form of family shows the transition of the pairing family to monogamy. In order to make certain of the wife\u2019s fidelity and therefore of the paternity of the children, she is delivered over unconditionally into the power of the husband; if he kills her, he is only exercising his rights. \n\nTo be clear, most first-world women are labor aristocrats, lumpen, or petty-boug. What I'm taking issue with is MIM defining gender in terms of leisure-time and biological health which leads to all these seemingly bizarre polemics and lines.",

                                    "body": "> Addressing the failures of affirmative consent involves moving away from the framing of individual sexual ethics to communal sexual politics, from the private regime of a contract to the creation of a robust public sexual culture. Imagining a world after consent does not only involve thinking through the individual activities and protocols of people that engage in sex, but rather the collective infrastructure through which we live our lives. It necessitates rethinking the basic provisioning of care in our society and the agency to move out of coercive situations. Moving towards a world after consent requires addressing the very architecture of the places we live and where we have sex by both providing access to communal spaces for public sex and acknowledging how the simultaneous consigning sex to private space, buttressing of the family, and rise of individual bedrooms within single family homes have all had a hand in the ubiquity of sexual harm. A world after consent necessitates structuring the way we live otherwise.\n\nThe concept of \"communal sexual politics\" reminds me of how the Maoist revolutions use people's courts to decide if a rapist is guilty, with the victim's testimony being given extra weight. It seems to be working for them but for obvious reasons, this doesn't really give any short-term advice for the first-world. \n\nIt's easy for me to criticize MIM but it's also true that something new has to come from the criticism, and with that I only have some preliminary, very shaky thoughts\n\n1) I've seen women/queer people suggest creating orgs that would not allow cis men to join in order to greatly reduce the risk of sexual violence and overall male chauvinism. How many of these orgs that exist and are communist, I don't know. I'm aware of [Half the Sky](https://www.instagram.com/halftheskynational/), which goes further and forbids white people as a whole from joining. But what role cishet men are supposed to play in the revolution is left unclear. \n\n2) It seems that most cases of sexual violence from communist men is against other party members. I think orgs should have strict prohibitions against romance between party members; this is something that can wreck even orgs that exclude cis men. The first-world communist movement hasn't reached the point where it can produce the \"revolutionary marriages\" of Nepalese maoism.",

Are they simply asserting that relationships will inherently be unequal under capitalism and criticizing the hypocrisy of \"bourgeois law\"/\"bourgeois consent\" regarding rape?\n\nwouldn't saying \"all sex is rape\" and \"consent is impossible until we reach communism\" potentially downplay the seriousness of rape?",
