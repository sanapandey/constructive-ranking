    "selftext": "I'm looking for books talking about the theory and practice of proletarian rule, specially relatively modern ones studying the real praxis of proletarian dictatorship from the Paris Commune to modern Nepal. I don't mind non-ML authors (trots, french maoists, even anarchists), just insightful stuff. I've already read a lot of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao, Hoxha, Yao Wenyuan, Zhang Chunquiao, Kim Jong-Il, Guevara and Deng Xiaoping, so other authors are very encouraged.\n\nI think that one major theoretical task (perhaps the most important one) of communists today is to synthesize and propose a credible program to implement the proletarian dictatorship, since historical experience appears to show that the Party-state model defended by orthodox Marxism-Leninism (and I say this as a honest ML) creates a contradiction within the dictatorship between the Party and the whole class, replicating in a way capitalist relations of production (intellectual work vs manual work, \"managerial\" thinking in the leadership vs parochial apoliticism in the greater mass of the class). \n\nWhile on the other hand, the different experiments with \"Commune-type\" dictatorship or democratic socialism have been unable to defend themselves or provide a political center to guide the revolutionary project without devolving into bourgeois democracy.",
