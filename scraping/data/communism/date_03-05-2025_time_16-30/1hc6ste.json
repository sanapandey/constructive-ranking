    "selftext": "In 2019, the RAND Corporation published a report titled \"Extending Russia: Competing from Advantageous Ground\" (link: [https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research\\_reports/RR3000/RR3063/RAND\\_RR3063.pdf](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR3000/RR3063/RAND_RR3063.pdf) ).\n\n\n\nThis report explicitly outlines several strategies that later unfolded in the following years, such as US support for Ukraine (chapter 4, measure 1), efforts toward regime change in Belarus (chapter 4, measure 3), and even support for Syrian rebels (chapter 4, measure 2).\n\n\n\nIt doesn't have to be from the same think tank, but does anyone know of a similar report that focuses specifically on Syria? Or perhaps one that addresses the balkanization of the Middle East as a strategy to secure Western access to oil and gas? If anyone has any links or something, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n\n\nIt's striking how much strategic knowledge is published openly, often revealing intentions that many remain unaware of. The West certainly has its own way of showing its influence and they dgaf who knows it. I wonder if Russia's think tanks publish their stuff so openly...\n\n\n\nThanks in advance for any help!!",

I realize they are open knowledge, which is why I agree with you that RAND didn\u2019t predict anything, but they are just unafraid to openly discuss the strategies the US and its allies employ around the world.\n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m smarter or better than anyone, I\u2019m sorry if I came across that way. I\u2019m just talking about them openly publishing things that change geopolitical situations around like it\u2019s a board game and the people from these countries (which includes leftists political movements and such) are completely ignored and squashed, even if the information about these situations are open knowledge, which means these movements have access to, say, \u201cenemy\u2019s words\u201d and could theoretically do something about it, except they don\u2019t have the means.\n\nThink tanks and how they work are just fascinating to me and I really wanted to know if there\u2019s another report specifically on Syria, given everything that\u2019s happening.",
