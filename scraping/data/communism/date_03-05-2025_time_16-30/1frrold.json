In a statement, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps said it had initiated attacks on Zionist military targets as well as intelligence headquarters in northern Tel Aviv. Iran also warned that if Israel responds, it will face more violent attacks. \u201cIn response to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah, and Commander Nilforoshan, we attacked the heart of the occupied territories,\u201d said the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in its statement.\n\n>According to Al Mayadeen, at least 400 missiles were fired. Sirens continue to sound throughout the occupied Palestinian territories as the Iranian response begins. At least two people were killed as a result of the Iranian attack.\n\n>Earlier, a shooting attack was reported in Tel Aviv. The operation is described as a \"martyrdom operation\" in which two armed Palestinians opened fire on several targets in Tel Aviv, leaving at least 10 dead and dozens injured.\n\n>Imperialist President Joseph Biden declared that the United States is prepared to help Israel defend itself against Iranian missile attacks and to protect American troops in the region.\n\n[URGENTE: Ir\u00e3 lan\u00e7a mais de 400 m\u00edsseis contra Israel](https://anovademocracia.com.br/ira-lanca-mais-de-400-misseis-contra-israel/)\n\nSo, this is clearly escalating.

They caution against \"Western activists opposing what the plurality of Palestinians want\". Posting this as kind of a tangential to the larger discussion that we were having regarding vulgar third-worldism being more or less moribund; I'm reminded of a time where smokeuptheweed9 said something about \"Sanders third-world-ism with Chinese characteristics\". Essentially that is what this boils down to, with a heaping serving of \"listen to the true oppressed people!!!\".",

If the revolutionary forces accumulate the power to make that a real possibility, then it is appropriate to ask the question, \"integration or liberation?\" Then there should be a plebiscite or series of plebiscites to decide the question. Asking the question before the oppressed nationality has the power to control territory only proves what the people will say when the imperialists are twisting their arms behind their backs. The people must have a genuine choice, not a choice dictated by the imperialists. \n\nit should stand to reason that Palestinians can only truly decide if they want israelis occupying part of their land when they have the power to make liberating all of Palestine a real possibility. I can get behind the sentiment of \"don't tell oppressed nation people how to struggle\" to a certain extent (an example being that a lot of critics of the Axis of Resistance just end up playing backseat general or spreading israeli propaganda and those types got a big dose of embarrassment today) but to then back a two-state solution also seems to me like telling them what to do but with the veneer of majority opinion.\n\nwhile I disagree with the article, I think calling it essentially Dengist is unfair though.",

Unless you don\u2019t think it can but then why call yourself a communist at all?\n\nTo your point, I think labeling this a general Dengism is a mistake.

Because we must resist general fascism, it is imperative we vote for Kamala Harris or organize mutual aid bullshit or whatever. \n\nKeep in mind this isn\u2019t a condemnation of New Afrikan self-determination and the role communists must play in advancing it (nor would I argue communists have no place in Uyghur, Kurdish, or Ukrainian self-determination, provided we discard comprador skewing first and foremost).

Were there other specific quotations you had in mind?\n\nI think of it like this.  Internal and external are a matter of perspective, depending on which system you are looking at.\n\nhttps://vinaire.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gravity-inertia.png\n\nIf we are looking at the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon, then the essence of that attraction is illustrated by the yellow arrow, but it takes the appearance of the Moon\u2019s orbit because it is conditioned by the the inertia of the Moon, which is external to the gravitational attraction.\n\nConversely, if we are looking at the inertia of the Moon, its essence is illustrated by the dotted arrow, but it takes the appearance of the Moon\u2019s orbit because it is conditioned by the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon.\n\nThe orbit is itself a system jointly determined by the two forces, which are both causes and represent the contradiction that determines the Moon\u2019s orbit.  But this is a relatively abstract presentation of the Moon\u2019s orbit.  The Moon\u2019s orbit is also conditioned by other factors external to the system described so far.  We can enrich this abstraction by taking into account factors like the Earth\u2019s tides.  By doing so, we bring another internal contradiction into view, which is causing the Moon to gradually get further away from the Earth.\n\nAny concrete analysis of the Moon\u2019s orbit needs to consider the tides, which are determined by the Moon\u2019s orbit and also react back upon it, fundamentally affecting the nature of the Moon\u2019s orbit.  But there are other factors external to all of this which might be taken into account as well, such as the fact that the Sun will eventually explode and destroy the Earth and the Moon.  The contradiction within the Sun that will cause this is external to the Moon\u2019s orbit, but without considering it we won\u2019t arrive at a correct answer to the question of what will happen to the Moon\u2019s orbit in the long term.  It can\u2019t really be considered fundamental to the Moon\u2019s orbit *as such* though.  Instead, we can expand our perspective to consider the solar system as a whole, in which case the fate of the Sun is quite fundamental.  And so on.  My typing these words also conditions the Moon\u2019s orbit, but in a negligible way.  It can only be considered external to the Moon\u2019s orbit.\n\nConscious is determined by social being *in the last analysis*.  There is an interplay of determinations along the way, so consciousness can be immediately determined by other factors (ideological factors have a causal role of their own) but mediately determined by social being.\n\nSo the difference between determination and conditioning is a matter of perspective and scope.",

Any analysis that ignores these connections of their work is abstract (much more abstract than thinking about the Moon\u2019s orbit without taking the tides into account). Now, no factor is ever *inherently* internal or external because internal and external are relative terms. But if your goal is to understand a scientist\u2019s production of knowledge, you need to make class internal in your analysis because it is fundamental. Lenin said you need to make your analysis as concrete as possible by comprehending as many relevant connections as possible.\n\n\nSimilarly, you need to treat imperialism as internal to an analysis of the struggle of the Palestinian people for national liberation because it is fundamental to what Zionism is in the first place. This is different from the example Mao gives of the Japanese invasion of China, which was external to the struggle between the Communist and Nationalist Parties, a disturbing influence with no essential connection to the conflict between them. It\u2019s like the Sun exploding: yes, you need to include it in your analysis but it isn\u2019t internal to the Moon\u2019s orbit, it figures when you expand the scope of your perspective to look at the solar system as a whole. Your example of geography also falls into that category.\n\n\nBy the way, are you a botanist? (I guess that\u2019s Timiriazev in your profile image.)

Though I mainly did that as there is the aspect of Bourgeois ideology that needs to be considered with it's mechanical/metaphysical and Idealist ideas and practices as scientists are educated with these ideas and practices which influences how they think about their experiments. They then go on to seek the causes of things Such as autism or Trans People within the Brain or in \"Genes\" or look for particles of 'Dark Matter'(i have suspicions of DM particle theories that are predominantly produced in imperialist countries but i do need to do more investigation into it), and project Bourgeois Society into Nature Such as Darwin did with his \"Struggle for existence.\" Of course Bourgeois ideology should not be looked at in a the Abstract but also should be tied into the class character of Scientists and their predominant Petite Bourgeois / Labor Aristocratic Class Character.",

The conversation is in English on the post, and most of indian subreddits, clearly Indicating the petty-bourgeois/bourgeois nature of such posters. Reddit is a fascist website, what else are we to expect? \n\n>Also, this guy wondering why a post celebrating the murder of over a dozen \"combatants\" in a Hindutva subreddit is shocked that there's a Hindu flag in the post lol.\n\nThe petty-bourgeois/bourgeois classes have both Hindutva as well as \"liberal\" people.

And of course, there is also the never-ending tirade of \"growth and development.\" \n\n>petty-bourgeois Indians (like me) practically live in a different culture because of the internet. Communication itself is based on petty-bourgeois memes usually from America.\n\nWow, i never thought of it this way. We do not have segregated data based on class character of internet users but we have some data that can hint towards the class character of the same. The rural-urban divide is huge and this has very real implications for the peasantry and the working classes.\n\nhttps://indianexpress.com/article/india/nfhs-data-shows-urban-rural-gender-gaps-in-internet-use-7103710/\n\nFor the petty-bourgeois, internet, as you pointed out, is largely just memes influenced by imperialist culture (i mean to say that the petty-bourgeois classes do not have to struggle with the internet as a medium in their day-to-day life), while for the peasantry and the working class, it is directly linked to their livelihood because of the so called digitization process that the compradors are taking out.\n\nhttps://rupe-india.org/aspects/aspects-no-81-82/",
