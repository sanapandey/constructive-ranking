The parties they in are alliance with to form a \"National Unity\" government are further to the right than PSUV and the presidential candidate they support has openly liberal proposals such as \"restoring the autonomy of the Central Bank\", \"coordinate with international organizations to solve the humanitarian crisis\", \"establishing a Permanent Tripartite Commission on which, in terms of equality, the State, workers and businessman will build the stage to march towards the national reconstruction.\" There is no mention whatsoever of the imperialist siege being imposed upon the country on the programmatic proposal and the whole thing just reads as completely bankrupt parliamentary cretinism (https://prensapcv.wordpress.com/2024/07/22/descarga-ya-esta-disponible-tribuna-popular-n-3-052/)\n\nI understand that their electoral registry has been taken over but surely supporting a reactionary candidate and forming an electoral alliance with barely social democratic parties was not the best way to handle this situation. It would probably have been preferable to denounce the persecution and agitate the masses against the elections as a sham.\n\nNow they are the denouncing the purported electoral fraud (it's probably true but what difference would it even make) while supporting a reactionary candidate that used to belong to fascist comprador Manuel Rosales's party. This just seems to confirm PSUV's accusations of them, even if they are untrue. All in all it seems the Venezuelan people have no political organization whatsoever to guide them amidst all this tragedy, just dreadful really.",

I simply don't understand why they would enter an alliance with such reactionary elements unless the party is rotten with revisionism. If they couldn't field a candidate because their electoral registry was taken over and there was no other minimally progressive option then they should just boycott the elections and perhaps use the opportunity to agitate for mass protests against the persecution and Maduro's neoliberal policies. In no way does supporting a comprador candidate furthers socialist revolution. Maduro didn't force them to enter this reactionary alliance, they went down this path themselves.\n\nNow that Maduro has been declared the winner we will see if they stick with this alliance as it descends into full support for imperialist intervention through OEA or any other avenue as everything indicates they will do.",

The same way socialism\u00a0in Cuba and the DPRK has mitigated the effects of the American blockades.

In reality, we defend the real gains of Korean and Cuban socialism and our criticism of them is fundamentally different.\n\n>The western world will make your life hell if you make any earnest attempt to nationalize industry in Latin America\n\nThe instructive example of Venezuela shows this will happen regardless if you possess national wealth that is potentially a threat to American hegemony. Economic planning is the only solution. \n\n>Gaza could have also potentially lifted its siege if they had done what the Israelis have been asking for years which is to \u201cdrop their weapons and we\u2019ll have peace,\u201d and Hamas is also not \u201cattempting socialism.\u201d \n\nThe reason Hamas is compelled to resist Israeli fascism despite its reactionary origins is because Israeli settler-colonialism exists to expel Palestinians from their land and exclude their labor from productive activity. That is, Gaza is blocked from \"having peace,\" Israel's very existence necessitates genocide. Analysis of political economy is necessary to understand politics, not merely reacting to whatever struggle presents itself as having a progressive and regressive option. The example of Syria is more relevant but this is an old discussion and one that has shown its bankruptcy. The options are not \"liberalism\" or \"socialism,\" Syria is a liberal capitalist state, like Iraq, which US imperialism found an opportunity to plunder.\n\n>It would be more apt to say that the extent in which these countries are \u201cattempting socialism\u201d is a sliding scale which is secondary to their primary antagonism against the rigid conformity of neoliberal/imperialist hegemony.\n\nThis is a totally empty theory of socialism for example. There is no \"sliding scale,\" socialism means something. You are defining socialism as basically \"national bourgeoisie,\" the definition it gained during decolonization in third world anti-communist regimes. That period is long over, and while I'm aware you are trying to revive it in relation to Chinese capitalism, that's a doomed effort since it was fundamentally flawed in the first place. Political opportunism towards states that are entirely indifferent to you has only caused you to abandon Marxism entirely.",

The same is true of Nasserism, Ujamaa, Pancasila, Titoism and whatever other \"non-aligned\" socialism you can think of. It was all nonsense. You don't live in 1965, you don't have to make excuses for opportunism because the world is moving towards revolution. It isn't and it wasn't. It was wrong then but perhaps excusable since decolonization did feel like something new and exciting. Now it's just sad. \n\nOne indication that the Bolivarian revolution failed is that we've been reduced to defending it using these outdated ideas. No one is trying to build their own Bolivarian communes or protesting globalization (ironically this same left is the last defender of globalization because it benefits the Chinese bourgeoisie, so much for the Battle of Seattle). There was a blip in time when the pink tide was supposed to be some indigenous logic which broke with the whole history of the Enlightenment. That was very silly and I'm glad it's forgotten. But as you point out, Venezuela is just Iran or Syria or Belarus. It's lost anything progressive beyond pure negativity.\n\nE: I don't mean to have this conversation in multiple places. But basically you're right, this subreddit was anti-imperalist when it was in the crib. We even innovated many of the pro-China arguments that I now find repulsive, and though I never liked them I was at least open to their internal logic as worth discussing. So I'm talking to my past self in some ways, I do sympathize (at least based on the logic you've presented which is different than a positive embrace of Putin's anti-Leninism and Deng's anti-Maoism) and understand your wariness to discuss larger issues when a coup is immanent. Unfortunately no one was having that discussion until now which is part of the contradiction.",

Obviously outside of this context, with Israel's current genocide on Gaza this is not the case.\n\n>Palestinians are not an infallible deity incapable of their own political missteps. They\u2019ve made MANY.\n\nI never said they weren't incapable of mistakes, I said Syria holds much of the blame for the disorder of the Palestinian liberation movement and thus declaring Syria the \"lifeline of the resistance\" is something that has little historical basis.\n\n>Their fight is righteous\u00a0*in their own land.*\u00a0But the PLO often behaved terribly in Lebanon and Jordan which warranted a variety of reactions from other political factions.\n\nThe most I can blame the PLO for in Jordan is miscalculating their chances of victory due to a lack of organization amongst the native Jordanian population. Their fight against reactionary Arab regimes like the Hashemites in Jordan was no less just because it was not \"in their own land\".\n\n  \nThe case in Lebanon is even more clear given the fact that compared to Jordan they did have the support of large sections of the Lebanese masses and their respective organizations, and before the Syrian intervention in May 1976 it is no exaggeration to say the LNM/PLO was on the verge of victory over the Maronite government:\n\n>By the middle of March 1976, the LNM controlled 82% of Lebanon.\\[125\\] All of Syria\u2019s proxies had withdrawn from the fighting, some even indirectly aiding the Maronites, and still the LNM was pushing forward. On 9 April, a Syrian ground invasion halted the LNM offensive. After a month of Syrian-imposed ceasefire, as-Sa\u2019iqa and the Syrian army launched an assault on PLO and LNM strongholds in Tripoli, Saida, Tyre, and Beirut. The absurdity of being ordered to attack the same Lebanese who had defended the PLO\u2019s right to operate in Lebanon was not lost on those Palestinians who had come to rely on Syrian patronage. The PFLP, DFLP, ALF, and Fatah aligned themselves unequivocally with the LNM. The PFLP-GC split into a pro-Syrian and an anti-Syrian faction. Most of the Palestinian membership of as-Sa\u2019iqa deserted and the Hittin brigade of the PLA revolted against its Syrian commander.

What I was referring to started in the 1970s after many Palestinian groups whom relied more heavily on Syrian patronage fully relocated there due to black september. \n\n>the PFLP leadership saw maintaining a border with Israel as the only means of staying relevant. But the Syrian Ba\u2019ath r\u00e9gime, at best a duplicitous and unreliable ally to the Popular Front, immediately barred attacks against Israel from Syrian territory and, after several years, banned the PFLP journal, al-Hadaf \\[144\\]. The PFLP was muzzled and contained and kept as a trophy to boost the Ba\u2019ath\u2019s liberationist credentials without threatening to drag Syria into a war with Israel. (Page 56)\n\nThe \"neutering\" so to speak is given example in the above two quotes wherein purely Syrian-based factions such as PFLP-GC and as-Saiqa are reserved to slaughter other Palestinians on the behalf of Assad, and where even those such as the PFLP (which maintained presence outside of Syria and therefore political independence) were barred entirely from militant activities and still restricted in their political ones.",

Care to elaborate on why these factions of Palestinians don\u2019t align and are at odds with each other? The PLFP-GC fought on the side of Assad as a way to ward off the sects of Palestinians who had turned against the government and were now supporting Al-Nusra\u2014this included Hamas for a time. Meanwhile these same groups committed over 2000 suicide bombings in 4 years which killed droves of Syrian civilians and were live-streaming their beheadings of minorities on a daily basis. \u201cChristians to Beruit, Alawites to the grave\u201d as they marched municipal workers off the tops of buildings and kidnapped the children of minorities for ransom and blackmail. \n\nAnd on your history lesson about the Lebanese Civil War, it\u2019s largely irrelevant to the current historical juncture. It was Hezbollah who fought for Syria to stay during the Cedar Revolution in 2005. It was Hamas and the remainder of the current Palestinian front who made peace with Bashar in 2021. Hamas and Hezbollah would be completely decimated if it wasn\u2019t for the networks that function through Syria. Syria regularly harbors Hamas and Hezbollah commanders while all of their neighbors have capitulated and are now act as an air defense system for Israel. If Syria would have been toppled, there\u2019s no telling how dire the state of the resistance would be today or how much of Lebanon would be under the thumb of ISIS.\n\nIf we go back to all of the demented, inadvertent, and temporary alliances that occurred during the Lebanese Civil War, you would wind up supporting no one\u2014including the PLO. At times, all of the factions of Lebanon have been allies or enemies, including the Maronites, Shia resistance groups, and the PLO. Stating the reality that Syria supported the Maronites for a time 50 years ago to ignore the realities on the ground right now is not a very strong defense. It\u2019s akin to dismissing Marxism-Leninism because Stalin supported the creation of Israel.",
