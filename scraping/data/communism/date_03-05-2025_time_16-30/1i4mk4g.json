            "body": "Sad thing is I know exactly what text you are referring to. Jones' explanation is idealist, in the sense of consciousness determines matter, while its usually the other way around. As Marx says in German Ideology and Engels in his writings about the German peasant revolutions, religion is an ideal self-representation, but if the questions posed by religion were simply solvable in the abstract realm of ideas, they would never actually translate into the real world.  There is a real content behind ideas that must be taken away from ideological mystification and presented as what they truly are.\n\nAs such, Mao already has answered your question on why we respect martyrs: to die for the people is to be weightier than Mount Tai. Guevara is obviously an icon, but every revolution had its own martyrs, and they are usually the bravest, most selfless revolutionaries of their time, dedicating their lives to the proletariat and peasantry up to their utmost consequences. Why Guevara in particular became completely detached from Communism to liberalism is to the class that is mainly behind this idea, the white petty bourgeoisie, as well as Guevara's own revisionism through focoism (focoism is actually a longer path to capitulating to social-democracy, as was the case of Debray himself), hence why this class seems in abstract martyrdom, i.e. death for death's sake, a revolutionary act, while its the opposite: its a profoundly liberal idea far closer to fascism, that sees death as the final solution to contradictions.\n\nMao refers to these things as the purely military viewpoint, and that it stems from low political and theoretical development. This may sound redundant when talking about the petty bourgeoisie, but deep down this liberal view of martyrdom holds deep contempt towards the masses. Contempt because it doesn\u2019t want to learn from the masses, nor does it want to lead them and help them realize they are the makers of history. As Lenin said in LWC, it is a form of fear from the working class. It is idealist because it treats revolution as made by great men, as reminiscent of Hegel\u2019s view of Bonaparte being the world-soul, and predominantly as a military endeavor. \n\nJones is supporting this view because, in the end, he is comprador to the white petty bourgeoisie, as well as to monopoly capital: a petty commodity producer of knowledge not only in videos, but also as writer for magazines and publishing houses of the petty bourgeoisie, like Jacobin, Opera, Boitempo and Autonomia Liter\u00e1ria.",

It is necessary to recognize that he may have made some theoretical errors in the past, but in general his books contain complete and relevant analyses. Dismissing him as a petit-bourgeois piece due to one or another error is ridiculous, considering that he produced several analyzes of great theoretical relevance and is a great exponent of communist ideology here in Brazil. Please reconsider your analysis of Comrade Jones, or if possible, convince me that I am wrong. By the way, what's the problem with Boitempo? They have good and cheap books, all of Lenin's works are in their store",

Attachment to Guevara figure in petty bourgoisie is just petty bourgoisie youth radicalism manifested through a superficial reading of Guevara's biography considering his list of revolutionary resistance against U$ imperialism across Latin Amerika, but class interests have to turn him into a figure like Christopher McCandless. While Castro remained in Cuba as the leader of cuban people and a main figure in U$ resistance in the 20th and early 21st century, Guevara as a experienced guerrilla combatant remained active in various revolutionary fronts in different sites until his assassination by the CIA.\n\nSo the only explanation is this attachment of the figure of Che Guevara as some bullshit of 'free spirit' and 'nomadic' that can match the existance of youth amerikans and other young privileged kids from the imperial core that travel around the world and keep a fetishist cynical approach to a historical figure like Che Guevara but he is not the only person that can become a symbol of this 'nomadic free soul' liberal crap that goes around this specific demography.",

The CIA also attempted to murder Castro numerous times and you can find both their biography in wikipedia but whether they were sucessful in the murdering of Guevara, the same can't be said for Castro.\n\nWhat you are missing out is that this attachment to Guevara as any other kind of white savior is a petty bourgoise fantasy which is what I'm talking about. He is not the only figure to be reduced to this liberal view, obviously, but Guevara's own life and commitment to the overthrow of capitalist society which led him to be eventually murdered by the CIA is the same reason why the CIA kept trying to assassinate Castro.\n\nBut of course, Guevara as one of the most important figures in the 20th century and being a historical figure of gigantic legacy for the proletariat, is a subject of historical fetishism like any other. His biography has been written and sold by many people in literature, movies, internet videos and etc. In the movie *The Motorcycle Diaries* there's the standard liberal fetishism which I'm referring, you can see yourself the movie critique available in wikipedia:\n\n\"The film shows what we were, which was two young men \u2013 boys, really \u2013 who went looking for adventure and found the truth and tragedy of our homeland.\"\n\nI think this elucidate quite clearly why a figure like Guevara, once he is detached completely from his actual involvement with guerrilla and the fact that he was a man in arms against the U$A until he was murdered, appeals to young liberals and this might not particularly be to amerikans or necessarily in the imperial core. I have experienced the same fetishism with Guevara in Brazil (the actual director of *The Motorcycle Diares* is actually one of the richest brazilians alive).",

Such vulgar stereotypes are attractive precisely because of their immaturity, defined technically as the stage of knowledge which has not yet reached inter-subjective communication and the difficulty of other people as rational beings that are outside your subjective consciousness. Though it is equally important to stress that even and especially subjective consciousness is a stranger to itself, reducing your own life and ideas to cultural stereotypes is a sign of your own self-alienation. You were not motivated to live your life and make this thread by \"Christianity in culture\" and neither is anyone else, do you really think so little of yourself and others?\n\n>>I wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree with everything he says, but I think he stirs great conversation.\n\nYou seem to be aware of everything I'm saying. That is something you probably should be sorry about. Why is your goal stirring great conversation? We are not here to entertain you, my time is valuable. We are interested in truth and the Cuban revolution is important enough to interrogate. If you don't \"necessarily agree with everything he says\" than he is wrong and you should not listen to him. Learning can be fun but only if knowledge is itself fun for you. It cannot be packaged in the form of pop culture, that only degrades it to the shockingly low standards for education you've come to expect.",

(that's why they hate him so much) We appreciate them for their efforts, but western media and some so called \"communists\" themselves throw mud at them for some of their actions, without considering the conditions they were in. Everyone is, for sure, criticizable, but most of the \"bad\" things they did are simply lies and made up things that never actually happened. Those two were great revolutionaries, heroes of their nations and inspirators for future saviors of other nations. \n\nErnesto Che Guevara, on the other hand, never really stayed at one place. He was an international revolutionary and therefore, he fought for the cause in many different countries. He was a symbol of resistance and fight for freedom, not only socialism. \n\nYour friend, bombarded by western propaganda, sees Castro as a bad man, because that is what was taught her. She saw only the things that US media wants her to think of Castro. \"He is a bad stinky dictator who killed billions of rich people in Cuba!\" On the other hand, Che is not a figure only used by communists, he is an international figure of salvation from slavery. I mean, I saw one of his quotes on my local Islamist Kebap man's place's wall, lmao.\n\nI hope that makes sense.",

Idk how to describe it but this is what I mean:\n\nModern day people have a great aversion to violence and fervour. To many, politics is supposed to be a clean process whereby people talk to one another, debate, campaign. Then a vote happens and stuff happens. \n\nIn that sense, violence for change is unjustifiable under any circumstance. In the liberal/moderate world view, it's considered pointless and contradictory to the ideals of democracy and progress.\n\nIn some ways, its also perceived as \"extrajudicial murder\", which can only make sense from the standpoint of \"the law is good and we ought to work within it for change even if it is difficult\".\n\nI think Che and Castro's legacies are coloured by this worldview. Their violent actions are magnified while the context surrounding them were determined as inconsequential. That said, you don't see people say the same for people like John Brown who engaged in very similar violence as Che, but he doesn't get as much criticism nor hate for them.",

The comment in question was regarding how during British colonialism, they wanted to destroy the Indian handicraft economy and force them to buy British handicrafts. I'm confused because I associate the export of surplus commodities as being a feature of imperialism, not colonization. is this just an example of the lines being a bit blurred of the transition between colonization and imperialism? also, wasnt export of british goods to be bought in the colonies a general feature of mercantilism? im a bit confused about this. thank you for your time!",

Is this just an example of a phenomenon that is not imperialism?",
