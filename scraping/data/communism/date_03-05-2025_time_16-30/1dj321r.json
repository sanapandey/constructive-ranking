    "selftext": "Since MIM prisons [will no longer be active on reddit beginning in May](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/news/all/US/4865), \nI\u2019m posting their recent polemic because I found it relevant to the political line of the sub\n\nhttps://www.prisoncensorship.info/article/a-polemic-against-settler-maoism/\n\nFor documents by the MCU, see http://www.bannedthought.net/USA/MCU/index.htm. In particular, they had a talk amongst themselves on their activities during George Floyd protests that might be of interest, seen [here](http://www.bannedthought.net/USA/MCU/RedPages/issue_three/george-floyd-protests/).\n\nHere\u2019s my summary of the main points. The polemic calls out the \u201cMaoist\u201d groups for being crypto-Trotskyists, fetishizing industrial US workers while not engaging with the question of the labor aristocracy and manifestations of settler-colonialism under the national question; the RMS has a faulty understanding of the Israeli \u201cworking class,\u201d a problem to be extended to the US \u201cworking class\u201d. Another critique is directed at the MCU\u2019s attempt at applying tactics from 1900s Russia to United States today, failing to differentiate the conditions of the modern (settler) working class against the former.\n\nThe polemic itself aside, it\u2019s disappointing that these organizations (MCU, RMS)do not make concrete analysis of modern phenomenas in the US\u2014unique to US, or at least to settler-colonial entities\u2014which could be attributable to their methods of abstraction, ultimately reflected their mechanical recycling of tactics from Lenin\u2019s time. Are there currently any organization (or just small active groups) that even takes the labor aristocracy and settler-colonial analysis seriously in charting out their practice? Maybe MIM is not all correct and the tactics are still relevant but with the above \u201cMaoist\u201d groups, its deficient because there\u2019s no coherent theory nor analysis of classes to accompany them.\n\nE: the last sentence is poorly worded, as corrected by a comment.",

            "body": "Hoping to spark some discussion on this point in [this MCU doc](https://maoistcommunistunion.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/mcu_and_the_working_class_movement-2.pdf) regarding logistics/transport as a supposedly key sector:\n\n>That said, it is undoubtedly true that the industrial proletariat remains as important as ever (and, despite their somewhat smaller numbers, certainly more important than the service workers) in terms of their strategic position in the economy.23 In commercial and financial cities with less industrial production, the transportation and logistics industry seems particularly key. These are often the largest basic industries in non-industrial cities, have the highest number of proletarians concentrated in one workplace, and form an essential aspect of the cities' economies.24\n\nMCU's theoretical justifications for this are pretty vacuous and seems to just be tailing the existing organizing efforts around this sector, however I have been seeing this as an emerging phenomenon across different tendencies all tailing the wake of last year's independent unionization efforts among Amazon workers.\n\nGetting a sober understanding of transportation and logistics is necessary, but the approach MCU and all other revisionists have, is to treat this sector in an isolated manner. RMC published this\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18x31u2/red\\_star\\_communist\\_organization\\_economism\\_class/](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/18x31u2/red_star_communist_organization_economism_class/)\n\nlast year and had the same problem (among many others) of narrowly organizing around the labor aristocratic interests of the strand of imperial core workers they were in contact with. The resulting failures from this all stem from a fundamental incongruency with reality, but I'd like to know if there's been attempts by Communists to approach unionization in the core with a focus toward uniting with workers further down the value chain. I'd imagine an attempt at consciously subjugating first world unionization efforts in service to third world ones, with likely few (if any) benefits to the former, would end in some sort of failure but I'm certain it would produce new insights into the practical applications of these concepts, and be more productive than unimaginative salting or placing vague importance on \"key\" sectors. If nothing like that exists (which I'm not confident that it does) any suggestion of similar events from history would be helpful, my current knowledge is limited and I'm not sure where to start looking.\n\nAs for what we'll likely be seeing more of in the future from Communists in the u.$. (not sure of other core countries) is this:\n\n>What is more, a crop of vaguely Marxist and revolutionary-minded youth, largely from a college-educated and petty-bourgeois background, is pouring into working-class jobs and unions for the sake of \u201cuniting socialism with the working-class movement.\u201d This is incredibly important and promising, for amongst these youth we can develop a significant number of bearers of revolutionary theory to the advanced workers if we can successfully win them over ideologically and organize them to be effective in their work in the unions.\n\nI have doubts that college grads are going into these jobs *solely* for the sake of \"uniting socialism with the working-class movement,\" and rather I'm more interested in whether this is a discernable phenomenon and if so, what is driving it.",

                    "body": "To add a perspective from the non-core countries.\n\nHere in the Philippines there have been and continue to be protests and strikes organized around the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program which has lead to large scale transport strikes (recently in 2023-2024, and historically starting 2017-2019). \n\nThe reason for this is due to how the modernization program would lead to the phase out of \"old\" forms of public transport colloquially known as jeepneys that trace back to surplus U$ military hardware that was then reconfigured for transportation purposes and now is a common cultural and accessible means of public transport. \n\nThe manner of the phase out would essentially straddle many drivers with large debts (~1 million Philippine Pesos), as the cost of the \"modern\" vehicle would essentially be shouldered by them. \n\nIn terms of organization this has lead to the formation of various anti-PUVMP groups/unions (PISTON, Manibela, etc). \n\nWhat is interesting is that from what I hear of western transport groups they seem to come exclusively from imperial/settler/petite-bourgeoisie slant, such as the yellow vests in France.\n\nHere the organizations have largely aligned with national democratic groups, and find particular activity in student and mass organizations. This is most seen in public or state universities which have served as platforms and centres of organization for protests, and have also seen increased repression, police, and military presence. \n\nI suppose an important point of investigation for why this difference occurs asides from the difference in the global south is that the protests here are not isolated to just demands related to jeepneys, the protests have allowed for further questions to be raised upon each succeeding administration, and allows for criticisms of foreign multinationals (Japanese, U$, Chinese,... auto manufactures), who stand to benefit from new vehicle purchases.\n\nNot only that but the proposed solution to manage the costs involve franchise consolidation, which would essentially further privatize the Jeepney and undermine the public service of PUVs.\n\nLink: \nhttps://cids.up.edu.ph/download/putting-transport-workers-commuters-first-route-transition-public-transport-modernization/\n\nI do agree with what you have to say though regarding the transportation sector in the core countries, why I think any future communist efforts there would need to link such events to broader struggles and not centre on only transient \"greater piece of the pie\" demands.\n\nThough I also wonder, how much of the transportation sector is made up of non-white or migrant populations.\n\nThough perhaps this is irrelevant if they are also aspiring settlers it might be useful to know the demographic makeup.\n\nRegarding college grads, I do not know of the core countries, but here it really depends. Since there are of course large amounts of careerists or aspiring settlers who want college education to escape the Philippines. At the same time the universities have also served historical function as centres of organization for mass orgs and bridge an important gap between the rural and urban movement.",

I have a basic understanding of the role of Jeepneys and the current struggles against the phaseout though not an immediate understanding of what the developments are right this moment. More to the specifics, I've haven't seen much analysis of the greater forces behind the franchise consolidation, specifically on its relation to the international trend in governments (both First and Third world) funding or investing in \"clean energy.\" The Jeepney Phaseout is situated in this with their replacement partially by [EV-buses from China](https://philippinerevolution.nu/angbayan/iloilo-government-to-build-brt-system-that-will-kill-traditional-jeepneys/):\n\n>Currently, First Balfour operates several e-buses that shuttle passengers within the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminals 3 and 4. The company imports its e-buses entirely from BYD (Build Your Dreams), a Chinese company.\n\nOf additional note is this:\n\n>In June 2023, the Metro Iloilo-Guimaras Economic Development Council, the National Economic Development Authority, and the Department of Transportation signed an agreement that Swedish companies will conduct a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d for the BRT system not only in the city, but also in Cabatuan, Leganes, Oton, San Miguel, Santa Barbara, and Zarraga. The study was funded by a $1 billion grant from Swedfund, the Swedish government\u2019s financial institution.\n\nThis seems to outline my understanding of what Sam King is presenting in his thesis with a consistent pattern of R&D stemming from the First World leading to production at the top of the Third World with China (I'm still very unsure in my understanding though). In this instance it seems the Philippines is pulled into the middle of this process as what seems like a low-cost (jeepney drivers are forced to take much of the burden on this implementation themselves) *testing grounds* for later, mass public electric vehicle implementation in the First World. I could be wrong on this as there are some cities in the imperial core that have implemented electric-motor buses, but they don't seem to have this level of extensive (and reckless) implementation as seen right now in the Philippines.\n\nThere is also immediate implications for ride-share workers in the core both due to the similar feature of being contracted (though obviously through significantly different means) and the contradictions that arise from further public transport consolidation (which again will have different features). If you have any other insights I'd like to hear them, there wasn't much of an opportunity when I was in ABUSA to discuss the greater implications of the phaseout, and much of the material that was presented by national to the local chapters didn't illicit much deep introspection on the matter.",

                                    "body": "No worries on the late response.\n\nI was able to do some research and talk around to gain more perspective on your question on franchise consolidation.\n\nThe state of affairs prior to consolidation essentially had jeepney drivers \"owning\" their franchise, as in they own the jeepney that they drove in. \n\nConsolidation of the franchise would effectively turn them into a corporation or cooperative where the jeepney driver no longer owns the jeepney the drive in. This is proposed by the government as the solution towards the massive amount of debt a driver would have to go into in order to modernize their jeepney.\n\nThe problem comes with how even if franchises form they would still be saddled in debt and would require essentially loans, or outside investment.\n\nIt would also mean that jeepney drivers don't have security in their work, as the jeepney would no longer be owned and maintained by them and would be property of the company or cooperative.\n\nI will quote some sections from the paper I linked up in this thread which has a better summary of this.\n\n>\"According to the OFG of the PUVMP,\nfor jeepney drivers and operators to be\nregistered with the LTFRB and eventually\nacquire the aforementioned loan programs,\nthey must first surrender their individual\nfranchise or provisional authority and\nconsolidate them into a single franchise\nby registering with the Cooperative\nDevelopment Authority (CDA), and getting\naccreditation from the Office of Cooperatives\n(OTC). The cooperative or corporations\nunder the PUVMP are required to have a\nminimum number of 15 modern jeepneys\noperating on a particular route. Only then\ncan they be qualified or awarded a franchise\nby the LTFRB to access the loans.\"\n\n\n/\n>\"Cooperatives also incur additional\nexpenses through franchise consolidation\nfees required by the OTC. These fees amount\nto PhP 300,000 for their consolidation,\nplus an additional charge of PhP 20,000 per\nmodern jeepney unit (Mateo-Babiano 2020;\nBendana 2023).\nThe forced surrendering of individual\nfranchises and mandatory franchise\nconsolidation is widely viewed by jeepney\ndrivers and operators as a massive\nconfiscation of their individual franchises.\nThese, in particular, pose a grave threat\nto the survival of jeepney drivers and\noperators. For them, their individual\nfranchises are their \u201clifeline\u201d (Mendoza\n2021, 38) that allow them to continue their\nlivelihood as transport workers, and earn\nand sustain themselves and their families.\"\n\n\nAlso on your point about \"clean energy\", the funny thing is that there would really be no effect from an environmental point of view, as any illusion of these being \"electric, or e-jeeps\" fell out with the absolute lack of any electrical charging access in the Philippines. Moreover there might even be a net-negative impact on the environment due to the production of new vehicles which would require all sorts of mined resources, along with the inclusion of electronics and air conditioning which would all increase energy use.\n\nI find your second paragraph interesting, though I don't think electric vehicles have found themselves successfully deployed here in any meaningful way. There are other things though that seem to have much larger penetration, such as the gig-economy. Ride-sharing has become much more prominent here with companies like grab (equivalent of uber in the west) and Ankas (a motorcycle ride sharing company). There is also large penetration of e-commerce, lazada and shopee in particular. Lastly there is the recent phenomenon of e-wallets such as G-Cash, which has rapidly increased it's presence in the cities.\n\n\nLastly, a lot of my insights were gained form interactions with mass organizations, which have engaged with and are supportive of the jeepney drivers. It is sad though that there hasn't been deeper introspection by ABUSA, though I wonder if it is an affect of them being away from here and thus not really having the same intimate grasp of the situation as people from here do, as to my knowledge the actual AB has been quite involved along with the other mass orgs on this issue. \n\nI hope to update as the situation develops as well, perhaps in a biweekly thread next time.",
