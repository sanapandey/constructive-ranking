Marx had to deal with people who would be called \"ultra-left\" today, that's the background of his famous quote about not being a Marxist. \n\n>After the programme was agreed, however, a clash arose between Marx and his French supporters arose over the purpose of the minimum section. Whereas Marx saw this as a practical means of agitation around demands that were achievable within the framework of capitalism, Guesde took a very different view: \u201cDiscounting the possibility of obtaining these reforms from the bourgeoisie, Guesde regarded them not as a practical programme of struggle, but simply ... as bait with which to lure the workers from Radicalism.\u201d The rejection of these reforms would, Guesde believed, \u201cfree the proletariat of its last reformist illusions and convince it of the impossibility of avoiding a workers \u201989.\u201d [4] Accusing Guesde and Lafargue of \u201crevolutionary phrase-mongering\u201d and of denying the value of reformist struggles, Marx made his famous remark that, if their politics represented Marxism, \u201cce qu'il y a de certain c'est que moi, je ne suis pas Marxiste\u201d (\u201cwhat is certain is that I myself am not a Marxist\u201d). [5]\n\nBut I think the substance of the debate is less important than the general principle of Marxism as a political movement of and for the masses, something Marx insisted on his whole life. The only people who still care about the minimum-maximum program as a concept are \"Kautskyists\" in the DSA, who are as ridiculous as they sound.",

                            "body": ">so Guesde and Lafargue thought Marx's political and economic sections were too conservative? \n\nNo, they agreed on the sections. They disagreed on the function of the sections. \n\n>that the system had to be completely overhauled instead of applying new laws to reform it?\n\nNo they both agreed that the system had to be completely overhauled. The difference was the function of reform proposals towards that goal. I'll try to summarize but I'm confused what is unclear in the quote I posted. \n\nGuesde and Lafargue believed that reforms would inevitably be rejected and therefore fighting for them was pointless once they served the function of being rejected. That is, they were primarily propagandistic. Marx believed that the struggle for reforms would itself develop revolutionary consciousness and that, in achieving reforms (which Marx believed to be possible to some degree), communists would emerge stronger as would the working movement. \n\nThe former were \"ultra-leftist\" because they confused their own consciousness of the objective limits of capitalism to be the consciousness of the proletariat, or at least the path between them was a simple matter of propaganda. Marx understood that for the proletariat to accept communist ideas as their own, they would have to fight to exhaustion first and communists would have to be there at  every step. \n\nAs I said, the debate has become largely irrelevant because in the age of imperialism, it is much more difficult to propose reforms which advance the cause of the global proletarian movement and will have broad domestic support. Further, now that communist parties exist and socialism was actualized, communists campaign on communist revolution. Compare the program with the program of the KKE, one of the oldest and most stable communist parties\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/05/parti-ouvrier.htm\n\nhttps://inter.kke.gr/en/articles/Programme-of-the-KKE/\n\nThe KKE's program is an explanation of what socialism is, what a communist party does, and its own history. Trotskyists are known for \"transitional demands\" which are somewhere between Marx and the PO: they are demands specifically chosen to be impossible to fulfill under capitalism but communists still fight for them so that the concrete struggle shows the limits of reformism. The point is that there is really no one left who cares about the \"minimum program\" except the farce of \"Kautskyists\" in the DSA. Social democrats exist, you don't need to concern yourself with Marx if you want to fight for reforms.",

I've been looking at the programme of EDON recently which is entirely reformist if not reactionary at points and it had me thinking about minimum and maximum programmes because I thought EDON's programmes bar the reactionary parts could perhaps serve as a decent minimum programme if actually accompanied by and tied to a revolutionary maximum programme. I'll admit I'm not very familiar with the history of the concept itself. I'm trying to wrap my head around why the world being in the age of imperialism makes this concept moot and I'm not sure I'm getting it. I can understand why it may be moot when it comes to first world nations but what about migrant workers and third world nations? Also, if we accept the KKE's programme as revolutionary, what about the fact the party still in fact struggles for reforms? Of course, I'm trying to approach the topic from the perspective of general revolutionary strategy.\u00a0",

Even Guesde and Lafargue were willing to do that to some extent, hence why they ultimately agreed to the program and all these forces fused together in the social democratic movement with Engels' blessing. It's that party programs are no longer about this. Trying to find \"transitional demands\" is a fool's errand though I sympathize with the desire behind it. Workers are not passive, they will fight for what they can achieve. The center can't hold and you end up with a program of minimum-maximum anyway (just like the French Worker's Party program, half of Trotsky's proposals did get implemented without a revolution and the other half were ignored and forgotten). The reason people don't talk about the minimum-maximum program is not that it is not relevant - the basic issues are unchanged as you point out - but that \"workers' parties\" no longer exist and you have to be in denial to still think the vocabulary of the pre-Bolshevik Revolution still applied afterwards. The \"communists\" and \"Marxists\" in the DSA are just playing pretend. You know very little about the concept (as do I - I was drawn into discussing it by trying to take the OP's half-assed thread seriously) because we already discuss reformism without reference to Kautsky's ideas, as if he was some genius rather than the first of many technocrats of the labor aristocracy.\n\nThere are three possible solutions I see: fight for reforms now while pointing out that communism is the only solution. You then wait for the objective situation to change, making yesterday's reforms now revolutionary (legal rights in a time of war, the cost of living in a time of crisis, etc). This is what the KKE does to not much success and easily becomes reformism, though at least the KKE lays out what the conditions are that it expects will lead to a revolutionary situation. Alternatively, look for situations where reforms are immediately revolutionary. Some examples are legal rights in a colonial situation, land reform in a semi-feudal situation, democratic rights under absolutism or fascism. These are the examples of past revolutionary success in the 20th century and we'll have to find our own. But it is true they are signs of capitalist underdevelopment, it's not a simple matter to find an equivalent in Greece (though not impossible imo, \"underdevelopment\" is both an absolute and relative quality). Finally, reject the terms. It may be, as the KAK argued, that the entire history of the \"workers' movement\" has been rendered superfluous by imperialism, making all reforms just a form of social fascism. One does not have to go that far, as you point out imperialism is both uneven and combined, though there is a tendency to find \"pure\" proletarian subjects without taking into account the reality of neo-colonialism which integrates comprador forces into bourgeois democracy and the spoils of imperialism to a much greater extent than its predecessor. Regardless, given the overwhelming failure of the communist movement in the 21st century to achieve a real revolution (not that anyone has anything else even worth considering), it's worth thinking about Marxism-Leninism not from the perspective of its organizational history but its anti-imperialism and commitment to principles (again, as the KAK did). It may be that Marx and Engels underestimated the dangers of reformism and ideas like \"revolutionary phrase mongering\" must be treated very carefully and at a distance.",

Point me to the relevant text please if they discuss it somewhere specific.\u00a0I'm not familiar with KAK writings.\n\n\nI'm also wondering why your seeming recent focus on the KAK / Torkil Lauesen. Is there something particularly useful or interesting about them? I understood them as just one more manifestation of the urban guerilla groups influenced by MZT throughout the 60s-90s in Europe which, although attractive for its radicalism if not somewhat interesting, ultimately failed to achieve anything substantive. Is it because Torkil Lauesen continued writing after his time with the KAK and the Blekinge Street Gang was over and to this day? Was he the only one like that?\u00a0\n\n\nFinally, why the recent use of the Trotskyist term \"combined and uneven development\"?",
