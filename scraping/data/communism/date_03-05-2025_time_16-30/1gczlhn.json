I recall hearing the same about socialist support of Scottish independence despite the SNP's repeated insistence that it would commit to NATO and rejoining the EU. The leading parties in favor of Quebecois independence don't seem to be all that interested in discussing an independent Quebec's economic or security relations to Kanada and the U$ in general which really inspires little confidence that anything would be weakened at all. Your point is true regardless but I wonder what gives someone like Realistic-Coffee the confidence to say that when it may not even be true from any perspective.",

The monarchy itself is thoroughly a capitalist one. I also don't see why I should particularly care for the \"independence\" of certain imperialist settler colonies, if you wanna make that argument. The only \"communists\" I've seen making arguments for the independence of Quebec or somewhat similar countries in the imperialist core are either social fascists or an obscure group of nazis who LARP as communists online (mainly on Reddit). Also you're missing the crux which would in the final instance determine the progressiveness of Quebecois nationalism: does it promise / is it even able to liberate the colonized First Nations? Again, I highly doubt it, but go ahead and make your case if you think it does.",

I highly doubt it but make your case\n\nRepublicanism doesn't have much of a presence in Britain aside from its secessionist movements, mainly in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the republicanism that does exist outside of those contexts are mostly liberals who want to save tax money that is spent on propping up the monarchy and their estate. I'd say, though, it's the case that not all republican movements are progressive but all progressive movements are republican; a communist party in Britain could only be republican.",
