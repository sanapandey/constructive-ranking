    "selftext": "Hello, I'm from Brazil, and here we have very active communist influencers and YouTube channels analyzing news from Brazil and the world, putting it in the perspective of Brazilian society, Brazilian Marxist and left-wing authors, and their particularities.\n\nI'm looking for the same from France and other countries\u2014maybe from Africa, Latin America, Germany, or anywhere else. They don't necessarily need to be in English; I speak French, Spanish, Portuguese, and a little German. The only international channels of this kind I follow are Hakim, Geopolitical Economy Report, and Second Thought.\n\nChannels that do video essays are also welcome, not just news. **The goal is to become more acquainted with the particularities of the communist debate in each country**. Thanks!\n\n\n\n*PS: The best Brazilian communist/leftist channels for me are Jones Manoel, Ian Neves, Frederico Krepe, and Humberto Matos. They are all in Portuguese, though\u2014sorry!*",

Their is a lot of \"leftists\" ones, close to Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon movement. But for strictly communist ones that do make good works and not just \"meme content\" their is \"\u00e0 l'assaut du ciel\"",
