            "body": ">Yet, rail hasn\u2019t been the tool and weapon of the capitalist-imperialist ruling class exclusively. As Marx and Engels famously wrote in The Communist Manifesto, the bourgeoisie raises its own gravediggers\u2014but we could add that it also furnishes them with many of the tools and weapons necessary to dig the bourgeoisie\u2019s grave\n\n......\n\n>Many activists in recent years have become more aware of and condemned the blood-soaked and brutally constitutive component of Canadian history that the railway has amounted to. But what the more postmodern-influenced among them fail to apprehend, however, is that forces of production are not moral categories or mere symbolic representations. We communists, by contrast, as dialectical and historical materialists, fully agree with what the highest echelons of the regime of preventive counter-revolution in this country conveniently admitted to us in Bland\u2019s report: the great liability that exists for the bourgeoisie\u2014and the great opportunity for the proletariat and oppressed nations\u2014in this vast infrastructure that has been press-ganged into existence.\n\nLeaving aside their obvious misreading of Bland's report, this is just a reaction to postmodernism by returning to classic eurocentrism. Ajith traces this view back to Marx's changing views on British India:\n\n>Yes, Marx correctly drew attention to the dual role of British rule, its destructive and regenerative functions. But a careful reading of what he wrote, aided by knowledge of the actual course of developments, shows that his optimism about the regenerative role of colonialism was misplaced. More-over, there was also the problem of viewing the prospects of colonial India through the prism of Western capitalism\u2019s course of development. One can summarise Marx\u2019s views as follows: through the introduction of modern industry by way of the railways and of private property in land through the zamindari and ryotwari settlements, by the political unity enforced through colonial rule, formation of a native army and the growth of a new class \u201cendowed with requirements for government and imbued with European science,\u201d along with the introduction of a \u201cfree press,\u201d the British were unconsciously laying the material foundations of Western (capitalist) society. If we leave out the specificities, what stands out is a projection of an inevitable development of capitalism, more or less along the pattern witnessed in Western Europe. Furthermore, the role of force exerted by colonial political power was seen only in its transformative aspect, in breaking down the old framework. Its role as a barrier to the development of capitalism, as a protector of the old order, suitably reformed, was missed. So too was the distinct nature of the capitalism fostered by colonialism.\n\nThe distinct nature of capitalism in Canada, as settler-colonial, means that through genocide and displacement Indigenous nations were prevented from developing capitalism on the basis of the development they had reached under pre-colonial modes of production. Instead, settler-colonial capitalism fosters a new dependent capitalism, in the place of the free development of prior Indigenous modes of production, with most reserves and urban Indigenous peoples today economically dependent on the tax-free industries (casinos, cannabis dispensaries, gas, alcohol and tobacco) or on government funding through social programs (charity). The Canadian government has also aligned itself with the most backward sections of Indigenous nations themselves by maintaining the position of tribal chief as their chosen lackeys, but removing all the real power of the native institutions, communal decision-making that once made them legitimate. The traditional customs, rituals of native people inherited were kept only as long as they reinforce the chief's power and thereby the power of the white nation over them, or are marketable as curious historical artifacts to tourists.\n\nIn this context, the railroad stands for genocide, for the stunting of the survivors in a regressive form of society. And the advance NCPC is proposing, for an alliance with the Canadian settlers, stands to continue that. From Azad's A Last Note to a Neo-Colonialist:\n\n>He \\[Verghese\\] goes on to say, \u201cDevelopment and connectivity threaten them. Hence they destroy roads, culverts, bridges. Hence the wanton attacks on railway and highway projects that would, if completed, connect and open up remote, backward areas. If education, health services, roads, irrigation, markets and communications are provided and poverty rolled back, the Maoists would be out of business.\u201d Why would Maoists be threatened by development and connectivity? If Verghese and his brand of intellectuals think that concrete roads are the barometer of development, they are living in a fool\u2019s paradise. He falls prey to the ruling-class scheme of development that displaces the Adivasis and destroys their lives, lands and cultures. He says roads and railways open up remote backward areas. For whom? For the people or for a handful of mining and industrial companies, forest contractors and police tormentors who make Adivasi lives a veritable hell?",

                    "body": "Such a \"great opportunity for the oppressed nations\" already exists - and has existed - in that a select few can or have become junior partners in settler colonial capitalism. On top of your examples in tax-free areas we can point out the desired sale of portions of the new trans-mountain pipeline to a special vehicle of first nations, the alliance of government and the Musqueam/Tsleil-Waututh/Squamish nations for land acquisition and real estate development in Greater Vancouver, or logistics companies like Northern Resource Trucking (owned by partnerships of first nations like the La Ronge Band and existing transport companies) which transport minerals from remote mines in northern sask. Even huge multinational mining companies like BHP are aware of and in condemnation of the bloody components of settler-colonial capitalism and are seeking to present the great opportunity that their new potash mine (in Jansen sask) will have for first nations with their Canada Indigenous Partnerships Plan - a type of partnership that their own executives admit \"they haven't seen (in other places they have worked like) Brazil or Australia\". \n\nIn a nutshell, in the post-UNDRIP world if your nation (or reserve) is near a resource-rich area (or near a line of access to it) then it is more cost-effective for the bourgeoisie to make small concessions and throw a few crumbs to a select few rather than spending millions fighting the newly-available legal challenges in court and subsequently having to pay even more in damages. More generally, capital can expand to include a few previously-excluded populations at the expense of many more as it flows to and centralizes in the same hands. I don't see how the expansion of this settler colonial capitalism is meant to bring Indigenous nations and a Canadian proletariat into allianc.......oh *right*, the (N)CPC said that 60-65% of the Canadian population is proletariat and includes workers in natural resources. By expanding the resource extraction labour pool to include Indigenous peoples the silly capitalists are unwittingly creating a multinational proletariat - oops!",

The Canadian oppressor nation requires a proletariat to sustain itself, but for a long time, it seemed to me atleast, that this class lay outside of its national borders. But slowly but surely, the Canadian nation will give rise to it's own gravedigger in the form of a multinational migrant proletariat or a new Indigenous proletariat.\n\nThose kinds of Canadian-Indigenous partnerships of course intensify the growth of a Indigenous comprador bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoise, but the kind of agreements where the whole of a nation or reserve shares in the payout (as with the Alaskan Native Fund) I\u2019d say falls under the category of various social welfare schemes of the Canadian government to placate people, to prevent discontent among the lumpenized nations- aren't these reforms not doomed to decline with time? Whereas the sorts of partnerships that involve employment of Indigenous labour, can lead to the growth of an Indigenous working class.\n\nAs an aside, I\u2019ve been returning to your post about the Canadian \u201cpopulation trap\u201d with the recent crisis and impending deportation of millions of student-workers. I was hoping that your recent posts about migration would speak more on this, applied to Canada, but it was more abstract, and concretely applied to Russia and China.",

                                    "body": "Oh absolutely. I should mention that almost everything I was quoting and/or responding to came from the linked article (\"great opportunity\", \"multinational proletariat\") and in my responses I was mostly sarcastically responding to what the (N)CPC envisions. It is absolutely true that any capital benefit derived from such arrangements applies to a sliver of Indigenous individuals and not the entirety of nations, and that such arrangements are very few and far between. And yes, reform as a whole has likely peaked. Will the resource extraction industry continue to extend miniscule reconciliatory gestures toward Indigenous nations as the flashpoint of critical mineral access (and a boost to the strength of the energy industry) approaches with PP and Trump in power? Probably not, but private business does have stronger law to contend with wrt Indigenous reconciliation and environmental law and they can't simply ignore it - it will have to be dealt with in some form.\n\nWith regard to migrants and the current crisis, it is true that I only made passing mention to Canada. Specifically, \"\"planning\" in capitalist modes of production\" in reference to \"the oft-discussed immigration targets.... and ...political jockeying around such targets in order to secure enough class collaboration to maintain rule\". It is no secret that Trudeau's govt downgraded the immigration targets to try to make a run at another election win, since the existing targets were deeply unpopular. Yet the consensus among bourgeois economists is that it was the increased consumption within Canada by new residents that kept GDP numbers high enough for the BOC to argue that a soft landing had taken place. Simply put, immigration is good for Canadian settler colonial capitalism - especially temporary migration of students and workers. This is practically a truism. In the past, whether it was John A McDonald, Stephen Harper, or Trudeau, the ruling class has been quick to quell popular discontent surrounding immigration by claiming that they would stem migration. With McDonald it was explicit, where he basically said: \"I hate the asians too, but we can't do anything about it until that railroad is built\" - the capitalists required migration and the settlers hated it, and so he secured class collaboration with this statement and subsequent exclusionary legislation. In the modern examples, Harper and Trudeau's govts have also had to juggle the interests of the bourgeosie and settlers, but they are not navigating the same economic landscape as MacDonald and so their legislation and *especially* the accounting of migration is very crafty: they use fog to conceal the concrete trends of migration in order to secure a class collaborationist mandate. \n\nLet me explain further: the TFWP under Harper explicitly defined migrant workers as being either \"high-skilled\" or \"low-skilled\". This can be seen in the open government data which accounts for the program between the approximate years of 2008-2015 (I believe the years might be a bit off here since I'm recalling from memory). When the Harper govt came under fire for the rise in \"low-skilled\" migrants, his govt (and Trudeau's afterward) did 2 things: 1) changed the definition of migrants under the program to be classified under National Occupation Classifications which are more complicated in how they define \"skill-level\", and 2) directed the attention of the populace toward the TFWP program while separate programs, the International Mobility Program and the pathways for international students to migrate to Canada, steadily increased in usage (not to mention any workers overstaying their visas and thus not accounted for in the stats). Therefore while Harper and Trudeau could point to the *new* stats to show that usage of the TFWP had decreased as was requested, there was no meaningful stemming of temporary migration and migrant work - in fact, it greatly increased. \n\nWhile I have no doubt that the Canadian and provincial governments will - at least temporarily - clamp down on the TFWP and international students (whether in new targets for study permits, post graduate work permits, or rules mandating legal work for current students) in their current and near-future claims to stem migrant work, and while I have no doubt that there will be some pullback in the growth of migrant work, I do doubt that it will be as large as is being argued. It would be too unpopular among the bourgeoisie. Instead, I predict that migrant workers considered under the IMP and so-called \"illegals\" working without a visa will likely grow to take up a much larger proportion, not to mention any planning for other programs that are likely under development. Take, for instance, how the Alberta premier came under fire recently for seeking to recruit migrant workers who are currently in the UAE - a so-called \"international talent mission\". If anything, with PP in power we will probably see a clamp down on the hot-button pathways for migrant work and an attempt to otherwise deregulate and take a hands-off approach to private business' access to international labour. \n\nBut this is me speaking off-the-cuff. You are right that a more thorough treatment of the topic is needed.",
