There is no class of indigenous in England who are nationally oppressed and deprived of land by a settler class that accrues wealth through rent (though settler-colonial relations do exist in the United Kingdom, mainly in the overseas colonies that they still possess and, perhaps, Northern Ireland). The English national-construct is not an inherently settler-colonial one, like America or Israel, but, at the same time, the English labour aristocracy is almost as large and reactionary as the American labour aristocracy, and most of the proletariat in England comes from overseas migrants who are exploited for their labour and face racial abuse, it's not that far off from America but the land relations aren't the same.\n\nI wonder about your thoughts on the matter. Why do you feel that England might be considered a settler colony?",

That doesn't appear to be a major factor. Palestine was a colony of the Ottoman Empire and then the British before the emergence of Israeli settler-colonialism. Ireland has a long history of colonization, but settler-colonialism specifically appeared only in the 17th century, and in one region of the island: Ulster. There were also failed attempts to plant settlers in other parts of the island, such as the province of Munster. The Nazis tried to establish settler-colonies in much of Eastern Europe as part of Lebensraum, but they didn't have enough time as they were defeated by the USSR",

I think because settler colonialism is often traced to its extraterritorial nature and its appropriative nature overseas, it is generally premised in the case of England as a subjugating force that emanated outwards from that empire. There is also the uniquely extractive and additive nature of colonialism (as in adding land and resources to the stock of empire) and at its peak its coinciding with industrialised capitalism and for example mercantile economies such as sugar plantations in the Caribbean or tea in India. Coupled with slavery and indentured labour of subject populations. Of course it was also a distinctly racialised and imperious ethnosupremacist phenomenon and it\u2019s unhistoric to suggest otherwise and I think that also doesn\u2019t apply in the case of Norman conquest.",

Destroy domestic manufacturing to create more customers for your manufactured goods. It was about capital formation. \n\nThe Norman conquest was about the extraction of rents. The Normans did not destroy England's cotton production to drive up the price of theirs. \n\nThey forcefully migrated. built fortified enclaves. Then used their knight class to extract rent the local population. These rents were used to fund the knight class and the nobility and eventually kicked back to the king.

The question then would be are substantial swathes of European states settler colonial states?\n\nWhen the AS arrived into Britain their was a mix of integration and conquest. DNA sequencing has meant that the traditional narrative of the Saxons arriving and then launching a conquest of England isn't quite accurate. A lot of the rural infrastructure of England would have been in a questionable state after the Romans left. In a lot of ways the Romans used the province of Britannia as a breadbasket, feeding Roman populations not just in Britain but also in the Northern European provinces along the Rhine as well. With the withdrawal of the Romans there isn't a need for the agricultural overhead so it's likely that fields were left permanently fallowed in their absence. In that regard there is the necessary agricultural output to support the existing Britons and the arriving Germanic population so their is little reason for violence to outbreak. Now there was violence, we have recorded battles between the AS and the Britons but the Britons and Saxons did mix extensively. It's also important to add that *everyone* was practicing slavery in Europe at this point in history and a lot of the economic activity in northern Europe as a whole was spurred on by the trading of human lives.\n\nIn total the genetic makeup of populations is the best we can do for figuring out how much of it was violent conquest and how much was peaceful settlement. It's hard to estimate but the number might have been as high as 50% meaning that the two populations mixed extensively and probably peacefully for the most part.",

That is how you end up with white people who justify the colonisation of America by pointing out that the native tribes engaged in warfare with each other, so, therefore, the colonisation of America by settlers was no different to those instances of tribal warfare. The colonisation of America lead to the formation of the First Nations, but the First Nations were unable to develop due to the parasitism of the American settler-nation that depended upon extracting its wealth, enslaving them, and depriving land from their possession; nothing like this resulted from pre-capitalist tribal warfare. Genetics don't matter either.",

                            "body": "My argument was the English are effectively native in England because they're essentially the combination of two different ethnic groups rolled into one and the Anglo Saxon migration is usually framed as a violent conquest which is why OP is originally even asking this question. My point is the history of the Island shows that the modern English are an amalgamation of North Sea Germanic peoples and native Britons. The narrative of the formation of the country is an inherently settler colonialist one developed during the height of British colonialism with the English being solely talked about in the context of an outsider people (the Saxons mostly) coming in and taming the wild peoples of Britain. An identical narrative is made by the same antiquated victorian scholars about the Romans coming in and doing the same thing. We don't have an extensive written history of this period so the best we can do is try and piece together fragmentary evidence at best, hence why genetics is important because the only period narratives  we have is from the likes of Bede and other religious figures who weren't particularly happy about the orthodox, insular Christianity, that the Britons practiced as they had been cut off from Roman Christianity for centuries by the time of his writing, and basically said all the horrible things that happen to them are justified as god being angry. So given the prevailing narrative, understanding the arrival of the Saxons into Britain as either violent conquest or peaceful settlement is somewhat important for disrupting that narrative, especially as those same people who are depicted as the barbarians being civilised are then ultimately, definitely colonised later on in history by the English so it does have consequences.",

There's no good evidence for actual population replacement on any kind of large scale. Most people who ended up speaking English were Celtic-speaking before that (and speaking something else before Celtic languages spread there from the continent). And prior to the modern period, there wasn't a top-down effort to force language change either. While the old English ruling class's language did prevail in most of the island, that of the Normal ruling class didn't and eventually died out. But all of that was before the modern concept of the nation-state existed, so it probably wouldn't even have occurred to them.",
