TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking.

We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

In fact, this article outright plagiarizes Hoxha's slander against Mao and makes it even more egregious!\n\n>Mao Zedong was for the unrestricted free development of capitalism in China in the period of the state of the type of \"new democracy\", as he called that regime which was to be established after the departure of the Japanese. At the 7th Congress of the CPC he said, \"Some think that the communists are against the development of private initiative, against the development of private capital, against the protection of private property. In reality, this is not so. The task of the order of new democracy, which we are striving to establish, is precisely to ensure the possibility for broad circles of Chinese to freely develop their private initiave in society, to freely develop the private capitalist economy.\" In this way, Mao Zedong took over the anti-Marxist concept of Katitsky, according to which, in the backward countries the transition to socialism cannot be achieved without going through a lengthy period of free development of capitalism which prepares the conditions to go over to socialism later. In fact, the so-called socialist regime which Mao Zedong and his group established in China,was and remained a bourgeois-democratic regime.\n\nArticle:\n\n>The Chinese revisionists\u2019 theories were developed in accord with the \u201ctastes\u201d of their national bourgeoisie and large peasantry, with fundamental aspects of socialist revolution such as the proletarian dictatorship being omitted in place of \u201cNew Democracy\u201d with all \u201cprogressive\u201d strata of China. \n\nThey can't be completely ignorant of Hoxha's criticisms but then just happen to reword them like a high schooler \"paraphrases\" an article into their essay.\n\n>Is it knowledge of the author, or just the anti-revisionist stalinist lens?

As some of our readers will know, before our restructuring from a journal to an organization, we explicitly were Hoxhaists and upheld the figure of Hoxha as a classic of Marxism. In our course of study and squishing of the amateurism which plagued us, we have discovered that (around early 2023) our line on the matter has been completely incorrect.\n\n>...\n\n>One question that had led to much debate even within the Red Spectre, was the question of what Hoxhaism even is. The word itself is often thrown by revisionists to disparage good Marxist-Leninists, and even we have had it thrown at us as an insult. To a revisionist, to be a Hoxhaist is to be a dogmatist, to be an ultra-\u201dleft\u201d;  who unapologetically worships Hoxha and Stalin; someone who follows this \u201cbackwards\u201d and \u201cantiquated\u201d interpretation of Marxism. If you uphold the theory of Marxism-Leninism, if you are opposed to revisionism, if you uphold the revolutionary history of the Soviet Union until Khrushchev, you are somehow a Hoxhaist. Hence the usage of the term \u201cHoxhaism\u201d by revisionists, is utter nonsense.\n\n>However, this does not mean that the label itself does not refer to anything real, as all ideas stem from a material basis, as a consequence of reality. There are many Marxist-Leninists who even identify with the label themselves, sharing it with the putrid ooze that contrasts so strikingly with Marxism - Not too dissimilarly to how Marxist-Leninists have to share a space with Dengites. Many good and well intentioned comrades who simply lacked prior access to all the facts surrounding Hoxha, and who made principled and well intentioned analysis given the information they had.\n\n>...\n\n>In the above, we have displayed our reasoning in full as to why we shifted away from Hoxha. We believe it is the most complete polemic regarding this topic (especially if one disregards the sheer nonsense made by Maoists, as nonsense cannot be used to refute nonsense).\n\n>We have demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that Hoxha originally upheld Khrushchev, that he lied about this and attempted to cover it up. We have proven that Hoxha was aware of the vacillations of Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, yet he took decades to come out in full open criticism. We have proven that Hoxha upholds a policy that amounts to debt-trap diplomacy and social-imperialism. We have proven that Hoxha upheld the islamist dictatorship in Iran, and that he further supported the CIA-backed Mujahadeen feudalists, lacking even the most basic qualification on the national question in his (lack of) reasoning.\n\n>Throughout all of this, he never admitted to his mistakes, or made any attempt to acknowledge blame for anything he has done. It would appear that Hoxha died without regrets. The regret over his actions, it appears, is a price not he but the communist movement worldwide has to pay. Unlike him, we will not preach unity with traitors - Enver Hoxha included.\n\n>Finally, we call on all Marxists, all aspiring revolutionaries and activists to not abandon the label of Marxism-Leninism. Uphold the revolution, uphold the struggle for a better world. Hoxha may have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, but that does not mean that we have to. The label of \u201cMarxism-Leninism\u201d is worth fighting for because Marxism-Leninism is the science of the proletarian revolution. It is not just a collection of dusty tomes but rather a field manual on how to use our understanding of the world to make real positive change around us. When we say that we are Marxist-Leninists, we are saying to the world that we uphold the history of socialism, that change is possible, that we are steadfast and resolute in our determination to make the world a better place.\n\nSo they appear to be something worse, where Marxism-Leninism itself is being reduced to leftkkkommunism -- there simply is and was no actual movement to abolish the present state of things post-1953.  All of history died with Stalin, and we are merely persisting in the doomed world that his void hath created.  All that can be done is start over with a disconnected Marxism(-Leninism) and this time *really* watch for those revisionist-bad-apples.  The polemic itself is ridiculous -- Hoxha's decisions against Khrushchev carried with them the fate of millions and shifted the balance of world power, are you really going to go after him for moving too slow or banal political formalities -- and you know who else was sleeping on Khrushchev and didn't act with haste? *Stalin!* That's the whole point of the criticism of anti-revisionism: *how Stalin missed this.* The lesson comes from Stalin's mistake and there are further lessons from Hoxha's and even Mao's, but they were all great communists who defended communism whenever it mattered and that's the point of standing by them.  And Lenin's break with Kautsky occurred while Lenin was on the outside looking in, it's not really a similar comparison; and Luxemburg beat him to the punch anyway -- perhaps they should go after Lenin for that letter he wrote saying not to be too hasty in throwing out Kautsky. And apparently Hoxha wasn't sufficiently arguing against Mao in bad-faith enough terms for these authors, so (in great irony) their criticism of China and Mao actually becomes basically identical to the criticism from Brezhnev.  I would actually be very interested to read a good serious attempt of a Hoxhaist criticism of Cultural Revolution which understands and steelmans the GPCR before attempting to criticize it, but instead all we get are wrong statements and quote mining Mao from the war or New Democracy periods with absolutely no honest articulation of what Mao was doing or attempting.  Their entire thesis on revisionism is poorly constructed too (blaming the Peasants, the most loyal ally of the Proletariat; blaming capitalist systems within socialist construction for the internal bourgeoisie - fine - but not in a way that actually explains where Khrushchev - the commissar-hero of Stalingrad - or Deng - risking all on the Long March - came from, etc).  Perhaps the deepest irony of history in this situation is that the last defenders of Hoxha will end up being the Maoists.\n\nedit: added some bits",

Revisionism injects idealism, mysticism, and superstition into a science (Marxism). On the contrary, to make a progressive advancement of Marxist theory (e.g. that made by Lenin and Stalin) is to preserve its revolutionary contents if not make them more empowering to the working class movement. \n\n...\n\n>The Soviet Union \u2014 previously a bulwark of socialism \u2014 constituted one of the first revisionist states alongside Mao\u2019s China and Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia. After the defeat of the initial wave of Soviet revisionism as represented in the tendencies of Trotskyism and Bukharinism, the deviationists and opportunists took on a more concealed approach, seeking to slowly detach the Communist Party from the people and provide power to a bureaucratic clique without the knowledge of the administration of Stalin who fought pugnaciously for further democratization. \n\nWhen I say Stalinism above, I was understanding, from the article, that Lenin->Stalin was the correct \"progression\" of marxist thought, that it was still materially relevant / correct and not in need of alteration, and that other communist 'isms' are ultimately idealist, bourgeoisie infiltrated poison.\n\nI guess my real question is ultimately; is revisionism just a word for 'not stalin'?\n\nI read the article earnestly because \"revisionist\" in Marxist terms is a word I loosely understand, but would like to understand more accurately.\n\nI am not at all familiar with \"Hoxha\".",
