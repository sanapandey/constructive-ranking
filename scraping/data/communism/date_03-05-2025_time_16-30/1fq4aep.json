    "selftext": "I\u2019m curious whether this sub has ever had extended discussions, especially since recognizing the question of the labor aristocracy, regarding the existence of a proletariat among the oppressed nations in the U$. There seems to be a significant vacillation, or perhaps disagreement, on the question espoused by frequent users here; for example, just this month, u/smokeuptheweed9 telling a chauvinistic white commentor that \u201cthe vast majority of Black proletarians are socialists, just not in the way you recognize\u201d and talking about \"the proletariat being mobilized for Blue Oval City in Haywood County\" and \"the rural proletariat still involved in the cotton industry\" while other users discussed how Cope\u2019s work and the cooptation of the BLM movement implied *no* Black proletariat existing anymore (and questioned the idea of the Black nation as a revolutionary force at all). Furthermore, I know MIM and MIM(Prisons) went back and forth on this question but ultimately agreed there were no Black proletarians. \n\nThe existence of proletarians of oppressed nations would seem to imply that the calculation of who is \"proletarian\" simply based off of surplus-value, as Cope does, is an incorrect way to view the question; rather, a thorough analysis of the living conditions and the class standpoint and alliances of these sections of the masses would be a better way to determine who is proletarian (an idea which I think is more productive, given that that's how *Settlers* is formulated). It is clear that the question of who is proletarian is much more than a semantic question, but for a subreddit largely comprised of Amerikans that places such great emphasis on correct class analyses and on the struggles of oppressed nations, there is very little discussion of whether these are *proletarian* struggles.\n\nThis seems to me to be an incredibly significant question that guides how both individual communists and communist parties should carry out work, and it feels as though a lack of investigation and discussion has occurred. So, I\u2019d like to open a discussion here about it. ",

To not consider property ownership in the US settler context is obviously flawed if not deeply troubling. I would hope Cope's fascist turn has caused people to think about some of the limitations of his work.\n\nI won't dispute the experience of MIM on this issue since orientation towards prisons is basically a wager on it. But I don't think we must be obedient to MIM because they are an organization and we are merely individuals. There have been some recent discussions about some of the ideas of MIM that have not aged very well and I think we can evaluate on our own whether a black proletariat exists without capitulating to this poster from r/revdem which takes the bad parts of Maoist (Maoism as a reborn CPUSA) to become a rightist faction of the DSA.",

You've been around this place for much longer than I have - has there ever been serious time and energy devoted to any sort of analysis, either via social investigation or via studying real economic data like Cope and MIM did, of this question?

Maybe I'm expecting too much of this subreddit, though, as a public and disparate space for discussion.\n\n> To not consider property ownership in the US settler context is obviously flawed if not deeply troubling.\n\nRight, and to be honest, musing on this idea is part of why I made this post in the first place. A frequent admonishment of chauvinistic first-worlders pandering to the labor aristocracy is \"proletariat doesn't mean working for a wage, it means people with nothing to lose but their chains!\" But what does that imply for the extremely numerically significant parts of New Afrika, especially the urban ones, who, yes, are making superprofits at their minimum wage jobs or in the underground economy, but nevertheless can't hold down a home, even a rented one, can't afford a working car, and are seeing their prospects for the future stolen away by deindustrialization and the dispossession caused by the anarchic motions of capital?",

It's straightforward to take that and apply it inversely to the American consumer aristocracy. Though to your point, that analysis would lead one to conclude that there is no proletariat in the US since everyone participates in the consumption of Chinese toys, electronics, medicine, plastic, etc.\n\nYou don't need us to analyze the US proletariat, every communist party has attempted to do so in practice. Every attempt has been a failure and they've all been discussed here. However I'm not quite ready to give up on the existence of a proletariat at all since, other than MIM, there are no parties that even acknowledge the existence of a labor aristocracy as a Marxist concept. There was discussion of \"state unions\" which some Maoist group thought was a great innovation when in fact it is a regression from the labor aristocracy. And yet it is still a step forward from the practice of other groups. \n\n>has there ever been serious time and energy devoted to any sort of analysis, either via social investigation or via studying real economic data like Cope and MIM did, of this question?\n\nWell yes, I think the posts here in good threads are as serious as anything else, though given the word limits the empirical work is done beforehand and it's referenced in its conclusions. But there is no one post with someone's thesis on who the proletariat is, that question is far too broad. It's like people who has \"how do we make revolution?\" If I had a 5 minute answer for you it would already have happened.\n\nThe specific post you're talking about was basically me telling some white dude to do something uncomfortable because I knew he wouldn't. I would imagine if a communist party really tried to organize in the way I discussed they would fail in the same way US communists have failed on similar terrain for a century. But the currently existing parties aren't even competent enough to try it, there's only so much we can say in an observational role.",

The best way to provoke discussion is to analyze a concrete phenomenon or event, like I said the question you're asking is too broad.\n\n>It's intricacies like this that make me think that these analyses are way too vulgar; it seems obvious to me that there's a difference between owning a home and a car and a 401k, and owning a bunch of cheap Chinese clothes and toys.\n\nIs there? The real problem with third worldism is not the expectation that there will be no revolution in the first world (that much is obvious) but that there will be revolution in the third world. The globalization of manufacturing has not had that effect and the revolutions that have happened are on the older terrain of anti-colonialism and anti-feudalism. That is why the \"third worldists\" like Cope (before full blown fascism) and Lauesen have all become Dengists. That's the actual manifestation of third world politics in the era of multinational monopoly capitalism, at least if we remain in the terms of progressive national bourgeois revolutions surrounding the first world cities. The most useful intervention of MIM is the simple challenge: show me where the revolution is actually happening. The \"Maoist\" in this thread simply denies reality itself and reduces a century of failure to a lack of consciousness or a proper party. I don't think MIM closes the book on the issue but few are even willing to confront the challenge because of its terrifying implications. Surviving that will require acknowledging we're still looking for the proletariat of today because capitalism moved much faster than Marxist theory could keep up.",

I was utterly convinced of the correctness of semi-feudalism as applied to India in the last thread on the subject. But the actual practice (inserting Maoist politics into the farmer's movement) is lacking. I'm not criticizing the CPI(Maoist), the level of repression there is extreme so there is only so much you can get through reporting and a real breakthrough will only come when such repression is no longer sustainable against widespread revolutionary power. But I actually wanted the person arguing for the development of rural capitalism in India to do a better job because the claim that the Indian farmers protesting are kulaks is the kind of bold provocation I like.\n\n>Is the idea behind this then that globalization has pushed capitalism so far beyond what the \u201cgreat theorists\u201d of Marxism ever supposed, to a point where revolutionary politics are impossible without a deeper understanding of the world of globalization? \n\nI would specify that Marx predicted it completely but that the level of specificity required to do politics is beyond merely rereading the classics. This is kind of what you're asking for in the OP. Marx even says that China's walls against free trade will be battered down in the Manifesto. But the specific evolution towards that event is both necessary to understand for politics and unpredictable.\n\n>If \u201cthe actual manifestation of third world politics\u201d is the anti-proletarian falsehood of Dengism, what does that say about \u201cthird world politics\u201d as a whole? \n\nI think it's reached the limit of its life cycle. Even Sam King's much better and more recent work seems unable to comprehend the real technological accomplishments of China in the last few years and any theory that takes wage differentials as the primary form of superexploitation won't last much longer against this phenomenon. Communists are right to assert the persistence of the nation-state as the foundation of capitalist accumulation and revolutionary politics. But it can also be misplaced, in pockets of China wages have already reached first world standards (if not the US, Spain or Taiwan). Comparing \"Chinese\" and \"American\" wages is an abstraction which can sometimes disguise more than it reveals.",

It goes all the way back to the Algerian revolution, when it was asserted for the first time that the (French) working class was reactionary and the national liberation struggle didn't need them or was even against them. But this issue was sort of deferred, as Vietnam took the place of Algeria and made the problems of the latter go away thanks to the connections between the communist party of Vietnam and the socialist world, including western communist parties. It then became the cause celebre for the new communist movement whereas the uncomfortable history of Algeria was forgotten even in France and the reformism of the communist party was seen as primarily a political problem rather than an accurate reflection of the class interests of its base. The first thing the new left did in France was go back to the \"working class.\"  \n\nWhat is new is throwing off this baggage and returning to the initial problem of mass reformism and chauvanism and trying to find a materialist explanation (Sartre avoided it and turned commitment to Algeria as a moral issue). But it also contains the traces of the era that no longer make sense. The foreign policy of Maoist China wasn't actually different than the USSR until it became completely different in a bad way because the fundamental issue was still national liberation struggles and the communist orientation towards the nationalist bourgeoisie and colonized petty-bourgeoisie. Algeria was a challenge but it was only really the most radical expression of the general movement for decolonization and late development. Dengism is, among other things, an application of this logic to the present, with Prashad explicitly calling it a new non-aligned socialist movement (though he is fundamentally dishonest on this issue since there was a great struggle within that movement over the definition of socialism between Cuba, Yugoslavia, and the rest - it was not taken for granted or deferred).\n\nFormal \"third worldism\" came after May 68 and similar events of the time, where the student movement showed its strength and the workers showed passivity or even reaction (the \"hard hat riots\" in the US are an infamous inflection point) but never went back and engaged with the limits of the Algerian revolution itself (to be fair, at the time the military coup seemed to advance further towards \"socialism\" and anti-colonialism, it's only retroactively that the cracks are visible) nor did it find a real political practice to substitute for first worldism. Even the KAK relied on the PLFP to have something to do, when that party inevitably became irrelevant in the receding tide of anti-colonialism they had nothing to do (and Lauesen became a Dengist). And that was a fringe organization, we're the ones reconstructing some coherence out of this period based on innovative praxis rather than support or influence. Both the PLFP and KAK combined the anti-colonial nationalism of Algeria with the Marxism-Leninism of Cuba and Vietnam (with some Maoist references), it's only retroactively that the contradictions between them come back to haunt us (everyone liked the Cuban revolution, even Trots).\n\nSo it's no surprising such an old concept is showing its age. It is more the power to offend that makes it interesting rather than its completeness that makes \"third worldism\" so appealing.",

The substance of the Kerala welfare state, to the limited extent that it exists, is actually remittances from workers in the middle east. The state is just a parasite on this inter-personal wealth transfer. Land reform and industrial development, both the foundations for mass politics, were complete failures and Indian \"democracy\" is really just the same old system of landlords or bosses mobilizing votes in a system of patronage, whether the CPIM, INC, or BJP. This is important to understand because, unlike the US where the white majority has an autonomous hatred of the black population, attempts to put Indian politics on the basis of caste chauvanism have failed. Even Hindu fascism is formally against caste discrimination, and using Muslims as a scapegoat has been no more successful in overcoming the class struggle between the peasants and landlords.\n\nThe DSA is only interesting because of its success. It didn't have to advertise itself to Marxist-Leninists and even Maoists, they went to it of their own volition. The Maoist movement in Nepal has been an utter failure since its absorption into the state, either to accomplish basic democratic tasks or to create a stable political basis for reformism. \n\n>Are you talking about the alliance with the United States out of the misguided belief that social-fascist Russia was now the greatest threat to communism?\n\nI mean before that, when China and the USSR were attacking each other's foreign policy but doing the exact same thing in Vietnam. Before the turn towards the US, the most you could say was that Chinese aid came with less conditions and more little red books, but even then Cuba did the same thing with more commitment. Foreign policy was one of the areas where the cultural revolution had implications for thinking about politics in a new way but it was never actually put into practice. Part of this was the role of Zhou Enlai on the issue but the biggest part is that the ideas of Lin Baio, which inspired much of what we're discussing, got caught up in domestic political machinations.",

Explanations of why social democracy is a dead end that skip over Lenin v.

Though obviously the social democracy of the DSA is counterrevolutionary and chauvinistic in ways that, say, Nasserite social democracy might not be, and though it goes without saying that the exploitation of nations is the primary contradiction on a global scale, the failure of first-world \"first-worldist\" groups in *theory* combined with the failure of first-world \"third-worldist\" groups in *practice* has left a void that fetishization of modern China (or, in other cases, the DPRK or Vietnam, or for some \"anti-imperialists\" even Iran) has swooped in to fill, this sub has noted it well. \n\nBut that's less of what I'm wondering; rather, what are the tendencies that *led* to Nasser, Sankara, et. al.'s nationalist social democracies? In China it's obvious, since the GPCR laid out exactly what would lead to a capitalist counterrevolution and exactly what it would look like in action. But if the justification for social democracy in first-world countries is solely predicated on the labor aristocracy... why do nationalist and ostensibly \"ML\" revolutions devolve into social democracy in the third world, too?",

This is reflected in wage differentials but that is a secondary, empirical expression. King uses GDP-per-capita which, while also imperfect, is better than wages as a measure.\n\n>One thing that third world politics has certainly lacked in answering, for me, is why exploited countries also turn towards social democracy\n\nI think you're getting caught up in the contradictions of Dengism. I would not call Nasserism \"social democracy\" even if it gives the appearance of being a \"welfare state\". Its primary purpose is different as is its class basis. The closest equivalent in the first world would be Prussian or Japanese late development, with the maturity of imperialism making this a doomed path. The closest thing is the \"Pink Tide\" governments which do have the appearance of social democracy. But here the problem is the opposite: whereas before social democracy was defined too broadly, this defines it too narrowly. Social democracy at its height led to major restructuring of the capitalist West and a solid basis for the labor aristocracy as a political force. Lula or Chavez channeled the political rhetoric of social democracy (someone like Olof Palme or Andreas Papandreou) but have none of the accomplishments. Neoliberalism led to a restructuring of the French or British economy whereas the election of Bolsonaro has only political and rhetorical effects.\n\nNevertheless, the general point is correct. There is room for both reformist politics (at least in rhetoric) and fascist politics and this has a real effect in the political arena. Thaksin may have had little overall effect on the Thai economy but for communists he represented a major political force to be understood and reckoned with. My causal explanation, echoing u/AltruisticTreat8675, is that China has changed the terrain of global politics.",

After Covid and the witness of the state coordination campaigns of China, there seems to have been a shift away from China due to lower \u201cwage differentials\u201d , rate of profits, or political instability with protectionist US. This week, the Gen Secretary of Vietnam visited US and Cuba, talked with corporates and Biden to increase cooperation of Vietnam. Vietnam desires for US to consider it a market economy and cooperate on the new semiconductor industry. Nevertheless, a contradiction is that China [1] will plan to use it, along with SEA neighbors, to \u201cnearshore\u201d manufacturing to maneuver the protectionist measures of US. Will the wage differentials in China hit the point where it\u2019s no longer profitable, seeking a restructuring of the global economy away from China towards SEA or Latin America, or this is only temporary and it will be long until China ceases to be the dominant manufacturing factory of the world? Socialist \u201cRevolution\u201d seems far from imminent in SEA and more likely will be US neocolonialism which emerges victorious more than anything else. How much longer can the \u201cspatial fix\u201d continue and where are its next locations? \n\nIf the \u201cspatial fix\u201d can somehow temporarily replace China, \u201csocial democracy\u201d will probably continue to be a dominant ideology if there is another commodity boom that comes from it. China also appears to be ramping up military spending so I\u2019m not sure if that counts for anything either\u2014maybe like a Brezhnevite stagnation in the economy.\n\n\n\n[1] https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna172798",

I think the question of Maoists not participating in the farmer's protest has already been publicly answered, [given the status of Dr. Darshan Pal, convenor of the united front leading the farmer's protest in 2020-21.](https://www.ptinews.com/story/national/cpi-maoist-expels-farmer-leader-darshan-pal-for-naxal-links/1028089)\n\nThis is a different conversation than what is going on but the farmer's movement should really be looked at in light of the internal line struggle ongoing within the united front of farmers. Unsurprisingly, the revisionism of Darshan Pal and his fellows is actually linked to the question of agrarian capitalism vs semi-feudalism, with him ultimately holding the belief that Punjab, Haryana and Wester Uttar Pradesh show signs of capitalist development (while the rest of the country remains semi-feudal). How would this justify aligning with what would be kulaks and landlords? They had no clarity during the course of the 2020 Farmer's Protest, their organizations were largely comprised of rich peasants. The internal struggle culminated with the 26th January 2021 republic day incident when the militant formations (including the Khalistanis) within the farmer's movement broke from the rest of contingent and stormed the red fort. Pal divided the revolutionary camp with his eclectic position and fear of peasant militancy. All of this has culminated with the letter I shared above, the splitting of the united front itself into SKM-Political (the agrarian capitalism status quo) and SKM-Non Political and the formation of the Kisan Mazdoor Morcha, which is a separate united front mobilizing organizations of landless peasants and agricultural labourers. SKM-NP and KMM are leading the 2023-24 farmer's movement. Darshan Pal's camp of neo-revisionists though, is a curious case in that they have ultimately aligned with SKM-P, they have ultimately chosen inaction over a serious exposition of whatever their line is.",

If so, if there have been any advances of revolutionary practice at the levels of the Black Panthers, the BLA, or even broader anti-imperialist New Afrikan nationalism, I'll eat my words here.\n\n>they're incomparably more so than the somewhat significant firmly petty-bourgeois, bought-off section of the New Afrikan nation.\n\nNow this is comparing apples to oranges, of course Bangladeshi sweatshop workers are more radical than the bought-off section of the New Afrikan nation. The question is, how much of the New Afrikan nation is bought off, how are their conditions shifting, and why do even the New Afrikans enjoying a standard of living far above the Bangladeshi sweatshop workers demonstrate consistent and remarkable resistance to the Amerikan empire? (If your claim is that they *don't* in fact demonstrate that resistance, well that's one of those provocative points that smokeuptheweed was extolling earlier in the thread, so I'l happily hear you out; perhaps the Panthers, the BLA, and the various Black nationalist movements described in *Settlers* weren't truly as radical as they seemed?

I don't know nearly enough about Bangladeshi conditions to say why textile workers haven't been organized yet along Maoist lines, but given how radical they already are, there is clearly immense potential for them to be mobilized in a revolutionary manner. I don't think the fact that they haven't yet done so, and that their demands are as yet mostly economic rather than political, speaks to any deficiency in radical potential as compared to New Afrika.\n\nRegarding New Afrika, you're asking the critical questions that, admittedly rather mechanically, I've skirted around. Cope's analysis of New Afrikan integration into the labor aristocracy is definitely reductive: since the national question is the principle contradiction in occupied Turtle Island, it's certainly safe to say that national position determines revolutionary consciousness in this country more than class position, though the latter is far from irrelevent. This interplay between national and class position can clearly be seen in the consciousness of the New Afrikan petty-bourgeoisie, which has become more prominent since the 60s. They are a class which reaps immense super-profits from imperialism, though far more precariously than the settler petty-bourgeoisie, and is still subject to national oppression. Their national oppression begets a demand for a change to the current state of things which is certainly in contrast to the political consciousness of most settlers (who are perfectly content with the current structure of global imperialism, their political consciousness being centered around the tiniest of localized ripples within that structure), but at the same time, their reactionary class position prevents their national consciousness from becoming revolutionary. The solution for them, rather than ending their national oppression through ending settler-colonialism and imperialism, is instead more fully integrating into imperialist parasitism through \"reparations\". [This Vox article](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22245223/black-middle-class-racism-reparations) is immensely insightful regarding this topic, actually because of its liberalism rather than despite it.\n\nThese people, however, definitely are not representative of the whole New Afrikan nation, which remains far poorer than the Settler nation, even if that poverty is wealth compared to the conditions of the third world proletariat. National oppression, however, is determinate, and that national oppression is particularly intense, with over 10% of New Afrikan men between ages 20 and 34 being imprisoned by the state. While all New Afrikans are more likely to be imprisoned than settlers, poorer New Afrikans are more likely to be imprisoned than petty-bourgeois New Afrikans, and this imprisonment is more likely to erode their already precarious economic position, not to mention the psychological effects on children whose parents are snatched away by the state (if they themselves aren't the ones being arrested, of course). All of this is accentuated by the fact that the police (or angry white people with guns and ropes, which basically play the role of the police) periodically brutalize and murder New Afrikan folk in the street or in their homes. It's interesting to note that, after the end of the Black liberation movement in the 80s, New Afrikan resistance against the state has mostly been in the heels of these murders, most recently after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Of course, the Maoist influence on these movements has been basically non-existent (a massive contrast, as you note, to the Black Panthers or BLA), and I'm not entirely sure why (an immediate guess, of course, is the absence, within the on-going global retreat of communism, of a revolutionary figure like Mao Zedong to give inspiration to the movement), but that doesn't negate the radical significance of these movements, something which has certainly unnerved the white people and imperialists trying to co-opt them. Of course, they are rather spontaneous expressions of rage and resistance toward the brutal white-supremacist state, which, however inspiring and justified, has no real potential to bring an end to that state; this is a limitation that will certainly need to be addressed in the future. I'm definitely not saying that the New Afrikan nation no longer has revolutionary potential, but cooptation and the end of organized liberation struggle has certainly altered the situation significantly from the 60s and 70s, especially with the further development of a black petty-bourgeoisie which is nationally oppressed but with a class position that inclines them to social fascism rather than revolution. This is something that I urgently need to do significantly more investigation about, of the social as well as literary kind, because its a critical aspect of the strategic situation in the US settler-colony.",

Anyway, in the case of a NDR, the main force would be the peasantry led by the proletariat, so the bulk of the struggle would not take place in the cities, but the rural areas and slums(as the PCP had done).

It is simply a description of the relationship to production, not a moral or political assessment. It is not the same thing as saying they have a proletarian worldview - something that has to be forged through prolonged ideological struggle and practical experience. \n\nMany communists in the US want to define away the US proletariat via surplus-value alchemies, or by pointing out various opportunisms or reactionary views held by this or that strata. The truth that the proletariat exists in the US, but is politically weak and dominated with bourgeois ideology, is painful to people who imagine a revolution to be a year or two around the corner. But that is the truth, and it doesn\u2019t change at all the necessity of organizing the proletarians and developing them into the class-conscious proletariat that they must be.",

The OP is asking about the extension of the concept after Lenin and its historical applications, you haven't added anything by defining it away with a crude definition that begs the question (what does it mean to have \"no choice?\" That is exactly what is being discussed except you have turned it into a subjective decision rather than a position in the totality of capitalist reproduction).",

You do not own land (or enough to reproduce yourself), you do not own means of production, you only own your labor-power which you sell to the capitalist. There is more nuance to it than that - for example, a doctor may not possess land or means of production but plays a petty bourgeois role in social reproduction, as an overseer within a capitalist hospital. But the compulsion towards wage-labor is the main aspect",

As I already said, you've simply explained the concept as subjective (the domination of bourgeois ideology) and haven't engaged with Lenin's concept of bribery at all.",
