            "body": "\n*** \n\nModerating takes time. You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "OP, the most singularly consistent piece of advice that any long time user of this subreddit will correctly give to you (or anyone who comes in here asking if X party is good) is that you shouldn't join an organization calling itself communist unless you coherently understand their political line, and can evaluate that this is *the actual communist party,* and not a bunch of revisionists calling themselves communists.  Joining a revisionist organization is actually more harmful to communism than doing nothing at all; there's a dozen or more revisionist orgs to any one actual communist party that takes this seriously, and the only worthwhile lesson you will get out of one of these will be witnessing the failure of revisionist politics in practice (at the cost of your time, your labour, your energy, your enthusiasm, your principles, and even your ability to think in a Marxist revolutionary way).  Also remember that you are joining this group of people to organize the forcible overthrow of the present state of things; the primary function is not as a social club and the parties that behave as if that were the case are the ones that get filled with sex-pests and predators.  If you aren't yet able to evaluate whether or not an organization is revisionist, then you should instead spend the time reading and learning until you become capable of doing so; at which point you will be able to answer yourself whether or not you are joining *the actual communist party.*",

I should have been more specific in my post - rather than advice about their political line, I was seeking information about their history, their inter-party and intra-party dynamics, and if there have been any scandals.\n\nWhat parties in the US (or internationally) do you take to be \"the actual communist party?\"",

Like we all can agree that older Lenin was right about using *some* things from capitalism to help stimulate economies, and it can work, but it has to be from the orthodox Marxist viewpoint though. I think they lose the bigger picture bc of that; they try to be more \"*palatable*\" to socialists lite/social democrats. It's hard to educate normies on Marxism bc of our lifelong capitalist programming :/",

From the standpoint of science, there are only parties of the proletariat which materially advance the world revolution, and revisionist parties which do not; an organization which \"could be worse\", but in fact has a counter-revolutionary line, is as bad as its gets (though the precise character and logic of their revisionism/opportunism would need to be revealed through investigation). Needless to say, a Trotskyist (read: liberal) party can never be revolutionary: how, then, can it be \"good\"?",
