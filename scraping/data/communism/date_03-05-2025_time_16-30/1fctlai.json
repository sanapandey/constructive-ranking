You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "Because Somalia was a bourgeois state that believed their irridentist claim over the Somali region was correct. The OAU on the other hand saw this (correctly) as right-wing nationalism, the invasion was defeated, and the Barre government dropped any pretense of being a \"Marxist-Leninist\" government in the aftermath. This set a chain of\u00a0events in motion wherein Somalia\u00a0became a US client state/debt puppet, leading to civil war and the eventual utter breakdown of the state\u00a0apparatus in the 90s.\u00a0\n\n\nUnfortunately youre gonna get a lot of responses to this from \"anti-revisionists\" who still believe Barre was some covert Maoist and that actually it was fine to invade Ethiopia over a land dispute that could've been settled peacefully.",

The social-imperialist Soviet Union, seeing an opportunity to establish a strong foothold in the region, shifted its support to Ethiopia.\n\nCuba, as a Soviet colony, participated in several conflicts in Africa, serving Soviet interests through military interventions. The Ogaden War was one of the most prominent examples of this, as thousands of Cuban soldiers were deployed to the region to bolster Ethiopia's defenses. The intervention ultimately secured Ethiopia's control over the Ogaden region, further solidifying Soviet influence in the Horn of Africa.",
