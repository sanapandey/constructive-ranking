You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

Though even when the questions are legitimate, it still feels like it would make more sense for them to ask them in public so other people get use out of them. I'm not really sure.",

            "body": "A curious and mind-numbing exchange on r/RevDem got me thinking about the backwards and opportunist way that fascists will describe \"imperialism\". One user referred to fascists and nazis as \"the people actually talking about imperialism\", which really crystallized with me how these people, despite having claimed to have read Lenin, think of \"imperialism\" as simply \"America having brown people in it\" or \"America being involved in foreign affairs\", rather than the all-encompassing primarily economic system in existence today. I have noticed this trend in other fascist spaces too, with \"anti-imperialism\" being used to describe \"America First\" foreign policy. (Interestingly enough, the same user also said that Democratic Kampuchea was a better example of anti-imperialism than the USSR, which highlighted to me how deeply warped the concept of the national question is, while also being primary to their ideology).\n\nWhat I am really interested in is when exactly this ideology came around. Obviously these fascists don't *actually* wish for an end to imperialism, as their closest allies - American and European white supremacists - bitch and moan about America and Europe respectively becoming \"third-world nations\" and strive more than anything else to increase plunder from the third world. But when did this crude anti-imperialism as code for white nationalism first come around? Is this a trend offline, or is it simply a confused online ideology?\n\n(Paging u/urbaseddad and u/red_star_erika.)",

This person also told me that the best way to work for the international proletariat from an imperialist country is to tell white nationalists that communism supports white nationalism, so that even though they benefit materially in every way from capitalism, they might be \"swayed to the communist position by seeing they agree on this point\". So I guess that explains how these people think - the question of class, to them, is subsumed by the question of nationalism. Forget Lenin saying that only nationalism *of the oppressed nations* has a place in the socialist struggle, forget Mao's distinction between Japanese and German nationalism and Chinese nationalism, forget MIM's writings on what happened to the \"German nation\" after Hitler was defeated. We should be going around telling the Proud Boys that ackshully, even though they're labor aristocrats, communism would be in their benefit because at least they'd have white tenants in their white communities. (This user also told me that anti-imperialism meant \"not being a class reductionist\". Funny how, no matter how much they hate the Queer Freak Revisionist Leftists, they still parrot their exact rhetoric, except for straight white families rather than trans bodies-of-color.)\n\n>MIM Prisons doesn't want a multinational U.S. like Maoist China.\n\nThis is a direct quote from this user. I wonder why these people claim \"communism\" if they don't even support Maoist China or Lenin/Stalin's USSR.\n\nAnd a particularly funny proclamation from their comment history:\n\n>Non-white nations in these countries (they're talking about Amerika, England, and Australia) exploit white nations in European countries.\n\nIt's a curious inversion of the \"meme socialism\" too common in online leftist spaces, one that occurs when one approaches phony \"communism\" as an ex-channer instead of an ex-Tumblr user. Instead of rejecting the labor aristocracy thesis, they accept it wholesale... and use it as justification for their predetermined metaphysical obsession with \"nation\" (read: hating the fact that some Black people live in their neighborhood) at the expense of all actual communist theory (did Mao support white South Afrikans? white Israelis? did *any* communist writers believe that \"nation\" was an immutable characteristic that just naturally causes people to burn churches, push for mass deportations, and churn out endless fatbergs of racist wojak memes?)\n\n(Before anyone asks why I'm posting it here - I guess to offer an interesting look into the mind of another confused fascist, and also just because, sadistically, I don't want to give this user the pleasure of thinking that his ideas can go unmocked.)\n\nEdit: Wow, this user also said that u/red_star_erika \"supports a white communist party\" and that Stalin and Lenin are revisionists for allowing private property in the early stages of the DotP. I think it's time for me to go play some chess or something more productive than trying to sort out this insane e-ideology.\n\nEE before I stop looking through this guy's posts for shock humor:\n\n>Mass immigration needs to be opposed because it's non-class oppression on the host nation. Supporting it is an extreme form of vulgar Marxism/crude materialism. The Native Americans were largely replaced in the name of materialism to build capitalism in North America. And now it's happening to Europeans to basically build communism by lowering the labor aristocracy's wages through immigration, which probably won't work anyway.\n\n>We give the masses too much credit. As a whole, most people are selfish assholes, which is why the labor aristocracy exists.\n\n> In imperialist countries you serve the people by trying to prevent their lives becoming worse with authentic nationalism and materialism.\n\nI think that about sums up the quality of thought that these \"EuropeanSocialists\" are capable of.",

It is only sad that they have appropriated the names of those subreddits, though r/communism really seems to be the exception as there appeared to have been at some moment in time a line struggle that oriented this subreddit to be one of the only few not to degenerate into a cesspool.\n\n\nTangentially though, their thesis sounds similar to talking points of any fascist movement that manages to organically develop in some locality. Marcos for instance served U$ Imperialism but in rhetoric would claim otherwise as seen here:\n\nhttps://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1978/06/12/ferdinand-e-marcos-thirteenth-state-of-the-nation-address-june-12-1978/\n\n\n>None cannot but glory at the significance, political and otherwise, of the events not only today but in the last five-and-a-half years. For the first time the Filipino people are truly sovereign over their land. After almost 500 years, for the first time in our history, no foreign colonizer holds any right of sovereignty over any part of our territory.\n\n>Barely a month ago, the American government formally recognized the supremacy of our sovereignty over the military bases.\n\n>We celebrate, therefore, our day of independence with an act of freedom. We have organized the government in accordance with the Constitution, which was formulated and ratified at the instance and with the mandate of our people without the intervention of a foreign power. We adopt a form of government completely derived from all the others that we have known, a mixture of the presidential and parliamentary forms of government.\n\n\nJust funny that in the same speech you have this line:\n\n>Dominating our foreign policy agenda are our trade and security negotia\u00adtions with the United States, our trade treaty negotiations with Japan, and the increasing number of decisions we are called upon every day to make with our partners in ASEAN.\n\n>With the United Stales, what is involved is the review of a historic relation\u00adship that has grown in war and in peace; and the searching question above all is how long and under what terms, shall we allow American forces to make use, if at all, of our military bases in Clark and Subic, among others. In the matter of trade, we are anxious to find out how well disposed the United States is in giving our products equitable treatment, and how willing it is to remove tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade.\n\nThat is to say that though those eurofascists represent the cesspool of the internet, the fascist seed that leads to their organic formation is a real threat. The Philippine nation for instance stands as a progressive force in history, but the usage of nationalism to justify state violence is still a very real thing.",

They are closely monitoring the developments of the new  \ngovernment, which is heavily reliant on the US and the West. However, after the government was  \nestablished, China felt some relief and, after a waiting period, also extended its congratulations to  \nthe new leadership.\n\n>In contrast, Hasina\u2019s masters, the Indian expansionists, are reacting strongly to her ousting. They  \nhave provided refuge to the fleeing Hasina and are conspiring with her on the next steps. India has  \ndeclared a near state of war along the border. They have been shedding crocodile tears over the  \nalleged extermination of Hindus and are attempting to incite communal riots. These actions are  \nintended either to stage a counter-coup against the new rulers through their agents, to secure their  \nown interests, or to pressure the opposition into compromising. They have already congratulated  \nDr. Yunus as part of these efforts.\n\nBy this it would seem that the interests of the Indians and US imperialism are at odds. This is rather unbelievable given that the Indian big bourgeoisie tails the US imperialists in almost everything it does. And US has a huge role in guiding its policy for its neghbours. Further, Indian fascists' claims of Hindu persecution in Bangladesh seems more to further its own agenda inside the country rather than flame communal tensions in Bangladesh.

Towards that end, they're highlighting the Indian state congratulating the neoliberal Yunus.\n\nA very crude view, but I see this more like the US stepping in and taking the reins from India for poor management.

For instance, during the first farmers' protest, the government ran with the idea of farmers being misled by Canadian forces, which in reality alluded to the Sikh diaspora there. So the anti-west rhetoric there was not really anti-west. However, the LGBTQIA+ issues were labelled as \"western\" (even in courts) due to it having a majorly petty-bourgeois backing (not to say that they are not oppressed).\n\n>how does the West's (especially the US) increasing 'concern' (aka thoughts and prayers) for India's human rights violations play?\n\nThese i feel are nothing but publicity stunts taken on from time to time as RUPE highlighted to course correct the indian big bourgeoisie. When Indian leadership went to Russia during the NATO summit recently, the human rights violation talk by the us was again highlighted by The Hindu newspaper. And as such, frankly nobody except a select section of the petty-bourgeoisie care about these - the real agenda seems to be spooking the foreign investors who are prone to immediate capital flight.\n\nAfter all, the indian state's method of anti-insurgency right from telengana days are copied from us imperialism so its not like it could be anything else - especially when us, even if not involved directly in some areas, keeps close tabs (for instance, in a leaked communication to the us some official from india had admitted that manipur was but a colony of india rather than its state).\n\n>Where can I look for a deeper analysis of this relationship between US imperialism and Indian Brahmanical Hindutva fascism?\n\nI am only aware of RUPE who have highlighted this issue wrt rights violations as negotiation tactics. They have one more issue on democratic rights which does not concern india's international relations unfortunately. You could contact them for further readings on the subject however. The editor does get back.",

            "body": "I'm curious of the thoughts about the application of Mass line and Study of Two Line struggle in the Sciences. As Science does have a class character and under the current Stage(Monopoly Capitalism) it is Hindered while it shall thrive under socialism.\n\n\nAnd if you're skeptical about the class character of science Read \"Dialectical Materialism and Science\" by Cornforth\n\n\n**Dialectical Materialism and Science** by Maurice Cornforth https://redstarpublishers.org/Cornforth.pdf\n\n\n> Firstly, there is the organisational side. [...]\u00a0science has\u00a0developed into a great social institution, so it has fallen more and more\u00a0under the control of the great monopolies and of the imperialist state\u00a0machine. Science has become subject to the dictates of the capitalist\u00a0monopolies in their scramble for profits and drive to war.\u00a0This means that the very organisation of science under monopoly\u00a0capitalism carries with it the disorganisation of science, the frustration\nof science, and its distortion into those directions demanded by the\u00a0interests of the monopolies. Scientists as individuals become the servants of monopoly capitalism, have to work as the monopolies direct,\u00a0and are subject to all the economic and political hazards of capitalism in\u00a0its declining days.\n\n\n\n\n> Secondly, there is the aspect of the internal, theoretical crisis of\u00a0science \u2013 the crisis of scientific ideas. The essence of this crisis in all\u00a0fields is precisely that stated by Engels \u2013 \u201cthe conflict between the\u00a0discoveries made and the old traditional modes of thought\".\u00a0The great achievements of bourgeois science, its penetrating\u00a0analysis of nature, its discoveries of the interconnections of natural\u00a0processes and of their laws of movement, have come into collision with\u00a0its traditional modes of thought \u2013 its narrow mechanism and empiricism. The further theoretical development of science demands, as\u00a0Engels put it, the dialectical synthesis. But this would be to carry theory\u00a0far beyond the limits imposed on it by the bourgeois outlook. Hence the\u00a0crisis of ideas in science.\n\n\n\n\n> Thirdly, with the triumph of socialism in the Soviet Union, and\u00a0with the division of the world into its socialist and capitalist sectors, the\u00a0crisis of bourgeois science begins to assume the aspect of the conflict of\u00a0two trends of science - of science in the capitalist world and of science\u00a0in the socialist world. The trend of science subjugated to monopoly\u00a0capitalism is opposed by the trend of science planned and organised in\u00a0the service of the people. Bourgeois science is opposed by Soviet science, guided by the ideas and methods of dialectical materialism.\n\n\nI think there's also something to think about Bourgeois ideology and being \"unbiased.\" My main example that I'm thinking about is Grover Furr who is great with Stalin era Soviet History yet also says he's \"unbiased\" when this is impossible in class society and you will be brought into 1 of ideology of a class based upon your material conditions and social relations and class struggle, that being either the Proletariat or Bourgeoisie.",
