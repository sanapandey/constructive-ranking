    "selftext": "In one of the greatest propaganda gifts \"israel\" could have provided to the cause of armed Palestinian Resistance, they released drone footage showing Yahya Sinwar's final moments before his death. He died sitting upright in a chair, fighting till his very last breath. This was after him and other fighters repelled cowardly IOF ground troops who resorted to tank strikes to murder Sinwar.\n\nThis reminds me of people who talk about Chairman Gonzalo's speech from the cage , which was meant to humiliate him but only served as an immortal reminder of courageous resistance. Since I wasn't alive to see that, this is probably how that moment felt. Maybe \"israel\" thought this would be some sort of symbolic win for them, except it utterly failed. There is no better piece of media that can rally the Palestinian People and the armed struggle.\n\nLong Live the Palestinian Resistance,\n\nLong Live Palestine.",

Hamas might be the largest, best armed and most organized group that makes up the resistance there, but it's not the only one, and they probably figured Sinwar, being in Gaza, had very high chances of dying or being caught, so contingency plans are likely in place for that situation. I believe that even in the event that Hamas and every other organization there becomes unable to fight, not much would change (in the sense that the IOF would likely keep employing the same MO). Resistance groups appear almost spontaneously in Occupied Palestine as an answer to Zionist violence and expansionism coupled with the complete impossibility of even a political compromise. Iran and Hezbollah aren't going away anytime soon, either. Despite all the talk about a \"diplomatic\" and \"humanitarian\" solution, the only way for Israel to put an end to their troubles there is to displace (or outright murder, as they seem happy to do) everyone from Gaza and permanently occupy it, either by settling there and making it a part of \"israel\" or by setting up checkpoints and institutions of repression like in the West Bank, the latter of which has shown itself to be a rather unsustainable strategy. In any case, I don't think the assasssination of Sinwar will really alleviate the pressure the Zionists face. They will likely stay in a downward spiral of violence and depravity as they have been for the last year. I might be completely misreading the situation, but the situation doesn't seem favorable to the Zionists, despite all of their illusory \"victories\".",

Admitting that there is a dialectical relationship between _settler violence_ and the _emancipatory violence_ of the colonized implies that upholding the \"right to life\" of both of them at the same time does not make any sense. What would the \"right to life\" even mean once this is acknowledged? My assumption was that the concept of \"human rights\" are presumed to be universal so they should be \"applicable\" to two class bases, both of which have violently antagonistic class interests at a given them. How do you uphold the right to life of the both at the same time without ignoring reality?",
