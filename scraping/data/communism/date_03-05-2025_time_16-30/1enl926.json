It reads like a call for a deformed yankee version of the Oslo accords or something. But still, I\u2019m glad someone in Cosmonaut circles is at least attempting to discuss this. They\u2019ve also published some pieces surprisingly sympathetic to the theory of unequal exchange  so maybe not all hope is lost?",

This model is rejected here, as it is doubtful the language of \u201cnational\u201d liberation accurately reflects the \\*self-\\*understanding of colonized and racialized peoples inside the settler capitalist state, who do not necessarily orient their struggles against that state in the language or practice of \u201cnational\u201d liberation. There is a further concern that in describing such struggles as \u201cnational\u201d liberation, we are limiting \u2013 not just theoretically but practically \u2013 our understanding of them to a particularly European conception of political association and relationship to land, if not imposing this conception onto non-European peoples.^(46)\n\nHe cites: 46. Rowland Keshena Robinson, \u201cMarxism, Coloniality, \u2018Man\u2019, & Euromodern Science,\u201d *The Spectral Archive* (blog), August 28, 2019, https://onkwehonwerising.wordpress.com/2019/08/28/marxism-coloniality-man-euromodern-science/.\n\nHere's a bit that's relevant in the Keshena Robinson says in the article quoted,\n\n>This is a trap that Marxism\u2014despite all of the insight that it may contain about the exploitation of wage labour by capital, the value-form, imperialism, class struggle, the State etc.\u2014fundamentally cannot escape because of the eurocentric corruption in its roots, which ultimately causes it mistake a european vision for a \u201cscientific\u201d one, and one with an unqualified universal applicability which should supplant all other epistemological systems. And so yet again we return to the notion of the eurocentrism of particular universalities.\u00a0 Abstract universals as they are, with the global designs that they proffer, especially when rooted in something birthed at the heart of the modern/colonial/capitalist world-system, are inherently epistemically western and colonial (Mignolo 2012).\u00a0 This is a trap set by the fact that that this thing we call modernity is indelibly, ineluctably, and inescapably linked with the colonial order of things.\u00a0 It was out of needing to understand this trap, out of the context of the Latin American engagement with dependency theory and world-systems analysis, that Quijano coined the concept of the coloniality of power, illustrated its constitutive relationship to euromodernity, and linked it to the compound concept of modernity/coloniality in order to describe this twinned formation (2010; 2008).\n\nIf i understand the argument is, the 'nation' is a false abstract universal that assumes that all racialized and colonized peoples will go through the process of development modelled off western Europe.  Of course, I think it's important to combat the old-hat eurocentrist dogma that in colonizing India, England was inaugurating the transition from feudalism to capitalism, instead of \\[in reality\\] stunting the development of a native national bourgeoisie in favour of a comprador bourgeois-feudal alliance. I think OP and Robinson get confused, and identify the particular form capitalism has taken - settler-colonial capitalism in North America or semi-colonial semi-feudal in India - with \"national\" development in total. The logic is - \"if what you call 'progress' is colonialism I want nothing to do with it\" which makes sense except what they call progress isn't progress at all- the economies of indigenous reservations in North America are entirely dependent upon the Euro-Amerikan oppressor nation, they haven't been allowed to develop their own native industry. In rejecting an economy that makes native people dependent on Casinos, you end up rejecting the necessity of developing their own capacity for mechanized agriculture, large-scale industry to meet their own needs. Am I mistaken or reading into it?",

I find it really frustrating when people imply that the nation, or even politics itself, are purely European inventions. If we accept this premise then it completely undermines the author\u2019s proposed solution of treaty rights as this \u201cinorganically\u201d forces the concept of nationhood onto Indigenous societies. And this proposed partitioning of the US empire into indigenous and settler rump states does nothing to mitigate settler nationalism, instead it stokes it and revitalizes it. If the settlers are truly to be liquidated as a class then there can be no more treaties. Settler national identity must be abolished and political and economic power goes principally to all the indigenous nations occupied by the US. These are the preconditions for the solidarity that the author envisions",

I think it would have been so much more valuable for them to investigate concretely what that dialectic of class consciousness - objective and subjective conditions - looks like for Euro-amerikan workers. They could've showed how material conditions like homeownership, health benefits, salaries have changed in Euro-Amerika over the past few decades - and if they found that they have declined or will decline, they could explore how subjectively white workers might resolve that through either fascism or aligning themselves with oppressed nations. Instead they just kind of assert that white workers ought to re-negotiate treaties in order to turn themselves into proletarians, and that's it. Why should they?\n\nAlso i think the OP might be in the DSA's Marxist unity group.",

I think I've done a terrible job combatting it, giving a poor and messy defense of Marxism and confusing myself with a weak, dogmatic grasp of the national question. My main source of confusion is in trying to combat what the article brings up:\n\n>This model is rejected here, as it is doubtful the language of \u201cnational\u201d liberation accurately reflects the \\*self-\\*understanding of colonized and racialized peoples inside the settler capitalist state, who do not necessarily orient their struggles against that state in the language or practice of \u201cnational\u201d liberation.

We have to prove that oppressed nations really are that - nations in processes of being annihilated/integrated or resisting. In order to do that we have to go back to the fundamentals. We can\u2019t just look at nations like a checklist meeting Stalin\u2019s definition (has shared economy, language, culture, etc). We have to look at each nation in its development.\n\nHoward Adams wrote that the Metis nation, for ex, grew out of the mingling of Cree tribes and European settlers. Indigenous pre-capitalist economies of agriculture and buffalo hunting declined and became oriented around the fur-trade. And the Metis nation grew out of this conflict between the half-breed fur-traders and the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. So before there were scattered tribes without self-consciousness of themselves as Cree or Metis, which developed into a nation out of the oppression they faced by the HBC, they came to a new consciousness about their shared economy and culture.\n\nIt's hard to show people that nation as opposed to national minority, or radicalized or colonized accurately describes reality - and that self-determination as a nation is still the central task. Like even in the historical example of the Metis nation when it was engaged in fur-trading - they were dependent upon the oppressor nation for the almost everything, and they weren\u2019t able to develop as a nation by developing  their own native industry and agriculture on the basis of the knowledge they had accumulated up to that point. They were stunted. And when that happened their culture became ossified and Euro-Canadians, and native people themselves now look at their culture as a historical artifact, not living and breathing. It wasn\u2019t allowed to develop and flourish on their own terms. So it\u2019s hard to avoid the fascist implications of post-colonialism, because in India especially the fascists glorify this ossified form of \u201cculture\u201d and it serves the purpose of justifying continued underdevelopment by imperialism.",
