Not that I subscribed to Dengism in the first place, but I am still learning about imperialism, its political economy and what anti-imperialism actually is. The failure of Syrian Baathism, and the futile nature of 'socialism' that capitulates to capitalist market logic is what I am deriving from this recent development.\n\nWhat I am afraid of is the repercussions of this wrt Palestine and Lebanon. A US Envoy talked about how Syria's takeover weakens Hezbollah as well.",

                    "body": "We did our duty when it mattered. When Syrian was on the brink and the Western \"left\" was bullshitting about the opposition forces, including most \"anti-imperialists\" today, we said \"this is the reality of the situation now and the anti-imperialist choice is clear.\" If Venezuela was threatened by an invasion or a coup we would do the same thing for all our criticism. We were not delusional, like the Maoists fighting alongside ISIS and the CIA because 5 people called themselves anarchists among them. Or those people who decided Marxists shouldn't bother dealing with reality because it does not live up to the ideal. \n\nBut what happened since then? Clearly Syria became even more dysfunctional, the \"axis of resistance\" weaker, and those forces in the county who made the same choice then forced to go down with the sinking ship. I don't think the Syrian Communist Party will be invited into the new system. Without the ability to act independently as communists, the same thing will always happen because the forces of bourgeois nationalism are moribund. I don't take any joy in the events soon to happen and I think everyone was shocked how diseased the system was despite years of relative peace and military support from multiple major world powers. But it's hard to believe nothing could have been done in 11 years except hope Assad would become competent, either inside or outside the county. \n\nAlso I guess that person in the discussion thread who said the ceasefire deal Hezbollah signed was a surrender was right. This may be as eventful as the betrayal of Egypt under Sadat. The world recovered from that but not easily.\n\nE: from that other thread \n\n>Syrian Baathism is still the lifeline of the resistance in the Middle East. \n\nThen I guess we're screwed. People are allowed to make wrong predictions but why even be a Marxist if you don't believe you can impact reality through scientific thought. Anyone can look at a situation and decide which side is better or worse, that takes no special insight and, other than cultivating a Twitter following, is pretty worthless.",

                                    "body": "I would argue that the axis of resistance centered around Iran filled the void left by Egypt and Arab Nationalism and that they could not coexist in the same space. I prefer secular nationalism but there's no point lamenting what was over what is, history is always retroactively determinate. Arab nationalism was doomed to fail because it did, the owl of Minerva has flown. On the other hand, something new had to emerge because capitalism will always generate its own gravediggers, in this case mere existence for the Palestinian nation makes Zionism impossible, which is too late to history to wipe them out.\n\nWe seem to be in a transitional moment where something new will replace the axis of resistance as well, although it will retain importance just like Syrian Baathism became important to a world where its ideological form was otherwise anachronistic. What will be the new form of resistance to the zionist regime? Obviously it's hard to say but, just for thought, the impact of the Houthis on global capitalism is remarkable and much different than the national or even regional politics of the past. If the nation and nationalism are weakened, so too is capitalism much more vulnerable to disruption and precise attacks. This at least provides a novel strategy of resistance compared to neo-nonalignment, which has proven itself to be a failure. Putin's efforts in Syria are like a farce of the USSR's efforts in Afghanistan, where a real popular system was built that outlasted its collapsing patron. Assad was just a house of cards and Putin's efforts in Ukraine are sad compared to Soviet decisiveness in Eastern Europe.\n\n>ever since Camp David, because of which, normalizing Israel's existence has now become \"a mere difference of opinion\" (to quote Kanafani) and IDF and Zionist officials are now regularly hosted on the main pan-Arab TV channels to offer their \"perspective\".\n\nWell yeah, things are horrible. History is an accumulation of tragedies, especially in our age. The essential task is to find the revolutionary spark of hope in that refuse without self-delusion. Hard to find that after today's events but at least we can be proud that we did talk about this before and have been working through a theory of global revolutionary politics that escapes the dichotomy of multipolarity as a continuation of the march of the world towards communism led by Khrushchev's Soviet Union or supporting actually existing reactionary forces because they are what appears to be \"the masses\" and reality will work itself out if we wish hard enough. I'm glad someone referenced that thread on the communist party of Venezuela, saying \"Assad was corrupt, of course he was going to fall\" after it already happened is useless. When the same thing happened in Venezuela inevitably we'll still feel shocked, but our shock is different than the shock of revisionists who genuinely cannot comprehend the nature of dialectical contradiction in history.",

It takes the form of anti-imperialism while it does not have any of its real content. A comparison can be made with [German chauvinism](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/may/31.htm) during WWI:\n\n> The German papers write about the liberation movement in India with great gusto, malicious glee, delight and rapture. It is easy to see why the German Bourgeoisie is full of malicious joy: it hope to improve its military position by fanning the discontent in the anti-British movement India. [...] The falsehood of the German chauvinists has its roots in their shouting their sympathy for the independence of the peoples oppressed by Britain, their enemy in the war, and modestly, sometimes much too modestly, keeping silent about the independence of the peoples oppressed by their own nation.\n\nDengism, or multipolarity if we want to use it as a synonym, is modern-day German chauvinism, it is the expression of aspiring imperialist countries, or countries that are huge reserves of imperialism in their own right. This is why its vanguard has roughly coincided with BRICS. Replace \"German papers\" with RT News, ~~Red Fish~~ or any of the other dozens of media outlets with similar political lines; it is not hard to find Russian, Chinese and Brazilian outlets parading national liberation overseas, but turning a blind-eye to their country's presence in Ukraine, the Central African Republic, Laos, the Philippines, Vietnam, Haiti, Paraguay and Angola.\n\nEdit: the striked part has been highlighted by u/urbaseddad as incorrect in a series of comments down below.",

Deindustrialization fearmongering is the ongoing cornerstone of reformism (although I\u2019m not able to see right now where the jump from one to the other is being made), but there is substantial discussion of how much deindustrialization is there really: it is assumed due to the low exports of manufactured goods and reduced participation in GDP; but when data comparing employment, total production and share of high technology manufactured goods, it has remained steady or grew from the 90s. If anything, it sounds more like panic from the white petty bourgeoisie, traumatized by the initial shocks of the Washington Consensus and the possibility of ALCA, although they are the ones that will benefit from this in the long run. All of this reminds of me some meetings I had with URC, where they tried their best to prove Brazil was the equivalent of the Philippines, but in order to do so had to disregard that the latter does not even have its own steel industry, while the former is one the world's largest producers of steel, and has the technological know-how of making oil rigs, nuclear submarines, ships, airplanes, weapons and obsolete semi-conductors. If the deal was so destructive to industry, CNI would be the biggest banner of protectionism we would\u2019ve ever seen (Rafael Lucchesi is the closest to a \u201cnational\u201d, \u201canti-imperialist\u201d bourgeoisie there is due to his open attacks against neoliberalism, and he is all in on the deal), instead, they are openly embracing it because Brazilian industry requires more markets, as well as modernization of its outdated production lines to save them from their profitability crisis created by Chinese competition. Following European reaction on reddit has also been interesting. Cheap meat aside, they are terrified of cheaper Brazilian parts destroying medium-sized factories.",

We were not delusional, like the Maoists fighting alongside ISIS and the CIA because 5 people called themselves anarchists among them.

I mean when you talk about 'the anti imperialist choice is clear' do you mean what you said in that thread wrt to Venezuela and other 'antiimperialist countries', that we cannot blindly 'support' these governments anymore because national bourgeoisie or whatever. Or are you talking about the fact that communists opposed the narrative that supported the coup against the assad government?\n\nAlso, what is the context for the 'maoists fighting alongside isis and cia'?

I understand probably these people themselves have adopted fascistic politics, through ISIS propaganda or whatever, but the issue I'm facing here is still what I mentioned; I don't know how to address this more broadly.

This is the same thing as people talking about \u201cCubans in Miami\u201d as a source for information on Cuba. The simple fact is, the people who support a government or social system are the people who stay there, and the people who choose to leave are more likely to be the ones that oppose it. This is true of socioeconomic classes and other political forces. So it\u2019s nonsense to say \u201cSyrians who live somewhere said such and such\u201d. WHICH Syrians? There are progressive Syrians and reactionary Syrians.\n\nSyria has been divided since its emergence as an independent state between the progressive secularists (including Baathists, Nasserists, socialists and communists), and reactionary religious conservatives beginning with the Muslim Brotherhood types and all their various odious political descendants. These elements have ALWAYS been in conflict with each other. The Ba\u2019ath Party has kept the reactionary forces under control for the last half century, but unfortunately now the reactionary forces have obtained the upper hand and destroyed Syria.\n\nThe whole Middle East has been trending in a negative direction since the 1970s as Saudi-sponsored fundamentalism has grown, the Soviet bloc has fallen (removing a crucial worldwide counterweight to reaction in general), and the US has had nearly untrammeled power to crush anything remotely progressive in the region and, since the US created the mujahideen terrorists in Afghanistan in the 1970s, the US has been able to wield this kind of terrorism as a weapon against progressive forces in the Muslim world.\n\nEven if the Syrian Ba\u2019ath Party had been perfect and done everything right (which unfortunately it was not and did not; ever since Hafez died the Syrian Ba\u2019ath Party has trending in a more compromising and less ideologically principled direction, which is why they failed to nip this clusterfuck in the bud the instant the takfiri cancer reared its ugly head in 2011), the odds were still stacked horribly against them. Progressive Syrians fought bravely and heroically for years and years after the dirty war started in 2011, and liberated most of their country at immense cost. So it\u2019s not like they did nothing or weren\u2019t there. Syria could have won. But it would have required decisive action from a government that was completely committed to its course. Like in 1982 when Hafez crushed the last terrorist revolt in Hama with ruthless efficiency, saving Syria for another 4 decades. But this time that will just wasn\u2019t there in the top leadership.\n\nIt\u2019s horrible, and now the Syrian progressive forces will pay a terrible price. So will the people of the wider region, especially Lebanon and Palestine.\n\nNow the Syrian reactionaries will likely return home and the Syrian progressives will be the ones exiled abroad.",
