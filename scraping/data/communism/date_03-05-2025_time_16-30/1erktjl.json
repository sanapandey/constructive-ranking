    "selftext": "I'm still very new to marxism but from what I've been reading I feel like for socialism to eventually be successful one day there needs to be a greater focus on internationalism and not building up socialism in a singular country as the failings of the previous century have simply shown us that socialism in isolation is heavily prone to capitalist reconstruction/propaganda and external capitalist threats that lead to coups as happened across the global south. \n\n  \nThis is the view that I have formulated currently but I'd appreciate if someone that is more versed in Marxism could give me a better analysis of the movements of the previous century and why they failed if it wasn't SIOC per se.\n\n  \nThanks in advance ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Communism cannot be achieved in one country, as a state will have to exist as long as the capitalist mode of production exists anywhere else in the world but socialism obviously can or else the success of revolution would be impossible, except if it happened simultaneously everywhere or if it were exported all over the globe immediately afterwards. Both of these hypothesis have been proven unfeasible by history, only trotskites and leftcoms still believe in these fantasies because they have no actual desire to make revolution.",

                    "body": ">The opposing lines that developed in the Russian Communist Party were broadly about whether the Soviet Union should pursue a modest pace of industrialisation to raise living standards and strengthen the basis of the proletarian dictatorship in anticipation of new revolutions in Western Europe (the Left Opposition's platform); or try to go full-steam ahead and pursue the rapid development of heavy industry, complete collectivisation/socialisation of agriculture, abolition of private property, wage-labour and money, etc (Stalin).\n\nThis is wrong. The left opposition supported immediate industrialization right after the end of the civil war via militarization of labour (by creating labour armies and instituting military discipline for workers) and other measures that would turn 1920s USSR into Pol Pot's Cambodia. The reason you have this rose tinted view of Trotsky's platform is because after he got expelled from the USSR he started painting himself as a democrat and fighter against bureaucracy even though while he was at the peak of his political career he was the biggest supporter of a bureaucratic form of rule. This constant lying is even where the russian phrase \"\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0422\u0440\u043e\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439\" (lying like Trotsky) comes from.\n\n>The latter was what was attempted historically, and while it achieved many successes, ultimately the USSR always lagged behind the capitalist countries, and it was only achieved at the cost of numerous economic disasters, huge growth in bureaucracy, famine, super-exploitation, and the political unrest and repression that followed.\n\nEconomic disasters? The USSR was the fastest-growing economy in the world from the 1930s to the 1950s until Khruschev's economic reforms nearly destroyed the country (it got so bad that once among the biggest exporters of grain in the world, in 1963 the USSR started to import grain!). As for the other points I have no comment since there have been hundreds if not thousands of threads regarding this. Instead of reading Trotsky, read actual archives, many of which have been declassified after the collapse of the USSR.",
