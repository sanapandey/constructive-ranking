    "selftext": "I recently made a post on the [internationals](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1dhojt0/history_of_the_three_internationals/), and I have found a text from George Novack and Jacob Zumoff. Novack's is a broader history of all three, but the issue I find is that it is quite Trotskyist. Half of what it analyzes from the Comintern is that there was insufficient leadership from the organization due to Stalinist bureaucratization and socialism in one country. Similarly, in Zumoff's analysis, from just the introduction it seems he. is also coming after Stalinist policies for the downfall of the Comintern. I am far from a Stalinist, but I am extremely weary of anti-Stalinist sentiment, especially when coming from Trotskyist perspectives. This is not a claim that their analysis is wrong, but there is a part of it I do not trust. I might be wrong on this. Does anyone know the relationship between Stalin and the Comintern, or even Stalin on the national question, that does not purely bash it? Or at least texts that offer a fair assesment of it? Zumoff's text might be more fair than Novack's, but I have an instinctual distrust when everything bad about the Soviet Union is Stalin's fault. I have seen posts on here that are critical of Trotsykist PR critiques of socialism in one country as idealist, so I wonder if there are some people that know more about Stalinist international policy with the Comintern.",
