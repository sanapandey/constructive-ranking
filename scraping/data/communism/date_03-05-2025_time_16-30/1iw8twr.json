You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "This question is all wrong; it's like asking if water wouldn't boil if it wasn't on fire. One could just say \"no\" and list out all the exceptions they could think of, but that's exhausting and the questioner would be advantaged a great deal more if one were to simply explain to them what fire is, what heat is, and what happens when water is heated on the atomic level; after which the question practically answers itself. It would not do to simply state that pressure cookers exist since this does not interrogate the framework of the question and leaves the questioner to the wolves of idealism/mechanical materialism; they might just shrug and decide that fire and water and pressure are atomistic entities and that's just what they do. Your own misunderstanding is even worse since at least the connection between fire and the phenomenon of boiling in water are at least somewhat close; your question would be like asking if water wouldn't boil without a kettle...\n\nI'll try to rephrase the question for you. **What does it mean for communism to die?** That is to say, looking at \"the history of all hitherto existing society [as] the history of class struggles\" as one finds in the first line of the *Communist Manifesto*, what does it mean for communism to die within the framework of class struggle being the prime determinant of the movement of history? Obviously saying \"the class struggle was lost\" isn't what you're looking for but it is at that point that my expertise runs dry. It would be better if I just linked a couple of threads that will help clear up the issue (read the entire thread in each case):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1isavwn/how_the_cold_war_slowed_down_soviet_economic/mdfio79/ (to correct the core mistake)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1igs715/why_dont_african_nations_not_just/maturxr/ (an answer)\n\nThis document by RIM as well might be helpful:\n\nhttps://www.bannedthought.net/International/RIM/AWTW/1988-10/AWTW-10-BurkinaFaso.pdf (an answer x2)\n\nThough the first thread is probably most critical for the stage you are at.",

That's not a matter of \"...think[ing] it through with different perspectives,\" and you probably know this because you know that that is a scientific question that can be explained scientifically. You obviously do not think of history in this way, and are tackling this like a /r/whowouldwin thread. I guess the west's power level was just too high or something.\n\n> you are implying that capitalists intervening and shutting down communism is a naturally given process as water vaporizing by heat which is simply not correct since water naturally vaporizes even at temperatures as low as 10\u00b0C.\n\nWhat are you talking about? I brought up heat with relation to the fire being used to boil the water. A pressure cooker would seem to be the spontaneous generation of heat unless you were aware of the particle theory of matter. Water vaporizing at low temperatures would be an even better example of what I was saying since it would prove that heat (or the lack of it) are not atomistic concepts either.\n\nThe rest of the comment is hard to parse. If I'm being generous, you're saying that since water naturally vaporizes at low temperatures, that heat is not necessary to vaporize water (why stick to the colloquial definition of \"heat\" here? maybe you're assuming I didn't know?). Then you're assuming that I'm comparing heat to capitalist intervention, and then you're saying that capitalist intervention is not actually naturally occurring, since communism has sustained itself for a while in \"indigenous cultures\" (Why not say \"societies\"? What do you mean by \"communist\"? Which ones? What is the point of even bringing up \"natural\"? Marxists study the movement of society; it is all \"natural\"). Or are you saying that external capitalist intervention is not the only way that communism can die? In any case, that's not the comparison I'm making at all - I said your comment was \"all wrong\" because your entire approach to understanding the world is wrong; the example of the fire and water was an example of a scenario in which someone not familiar with the particle theory of matter might make the same error as you. You, similarly, are not used to thinking of \"the history of all hitherto existing society [as] the history of class struggles\" and therefore make a similar error. Can you read the first post I linked?",

                            "body": "Burkina Faso was a nationalist military junta regime, eclectically inspired by Marxism, but it did not establish any kind of democratic popular or socialist state.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, Thomas Sankara, in his coup d'\u00e9tat, suppressed all unions. He also persecuted and assassinated leaders of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Volta (PCRV-MLs).\n\nThe General Confederation of Labor of Burkina (CGTB) was created at its First Congress on October 29, 1988, but its work began with the Trade Union Front of Burkina Faso on October 28, 1985, an organization formed by the revolutionary line led, from the beginning, by the PCRV.\n\nThe Trade Union Front of 1985 aimed to clarify to workers that the problems of the working class would not be solved through a coup d'\u00e9tat carried out by Thomas Sankara, but only through a proletarian revolution, led by Marxist-Leninist ideology with the Communist Party at the forefront of the working class. For this reason, the unions affiliated with the Trade Union Front were actively persecuted by the government through the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), whose cohesion was maintained by the African Independence Party (PAI). In other words, Thomas Sankara was not aligned with the idea of a Leninist socialist revolution\u2014not just in words, but in deeds, as he persecuted revolutionaries and communist trade unionists.\n\nDuring the years of Thomas Sankara's rule, the CDRs were created. These were supposed to theoretically defend the \"revolution,\" but in practice, they did the opposite. The CDR was the main reactionary force within Thomas Sankara's government. It eliminated trade union leaders, shut down unions, captured and tortured PCRV militants\u2014such as Tol\u00e9 Sagnon\u2014and confiscated the party\u2019s pamphlets.\n\nNon-partisans of the \"national revolution,\" the PCRV's thesis was that the \"national revolution\" was a progressive path but insufficient to resolve the political and economic problems faced by the working class under capitalism. Therefore, the Sankarist \"revolution\" was nothing more than a democratic \"revolution.\"\n\nA Marxist revolution is primarily led by the working class through the vanguard party\u2014that is, the Communist Party, where Marxism-Leninism serves as the ideological guide for the revolution. We can say that Thomas Sankara was a patriot and a revolutionary fighter, but we cannot say that his rise to power was genuinely Marxist.\n\nThomas Sankara, historically speaking, can be seen as the \"African Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\" because both established a stronger relationship with the military of their respective countries. From a Marxist-Leninist perspective, this is incorrect in claiming that it was a proletarian revolution. From the standpoint of class struggle, the necessary and foundational bases of popular power were not established to build the political regime of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nAnd indeed, history confirmed what the PCRV had already warned the population about: Thomas Sankara was executed by Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who, due to the lack of Leninist practice, was not repressed by the dictatorship of the proletariat despite his reactionary actions.\n\nWhat has been said here also applies to any eclectically \"militarist\" experience that is supposedly socialist, such as Grenada \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde9, Myanmar \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf2, Nicaragua \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddee, and Venezuela \ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\uddea.\n\nNone of these were socialist or a people's democracy.\n\nhttp://averdade.org.br/2012/03/o-pcrv-e-a-revolucao-popular/;\n\nhttp://averdade.org.br/2015/02/nosso-desafio-e-avancar-o-processo-revolucionario-em-burquina-faso/\n\n http://www.pcrv.net/spip.php?page=pcrv-article&id_article=48\n http://thomassankara.net/le-syndicalisme-etudiant-dans-lhistoire-moderne-de-la-haute-volta-et-du-du-burkina/\n\nhttp://www.sidwaya.bf/m-2408-formation-syndicale-le-synatic-galvanise-ses-militants.html\n\nUse Google translate for these",
