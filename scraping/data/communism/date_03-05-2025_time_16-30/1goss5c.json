You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The conclusion of these \"Genes\" is that we must wait for the right Plants and Animals to evolve and we cannot direct the development of Organisms to suit our needs. It's ultimately a statistical Theory. To quote Lysenko(Fortuitous = Random, Chance):\n\n\n> \"Gene\" mutations, according to the theory of Mendelism-Morganism, appear fortuitously. Chromosome mutations are also fortuitous. Due to this, the direction of the process of mutation is also fortuitous. Proceeding from these invented fortuities, the Morganists base their experiments too on a fortuitous choice of substances that might act as mutation factors, believing that they are thereby acting on their postulated hereditary substance, which is just a figment of their imagination, and hoping to obtain fortuitously what may by chance prove to be of use.\n> According to this sort of \"science\" the development of an organism does not proceed on the basis of the selectivity of conditions of life from the environment, but again on the basis of the assimilation of substances fortuitously entering from without.\n> On the whole, living nature appears to the Morganists as a medley of fortuitous, isolated phenomena, without any necessary connections and subject to no laws. Chance reigns supreme.\n\n\nThough New Discoveries have Made Bourgeois Science change their conception of \"Genes\" a bit as now \"Genes\", while retaining the ideology of being \"units of heredity\", are conceived of as \"Bits of DNA\".\n\n\n> Is it not the case that they do not determine but condition evolution and heredity?\n\n\nDNA is information Storage yes and DNA does have a role in evolution and Heredity i don't deny that and neither did Lysenko(though he talked about chromosomes as DNA had yet to be discovered and I cannot find any English texts of his that discuss DNA(I suspect due to DNA being discovered in the 50s and that is the time of Stalins Death and Revisionists acquiring Power censoring stuff)).\n\n\n> When have I said or written that it is not necessary to study the membrane of the cell or the chromosomes? Who of us has said that it is not necessary to study the chromosomes?[...] No one of us has said or says that the chromosomes do not play a great biological role in heredity. But Morganism-Mendelism forbade studying the biological role of chromosomes. They transformed cytology into cyto-genetics, i. e. **instead of studying the cell as such, the Morganists reduced everything to the count and the morphology of the chromosomes alone.**\n\n\nToday's science is about the count and morphology of DNA Rather than about the life activity of Organisms in their environment.\n\n\n> Also can't genes be altered by environmental effects, even those in the germline?\n\n\nDNA can get altered by environmental affects but this is not the claim of Bourgeois Science. Their claim is merely that Epigenetics doesn't Change \"Genes\" Themselves but \"Gene Expression\" that a \"Gene\" may be turned \"on or off\" or can be set to some % active instead of Fully active. The \"Genes\" don't change just their expression.\n\n\n> These things are not so clear to me yet even after I read a long essay about the conflict between Lysenko's theories and bourgeois genetics.\n\n\nThey can be a bit confusing as New Discoveries by Bourgeois Science have changed the presentation and Claims a bit and language has changed a little bit Since Lysenko's Time. As well as there being no Scientists(as far as I have been able to find) that uphold Michurinism Today due to there being no Socialist State to Promote Science that is grounded in Practice and Serves the Proletariat.\n\n\nMay I ask what you have read on Lysenko and Michurinism? I do have a [post](https://www.old.reddit.com/user/Autrevml1936/comments/1e0i0ba/michurinism_texts/) on my account that has a bunch of Texts by Lysenko and Michurinist's if that helps.",

That is the product being sold. Sex workers would have worker protections, competitive wages, access to healthcare, retirement funds, and all the other things that were tied to typical employment.

That art, as dmshq pointed out, has turned into porn and even that is only a very small minority of porn is. The vast majority of it is for cishet people. Queer porn today, from what I've seen, has little connection to left-wing organizing. It's essentially just people retreating into consumerism.
