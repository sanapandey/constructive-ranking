This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking.

            "body": ">Simultaneously, the reproduction of imperialist culture in India and the idealisation of that lifestyle- which seemed achievable to the upper petty bourgeois and comprador sections, has led to an expanding marketplace for pet products within India, with a $77 million worth foreign investment in the sector being made as recently as 2022. The irony is that even brands such as Drools Pet Food, that prides itself on being the \u201cfirst Indian brand in a marketplace crowded by Western brands and imported products\u201d, is effectively owned by global moguls. For example, Drools is owned by LCatteron, a US based global player in the pet market, as the firm invested a huge $60 million in Drools.\n\nMany such cases\n\n>In bourgeois society, \u201canimal rights\u201d is used as a garb to hide the malevolent and exploitative nature of the dominating class by peddling projects that are aesthetically innocent- they seek to protect much loved \u201cfur babies\u201d. An example would be TenderLovingcare in Ohio prisons, where prison inmates train dogs for free- with money obtained for the same being diverted to pet-care, and not to the inmates\u2019 lives and advancement- that too in the country that claims the largest prison population in the world with a disproportionate racial representation of non-white persons, these racial minorities are the oppressed nationalities of USA like the New Afrikan and Chicano population. \n\nThis is pretty good for a student paper. I think about this relationship often, living in the imperial core with pet companionship/ownership so entrenched. I do not know enough, but I feel there's a ton to unpack psychologically about pet ownership - beyond what this paper discusses about the raw exploitation which seems similar to many industries.\n\nAlso, I googled the student and found this article: https://www.newslaundry.com/2024/02/16/an-absolutely-apolitical-space-why-jindal-university-suspended-two-students-this-week which may be of interest as well",

Once when i had asked members of an organisation who were being targeted continually as to how they had avoided major uapa charges up till now, and they said that national media would pick up the news and that acted as a temporary relief from being arrested (being detained is almost routine though). And if the students are organising, then the police must be already aware of them as student activism is heavily regulated and it becomes a such a routine affair that the local cops and students both know about each other. Sometimes, when a vip would show up to university campus, the regular student activists would receive calls warning them to stay away and preventive measures such as surrounding their houses in order to keep them detained there would be carried out. \n\n The circle of student activists is extremely limited in Delhi (the epicenter of revolutionary student politics) and if you discount the revisionist parties, almost everyone knows everyone else or else have at least heard of them, which makes it sort of an open-secret as to who is who.",

I'm not sure where to start in critiquing the idea but it is interesting to see the diffusion of what was (and still is for some) a rather intense fetish act becoming something of an identity and one that doesn't seem immediately marked by the logic of commodity identity. Similar to what the article points out,\n\n>Despite this cost effectiveness surrounding the dominance of petting, pet owners spend a lot of money, time, energy, and expend love and care to the animal. This is because pets also serve a purpose for them- to provide a comforting space in the alienation propagated by existing capitalist society. Where, due to the hyper competitive and resultantly, hyper-individualistic, human relations promoted by capitalism, people started substituting human relations that further alienated them in this structure, with relations with their pets- which were seen as \u201cpurer\u201d and free from the taint of capitalist competition.\n\nthe emergence of oneself becoming the \"pet\" seems to take the fetish of the pet and reflect it back on the subject. Note this also may indicate decay in the consumptive habits of the FW petty-bourgeois where owning even a pet comes a burden and the simply consuming the image of one becomes no longer fulfilling. This extends to being a furry as well given the costs of a fursuit, expenses for travelling to conventions, or even the price of commissioning art of one's sona. Obviously as mentioned by u/smokeuptheweed9 in the linked thread,\n\n>It's not just that pets can be disposed of when they shit the bed or bite you or smell, it's that these animal aspects are inevitable to pet ownership. The idealized form of pet ownership is producing and consuming images of pets, pets themselves will always fail to live up to the ideal of the commodity.\n\n(...)\n\n>As the article notes, the most terrifying thing would be to be in one's fursuit and be unable to perform after thousands of dollars and countless hours of emotional investment in one's character because the reality of sweat, low visibility, smell of artificial materials, and the incompatibility of one's character to the other person's character world cause the whole fantasy to crash.\n\nPeeing in a litter box or actually shitting one's bed as a pet would, only appeals to more of the hardcore fetishists and is typically not what is desired when one adopts the identity of \"dogboy\" or \"catgirl.\" Certainly it can lead to that, but really the main appeal seems, outside of immediately sexual terms, to be the escape from the threat of proletarianization where the \"pet\" is the embodiment of the safest form of declassing (i.e. an inversion of lumpenization, where existing outside of the process of production is desired, while still maintaining some structured existence in the form of rules and rewards). Seeing it as a fetish of lumpenization holds some interesting directions to explore, such as comparing it to the failure of the alt/punk identity to mystify \"living outside the system,\" being now an inescapable farce where there's hardly an attempt to hide its underlying petty-bourgeois desires.",
