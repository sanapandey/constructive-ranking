    "selftext": "Hi comrades, we ([Nobody Owns Land](https://www.nobodyowns.land/)) are currently in the process of editing a version of the 1965 book \"Lenin's Fight Against Revisionism and Opportunism\" which can be printed from any home printer and bound through perfect-binding for easy distribution by comrades anywhere. However, we've found that every PDF of this book online has (frustratingly) omitted the preface entirely and we can't find a copy for sale anywhere. We have found [this work on marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.secondwave/western-voice/critique.htm) which appears to quote the preface in its entirety, but we're hesitant to use it as we can't verify whether it's actually the unabridged preface or not.\n\nSo we thought to reach out here to see if anyone here might have access to a physical copy in order to verify that this is genuinely the full preface. Alternatively, if someone has access to a more complete PDF that would be incredible.",

            "body": "I haven't had any luck finding the English preface online besides the quoted version you linked.  However, the Chinese version of the book is available online.  It is titled \u300a\u5217\u5b81\u53cd\u5bf9\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3b\u4e49\u3001\u673a\u4f1a\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u6597\u4e89\u300b.  I skimmed through the Chinese text and the English text you linked side by side and they are mostly the same.  I noticed only very minor discrepancies that come down to the translator's style, like how\n\n>That was exactly what had happened.\n\nis its own paragraph in the Chinese version or how the \"failure\" in \n\n>After the failure of the Paris Commune in 1871\n\nis absent from the Chinese text.\n\nBut the one significant thing is that\n\n>Lenin led the struggle over strategy and tactics (which reflected a two-line struggle in the ideological sphere between the two classes) in all areas of the international working-class movement. The History of the CPSU [B] is one good work that can be used to explore these struggles, as well as the Cheng book. Also of use is the first chapter (in particular) of Thomson\u2019s From Marx to Mao Tse-Tung.\n\nis not part of the preface at all; it is part of the text that is quoting the preface.  In its place, the Chinese preface has a concluding paragraph that reads:\n\n>The following are the main historical situations in which Lenin opposed revisionism and opportunism.\n\nSo the English version you have is surely very close to what you would find in a hard copy of the book.  You're more or less safe to use it.  But it would be better if someone could scan the original preface.\n\nNow, my question for you is, why are you republishing this book seeing as it's already available for free online?  Wouldn't your time be better spent finding the preface, scanning it, inserting it into the existing scan and sending that to Banned Thought?  I have to say I'm sceptical looking at your website, I'm picking up \"content creator\" vibes.",

                    "body": "Thank you so much! This helps us immensely.\n\n>Now, my question for you is, why are you republishing this book seeing as it's already available for free online?\n\nA couple reasons: Firstly, in our organizing (which is principally among working-class tenants struggling to unionize and Black students) a consistent issue that has arisen in moving beyond basic political education has been the expense and availability of books, along with general dissatisfaction with reading digitized books. In our experience, folks found it difficult to read digital scans of books for a variety of reasons (size of screen, eye strain, quality of scan, lack of confidence with tech, etc.). Thus, we found it important to become familiar with methods for printing our own books, and this gained the additional utility of others being able to independently produce books for others they knew for relatively low cost. Secondly, in our eyes most existing groups have liquidated their ability to publish outside of the internet and lulu press (or other similar companies). To us, this is a troubling position to be in as the working-class struggle inevitably intensifies and repression of genuine revolutionaries by the settler-state becomes more acute. So developing and popularizing simple and cheap methods for formatting, printing, and binding books alongside pre-formatted anti-revisionist works is an obvious step to take in order to maintain its availability and preserve our ability to disseminate propaganda regardless of our access to the internet or formal presses.\n\n>Wouldn't your time be better spent finding the preface, scanning it, inserting it into the existing scan and sending that to Banned Thought?\n\nAs mentioned in our original post, one of the first things we did was look to purchase the book for ourselves, but none seem to be available. If we could find a physical copy, we would absolutely do this, [as we have the equipment for it and have put out scans of anti-revisionist books before.](https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=1402A4A09EB9257C8EDB38BDFBCB34FD) Regardless of how things turn out with our reproduction, if we can find the original and scan it we will absolutely send it to Banned Thought. As for whether our time would be better spent doing that, that would be the case if our mission were solely the preservation of information. While that is important to us, our mission also includes the physical reproduction and dissemination of that information, along with encouraging Marxist line struggle across Louisville organizing spaces. Getting the information out there isn't enough, it needs to physically get out into the streets and touch workers through worker-organizers who've connected with them deeply. So we feel this is worth the effort, as it was with other works we've already reproduced.\n\n>I have to say I'm sceptical looking at your website, I'm picking up \"content creator\" vibes.\n\nI don't blame you, there's way too much of that online already. To be perfectly honest I'm not sure how I can dispel that skepticism in a Reddit post, especially since as a new organization there's bound to be errors in our existing practice on and offline. All I can say is that our work was in the streets first, and online second. Most of us were given a baptism in fire in the early days of the protests against the killer cops who killed Breonna Taylor and would rather die than see another Black man, woman, or child murdered by cops and capitalism. We'll do our best to do right by our forebears and further the Communist Movement in Louisville and hopefully beyond. We welcome principled criticism along Marxist lines as the way we'll become better as an organization and as organizers.",

But in the above quote you mention difficulties with book scans being the fact they seem to be purely PDFs, hence the awkwardness and strain that comes with reading what is essentially an image of a page, versus pure encoded text. I'm still critical toward the idea of relying on printed texts, especially in the DIY realm, and most importantly in the age of EPUBs and digital book formats (not PDF scans), since printing comes with its own technical challenges (particularly with scaling) and really is more a fetishization of the past. \n\nI would suggest researching means of converting PDFs to EBUPs (or whatever similar format is needed) and training your cadre to be adept with the technology in general. That way you are able to utilize old (or new) *e-readers* which present solutions to those accessibility issues (text size rescaling to help with eye strain, and overall UI/X simplicity). For a brief overview, most PDF programs have some form of OCR (optical character recognition) and this is able to produce a text layer out of a scanned document. The method has existed for around a century and the current technology has been present for decades. There are programs out there that can convert PDFs to EBUPs using OCR but they all appear to require subscriptions or payment, so I won't endorse any specific one as I haven't tried them.\n\nHow/if you implement some program of distributing e-readers with a system for formatting and uploading *any* text to them along with training the masses to use them can only be decided through struggle but experimenting with this option will have more productive results than the oft suggested (and ultimately unimaginative), anarchist DIY zine/printing approach.\n\nIf you do decide to carry out this experiment, presenting a summation and reflection here to this subreddit would be incredibly productive.",

If this is a need that arose from real practical work then it makes sense to me.\n\n\n>Photocopies\n>LFPL can generally obtain an electronic copy for free. However, charges associated with obtaining physical copies depend on the lending library. Requests for photocopies of articles from magazines, journals and newspapers require your approval of a maximum cost since libraries routinely charge for these. Even putting $5.00 on the form will greatly improve your chance of getting the item. Charges must be paid before receiving the photocopies.\n\n\nhttps://www.lfpl.org/services#126\n\n\nI don't know your situation but if you have access to the Louisville Free Public Library they can probably get you a scan of the preface. Many libraries in the US have this book, they just aren't near Louisville. Have you thought about accessing it through a library?",
