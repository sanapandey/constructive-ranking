Who historically constitutes a privileged section of the proletariat in a country that can be classified as having a semi-feudal and semi-colonial character? How big is it today, how does its reactionary position develop and how does it reproduce itself? What role do social relations and structures such as caste and the current state of communalism under Brahminical Hindutva fascism have to play in this? \n\nIf someone can point me towards any readings on the same, I would greatly appreciate it. Of course, links to previous discussions on this subreddit are great too. ",

            "body": "There is so much confusion regarding proletariat in semi-colonial semi-feudal countries it is often befuddling. In a country with extremely uneven development, to imagine the significant presence of a labour aristocracy (as a class), is rather pointless. India does not have genuine industrialization, it does not have a consolidated proletariat found in industries, most of its labouring masses lie in the peasantry and semi-proletariat and a consolidated proletariat remains only a small section of people. The trade unions are weak and the corrupt union leaders are hardly eating a share of the imperialist pie, nor do they exist as a consolidated class with shared interests for them to be an aristocracy. Most establishment unions are fighting for their lives at the moment, unable to build any movements against the labour laws which are demolishing the TUs. It's very straightforward. In Development of Capitalism in Russia by Lenin, he laid out factors to evaluate the transition from feudalism to capitalism in a country. As primitive accumulation occurs in a pre-capitalist society, the peasantry is bound to be displaced. But what is its centre of gravity in a capitalist country? It is the industries and particularly the manufacturing sector where they gather once again, on the march to proletarianization. This does not occur in India, where participation of workers in manufacturing sectors has continuously reduced since the 1970s! Instead, the people displaced from agriculture find themselves in construction work and in the so-called service sector. They are not even proper proletarians in these conditions, most of them are stuck as semi-proletariat. Finding the \"privileged\" section of the proletariat in these conditions is a futile enterprise. Already most people do not actually put in the effort to engage in Marxist analysis, there is someone in this thread calling call centre staff as workers after visiting the country once. So when these people see the \"best\" among the worst, they deem them labour aristocracy even though the conditions of this so-called best is nowhere near the working class these people will see in their own countries. Or, the other fallacy is looking at petite bourgeoisie and deeming them proletarian. So many in the imperialist countries and particularly on this website look towards the semi-colonies as sights of revolution but do not seem to want to engage with understanding this situation by even studying Communist Party of China's experience from a hundred years ago or the Peruvian Communist Party's experiences half a century ago. The sites of investigation, on the other hand, are located at imposing questions that are non-existent for Marxists in the countries we are talking about. Not even revisionists in India who consider it to be a \"junior partner of imperialism,\" \"backward capitalist country\" or even a weak imperialist country have the ridiculous courage to discuss labour aristocracy in a country where even the successful transition from feudalism to capitalism is up in the air.\n\nA commentor has linked a discussion on brahmanical Hindutva fascism. If we are already in agreement about India being semi-colonial semi-feudal in nature, then it is not a big leap to understand fascism in India as comprador feudal fascism, which manifested in China during the final years of KMT rule after the defeat of Japanese imperialism in the second inter imperialist war as a means of curtailing the strategic offensive of the CPC and preserving the ruling comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie-landlord nexus class rule. Brahmanical Hindutva fascism has nothing to do with labour aristocracy, but everything to do with the imperialist crisis that festered after 2008 which slowly ate away even the superficial concessions that came with liberalization-globalization-privatization (LPG) of the 1990s in India (for largely a cream of the Indian petite bourgeoisie and the rich peasantry in some limited areas). With a weak and dependent ruling bourgeoisie, along with an already weakened landlord class, along with class wars being waged against the Indian state on all four corners (national liberation in Kashmir, Asom, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and the unprecedented upsurge of Maoists in 1/3rd of Indian territory after 2004 reaching near the point of stalemate within 5 years), the Indian state led by such weak ruling classes trying to maintain its facade of democracy would spell disaster for imperialists. At the same time, the global imperialist crisis is a pile of waste falling down a mountain of crap, it will only accumulate more and more waste and enlarge until it collides with something at the bottom and crashes. It needs to feed itself, with cheap labour, with natural resources and raw material, extracting superprofits from a well which is already nearly dry, and for this task it needed a brutal fascist state which would A) mobilize the disgruntled urban de-classed into an ideological framework away from revolution, B) push the Hindutva idea of an Indian nation, a manufactured idea itself, to attack the national liberation wars being waged on all fronts, C) throw away all pretenses of democracy and directly attack those using this contradiction of the Indian state to hold it accountable (attack on democratic rights activists by labeling them as Maoists), D) intensify primitive accumulation and corporate loot with the barrel of a gun, by way of militarization and kill all dissent, armed or otherwise. Fascism, first and foremost, is the open terrorist dictatorship of finance capital. For this task, the BJP government has intensified the LPG policies on essentially steroids, demolishing most forms of the Nehruvian \"socialist\" welfare state that was a big fad during the early days of US imperialism's hegemony. For the first two tasks, it pushed brahmanism and Hindutva to create a few enemies which imperialism on a world scale has already been promoting: Muslims. Even among Muslims, as studies have shown, it is the lower caste proletarian, semi-proletarian and lumpen-proletarian Muslims in the cities who are largely being targeted and in some rare cases, the Muslim peasant (like in Mewat), though the peasantry's proclivities for armed resistance bode disaster for the RSS when it tried to engage in its violence in rural areas. The recent elections have also made it painfully clear that fascist consolidation in rural India has not occurred. Fascism in India is defined and limited by the strength of its ruling classes, which in the grand scheme of things, are weak, dependent classes with no life force of their own. It is due to this that brahmanical Hindutva fascism, even after 10 years, has been unable to consolidate its control over the entirety of the Indian state, a task the German and Italian fascists completed within a couple of years.",

From my experience this tends to have to do with an individual's ability to interact with the imperial core.\n\nAn example of someone who might be considered part of the LA in India would be a call center worker working for a large American company. They work terrible hours for low pay, but are also dependent on the even worse exploration of farmers, laborers, etc. within India to be able to live the (again relative) lifestyle they have.\n\nI don't know if that answers your question, but it's the best I've got.",

A proletarian with 4 limbs is more privileged over one with 3 limbs...this nonsense renders the whole theory of labor aristocracy completely toothless.\n\nWe have concepts for different sectors of workers in India - petty-bourgeoisie, unproductive workers, semi-proletariat. Describing call center workers with the aim of organizing them comes at the end of a long investigation into their industry, their conditions and consciousness. Not by just stamping them with some worthless concept \"more privleged proletarian\" and calling it a day.\n\nE: /u/[anihallatorx](https://www.reddit.com/user/anihallatorx/) Whether or not there is a labour aristocracy comes at the end of a study into the class structure of Indian society, not before. There are many analyses of the class basis of fascism in India that don't mention a labour aristocracy at all.

Edit: my app was/is malfunctioning. \n\nI haven't read much about LA but from what I have gathered from this sub they only/primarily (?) exist in imperial core nations? I was hoping you could give some pointers on this. I would be reading in depth on this later.",
