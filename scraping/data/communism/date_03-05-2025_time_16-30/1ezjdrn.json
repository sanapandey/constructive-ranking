            "body": "Who is \"MrKazuma on Discord\" and why do you trust them over someone like Ilan Papp\u00e9? I understand skepticism about historians when it comes to the cold war but this isn't one of those subjects, Israeli settler-colonialism is uncomfortable for American liberals as arbiters of neocolonialism so there is significant room for critique in academia.\n\nE: To be more precise, I understand they are not opposed in your mind, I'm sure this doc relies heavily on historians like Papp\u00e9. I also understand that you want a curator of knowledge before embarking on research so you don't waste time. What I don't understand is why this random internet entity is your curator? Since we no longer live in a world where your local communist party social club tells you what to read and presents you with like-minded people to discuss with, the internet has taken over that role and gives the illusion that anyone, anywhere can belong to a social space at the click of a button. But they are not equivalent. You don't know who this person is, what they believe, what they've done, if they've even read the works in the doc, or even their real name. The price of speed is superficiality.\n\nThe death of the author is the birth of the reader. You must become a historian and develop your own ability to distinguish useful information prior to research. The alternative is, at best, skimming a giant documents that actually waste more time since no one ever read the sources in the first place (since our current condition of social atomization is an objective, material situation - MrKazuma on Discord is someone just like you). At worst it makes you a mark for scammers, grifters, and content creators, who fill the void of society with a direct relationship between social belonging and the money form. It's not like this doc is well known, so the time you put into finding someone to tell you what to think is probably greater than the time the person themselves put into making it (once we account for all the time posting on discord as a means of belonging). We are not dealing with an absence of time, despite common excuses, but an absence of effort.\n\nHistorians are curators of knowledge as well so I am not asking you to rely on academic qualifications or the supposed rigors of professionalism. In fact, it's the opposite: because historians are professionals we can critique their work from a distance. They are not like us (people \"just asking questions\" or \"just trying to learn\" or whatever) and we don't have to be polite to them. They have simply written a book which stands on its own merits. It is the illusion of sociality that comes with \"docs\" that is the danger and leads us to think of these works as indications of friendship and belonging. Judged on its own merits, I'm sure this doc is full of errors, misspellings, and sloppy work. Taken as an argument on its own, which it is despite the form of presentation, I'm sure it's deeply flawed and amateurish. But that is not how you judge them. As I said, they are really a substitute for social belonging, like an older comrade you trust at your workplace giving you their old copy of Lenin's collected works. But it isn't. That world is gone and it's never coming back. You have been liberated to be your own historian and your own philosopher. \n\nSocial media is not social at all. It is advertising. This subreddit is the exception because it fights against all manifestations of friendliness and sociality because, ultimately, we are not friends and I don't want your clicks or your donations. We are either vessels of pure thought or we are grifters. Which one will you be?\n\nEE: I started reading the introduction which is conveniently \"in progress\" (imagine if a historian did this) and it is fundamentally flawed. Indigeneity is not a discursive term but a material one based on the existence of people's as nations were being formed. \n\n>despite the Maori having arrived in New Zealand just 300 years before the Europeans did \u2014 a relatively short time period \u2014 they are still indigenous people, because their society is one which is being marginalized and ultimately targeted for elimination. \n\nThis is ironically exactly what Zionists argue: now that Israel is fait-accompli (and multi-generational) and Palestinians want to wipe us out, our inindigenous status is as legitimate as theirs. The actual Marxist position is that Israel will never be a legitimate nation (or New Zealand) because they are settler-colonialist societies that were driven by mercantile capitalism towards the genocide of actually-existing, historically formed nations (the features of which Stalin laid out clearly). That many nations formed discursively in reaction to oppression (though not all) does not mean they lack a historical foundation rooted in an objective relationship between a people and its land and labor. To be honest the implication that indigeneity only exists in the discourse of the oppressor and vanishes when that situation disappears (is a \"transient phenomenon\") is deeply offensive. That Algerians are not indigenous to Algeria because after the French withdrawal, \"no one calls them that\" (who is \"no one?\" Surely not Algerian people), is so insane I don't think this person thought very much about what they were saying.\n\n I'll admit I stopped reading there because criticizing something a \"doc\" on its factuality is to miss the point.",

But the larger point is that history is full of migrations of humans. Why are only some of them settler-colonialists? The idea of \"oppression\" explains nothing, the Mongols were oppressive but we do not consider them settler-colonialists. The conquest of the Middle East by the first caliphate was done through war and yet various Muslim peoples are indigenous to the region. And whether Jews are oppressed or not is a matter of opinion since it is a discourse and feeling. Nations are material things that have concrete histories.\n\nHumans do not naturally commit genocide against their neighbors. Genocide is the result of a particular logic of capital which is irrational: the labor of Palestinians is excluded from productive activity (wasted) because of the logic of Israeli labor. In fact, Jewish ethnic groups are indigenous to many places. Ashekanzi heritage is the result of intermixing and conversion, and it is this point which shows they are not a nation (just like Muslims are not a nation but Arabs are). It is only when they became part of a settler-colonialist attempt to form an artificial nation that they became genocidal.",

Again, you are a historian and you are responsible for what you write. As for your larger point, your logic is circular. You posted the doc because it was good. How do you know it was good? Because it advocates for the liberation of Palestine. But that's the title of the doc, not the substance. You've presumed its quality before reading it. The act of reading is performative, which is why you've already shared it before even reading it (which is impossible given it contains references to multiple books).\n\nThat is completely normal on discord. Imagine actually going back to the discord and saying \"hey everyone, I read the document that was linked two weeks ago and I'd like to discuss the arguments made in source #39 and #156, specifically their use of terminology. Did everyone bring the relevant books?\" You would be mocked and then lost in the mass of messages that followed. In fact, the act is so alien that there is even a term for it: copypasta, where sincerity is itself mocked as the ultimate transgression of the community's norms as \"just\" discussion (which is exactly the same as discussion but without responsibility).\n\nThat is because, to belabor the point, discord is a \"social\" media experience which is primarily for creating communities. There's nothing wrong with that, it has its purposes such as keeping zionists out (whereas truly open communities like 4chan become fascist garbage since the means of self-policing is shock tactics and the arbitrary construction of friends and enemies - though one should not overstate these differences).\n\nThe question I am asking is what are the consequences of that communal experience and what are its limits. \"Docs,\" which simply did not exist before the internet, are one example we can interrogate. It is very strange on its face that you are attempting to learn from and spread the work of \"MrKazuma on Discord.\" Try telling your parents or your teacher. We should reflect on that strangeness rather than take for granted this world of detached, virtual humans we participate in.\n\nE:\n\n>MrKazuma is since I've never met him\n\nI never met Marx and I avoid biography as a form.

All I will say is that it is interesting that all the subreddits relating to other websites on reddit are either \"cringe\" or \"fail:\" r/TikTokCringe/ and r/LivestreamFail/ are some examples, and this is the overwhelming substance of \"leftist\" subreddits. There is a certain Schmittian idealism (in the Marxist sense) which constitutes this sense of communal identity and it is no coincidence that it originates with the right: r/kotakuinaction and the larger \"Gamer Gate\" movement. That these are the foundations on which regular discussion are then built is very strange, as if the initial distancing from the other as beneath criticism (i.e. subhuman) is necessary as the founding act of any internet community. And, as Walter Benjamin showed, this foundational act of violence is in reality continuous, as the community must renew its distinction from the other or else be torn apart itself by its lack of substance.\n\nI think most young \"leftists\" will admit this: they came of age when the right had weaponized the internet, using popular culture as an ideological weapon and radicalize the normative libertarianism of the previous era. This saw its culmination in Trump as a not \"cucked\" Sanders even if seemingly ideologically opposed. I use that gross term because all the terms are borrowed from the right and are coherent within its worldview (whereas they suit Marxism very poorly). The scary thing is openly analyzing it.

What I will say is communists either have a tendency to treat the internet as either another form of media (as in memes as another form of a billboard) or dismiss it entirely (as in Kites which used to rant about internet communists while posting on the internet). It should be understood on its own terms and treated as a powerful force in its own right. \n\nI can't find it right now but there's a blog that gets posted here sometimes which is someone's analysis of Marcyism and the PSL. They talk about the rise of Dengism in the party as a seemingly inexplicable fixation on a totally unremarkable historical figure in a way detached from any social practice (except, of course, the internet). The point being that the void of ideology at the center of the PSL meant that their plan to recruit, convert, and use youth from the Sanders movement had the opposite effect: the party's staid educational apparatus was totally unequipped to handle people raised on an overabundance of internet information and instead these people remade the party in their own image. The same has happened in every party (most obviously the CPUSA), even the DSA, which is finally on its deathbed now that an issue has arisen that the old CIA leadership can no longer repress among the young membership. \n\nWhen SDS was remade and then collapsed because of a new generation, people understood this was a fundamental shift in the left, with both good and bad features (J. Sakai's comments about the old party members trying to turn everyone back into white male industrial workers is a nice counterpoint to cynical dismissals of the \"PMC\" though both are windows into the same totality). The same thing is happening today and the internet is a major part of it as a source of community belonging. Not that the CPP is comparable to the PSL, the latter already lacked a revolutionary theory or practice before memes took over. But one should be careful with seeing internet-raised petty-bourgeois youth attracted to communism as simply a blank slate. And, as many people have pointed out here who actually live in the Philippines, content creators and social media and memes are just as popular there among the petty-bourgeoisie (if not more popular as an indicator of global literacy). There is no pure world untouched by \"internet communism\" anymore and the allure goes beyond merely bored rich Americans on their phones.\n\nE: as for biography, I will let Bordieu explain\n\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110516678-036/html?lang=en\n\nThe issue is not so much the biography but the desire for it. That people ask on reddit for biographies is a sign of what Bordieu is saying, which is that the form gives a false comfort of the individual life as a coherent center that gives order to the social totality. The individual being the subject of bourgeois ideology and Whig history. You are right that serious biographies today are no longer written in this way (though there are few good biographies left, most are pop-history crap for airports) but then the biography is either a crutch to lure readers into reading history or a presupposition of its own terms given the person is already presumed to be historically important before one opens the book, which means reading the book is akin to watching a \"breadtube\" video that tells you what you already wanted to hear. \n\nIf you've read Michael Heinrich's biography of Marx you know what I mean. The commitment to the biographical form is so strict that the work is almost unreadable, as a refusal to commit to anything is justified with an overwhelming amount of sources and discussion of what they do and do not say. So little is said that Heinrich hasn't even made it to 1844. And Heinrich is a serious historian and Marx is deserving of an investigation of his life, most biographies of figures like Stalin or Mao are just propaganda in the form of \"truer crime\" shlock.",

A bizarre version of this same thing seems to have happened there. The \"party\" is nothing special, a whole lot of Black Panthers theory reading groups combined with a lovely community garden, \"mutual aid\" twice a week, and free ad space for local \"Palestinian\" coffee shops and Black-owned barbeque restaurants. But it's really interesting to watch as the implications behind the theoretical pieces published by the party have shifted back and forth through internet trends (the party itself is old, its presence going back \\~12 years).\n\nIn its inception, the party was a pretty bog-standard revisionist party, championing \"harm reduction\" voting for Obama while maintaining that radicalism will never occur within the system. Then, perhaps a little less than a decade ago, they made a hard shift to the weird 2010s-style \"anarcho-Maoism\", and suddenly all their leading \"cadre\" were no longer writing about Sekou Odinga but instead attempting to synthesize Chinese and (New) Afrikan herbal medicine (one even calling herself a \"barefoot doctor\" in the projects for offering free CBD oil and acupuncture to homeless addicts). Around 2018, they seemed to be captivated by BRICS, making many posts about their latest \"BRICS symposium\", with all their posts having a little footnote of \"this isn't to say that Russia is anti-imperialist though\". And now, post-October 7, many of the leading cadre have converted to Islam, and they've published an article saying that secularism is incoherent with revolutionary optimism/\"communist humanism\".\n\nNothing particularly special, I guess. But I just haven't seen a party with such seemingly strong roots in oppressed-nation proletarians go through such a clear and comical ideological vacillation. I guess that's a reminder of the fact that \"you're a revisionist because you're a settler and petit-bourgeois\" isn't always the answer, even though it's frequently the case and a tempting answer in general.",

There is truth to that but it's also the makeup of parties themselves that changes and injections of new energy. There is nothing to envy in the leftovers of the new left, the anti-globalization movement, and the anti-war movement from the Bush era, but it's also true that this movement of young people into parties is not just a blank substance to be used and shaped but has its own characteristics. Parties either embrace it,  turning into sudden converts of Dengism, or think they can control it and find themselves washed away by the tide regardless. Though my experiences are with various revisionist parties and the revisionists who post here so I'm always interested in how parties and movements outside that petty-bourgeois world function. Despite my claims this is a general phenomenon, I think some things get changed and twisted in translation.\n\nAs an aside, I'm enjoying reading the discussion about more serious subjects in the comments. I do wonder if my particular method of critiquing OP's that captivate my interest has any use to anyone else, especially about seemingly silly subjects like memes, so I'm glad you found it useful for your own thoughts.",

The danger is that all \"irl\" activities are interchangeable in this fantasy but the CPP is a significantly more serious commitment than the CPUSA, and there is serious danger of over-excitement at new recruits who are not actually ready to break with the low-stakes commitment of internet community belonging. In a situation where ex-guerillas often turn into informants, memes should not be used as just another way to get someone's foot in the door. Of course this will always be present to some degree, being a guerilla is a major life change for anyone, but if your motivation is to brag on discord that you finally \"touched grass\" the life of a revolutionary is probably too far.",

Form constitutes apart of content.  u/smokeuptheweed9 avoids biography as a form because (as I understand) the form determines the content, at least to a considerable degree.\n\nIs this not resolved by the proper usage of dialectical materialism?\n\nI started to see this truly when I returned to a study of Spinoza while connecting it to the developments of Marx, Lenin, and Mao. Along with reading through Ilyenkov's Dialectical Logic, which runs through a good history of this thought.\n\n\n\nThis can be seen how the life of living people are themselves subject to motion, and draw from the aspects of material nature, and are subject to emergent contradiction. Creating just a biography of a person would be to only see the aspect of a persons recorded life and not the works that they produced in that life. Which as smoke said just turns into a PHD paper written by some historian with pages of footnotes and historical trivia that makes one lose sight of the essence of their life work. Something that seems to be lost among liberals here is you can in fact learn a lot about Marx by reading his works and engaging in his thought. It really is strange because students have no problem doing the same thing when one has to engage with Newton and Leibniz to learn undergrad calculus. \n\n\nI don't know particular examples of Jazz to be able to speak about it in depth. But in the case of hip-hop and rap written in the Filipino context I can see how the form and content run dialectical. Where much of our influence is from the west (in this case New Afrikan), but our contents are about our own experiences. Even the languages used are usually in some contradiction, with a mixed use of Filipino and English. There is of course the constant draw of become mainstream and capitulating to bourgeoisie way of life for our artists, but there are also artists who live and die and walk among the masses.",

Mao articulates it best - we don't need to smash the *form* of bourgeois art, we need to alter it so it serves the people, and the way to do that is to simultaneously allow the proletarian masses a place in cultural creation and to encourage (or force) artists to integrate with the masses.",

This is also sadly a phenomenon in the urban mass orgs, especially those with more petite-bourgeoisie makeup due to being organized in or around universities. This has unfortunately lead to situations that diminish the trust of the masses in these orgs if some SA scandal occurs. On the other hand, more disciplined orgs have been able to improve their trust with the masses, especially in responding to pertinent issues (Jeepney phaseout, US military presence/escalation, Infrastructure projects that threaten lumad communities).",

Though for what it's worth I'm far from excited about \"memes\", more just attempting to offer some criticism of the idea that all \"memes\" are inherently the same type of media (just as bourgeois commercial \"jazz\" and New Afrikan improvization might not be the same type of media).\n\n>Compared to agitprop which forces one to centre on the real conditions and approach it with seriousness, memes tend to make light of it\n\nThis is a really good point, yeah. Hadn't considered that.\n\nThat is unfortunate about the urban mass organizations. Though from my experience, it doesn't really seem like \"greater discipline\" necessarily cuts down on sexual abuse (see: Red Guards / CRCPUSA, lol); rather, to me it seems like a combination of discipline and a correct analysis of the \"woman question\" are equally as important. Even the Black Panthers, a party with (originally) attempts at strict proletarian discipline, had its thorny elements here (see: Eldridge Cleaver and his early, pre-theoretical-development but post-joining the Panthers, writings about how New Afrikan men raping settler women can be liberatory).\n\n>the global power of the internet has spread to the petite-bourgeoisie here\n\nDo you foresee this eventually spreading also to the proletariat proper? I've noted, in my experience organizing migrant proletarians that certain reactionary parts of the \"global power of the internet\" - obviously \"hustle culture\" as an attempt to escape from the proletariat, but also weirdly enough the Manosphere / \"alpha male\" brand of gender/sex chauvinism to some nonnegative extent - has significant influences on sections of the proletariat, particularly young men immigrating from Africa as opposed to Central and South America. (I have no idea why this geographical difference exists in what I've noticed, and I struggle to think of a way to phrase this that won't be twisted sickly by chauvinist fascists espousing \"feminism\", but I don't want that to stop me here from telling the truth; as smoke once said on a thread about the intersection of transness and liberal hegemony, this is one of the few places where we're least likely to be decried by liberals as bigoted or to have our discussions coopted by fascism.)

This is different from memes though because one does not want to make light of acts of military violence, destruction of ancestral homes, or farmers facing famine.

Been meaning to get around to it at some point. That sounds relevant here :) Additionally, I think Mao's writings about not harming the interests of the masses are useful for helping communists attempt to live a persynal life that neither falls into liberalism nor into lifestyleism. (For what it's worth I think that the original Maoist International Movement, and the Red Guards, respectively, indicate the lower and upper bounds of acceptability for how much a communist party in the imperial core should police its members' persynal lives, at least in our current conditions eg. not living in semifeudalism, not waging guerilla war, etc.) But yeah, ultimately lime is primary.\u00a0\n\nE: of course I speak here of the Red Guards CRCPUSA, not the Red Guards of the GPCR, which are an entirely different story :)\u00a0\n\nEE: And of course I meant \"line\", not \"lime\"; I think it's bedtime.\n\nE^3: Regarding humor, a close friend of mine who is unfortunately starstruck by the Frankfurt School and post-Marxism says that someone, I don\u2019t remember if it was Deleuze, Althusser, or Adorno though, once postulated that humor can be revolutionary but \u201ccomedy\u201d is inherently reactionary.

And were these official CPP initiatives?\n\nThis was more in the line of academic and educational work I've encountered as a student and teacher so not party initiatives. \n\nThough there are mass organizations that post on social media that have used certain variants of 'memes', though the are usually particular to some situation in the Philippines (this was a while ago but we had 'memes' about the usage of crushed dolomite to beautify manila bay that came at the cost of the mountains those rocks were taken from and would be washed away anyway by the tides).\n\nIn terms of official initiatives though, I am only aware of agitprop. \n\n\nThough now that you mention it I was at an event (a vegetable exhibit of all things) that also became a avenue to talk about the plight of lumad farmers and there were booths with lumads, as well as one with the wife of a Filipino botanist killed by the military, there were booths with CPP symbols along with petite-bourgeoisie booths selling trickets with 'memes' that also brought attention to EJK and other contemporary political issues.\n\n\nI guess here the question then is when is something a 'meme' or agitprop?\n\n Is talking lightly about a situation justified or not?\n\nAt least in official statements I don't see the use of 'memes', for example: the lumad newspaper talking about the Dam project being built in Mindanao was as serious as can be. Though that same booth also had a colouring book based on traditional lumad dances and practices.\n\nEdit:\n\nIt was also telling because as I left that same vegetable exhibit there was a convoy of military patrol waiting outside the campus grounds. Which is another point about the seriousness I believe we should have when undertaking the communist movement.",

The mistake was all the more pardonable since various prerogatives enjoyed by the ruling classes are actually barriers in Russian life. Mr. Lyuts\u2019 educational attainments, however, did not \u201c*vozbudirovat*\u201d the laughter of his educated friends or their press.\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1913/apr/10.htm\n\n\nCriticizing foreign influence on a language might seem formalistic, but Lenin's rationale is actually based on content, and for this reason he finds some instances \u201cpardonable.\u201d\n\nEdit:\n\nThat said, like I mentioned in another comment, it is also metaphysical to artificially isolate form from content.  Form can also determine content and is a part of content.",

Cronenberg said that he primarily came up with the idea for the film because of Salman Rushdie's experience in the '90s which is .. expected I guess, but there's so many bits of dialogue from it that I think about when I see some of these Dengists comment. There seems to be such a drive towards making the impersonal form, as you reference, tangible, human, or something otherwise personal. But then there's an extreme insecurity about this at the same time, as one can see anytime this type of individual is criticized.
