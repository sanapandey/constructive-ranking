                    "body": "To understand this requires an understanding of the current strategic position of US imperialism with regards to its inter-imperialist contradictions with principally Chinese imperialism, and the contradictions within the US imperialist bourgeoisie over how best to navigate (while serving their class interests) this strategic position. With the growth of Chinese Imperialism, the contradiction between it and US Imperialism over markets and access to the labor-power of the oppressed nations has become increasingly intense. In light of this, ever since Obama's \"Pivot to Asia\", US Imperialism has expanded its military presence in the Pacific region --both on Pacific islands and in its long-standing comprador regimes of Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines, as well as alongside Japanese and Australian imperialism-- in preparation for inter-imperialist war. At the same time, in addition to imposing tarrifs on Chinese imports, US imperialism has embraced a sort of protectionism that has been called \"Neo-Mercantilism\"-- the US bourgeoisie have been directed to withdraw from investment in Chinese production, and have increasingly been exporting their capital to nearby comprador regimes such as Mexico, and to domestic production of important strategic commodities for US Imperialism.\n\nAll sections of the US bourgeoisie are in favor of these policies, and they have been supported and accelerated by every president since Obama. There, are, however, contradictions among them over further aspects of the handling of this contradiction. The section of the US bourgeoisie aligned with Biden prefers a slower, more coordinated approach of intensifying the contradictions with Chinese imperialism; they are the section which is more committed to continuing the proxy war with Russian imperialism, and while they back the withdrawal of capital exports to China and the expansion of domestic production, they also support the limited export of capital for high-value-chain commodities, like cars. The Trump-aligned section of the US bourgeoisie, on the other hand, supports a more aggressive confrontation with Chinese Imperialism and repatriation of high-value-chain commodity production, alongside cutting US Imperialism's losses in Ukraine to devote a greater section of military resources towards confronting Chinese imperialism.\n\nTrump's recent announcements of tariffs on Mexican and Canadian (as well as Chinese) commodities, as well as his aggressive gestures toward Greenland and Panama, can be seen in light of this. Regarding the former, I wrote about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1hjmmaf/comment/m3blg5p/), though I'm now far more certain about my conclusions obtained within than when I wrote them, and my analysis of the Mexican tarriffs principal role of promoting US car production actually also applies to Canada, since the US auto bourgeoisie has also exported a great deal of their capital into Canadian production. Trump's gestures toward establishing a new military base in Greenland (or even acquiring it, which would serve the same purpose), is in order to strengthen US imperialism's position in the Arctic vis-a-vis Chinese and Russian imperialism, both with regards to commodity production (principally of oil) and capital circulation in light of the melting sea ice and in the potential of an inter-imperialist war; in contrast, [the other](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/08/trump-congress-biden-pardons-politics-latest-updates) section of the US bourgeoisie backs a less confrontational approach toward other members of the US Imperialist block in doing so.\n\nWith regards to the prospective seizure of the Panama Canal, this is clearly a case of the US \"battening down the hatches\" in light of new inter-imperialist contradictions. The canal, after all, was only totally delivered into the control of the Panamanian comprador regime in 1999, several years after the collapse of Soviet social-imperialism; with the development of a new inter-imperialist contradiction, US Imperialism, headed by Trump, is clearly interested in re-establishing control over the canal-- in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of Chinese imperialism, to restrict Chinese capital circulation, and to restrict the movement of the Chinese fleet/Chinese commodities in the event of war. What these developments represent is the rapid heating-up of US-Chinese imperialist contradictions, which seems more and more likely to result in a third world war.",

As for Panama, it also is important for all global trade, not just Chinese, though I don't know how much Russian trade passes through it and I imagine Chinese trade flow is much more",

                                    "body": "With regard to Panama, my analysis is largely informed by the explicit rhetoric and declared strategic intentions of US imperialism at the moment. Trump has been very clear that seizing the canal is for the purpose of combating \"Chinese influence\" or \"Chinese meddling\", and strategic centers of US Imperialism like the [Atlantic Council](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/right-to-be-concerned-about-chinas-influence-over-the-panama-canal/) are basically saying the same thing. This, combined with an understanding of the rapid ongoing intensification of the inter-imperialist contradiction with China, makes me very certain that the above analysis is correct.\n\nAs for Greenland, I did note in my above post that it was a development of the contradiction with Chinese *and* Russian imperialism. The principal inter-imperialist contradiction today is that between the US Imperialist bloc and the China-Russia imperialist bloc, yet, like all things, that contradiction itself is defined by its own contradictory aspects--namely, US Imperialism's individual contradictions with Chinese and Russian imperialism. It's rather clear that the former (the US-China inter-imperialist contradiction) has, by this time, become the principal aspect within the general global contradiction between imperialists, with its development coming to define the development of all other aspects within that contradiction. Therefore, even though, quantitatively, Russian imperialism may have a larger presence in the Arctic than Chinese imperialism, the inter-imperialist contradiction which manifests in the region is still principally that between US and Chinese imperialism-- besides, the presence of Chinese imperialism in the region is accelerating while that of Russian imperialism has (at most) increased only quantitatively. To see just the current \"balance of power\" in the region as determining the character of the contradictions contained within is a metaphysical approach: matter is always in motion, and the development of a system is determined by which aspects are rising and which are declining, not which are principal or secondary at any given moment of time.",

So there is obviously a benefit to having western allies in the region like Japan, SK, and Taiwan.

The problem here is analogous to the anarchy of the market - each person produces independently without knowledge of what is necessary for society as a whole and we only know once we bring our product to market - in which case someone either informs us \u201cthis has been covered before\u201d, \u201cI was working on something similarly but haven\u2019t been able to flesh it out fully\u201d etc. The consequence is there is a lack of the long-form in-depth theoretical studies that are necessary to build a party. We have here a spontaneously developed division of labour - some people know more about music, others natural science or political economy according to their own personal interests and private education.  So theoretical production can only proceed at a slow, stunted pace.\n\nA higher, better form of newspaper is like organized industrial production - a moderation team that fully owns up to its function as leadership that acts as an editorial board by guiding discussion and setting collective priorities. A forum that implements a formal division of labour so that we can have people write in-depth studies in specific areas that are needed by the group as a whole. Ie. a Party newspaper. \n\nOf course, these already exist, but the results are disappointing entirely due to political lines being followed. Some internet newspapers are by organizations that only use the internet as an outlet for publication (like https://the-masses.org/). They don\u2019t make use of the internet\u2019s power to facilitate discussion, to eliminate geographic barriers to communication, and allow anonymity. Some do make use of the form for long-form discussion (like https://cosmonautmag.com/), but again are entirely disappointing owing the their political line. MIMP\u2019s ULK is pretty good, because of a relatively more advanced political line, but is also stunted in my view because of the line of a decentralized cell-structure. When you have an ideological leadership, but that leadership insists that it is purely educational, purely to help facilitate discussion for others (as MIMP believes) you\u2019re relying on spontaneity and now acknowledging the importance of your own leadership. Same equally applies here, where the mods are relying on each individuals waxing and waning interest to produce long detailed theoretical work - which doesn\u2019t really happen.\n\nI hope we the see the development of new internet newspaper-forums outside of reddit (chinese maoists have created [https://bu2021.xyz](https://bu2021.xyz) to show a practicable example) that follow the structure of a party newspaper (with a formal structure and division of labour, vetting of new members) and use it to promote a higher level of discussion and theoretical work. There was an attempt by Dengists to form an off-site forum Lemmygrad using reddit as a springboard, but it replicates reddit\u2019s weaknesses, and its predictably awful because of the Dengist eclectic political line. I imagine some of the better users here could get together and form such a forum, in advance of Reddit\u2019s inevitable censorship of this place, but it\u2019s something that I don't have the technical know-how to do alone. Even if a new forum isn\u2019t formed from the initiative of users here, I imagine new organizations will take up the format because it offers clear advantages over the traditional newspaper.",

And attempts to build a mass base before an organization has a basic programme and class analysis of the country have been shown to be just narrow pragmatism. Before that stage the organization is inevitably mostly intellectuals, and needs to produce theory to guide the actions that follow. As for practice, we have how many years of history and new spontaneous practice being done every day, and very little reflection to show for it.

I will say that I think you raise a good point regarding anonymity (and I think one you discount as a benefit of the cell organization, even if you correctly critique the MIM (Prisons) for abdicating any party work that would come with developing it). \n\nThere\u2019s a simultaneous tendency for third world communist organizations to opportunistically tail first world organization, especially those from Occupied Turtle Island, for the understandable reasons. The contradictions in the Amerikan prison-house are decisive to, say, Peruvian struggle in a way that isn\u2019t true for the inverse. Furthermore, the preponderance of chauvinist \u201ccommunists\u201d in these first world parties tend to obfuscate the conditions of their class analyses in order to paint their chauvinism and reformism as revolutionary.\n\nOn the inverse, these same chauvinist orgs will tail the global south in both their initial analysis (\u201cthe countryside in Mindanao is politically active so surely that is true for the Rust Belt or Kanadian Prairie\u201d) and the response to this line where they cling to these third world orgs for legitimacy in the face of domestic/internal critique. For anyone organizing in Amerika, the RCP\u2019s prominent role in the RIM is a complete joke but externally how many members of the CPN(M) would have access to [this MIM document](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/mim-rcp-nafta.pdf), much less have the information to fully evaluate each position, especially when the RCP has no reason to allow for this criticism to be distributed.\n\nI don\u2019t think that is a problem that exists as such in the present day, or rather is less significant given the better availability of these writings on the Internet. The RCP might have been the preeminent Amerikan Maoist party in the 1980s, but now they\u2019re listed among dozens on Marxists.org. Bob Avakian is just some guy who endorsed Genocide Joe.",

I think this is also a benefit of these sorts of forums\u2014 there have been several times when someone has criticized, for example, the CPI (Maoist) for a particular error only to be revealed as reformist in the comments. This was a structural error with traditional communist internationals, I think. If a single party has access to the resources and legitimacy of a revolutionary international body, they will gain undue influence domestically in silencing opposition (and gain supporters who may not agree with their line but see benefit in the access), and also internationally in being *the* line of a given country. \n\nYugoslavia famously used this to leverage its own social imperialism, for example, but on a lesser level Amerikan communist orgs are full of New Afrikan compradors claiming to speak for the oppressed nation and trying to prevent any other communist from intervening on these affairs. For their part, Euro-Amerikans tend to attach themselves to the first community leader they find and never leave out of fear of being labeled chauvinist.\n\nI think in many cases social fascist standpoint theory gets smuggled in as \u201cno investigation, no right to speak\u201d, but the difference is that communist *can* investigate and consequently speak. An anonymized forum, where nobody cares if you say you\u2019re the head of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia or a Croatian worker distraught at the privatization of your firm, should help in terms of this investigation. Ultimately it often still devolves into a \u201che said-she said\u201d situation, but at least both lines are out in the open and can be considered in a social investigation, rather than being submerged in revisionism before you even try to engage with the masses.\n\nWhile I do criticize Comrade Joma for such an opportunist line on Biden, he is correct that Amerikan imperialism is a primary driver of Filipino fascism and a backbone of the AFP, and if he is under the impression a Biden victory is the best way to achieve that then I see the logic. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s right but who should he support instead? The PSL? MIM(P)? The CR-CPUSA? If Amerikan settler-colonialism is such a minority idea domestically, one can only imagine how marginal it is internationally.*\n\nThis was one of the biggest benefits of *Iskra* for example, but we have the capacity to completely eclipse it with the reach and ease of communication that the internet brings. Even language barriers don\u2019t really exist on here (at least to the same extent), something unthinkable just 30 years ago.\n\n*It is notable, however, that Amerikan chapters of Kabataang Makabayan\u2018s line predominantly interacts with the lumpen diaspora rather than any illusions of a great Euro-Amerikan mass base. This is certainly an issue of contradictory politics, but how much does this matter? The CPP isn\u2019t going to save us and shouldn\u2019t be responsible for doing so. If tomorrow everyone in the NPA started disseminating *Settlers*, I\u2019m not sure if it would make any impact on their actual tactics or strategy in their PPW.

Without that, it\u2019s just a bunch of metal.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re breaking down the contradictions within the functioning of a car, it\u2019s pretty absurd to ignore the social functions of a car, like the contradiction between the car and its driver in the first instance. Nothing being described by u/RNagant takes this into account.\n\nAs a result, we see a set of imagined contradictions that lead toward something that doesn\u2019t really happen, which is a car basically propelling itself. Contradictions exist to explain a process that is in motion, to move from one set of definitions of the starting and end points of a moment of transition. If your analysis of a car is unable to describe the social function of a vehicle, you aren\u2019t really arranging it within a totality, and are only providing a metaphysical, mechanistic description.\n\ne: The essence of a thing isn\u2019t innate. In one moment the essence of a hammer can be defined by hammering, or by the removal of nails, all dependent upon which direction the hammer is being held by a person. That essence can change again depending on the work that person is doing. So essences can\u2019t be arrived at through working through a list of empirical observations, or else you end up being a mechanist or a positivist. The essence of a car will be dependent upon its position within a process.",

Thank you.\n\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gnnnjo/biweekly_discussion_thread_november_10/lzcqhlm/?context=3\n\nI had asked a question in this thread about music and wanted to post my confused thoughts for critique. \n\nIf I\u2019m understanding the comment I replied to correctly, the Peking Review article is firmly asserting the class character of art/music while the Zizek video is demonstrating the fundamentally bourgeois character of the Ode to Joy. Zizek points out the bourgeois character of the song by referencing the exclusion of those oppressed and exploited by the \u201cjoy\u201d of the new bourgeois \u201cfreedom\u201d. This exclusion juxtaposed with the supposed universality and inclusiveness of the music shows the truth behind the position of the Peking Review article.\n\nI am not at all confident in my understanding of this discussion and would appreciate criticism or guidance if anyone has any for me. \n\nAlso one other thought I had with regards to the idea of a melody expressing two diametrically opposed feelings- what about the Chinese [\u201cSong of the Guerrillas\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fKUa6eA4hEI)? Isn\u2019t the melody basically the same as \u201cThe British Grenadiers\u201d?",

                    "body": "It\u2019s not a frivolous question. There have been a few discussions here on the class character of music and art more generally in recent months. I unfortunately failed to keep up with them and never went back to read them all in full, but I think the consensus was a *Death of the Author* perspective.\n\n\nPut it this way. I think there is a contradiction in Chao Hua\u2019s article. On the one hand, they say:\n\n\n>To claim that one melody could be used to express these two diametrically opposed feelings would be sheer charlatanry.\n\n\nOn the other, they say:\n\n\n>We should critically assimilate certain techniques from classical bourgeois music\n\n\nIf a single melody cannot be used to express two distinct class standpoints, why should musical techniques be any different? I think the real function of Chao\u2019s article is to say this:\n\n\n>Some people talk about bourgeois classical music with great relish, are mesmerized by it and prostrate themselves before it, showing their slavish mentality for all things foreign. They are nihilists with regard to national art. Their reverence for foreign things is actually reverence for the bourgeoisie.\n\n\nSo far as the article served that purpose, it was correct. But taking their thesis (as expressed in the first quotation above) seriously on its own terms, we can reject it as a metaphysical vulgarization, pointing to many instances of a melody being used to express divergent class interests. Do the *Aviators\u2019 March* and the *Battle Song of the National Socialists* express the same class standpoint? How about the *Partisan\u2019s Song* and the *March of the Siberian Riflemen*? Does revolutionary music embody the same meaning when played at a factory in Korea as it does when listened to \u201cironically\u201d on a stream?\n\n\nThe class character of music is no more an inherent attribute of the materiality of music than is value an inherent attribute of use-value. The materiality of music is the material depository for social relations. The class character of music consists in the concrete social relations that make music what it is and as such is inherently relative. And this position in no way coincides with the bourgeois position that the meaning of a song is determined by the listener as an individual on the basis of an abstract human nature, which is what Chao Hua was rightly attacking. Chao Hua starts from a correct premise (\u201cwe must conduct a concrete class analysis according to the social content it [music] reflects\u201d\u2014quote from Chang Shan, see below) but if their argument is taken to it's logical conclusion it runs a foul of the premise, effectively insisting that a piece of music can go on reflecting a class even once that class has actually disappeared in history.\n\n\nIncidentally, Chao Hua\u2019s article is just one chapter in a 1975 book (really a collection of articles) titled \u8bba\u97f3\u4e50\u7684\u9636\u7ea7\u6027 (*On the Class Character of Music*). There is another chapter in that book by Chang Shan titled \u65e7\u8c03\u91cd\u5f39\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f, but it\u2019s basically just a paraphrase of Chao Hua\u2019s article with the same sequence of points and line of argumentation.",
