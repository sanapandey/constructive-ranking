Anything within communist ideology is relevant, but I\u2019m particularly looking for books on these topics: \n\n- settler colonialism \n\n- sex work \n\n- violence against women \n\n- religion and Marxism \n\n- the police and/or military \n\nBut again; any book you adore and think should be studied more in leftist circles is more than welcome even if it doesn\u2019t address any of the topics above. \n\nIm also up for documentaries, movies, YouTube videos, podcast episodes, etc. I really just want to learn and grow as a Marxist.

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Frantz Fanon also wrote a lot about this issue.\n\n\nAlexandra Kollontai was a Bolshevik who wrote about \"women's issues\" including prostitution. You can find some of her work [on the archive](https://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/index.htm). While not a Marxist per se, Andrea Dworkin's critique of patriarchy remains one of the best and is rooted in material analysis of gender. Pornography is the most obvious contender, but Woman Hating and Intercourse are also worth checking out. I would say The Origin of Family, Private Property and the State by Engels is also a pretty foundational text for understanding gender oppression through a Marxist lens. If you want to continue down that vein, there's The Dialectic of Sex by Shulamith Firestone and Silvia Frederici's work. I believe there's an also an issue dedicated to the topic of gender in the MIM archive.\n\n\nNot too sure about the other topics you listed, unfortunately.\n\n\nWith the exception of Dworkin (and Engels ofc), all of the above authors self-identify (or identified) as Marxists but you should still approach their work, and anyone's, critically. Identifying as a Marxist doesn't mean you are immune to reproducing liberalism.",

I still think her work is incisive on the issue of patriarchal oppression and approaches the question of gender from a materialist perspective, though I haven't read Right-wing Women so can't speak on that one. (Most of her work, including that title, have been out-of-print for a number of years but are being republished early next year.) Her analysis of class is surely incomplete but the same could be said of most feminist thinkers (as well as the majority of western thinkers tackling the issues of white supremacy and racism in the imperial core), it's hardly an issue unique to her.\n\n\nWhat theorists do you prefer for understanding gender through a Marxist lens?

Her view of it is pretty close to the MLM understanding of gender (although she obviously doesn't take it to the same conclusions since she is not analyzing things on a global scale). This was a big deal for me as I was struggling to reconcile my own suspicions that this was the case with prevailing \"gender discourse\". I actually became rather disenchanted with feminism generally over this, because antiessentialism is exclusively associated with transphobes for reasons I can't understand, since transphobia is rooted in bioessentialism. It wasn't until I met my partner (who is also a ML and shares my views on gender, go figure) and they loaned me The Lenses of Gender by Sandra Bem that I saw it contextualized in feminist theory \u2013 and not for lack of reading, either. I had heard of Dworkin prior to this but wasn't familiar with her work, having written her off based on the abundant and malacious misrepresentations of her views. Bem is coming from a more scientific approach than a theoretical one, though (but nevertheless I'll update my original comment to include her and another writer who argues that biological sex is itself part of the gender superstructure).\n\n\n* She had an incredible amount of insight into how patriarchy is reproduced through gendered interactions. This not only clarified social reproduction in a theoretical sense for me (in a way that is broadly applicable to liberal ideology in general), but it also was absolutely invaluable in helping me finally deconstruct certain hang ups I had around gender on a personal level. (Specifically, the internalized belief that I needed to be both desirable and actively desired in order to have value as a human being, which had been a constant source of distress for me.)\n\n\n* Her critique of the sex trade and the dialectic between it and society is still unrivaled imo. Similar to antiessentialism, having a critical view of the sex trade is widely considered regressive and Puritanical. There is a lot of social pressure, *especially* in \"left\" spaces, to unquestioningly normalize pornography and prostitution in order to be \"sex positive\". (\"Sex positivity\", in general, is mostly used to shame women into tolerating ever increasing objectification and violence under the guise of \"empowerment\".) This requires urgent correction, and while I know even Marx himself condemned prostitution, I've noticed a lot of people align with the \"left\" moreso on the basis of opposing oppression than capitalism as a strictly economic system. As such, I think Dworkin's arguments against the sex trade will resonate more readily for those folks than the \"labor deserter\" angle, which requires a deeper understanding of Marxist economics and may\u00a0be read as somewhat \"hostile\" toward sex workers. Dworkin's critiques are still rooted in materialism, so they aren't incompatible with Marxism at all, they're just \"incomplete\". In general, I don't think there's anything worrisome about an incomplete analysis as long as it isn't egregiously *wrong*, because you can always build on it later and we should be approaching most things from that mindset, anyway.\u00a0",
