You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They utilised all the Fascist collaborators and paramilitaries, while blaiming the \"far-left\" for what was happening. They opened concentration camps (again) for the Communists, while public opinion forgot about that fact and blames the Right. Thanks to them we ended up being governed by Fascists, collaborators and deserters, while our Resistence fighters died, got sent to exile, or escaped in Warsaw Pact countries. And that whole mess stopped in the '70s, after the collapse as of a US-backed military dictatorship which had banned all political parties to... combat the communist threat.",

Quite the opposite, I strongly agree the idea that liberalism is just moderated fascism is absolutely correct. I provided the explanation below because fascism and communism are often associated as opposing ideologies, which creates the illusion that they are somehow complementary.\n\nYou would be wrong in saying that; there is no ideologically opposing correlation between fascism and radical leftism.\n\nRadicalism on the left means going to the root of the issues. For example, when we say that capitalism is unsustainable because it aims to exist with infinite expansion within a world with finite resources, this statement can be made because we went to the root of the issue using a method within material reality, with the goal of the emancipation of the working class by breaking away from the dominant mode of production.\n\nFascism is cornered liberalism going to its extreme to protect the interests of the bourgeois class. When liberalism and the bourgeoisie find themselves pressured in the class struggle and close to defeat, they use their extreme face\u2014fascism\u2014ignoring the morality they once claimed to protect and their own institutional rites if necessary. Take France, for example: Macron is a sly neoliberal. At the moment, he is ignoring democratic rites and carrying out an institutional coup because the French bourgeoisie was slightly threatened. That\u2019s why it is said that Social Democracy is the antechamber of Fascism, and why radicalism is different from extremism.",

It is true though, that liberals will always side with fascism over communists, since it does protect the current hierarchy of ownership and prevents people from forming class consciousness. \n\nFascism is to liberals, more like the bonapartism of 19th century France that marx described. A restrictive government that is tolerated, because it will side with the bourgeoisie in the class war. \n(This is very long, I hope I made my point understandable though)",
