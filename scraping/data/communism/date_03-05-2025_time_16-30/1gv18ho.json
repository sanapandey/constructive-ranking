    "selftext": "I've recently read some things on this sub that lead me to believe I'm not part of the proletariat. I'd like some opinions from those more educated than myself on where I fit in, and what actions I can take to help the most. \nI work for a living, light engineering and maintenance in the energy industry. Firmly white collar. I make a decent wage, over $150k/yr, but I've not been steadily employed the past decade. I live in a house that I pay a mortgage on. Car payments. I've made a fair bit of bad decisions, so retirement is not guaranteed for me, though I understand that might not make a bit of difference, but it is part of what led me to communism. \n\nI'd like recommendations of texts that may explain where someone like me fits in. Are the only options proletariat, petty bourgeois, and bourgeois? \n\nMaybe the question doesn't even make sense. Let me know. \n\nI'd like to call myself a communist someday (is that even a thing when I'm living in capitalism?). At the time though I'm admittedly stuck resisting because of fear. The same fear that keeps people in line when they see homeless people living in tents. \n\nAnyway, hopefully you all are healthy, safe and warm. \n\n-confused and unsure",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How can the lifestyle of one individual determine the sort of society they're living in? If a freelancer in the First World goes out and hires an Uber driver as her personal servant for an hour to ferry her around for less than minimum wage to a department store where she can buy a T-shirt manufactured by sweatshop workers paid less than they can live on, are those not also part of the \"society\" that she's living in?\n\nI see you've purchased *Settlers* and the essential works of Lenin; those will be far better at helping you understand the world around you and far more insightful than some random Redditor who has decided that their warped worldview informed by zero theory or practice is communism.",
