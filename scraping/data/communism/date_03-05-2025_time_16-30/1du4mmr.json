    "selftext": "So i want to start with this: I am not from North America, and my question was mostly regarding getting a correct understanding of national liberation and the concept of nation itself from a marxist viewpoint. I got this from a north american who identifies as marxist that since Canada and the US were built on colonized land, they all are settlers and thus all the land should be given back to the Native population as a form of national liberation and decolonization. They also disregard the concept of \"white proletariat\". Now it didnt seem right with me so I read up Lenin's \"Right of nations to self determination\" and Stalin's \"Marxism and National Question\". I also read [this](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ca.secondwave/nationhood.htm) explainer on the Native National Question by some Canadian comrades from the 70s. Their line was basically that the struggle against white settlers has lead to the formation of a \"native nation\" that is north of canada.\n\nWhat I find the difference between the Native National Question and the Palestinian national liberation question for example, is that Palestine was a nation before getting colonized by white jewish settlers whereelse there was no such native nation, and instead it formed (and still in the formation) due to the struggle itself. I would really love an actual marxist position and clarity on this as I think this ties with the general understanding of the national question itself. Can anybody guide me on this?",

The term describes an actual class relationship between land, labor, and ownership in the present. It is not a moral argument about original sin. You should read *Settlers* and it will answer all your questions.\n\n>is that Palestine was a nation before getting colonized by white jewish settlers whereelse there was no such native nation, and instead it formed (and still in the formation) due to the struggle itself.\n\nYou don't seem to understand *why* nationalism is progressive. It is not, in itself, something communists care about and there are many reactionary nationalisms we do not care about. Please read Lenin and Stalin to understand why \"the struggle\" and progressive nationalism are inseparable.",

My question was more specifically about the marxist leninist position on what \\*constitutes\\* as a nation. The work I provided titled \"Nationhood or Genocide\", the Canadian comrades clearly states that they believed the native nation has \\*formed\\* during the struggle with the colonizers, and the Canadian state constitutes 3 nations: namely english nation, quebec nation, and native nation. And they believed in the right to self determination for the native nation, and that it was an oppressed nation. The Land back position is significantly different from this as it doesnt care about the concept of the nation but rather thinks in terms of land(?), and that land inherently belongs to anyone. This is what confused me as to whether marxist position should be of \\*Land back\\* or right to self determination of the \\*native nation\\*.",

That's probably true but I don't really care what liberals think. The Marxist position is that decolonization, national liberation, and socialism under the dictatorship of the proletariat are three aspects of the same totality which are inseparable.\n\nNations didn't exist until the bourgeois revolutions. When they came into being after that is not politically important, if a national movement came into being tomorrow communists would support it if it fulfilled the criteria of being historically progressive.\n\nI'll admit I didn't read the article you linked because I don't really care what this Canadian group from the 1970s says. What do you think?",

It seems pretty important that a distinction is made between white property owners and workers who are now stuck on the continent with no money nor assets (which is what class is).",

            "body": "This question was in fact a controversial one in the crisis that shook the old revisionist Communist Party of Canada in 2022 when a lot of its younger members left. One of the dissidents' major objections to the party leadership was the leadership's unwillingness to consider settler-colonialism as a useful concept for understanding the world and their insistence on imperialism as the way to understand these relations, with the relation between the Canadian nation and Indigenous ones analogous to that between any other wealthy nation and the poor nations which they exploit.\n\nReading Settlers is certainly a good start to understand what is meant by the word and even though it focuses on US history for the most part it can be carried over to Canada (although I would love for someone to write a Canada version of Settlers which deals with the development of the Canadian working class some day, especially regarding the 1837 rebellion) but keep in mind that it is a history of the white working class in the USA, not a manifesto laying out how to solve the national question in the Americas.\n\nReading the article you linked, its position would probably be regarded by most people who consider themselves \"pro-landback\" as reductive or unrealistic, but its view of more than half of Canada's surface area as an occupied territory which should secede is refreshing and concrete compared to two positions on \"landback\" which I can think of. The first, which is held by the revisionist Communist Party of Canada, is that every individual nation (of which there are very many rather than just one large nation, something which might be a problem in the article you linked) has a right to secede on its own, but the Party's own view is that it is better that they remain part of Canada with an \"Assembly of Nationalities\" like that of the USSR replacing the Senate.\n\nThe second position which was held by mots of those who left the CPC in 2022 opposes this first position on the basis of all of Canada being stolen (which is true) and that it should theoretically all go back to Indigenous peoples, but I have not seen any concrete revolutionary position put forward by any of these members. The closest thing I saw was [this essay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QI6MtmKs1KbTEvEZkUXoTy1d5xTkdLRcQi7hjoCqFEk/edit#heading=h.epgbvtrvhxus) written by a member who left in 2022 which toys with the idea of moving large buildings in Toronto if the country's major cities are returned to the Anishinabek and the Mississaugas of the New Credit. This is what I would consider the landback position which as described by the other commenter is \"degraded in its encounter with liberalism.\" When these people say landback they either mean that they hope specific Indigenous nations win specific local land claims (usually not large ones and usually simple defenses against new construction or resource extraction projects) or they talk about \"returning all the land\" in a vague sense which means nothing.\n\nThat article from the 1970's has a far superior position to either of these - obviously there remain problems with considering \"one unified Indigenous nation\" but this does solve the fact that on their own, essentially all individual Indigenous territories within the Canadian state are not really economically viable (by design when Indigenous peoples were removed to far-off places mostly in the 1800s to allow the expansion of Canadian agriculture and resource extraction without hinderance). By contrast, a large country as described in the article would be an economically viable unit in the modern day. Obviously in contrast to vague calls for \"returning the land,\" this solution stands against the interest of large sectors of Canada's population (Settlers essentially answers why this is) but that doesn't make it an impossible solution and doesn't mean that communists here should use that as an excuse to do nothing and wait around.\n\nTo conclude, I do not have the answer to your question, but the article you linked, while not entirely correct, is closer to a revolutionary position on the national question in North America than anything that any of the existing left-wing organizations north of the US border could give you.",
