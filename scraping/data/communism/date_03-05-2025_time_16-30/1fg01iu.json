But how would you relate it, even if gradually, to communist goals, without turning people away too quickly?\n\nKnowing how to relate these topics to us would be incredibly useful for approaching my family with it too, since they also have a pretty skewed view of Communism, from their time alive.\n\n(For context, I'm from Romania. The subject is either too touchy, completely avoided, or used as an insult; you can probably see why I'd be so wary when approaching anyone with this.)\n\nThanks in advance, comrades!",

The folly of searching for the ''working class'' to organise with is that you will encounter reactionaries, specifically amongst the labour aristocracy and petty-bourgeois, who do perform labour and often identify as working people but are almost always opposed to revolution since their class interests are reliant on the extraction of surplus value that only capitalism can generate.\n\nEdit: And don't fall for propaganda that Eastern Europeans despise communism, even if you yourself are Eastern European and think you know better about what they believe in. If you know where to find the Romanian proletariat then you can trace their political development and find people to organise with as they are not going to repulsed by communism, a communist party is simply the most advanced concentration of proletarian interests in a bourgeois society.",

I've just been very careful either way, I'd assume that a strongly revolutionary mindset and intensions could potentially get someone in real trouble if voiced. Is this the sort of thing you were referring to?\n(I'm not even sure of sources where I could find out more about what's dangerous and what isn't right now, to be completely honest.)\n\nAlso really appreciate you shedding light on the term \"working class\" here. That's a very important differentiation I didn't really consider until now.\n\nRegarding the edit: Very true. The hatred against communism is definitely not that major if I think about it more. The propaganda you hear very often your whole life can genuinely overshadow what you actually observe if you're not careful lol.",

Communists shouldn't be averse to breaking the law or risking themselves for revolutionary gain but as I \nsaid, it requires special consideration but for Romania, I wouldn't worry too much about the legal ramifications of calling yourself a communist.",

While we can still identify ourselves as communists, we literally have this government-funded National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) who, of course, jails every activists, not even just communists, without proof of belonging to the armed struggle. The PH government also added the Anti Terror Law, which is nothing but a made-up law that they can file against activists.",

Our organization also helps with the paperwork. The left has very good rhetoric. Sound, rational, and true. But not enough of us are willing to actually go out there and do something about it.

Here all major unions (including \"independent\" unions like UE) tail the major capitalist/imperialist political parties and membership are largely composed of petty bourgeois or labor aristocrats individuals. \n\nThe American so-called communist organizations are often tailing these unions under the auspices that they fight for workers rights. \n\nThey all fight for the class interests of their members which generally involves fighting for a bigger slice of the spoils of Imperialism. To give two different examples: AFSCME which represents government employees fighting for a bigger slice of US tax dollars for their members, UAW which represents automotive employees fighting for a bigger slice of inflated profits from Ford for their members. In both instances the union is fighting to maintain wages and working conditions above the value of the labor.\n\nAll of the major communist and socialist organizations in the united states do some sort of union work, whether that is working to unionize new workplace, showing up to \"picket lines\" with the aformentioned unions. This doesn't do a whole lot to further the class interests of proletarian and oppressed classes. \n\nThere is probably more work to be done here, and some interesting and critical discussion about unionization in the first world has taken place on this sub but there probably should be more.",

I usually get at least positive head nods or, in the best cases, they buy the paper or even ask to join the party.\nPeople tend to look down on communism around here, so you gotta start with the biggest issues and trace It back to class exploitation.
