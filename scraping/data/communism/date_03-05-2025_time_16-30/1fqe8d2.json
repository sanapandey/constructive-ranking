    "selftext": "Given recent discussion on the necessity for a \"great leader\" within revolutionary movements, it strikes me as quite interesting that the current active Maoist revolutions seem to totally lack them. The CPP-NPA was led by Jose Maria Sison for a while, but he was never an equal, either theoretically or in his stature within the movement, to someone like Mao or Gonzalo in their respective parties. This also seems to be the case in the Indian struggle, with figures like Charu Majumdar or Kishenji being leading comrades but not faces of the revolution. Why is this the case? Is it just the result of happenstance, or is there some deeper logic to it? Both rigorously apply Mao's theory on the struggle in semi-colonial nations to revolutionary practice in their own conditions, so could this phenomenon be simply a result of the lack of a need for totally new theoretical contributions in conducting their revolutions?",

There was also an incident where the newly formed committee was inaugurated and Kanu Sanyal raised the slogan of \"Charu Majumdar Zindabad [long live]\" instead of raising slogans in the party name. This has been discussed (but not \"critiqued\"/not analysed afaik) in Ashoke Mukhopadhyay's sketchy but okayish biography 'Charu Majumdar: Dreamer Rebel' and by Suniti Kumar Ghosh (in passing) as noted in Amit Bhattacharya's 'Storming the Gates of Heaven.'",

After all, even while it can sometimes be disconcerting to our residual petty-bourgeois sensibilities, the glorification of great revolutionary leadership has never, to my knowledge, been a hinder to the revolutionary struggle, but to the contrary has only served to further it. Great leadership gives the revolutionary struggle a symbolic center for the struggling masses, and it is in fact the masses themselves who have historically taken the lead in honoring and glorifying the leaders of their revolutions. I'm receptive to u/Particular-Hunter586's speculation from last month's thread that the sometimes quasi-religious nature of the Chinese masses' reverence for Chairman Mao may have been a fetter on their broader revolutionary consciousness, but even if that were true, it wouldn't negate the role that Chairman Mao, as a symbol as well as a great leader, theoretician, and helmsman, played in the Chinese revolution, and wouldn't negate the necessity for great leadership in the revolutions to come.",

Communists should selflessly do the best they can to wage and advance the revolution and forget about seeking personal fame or claiming for oneself the credit that belongs to the revolutionary forces of the proletariat and the people**. It was not Marx and Lenin themselves who labelled their collection of ideas and actions with their respective names.\"\n\nSourced from [this interview.](https://www.descifrandolaguerra.es/interview-with-jose-maria-sison-i-we-can-see-the-conditions-for-the-resurgence-of-the-world-proletarian-revolution-precisely-because-of-the-intensifying-inter-imperialist-conflicts/)\n\nAs for my petty-bourgeois sensibilities, you should speak for yourself. It is you and only you in this conversation who exhibits bourgeois idealism by believing that it's \"great leadership\" that makes revolutions and not the masses themselves.\"Great leadership\" is not a necessity for any revolutions to come. \"Great leadership\" does not even play a significant role in the creation of revolutions. Material conditions make them and those conditions push the masses to revolution. If Lenin had been born in 1700s, for instance, it is no doubt that he would not have been able to make revolution in Russia, no matter how great he was or how hard he tried.\n\nFurthermore, you are forgetting Mao's principles of mass line by justifying these personality cults by saying that it's usually the masses themselves who initiate them. Communists do not tail behind the masses, move behind them and only go where they go, regardless of if they are right or wrong. Communists must *guide* the masses towards the correct line when they are ready for it. The correct line in this case is to avoid the veneration \"Great men\", because that's ANTI-MARXIST!\n\nFinally, do tell how do personality cults advance the communist struggle? How does venerating our leadership bring the world closer to the abolition of class society?",

                    "body": "> Khrushchev\u2019s complete demolition of Stalin at one blow was also a kind of pressure, and the majority of people within the Chinese Party did not agree with it. Others wished to submit to this pressure and do away with the cult of the individual. There are two kinds of cult of the individual. One is correct, such as that of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and the correct side of Stalin. These we ought to revere and continue to revere for ever. It would not do not to revere them. As they held truth in their hands, why should we not revere them? We believe in truth; truth is the reflection of objective existence. A squad should revere its squad leader, it would be quite wrong not to. Then there is the incorrect kind of cult of the individual in which there is no analysis, simply blind obedience. This is not right. Opposition to the cult of the individual may also have one of two aims: one is opposition to an incorrect cult, and the other is opposition to reverence for others and a desire for reverence for oneself. The question at issue is not whether or not there should be a cult of the individual, but rather whether or not the individual concerned represents the truth. If he does, then he should be revered. If truth is not present, even collective leadership will be no good.\n\n  \n[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-8/mswv8\\_06.htm](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-8/mswv8_06.htm)",
