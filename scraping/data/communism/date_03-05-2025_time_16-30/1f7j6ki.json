Tons of people are accusing me of being a trumper because I don\u2019t post about him as much because his horror is more obvious to me and to everyone else on my list. People also ask things like \u201cwho do you think wants you to spread this stuff about Kamala?\u201d But like everything I\u2019m posting is about stuff she did as DA/AG or things she\u2019s doing now with Gaza and wanting more cops/border patrol. But I saw a video exposing an Israeli dude who\u2019s been interfering with elections for money all over the world and now I\u2019m like \u201cdamn I don\u2019t know the people sharing these memes and takes on stuff.\u201d And now I\u2019m hella paranoid. What the fuck?! I\u2019m still a bit new to anarchism/communism and I\u2019m weirded out by people seeing me as some kind of conspiracy theorist. But like damn I\u2019m posting shit about things Kamala\u2019s done. I guess are y\u2019all feeling psyop-y? How do y\u2019all handle the paranoia? Am I just tripping because I don\u2019t really have a lot of actual leftists in my life? Am I in an echo chamber? Thanks y\u2019all. ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just don't care. The person calling me that is irrelevant, and I know why they feel that way, because they benefit from social democracy.\n\nIf you're serious about communism, just keep studying. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. Eventually, you\u2019ll see that anarchism is useless and actually get into Marxist theory. The more you read, the more confident you'll feel in what you're saying, and you won't worry so much about being seen as a \"conspiracy theorist.\"",
