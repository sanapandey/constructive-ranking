    "selftext": "Now, I'll start off by saying that I'm not an American. I have no idea what issues the CPUSA is currently battling with and, frankly, they aren't relevant whatsoever. Dissolve the party, fix it, whatever happens is irrelevant to the topic at hand.\n\nThe American Communist Party is a newly founded party that, on the surface, could more or less appear as a legitimate Marxist party with Marxist critiques of the CPUSA and its actions (again, not a clue). Unfortunately, however, it is almost certainly either a) a \"MAGA communist\" organisation, b) a fascist organisation posing as communist (sound familiar?) or c) simply a completely normal party that I am overreacting about.\n\nIt appears (to me), at first, as a rather legitimate separation from the CPUSA, with apparently many chapters of the CPUSA joining it. Noticeably, however, one of its founders is Jackson Hinkle, the MAGA \"communist\". The other signers of their declaration appear (from a brief search) to be a mix of conservative debate bros with communist aesthetics, (maybe?) a few vaguely genuine communists and people in favour of taking the worst possible position that we are accused of in every instance.\n\nNow, why is this party dangerous? In the event it is a collection of MAGA communists: its undoubtedly horrendous positions will tarnish communism in America even more (somehow) and the hordes of edgy 14 year olds the debate bros attract will make communism even less attractive online, potentially crippling an already small movement in America. Additionally, its name is likely to show up first, or at least early, in searches if it gains enough traction. This is probably the least dangerous option.\n\nThe more dangerous option is that it is a fascist organisation posing as communist in order to gain more of an audience (odd since fascist ideas are already gaining popularity in America, but perhaps I have screwed perspective) in order to speak to their real followers, the far right. Now, it was almost a certainty that fascism would rear its head in America during this period of capitalist downturn (arguably, it already has), but to reattempt this strategy is a \\*\\*somewhat\\*\\* unexpected choice, though it has worked before.\n\nThe possibility that this is a fascist attempt to co-opt disagreements within the CPUSA (which may or may not be happening idk I'm just some random Aussie) is not to be ignored. Or maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist idk thoughts lmao?",

I don't think there's too much to fear from them\n\nI notice some people are theorising that this is some CIA backed Cointelpro operation but that seems silly to me. That party has already been subdued and subservient to capital for a long time. This is nothing more than a split amongst social fascists over which of the two parties will better represent their interests. The Democratic Party is a stumbling mess right now so it's no surprise that many CPUSA members would rather hitch their wagon with Trump than Kamala Harris.",

There is a real chance that the union bureaucracy realigns towards tailing the Republicans over the next 4-8 years of Trump, similar realignments have happened in many countries where neo-fascism is hegemonic and the \"left\" is the party of neoliberalism and the urban petty-bourgeoisie. Outside of moves made by the Teamsters as the first break in the dam, the logic of fascism is immanent to Dengism which is only positive political position one can derive from \"X characteristics\" and \"anti-imperialism\" led by Russia.\n\nThere are objective limits to this, the biggest being that despite overtures to the \"working class\" white or otherwise, the actual substance of the communist movement are petty-bourgeois urban youth who are disgruntled there are not enough oppprtunities for advancement in the DSA. Whether a real alliance forms between Trumpism and the American unions, \"MAGA communists\" are barnacles, faking what they think are working class aesthetics which are mostly derived from the video game *Fallout* than any organic experience. You are right to primarily be concerned with their \"attractiveness\" online, only because it points to how insignificant both you and the \"rightist\" response are to the actual political events occuring.",
