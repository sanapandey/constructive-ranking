I'll forward this statement from a comrade online which is a good evaluation of it: \n\n>Why Hezbollah has rushed into a ceasefire agreement, particularly when it is in a weak position to negotiate, is beyond me. Things on the inside must be looking particularly catastrophic or the leadership simply saw that they were getting off easy and decided to jump ship, allies be damned. Hezbollah's performance in this war has been dismal. Its leadership made multiple incorrect decisions during and before the battle, its rocket arsenal turned out to be highly overestimated and it was not utilized correctly, the ground forces also failed to cause heavy losses to the IOF during the ground invasion (more IOF soldiers were killed in 2006 than in the entirety of this war by Hezbollah), and even the media unit struggled to do its job. The thing that was most staggering however, was the level at which Hezbollah was infiltrated. Dozens of commanders and officials were killed in Dhahiya with many of them being killed in apartments that can easily be struck by the IAF, rather than in bunkers which atleast provide some protection. Ali Karaki, the commander leading the fight in the south, miraculously survived an assassination attempt on him in Dhahiya when all the bombs dropped on his apartment failed to detonate. Rather than getting the fuck out of Dhahiya, he was killed there along with Nasrallah merely days later. In many cases, the IOF had very precise information on the location of Hezbollah commanders and they were also able to carry out the shocking pager attacks with the help of infiltrators. It is clear that Hezbollah had entered this battle halfheartedly. Nasrallah wanted to avoid the costs of a war, yet also achieve victories that can only be accomplished through a war. Rather than take advantage of the opportunity he was provided on Oct. 7th, he only gave the IOF time to prepare and recover from the blows it had suffered. Lebanon has payed a terrible price in this war. Over 3000+ people martyred, thousands more injured, thousands of buildings destroyed/damaged, and even villages that were completely destroyed. It has payed the cost of war that Nasrallah so stubbornly attempted to avoid, yet Hezbollah has completely failed in achieving its goals.\n\nI unfortunately don't have much more to say, I've neglected to continue to keep a more critical eye on the conflict as of late.",

I don't care to debate these things because I am no Zhukov. my concern is that Hezbollah held a political position of military commitment to Palestine that has been seemingly abandoned. I have seen it suggested that provoking israeli aggression for the sake of Gaza was becoming unpopular in Lebanon and losing Hezbollah friends and I wonder if that pressure caused a defeat of the more internationalist line. if this is the case, I doubt being more aggressive or just vaguely \"doing better\" would've necessarily fixed this.",

It is the truth that after the initial onslaught by IOF on Lebanon, which lead to Nasrallah and multiple commanders deaths, Hezbollah recovered (according to 'israeli' media itself) and started dealing IOF with truly heavy losses. Especially last month or so one could only see israeli media going insane about the incompetence of IOF commanders and what not. I am quite confident in saying that Hezbollah did NOT fail in causing heavy losses to the IOF troops. Not to mention in the last month or so the IOF started to withdraw from the places it initially occupied anyway (areas which were already small). On the question of rocket arsenal, Northern 'israel' has been deserted by a significant amount of settlers and economic activity has slowed down considerably. The war with Hezbollah has also caused multiple businesses to reconsider or outright change their dealings in 'israel'.",

            "body": "Continuing on from [my discussion in last week's discussion thread about the role of migration in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union](https://old.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gnnnjo/biweekly_discussion_thread_november_10/ly5qbhe/?context=3), I wanted to very briefly discuss China.\n\nTo reiterate, the basic claim is that migration is a negotiation of class status, that migration is coloured by the root logic of the given mode of production, and that the class contradictions emergent through migration are mediated by the state which is made up of the ruling class (or ruling alliance of classes) which control migration according to the desire to reproduce their existence as such (which means, of course, to reproduce the existing mode of production). Therefore, that society, class, production, and superstructure are hopelessly entangled with migration and that altering one of these will alter the others in turn.\n\nI don't know as much about pre-ROC China with regards to household registration and migration with regards to class negotiation, so I can't comment much on it here, but I will note that household registration of some sort existed in China for many centuries. Historians state that it likely existed in some form since the Xia Dynasty (21st C.-16th C. BC). Not that this is of much interest, at least until the Qing Dynasty when there was a migration project encouraged by the Imperial State that some might study. I am referring to Manchuria, which was legally closed to Han settlers for much of the history of the Qing until about 1860, when Imperial politicians encouraged Han settlers to settle in Manchuria (something that had been occurring irregularly in very small relative numbers prior to this date) in at least some part because of the threat of Russian imperialism encroaching from the north. Some demographers consider this as one of the \"great migrations\" of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and it might be interesting to analyze how household registration as a system of demography was intertwined with such a project but, again, I can't comment much on pre-1911 China given that I don't have much concrete knowledge to share at this time. Even then I sincerely doubt such a period had a remotely similar impact on economic development and class status in China as it had on Russia, especially with the later Japanese settler colonialism in the region.\n\nAt any rate we can note that the ROC from 1911 onward enacted constitutions which almost always explicitly recognized the rights of all citizens to freely move and reside throughout the Chinese territory. Yet how important was this freedom of movement of Chinese citizens to the development of capitalism considering the backwardness of its economy and land relations, and the fact that, when compared to Russia, there wasn't nearly as much \"black earth\" (unsettled) territory for peasants to settle on? In other words, while Russian peasants could flee in much greater number to a much greater of expanse of unsettled land (or land cleared of the Indigenous populations) (or the urban centres of industry) and thus negotiate their class status and \"develop capitalism in depth\", China was a more densely populated land with tributary conditions and landlordism which had existed for a comparatively much longer time period - and further, there was a level of exploitation by foreign capital in China which Russia did not have which entrenched these economic and social conditions. As Mao notes, the number of proletarians (and even semi-proletarians) in China in 1926 was very low for these reasons. It does not make sense that freedom of movement in China in this period would create similar circumstances as it had in Russia with their emancipation of the serfs. It would have required that the national bourgeoisie had much greater political power to sufficiently suppress the imperialists, compradors and landlords in order to utilize a mobile labour population to build a national capitalism - something that they never realized. Instead it seems that any mobile labour immigrated to feed external capitalism over the centuries (coolie labour).\n\nAt any rate, the provisional constitution of the PRC (1949) and its first full constitution (1954) both explicitly mentioned the rights of all people/citizens to freely move about the country, which we might say is similar to the NEP period legislation of the Soviets in its treatment of labour mobility (with some legislation thrown in here and there to prevent complete chaos, considering the economic situation that was inherited). And similarly to the collectivization period of the Soviets, with the coming of the Great Leap Forward in China, the NPC Standing Committee enacted a new Regulation Governing Household Registration on January 9, 1958, within which we can note the following:\n\n- these new regulations for household registration (hukou) are explicitly enacted to serve socialist construction\n\n- all citizens are to register in the locality where they regularly reside, and can only be a *permanent resident* in one locality\n\n- residence is explicitly tied to employment (as such in the Soviet case). Any rural hukou holders who wish to move to urban settings *permanently* must have a) a certificate of employment, b) certificate of school selection, or c) certificate from the city permitting their move. There are no such restrictions for citizens moving from urban to rural settings, but all permanent moves require coordination with the relevant hukou authorities: removal certificate from current place of hukou, and new registration at the new locality. Those accepted into military positions can also gain easy acceptance to change residence, of course\n\n- travel is possible with permission, and the same can be said of temporary residence. Any rural hukou holder can receive temporary registration for urban localities, but must apply for extension or for removal cert from their hukou locality if they will be out of their hukou locality for more than 3 months. There are no such rules for going about the countryside.\n\n- those who are under surveillance, are criminals, are counter revolutionaries or are otherwise deprived of political rights must jump through many more legal and security hoops in order to move about. Further, special permission is required to go to frontier areas and areas where security is of greater concern\n\n- abuse of system including for counterrevolutionary aims will be prosecuted\n\nGiven the planned economy and its goal of utilizing an agricultural surplus to build industry, these regulations make perfect sense for allocation of labour. But I'd especially like to highlight that one could change their place of permanent residence to an urban setting if it made sense within the plan (ie: for labour, for schooling, for military). Further, that temporary mobility was perfectly legal, within reason. It is further notable that the amount of internal migrants residing outside of their PR locality remained well below 0.5%.\n\nThis changes in the post-Mao period. How so? Firstly, hukou was explicitly tied to \"economic growth\" and not simply socialist construction. Therefore labour needed to be channeled to locations where this economic growth would occur. A key development was the extension of temporary certificates for those residing outside of their PR locality when they had a job in their area of \"temporary residence\". However, it was much more difficult to change your permanent hukou location, whereas under Mao it was the employment itself that could allow for this! By 1995, all non-urban hukou holders residing outside of their PR locality for more than 1 month required such a temporary certificate. These legal reforms promoted labour movement to areas developing for the export-oriented economy (Eastern provinces) without a need to change ones permanent hukou locality, which was a legal requirement of labour migration under the socialist economy. And now if one wanted to transfer from a rural to urban hukou registration (which was not easy to do, considering that by now employment alone was not enough), they permanently lost their land use rights from their PR locality. As one could easily imagine, the number of internal migrants residing outside of their PR locality skyrocketed post-reform and continued to shoot up as reform deepened over the years. And this was the plan, just as it was the plan under socialism to keep the labourers resident to the location of their jobs. Yet the resultant surplus did not feed national industry but mostly into the hands of foreign and domestic capitalists.\n\nIf someone were interested, they might study the *hoju* (sp?) system of the DPRK to see its specific trajectory. All I know for certain is that the DPRK's constitution enshrines the rights of all citizens to freedom of travel and residence, at least according to a reference from 2003. I'm not sure if there have been any reforms of note that would provide more concrete information about labour mobility within and without the DPRK. Otherwise I think it would be best to focus on labour migration in your area to see if and how it shaped the economic progression and class terrain of your country.",

This we have already clearly stated in the Manifesto. Here, however, two remarks are to be made:\n\n\n> First, such people, in order to be useful to the proletarian movement, must bring with them really educated elements. (...) They are completely deficient in real, factual, or theoretical material. Instead, there are efforts to bring superficial socialist ideas into harmony with the various theoretical viewpoints which the gentlemen from the universities, or from wherever, bring with them, and among whom one is more confused than the other, thanks to the process of decomposition in which German philosophy finds itself today. Instead of first studying the new science [scientific socialism] thoroughly, everyone relies rather on the viewpoint he brought with him, makes a short cut toward it with his own private science, and immediately steps forth with pretensions of wanting to teach it. Hence, there are among those gentlemen as many viewpoints as there are heads; instead of clarifying anything, they only produce arrant confusion \u2014 fortunately, almost always only among themselves. Such educated elements, whose guiding principle is to teach what they have not learned, the party can well dispense with.\n\n\n> Second, when such people from other classes join the proletarian movement, *the first demand upon them must be that they do not bring with them any remnants of bourgeois, petty-bourgeois, etc., prejudices, but that they irreversibly assimilate the proletarian viewpoint.* But those gentlemen, as has been shown, adhere overwhelmingly to petty-bourgeois conceptions. In so petty-bourgeois a country as Germany, such conceptions certainly have their justification, but only outside the Social-Democratic Labor party. If the gentlemen want to build a social-democratic petty-bourgeois party, they have a full right to do so; one could then negotiate with them, conclude agreements, etc., according to circumstances. But in a labor party, they are a falsifying element. If there are grounds which necessitates tolerating them, it is a duty *only* to tolerate them, to allow them no influence in party leadership, and to keep in mind that a break with them is only a matter of time.\n\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1879/09/17.htm\n\n\n\n\ni think this should serve as an important reminder to users here that while Many like to point to Class Traitors like Engels i think focusing on Class Traitors who successfully struggled against their Petite Bourgeois Class Character has Overshadowed the vast majority of Petite Bourgeois who's struggle did not result in being a Marxist but keeping their Petite Bourgeois ideas.\n\n\nWe must truly struggle to be Communists and Disregarding any ideas about leadership and \"being like Engels\". And Us Euro-Amerikans must especially grip this, we will most likely not be leading but be Assisting and monitored by Oppressed Nations.",

[https://www.instagram.com/p/DCtfLn7zYWe/?img\\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/DCtfLn7zYWe/?img_index=1)\n\nI'm going to refrain from further commenting on it but I have to say I'm quite disappointed in this response. Between this and the accusations of sexual assault in Anakbayan, it seems this will become an issue that communist organizations both in the First World and the Third World will need to get *much* better at dealing with, or risk alienating the female masses.\n\n(For context, Ramnit mentioned in the post had previously accused another Nazariya Magazine comrade of sexual assault and relationship abuse, and an investigation had found this to be true but had also found that Ramnit had violated organizational conduct surrounding relationships by having extramarital sexual relations. I would also recommend, if anyone is interested in understanding the whole situation, reading the previous statement put out, as this seems to be a regression.)",

Sigh.\n\nWhat's really standing out to me with their expulsion of Ramnit statement is why their reasons for the expulsion don't apply to Mukundan, the person accused of assault and abuse. Surely the very same issue of sexual opportunism should apply to the latter? I also saw from multiple comments on the past statements that Mukundan flaunted how he apparently stated how he will continue to be supported by 'professors and activists'.\n\nMost importantly, there is not a single mention of sexual assault in this final statement which is batshit insane to me. At least the previous statements, which weren't good anyway, acknowledged it. In this one there is no mention of it. The recent statement also admits that the relationship Ramnit was in was abusive, but for some reason it has been Ramnit throughout this ordeal that has been singled out for 'rectification', mistakes, etc.\n\nFor instance, the statement talks about sexual opportunism and Ramnit's lack of \"ideological firmness\". The example for this was that Ramnit acknowledged the abusive nature of the relationship she was in and wanted to leave the relationship, but acted in 'vitriol' when this was brought up to her (whatever this means, ngl I have no idea cuz the wording is vague and it's not like I was there when all this happened). Maybe I'm out of the loop here, but even from Nazariya's own logic how does this makes sense? Blaming the abused for not leaving an abusive relationship?\n\nNazariya was small to begin with, but now I think it's just 1-2 people in the damn magazine who're left. It's really sad for me because I learned a lot from the magazine's publication, which included Ramnit's articles. Regardless, the magazine cannot really publish things in my view. They're permanently stained by this issue. And again, Ramnit was a big part of the magazine too.\n\n(On a sidenote, an additional thing that pisses me off  is the space this gives for liberals and post-modernists to discredit the MLM student movement, and use it as an excuse to spread liberal hogwash.)",

Tagging u/NobodyOwnsLand u/Particular-Hunter586\n\nFrom Chapter 1 there is this foundational outlook the authors use to define their perspective on the movement.\n\n>Rather than\u00a0*renter*, we use the expansive term\u00a0*tenant*. The concept harkens back to landlords\u2019 feudal title, which makes their power clear. It also refuses the dehumanizing division that ejects unhoused people from our analyses as soon as they are pushed from their homes. A tenant is more than a renter. A tenant is anyone who doesn\u2019t control their housing, who inhabits but doesn\u2019t own. Like the word\u00a0*tent*, the origin of the word\u00a0*tenant*\u00a0is from the Latin\u00a0*tenere*, which means \u201cto hold\u201d or \u201cto have.\u201d Tenants hold space but are vulnerable to having it taken away.\n\nThe term is expansive, but at what cost? Personally, I don't see how that turn of phrase makes a landlords \"power\" more clear. Instead, what the term does is obscure real class divisions under a broad populist umbrella. Homeowners with mortgages, wealthy renters, the unhoused, migrants families, all technically are unable to \"control\" their housing, and certainly that was clear with the 2008 recession. But \"vulnerability\" is not a scientific category and raising this to the level of political strategy is a recipe for confusion and sharp internal contradictions. Along with this there is also the consequences of the having one's subject of history be defined by what is essentially a particular relation to commodities, rather than to labor process itself, as outlined by Engels in the *Housing Question*:\n\n>In the rent transaction the situation is quite different. No matter how much the landlord may overreach the tenant it is still only a transfer of already\u00a0*existing*, previously\u00a0*produced*\u00a0value, and the total sum of values possessed by the landlord and the tenant\u00a0*together*\u00a0remains the same after as it was before.\n\nThe return to Proudhon isn't particularly surprising given the class composition of lead organizers in the tenant union struggle are often petty-bourgeois students/graduates. Beyond this legacy there is something particular to note that is a symptom of our current conditions in the imperial core (*the* postmodern condition to be exact).\n\nChapter 2 begins with this quote from Fredric Jameson:\n\n>In our time all politics is about real estate.\n\nThe book presents this as an affirmation of their political struggle. The quote is taken as a prescription of what *should* be done, rather than, as Jameson was intending, a descriptive one, observing the present (e)state of politics as something to contend with.\n\n(contd. below)",

It is a development which can now be dramatized politically, for I want to suggest that it is strikingly confirmed by the evolution of politics itself, whose extraordinary verities throughout history seem today, on the global scale, to have been themselves reduced and standardized on a well-nigh global scale. I will put a very simple proposition to you: namely that today, **all politics is about real estate.** Postmodern politics is essentially a matter of land grabs, on a local as well as a global scale.\n\n*An American Utopia*\n\nI certainly don't think Jameson is lauding the fact that politics finds itself to increasingly spatial at the expense of temporality. Instead, he is presenting us (as Communists) with a reality to grapple and draw revolution out of. Addressing a question asked in the thread, the link (or rather the necessary transformation) between the tenant struggle and the land struggle, I think the Jameson quote (as well as the text it's from) shows the terrain of that we must confront (though I don't really agree with some of the conclusions he makes or really thought about their significance yet).\n\nAt the end of Chapter 2 we see the above manifest once again:\n\n>We have to make an active effort. The rest of this book is devoted to that uphill battle. We describe concrete tenant struggles: **direct, local conflicts** that challenge the power of landlords and the real estate state. In so doing, these conflicts trace a future housing system governed not by individuated, asset-based welfare or repression and containment, but by collective self-determination and **community control**.\n\nWhat has disappeared from view is the role of the state in achieving these goals, substituted by localism and \"community.\" If we're to talk about land struggle in the u.$., it must necessarily involve the question of national struggle, but that is liquidated in this conception. Leaving this liberal framing to the side for now, how then should Communists approach the tenant struggles. What u/NobodyOwnsLand stated in the thread is a correct approach to developing that line:\n\n>We see the present role of Maoists in the tenant movement as learning from the practices shown to be successful by these unions (linking up with the tenant masses in the process), uniting with communist tenant leadership (which exists at every level of TUF) in order to advance the land struggle along revolutionary lines, and struggling against elements which seek to de-politicize the struggle and divert these unions back into advocacy and aid work.\n\nHowever, I am curious about their theorizing around the struggle itself. I've been marginally involved in that struggle and can see the immediate ties to migration (internationalism) and nationalism/self determination (among Chicanes specifically). But also see the gaps and contradictions - if taken to it's conclusion, what does a world where tenants \"controlling housing\" mean for a settler colonial society. There are tenants in i$rael, what do we make of their desires for that \"control?\" Those desires manifest as being the shock troops for the invasions into the West Bank, paralleling the invasions of landless Euro-Amerikans westward. Clearly there are limits to this struggle which I think we are all hopefully aware of, but I'd like to see more discussion on what those limits exactly are (and for us, how this can contribute to the reconstitution of *the* Communist Party), as hardly any of the literature put out by these tenant union orgs is willing to examine those limits.",

Although it can take many particular forms we generally understand that the universal source is alienation under capitalist production. \n\nThere are universal and particular activities that one can partake in to address their alienation. The universal activity is active intervention in the world to address the universal source of alienation. In other words, collective work to establish socialism, the activities of which take many particular forms. \n\nThe particular activities I am *otherwise* referring to (ie not communist work) are differentiated by the amount of time, energy, and financial security one has outside of ones job that can be dedicated to such activities (and access to such activities), and therefore how much of an impact said activities can have on ones mood - therefore, generally understood to be particular by the level of access of different classes. Activities in arts, music, literature, sports, activities in natural environments, cooking, woodworking, general exercise, mechanics etc. Although there is still the limitation of time and energy these are not all expensive things.\n\nAll such activities have the commonality of uniting mind and hand in one complete transformative process whereas the mind and hand would be otherwise separated and the labour process segmented. And all could put oneself in a social or natural environment and help combat social or natural isolation. But it would be useless to partake in any such activities without being *active* and intentional in them. For most alienated petty bourgeois/labour aristocrats, all such activities are understood to be performative and therefore to raise or maintain the good mood produced by ones privileged status - whether using said activities to sell a product or to be an in-person in a fandom of alike peers - and therefore they are active in the reproduction of the illusion of commodity fetishism. So they lie to themselves and others and act in shame when confronted by others or the product of their participation in such activities. To my understanding this is also a form of bourgeois therapy.\n\nInstead you should understand yourself to be an active participant in the activity, and therefore act with intent to the process. Let go of the idea that your action has to have an impact on others or on their perception of you: your participation in the activity holds meaning for no one else but yourself. In communist work although your participation is important you are easily replaceable, and you have no guarantee of seeing a finished product. It is true that the goal is the liberation of the proletariat and the building of your socialism but that should go on the back burner of your mental focus. And take your participation in any artistic or other activities (within your means) completely out of the context of commodity circulation and social media. The meaning is derived from the act itself, and you don't have to trick yourself to believe this in order to genuinely feel the impact on your own mind. \n\nYou can also put your body in the best position possible within your means by attending to things like exercise, sleep, and diet.",

And the liberal impulse is to stare inward at one's self. So to resolve cognitive dissonance \"progressively\" one could put the blame on themselves in an act of self-shaming. Like a land acknowledgement. By saying \"I acknowledge that I am a privileged settler\" now one can pre-empt criticism from others (or their own self-realization that they participate for performative reasons), elevate their status above radlibs, and meet the requirements of participating in communist fandom. It's something we've seen before on these subreddits (though perhaps a bit niche in that sense - more common in other fandoms and being a \"true fan\") and I consider it a form of bourgeois therapy. Or in other words self-shaming is one-sided reformism (different from self-criticism which has a productive side). \n\nWe should ask: why focus on the self? It's unproductive and self-serving. It would be much more productive to put in some work and discuss it with others. Then one is actually acting with intent to the process. And that activity itself is enjoyable.",

                    "body": ">However, does it have any positive impact on keeping oneself going from one day to the next? \n\nThe short answer is - it all depends on the psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist (i don't know about the imperial core but here in india these are three distinct things with the first being a specialist, the second being able to give meds, and the third is anyone with a ba psych degree; using the term interchangeablyin hereon) and your own disposition and needs. \n\nLooking for a proper psychologist is work in itself. You will have to search for someone you like and you can \"trust\" enough to get the job done. It is completely upon your expectations - what do you want out of them? \n\nDo you want meds to numb the pain along with possibly everything functional about your brain? I say possibly because medication is again very subjective and can have different reactions, and the psychiatrist usually does not care about it much. It can take weeks to arrive at the correct dosage or perhaps just the first try and viola you are good to go. And then there's the question of addiction. Again, completely dependent on the person. I have watched numerous people i know get hooked onto psychiatric drugs just because it made them high and they felt nice. The bottom line is consider the risks before going in for medication. But this is one aspect of the problem with modern psychology. \n\nThe second is what kind of therapy? Do you want to talk to your therapist? Which kind of therapy though? Cognitive Behavior Therapy - very popular talk therapy but meta studies reveal that they are as ineffective and patients just reel back into depression once it ends. Dialectical Behavior Therapy (nothing to do with marxism or hegel, its just the name) - rage in the current moment according to some psychologists i talked to but is barely an improvement on CBT's technique. There are numerous others but we get the point.\n\nFurther, how do you feel about repeatedly telling different people all your problems over and over because you cannot find a good enough therapist (it might also be the case that they reject you due to some or the other reason)? Let us suppose you find a suitable therapist: now, will you be able to afford both the monetary cost and the psychological load? Therapy sessions are not magic rooms where one can clear their heads and get right back to life. It can have serious implications if not done properly especially since people are extremely vulnerable. Plus, therapy is notorious for its slow progress. It might be months before you begin to feel better or anything at all. \n\nu/Natural-Permission58 i am not trying to scare you out of therapy but i am trying to lay out what one should realistically expect of modern therapy since it is all based on bourgeois ideas. As an added note, one should also be wary of therapists who try to box you in in some or the other DSM category and give you a definitive label because whatever you do, you will be evaluated on that basis by them. \n\nI agree with nearlyoctober that psychoanalysis can help. It is the best kind of therapy there is. Although, again, there are different kinds of psychoanalytic practitioners - in today's world most will be some or the kind of followers of winicott or object relations which is something different from your typical Lacanians or Freudians as far as i can tell. \n\nIn my own case, therapy did not help (not that i was able to afford it anyway). But what did help was reading psychoanalysis. Because it helped me understand my own self and what was actually going on in my own head. I am not suggesting that you do the same but you can take whatever i have written into consideration before selecting a therapist so that you do not end up doing more harm to yourself. And ofc, please do criticise this if you wish. \n\n> Just looking for any experiences that might provide more insight around the kind of conversations one might have with the therapist, to what extent one discusses their world view and related thought process, etc\n\nAs far as this goes, they will probably ask you some standard questions and reasons for seeking help. Other than that, the field is yours to talk about the whole world in therapy.",

            "body": "u/aussiecomrade01 has reached out to me in dms to bless me with their infinite liberal wisdom. This is after they were critiqued on another (now deleted) post for their liberal comments about the supposed downfall of the cpi maoist. I am attaching the message down below for people to judge on their own. But my question is how do other users deal with such people? Do we just block and move on? I am asking this as i had to close my last account after i started receiving weird messages by trolls asking me to connect them with the maoists somehow. I am guessing they also sent personal dms to u/Flamez_007. \n\nTheir message:\n\n\"I understand you guys are really passionate about this, but you\u2019re all assuming a lot of shit I never said and are reading too much into every single word. Relax. \n\n>I love this dead giveaway of propaganda when the posters assume that maoists have fallen out of the sky and have not emerged from the masses themselves. What do you mean help the locals? They are the locals. Did misir besra come from the city to thr villages of Jharkhand or was basvaraj born in mumbai?\n\nLocals can help other locals. I never suggested that they were outsiders or anything. I sincerely didn\u2019t think people would look into every word this deeply. Step one to be a communist that actually has any influence on normal people, is to talk like a normal person, rather than a deranged lunatic. \n\n>You are just being vile and casteist.\n\nHardly, I am indian but my family are immigrants to Australia and I could give less of a shit about the caste system. \n\nAnyway I\u2019ve been very clear that I think we should continue supporting the Maoists even if they\u2019re \u201cfailing\u201d. Keep in mind I didn\u2019t initially characterise them as that, I was just answering the question of the post from a dialectical materialist perspective, which is that while it certainly came from the masses in their respective regions it could not be reproduced on a national basis. Nobody has so far addressed my rationale and have instead just acted hysterically. I think you know just as well that the common perception among indians is that the maoists are on their way out, and this only seems controversial on western forums. Could I be wrong? Perhaps, but I doubt it. The outlook seems grim.\"",
