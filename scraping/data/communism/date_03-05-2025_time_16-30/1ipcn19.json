You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

                    "body": "Right, the danger is the desire to make news conform to instant gratification. Marxism does not operate in instants and it's not possible to get a serious understanding of tendencies through immediate reactions. Only the most superficial forms of \"leftism\" result which are basically just the inverse of the mainstream. China does something that the NY Times freaks out about. It's another sign that China's winning. Der Spiegel writes an article about difficulties recruiting for the war in Ukraine. That's proof that even the \"mainstream\" admits the war is lost. Musk fires a bunch of people at USAID. That's proof of the irreversible decline of American hegemony. Ok great, well tomorrow China hasn't won, Russia hasn't won, the US still exists, so you repeat the same thing with slightly different stories. After a certain point you've become so sure of these discourses, carefully curated by a certain selection of stories to reinforce them over and over again, that you've become totally detached from long term thinking and any deviation shakes you to your core or you just deny it entirely. The collapse of Syria was a remarkable example of the collapse of the entire \"left\" news aggregation system and then it resumed the next day like nothing had happened with the exact same curated discourses. It's not like they can do anything else, they're not investigative reporters and have no money or expertise to do anything except react for you. I can react myself, thanks. \n\nI think a general skepticism about the mainstream media, which at least is removed by some levels from direct grifting on the audience, is preferable to being caught up in a particular blog network or twitter circle that you identify with.",

They are workers producing two commodities: \"content\" for you to consume and surrogate friendship/parasocial confort. The first relationship makes this a relationship of wage labor in which you mediate the corporate platform and the worker as both consumer and manager and the second fetishizes it as sociality in nature. What interests me is the ideology of this new fetishism. Instead of a fair wage for a fair day's work, wages are donations or \"bits\" and you're helping out your buddy. The strangest thing is this straightforward addition of silicon valley ideology to capitalist production is so unquestioned in its ideological presumptions that many Marxist scholars can't even figure out where the surplus value comes from or if it is capitalist production at all. To be fair, they are also old so it really falls on us to save Marxism from people like you (though I am saving you as well from both ideological confusion and the inevitable disappointment of parasocial relationships as commodities fulfilling your human needs).\n\nAlso I'm fascinated by your addition of morality to the question. Again, it is very strange for a supposed socialist to be offended by stealing things and if we were talking about Walmart you would probably encourage it. But the illusion of small \"creators\" who are even helping spread the gospel of leftism (and they even get paid a living wage to do so! There is clearly no conflict of interest) makes this morally wrong. We have regressed a long way from \"property is theft.\"",

What is being paid for, in the exact same structure of \"donations\" and \"support,\" is surrogate ownership of the desire of another human being, safely experienced in a controlled manner because of the mediation of the money form. But whereas for (primarily male) content creators who deal in \"news\" and \"politics,\" the addition of patriarchy and sexuality brings out the nefarious underbelly of this whole system and \"creators\" as ultimately dancing monkeys for your pleasure. The difference that allows the ideology to function is that in most content creation this managerial function is diffused among many people (unless you pay a lot and then gain direct control over another human being) whereas in onlyfans you are directly paying for actions and personal attention. But this is merely fetishism, the regulating function of money on human action is the same once viewer number drop or a creator is too mean to a chatter and the collective viewership rebels.\n\nEngels never asked Marx to blow him a kiss to earn his money. You would think that in 2025, when the clear patriarchal and fascist appeal of \"content\" is common sense even to liberals (who found the first thing to blame in Joe Rogan's endorsement of Trump and Musk's Twitter takeover) this connection would be made more often but I think confronting yourself as basically a John for Hasan Abi is still a bridge too far.",

Their observation was questioning the gradual shift in respect away from more of the casual partakers in the fetish toward those who make it their lifestyle or engage in its extremes. The short answer was just that it's what the market wants. But it's interesting cause that basic assumption is never criticized, and when it is, it's only explained in personal terms or just tautologically (they don't respect X fetishists because they are just disrespectful) nor does it critique the process itself. It's also interesting because this change happened quite naturally and the introduction of OnlyFans only helped mediate a process that was already in formation. I'm sure this happened for every niche community but I specifically remember that before the domination of \"content,\" people who would make posts of them engaging in the fetish without any immediate expectations for something to come from it. Maybe someone paid them to do it once in a while but it was often just dictated on the poster's terms with maybe some suggestions from the people who were interested in them. At some point, posts became content and it was ultimately the followers that began to dictate the form and *content* the posts would take on. It's that \"surrogate ownership\" you mention which is latent in content creation itself that makes even things that are not explicitly pornographic start to feel like porn. \n\nMy instinctual feelings about all of it is that there is some nostalgia for the way things were before. There is also a general disgust for having things I enjoy (not just within the kink realm) being turned into \"content.\" If I weren't a Marxist I'd naturally be inclined to alleviate that anxiety through doubling down and becoming a content creator myself, which I remember at some point vaguely wanting to do but never quite bought into because of the inevitability of turning myself into a dancing monkey. \n\nHaving capital parasitically attach itself to everything you enjoy should feel rather gross and I can see there is a growing disdain for this fact among my petty bourgeois peers but it only exists as a diffuse antagonism and is more readily harnessed into the reproduction of our class than any immediate revolutionary outlook. As for those I've talked to outside this strata, it's a very alien thing to form one's language around memes or to turn your everyday life into content (though this is gaining some degree of traction, similar to the content industry farms in China or that brief trend of people from India recreating the Primitive Technology style of content except on a more spectacular scale).",

The original sin, which was the combination of the sexual revolution of the 1970s and silicon valley libertarian ideology is finally paying its dues. I feel the same way you do wrt nostalgia about anime conventions, which were very insistent on running on the volunteer labor, centering Japanese anime and culture, and in general entering a utopian space where everyone plays a role in the ecosystem of content creation and money is never directly an issue (although it lubricated everything). This is nothing to sneeze at, it was the only thing I cared about in my childhood and I can imagine feeling even more strongly if it's a matter of sexual self-expression.

Obviously that's all gone and was gone before you were born, no individual human being can restore a society on their own. Given it all ultimately came to naught, I'm not advocating a return. But socialists today are fully aware of the problems of that social world: reproduction of the bourgeoisie family and patriarchal relations, social imperialism and segregation, obedience to the party line, and the physical limitations of print media (just to name a few). But few even consider the problems of the present. When I was a kid I understood that Dave and Busters points was gambling for children with the thinnest abstraction to make it not money. And yet adults become very defensive when you point out that Hasan Abi lives in a mansion bought with your \"bits.\" He's not our friend, he is himself a corporation. More specifically, he is a parasite who attaches himself to information (or news), partially through the labor of aggregation, partially through emotional labor of presentation and partially as a corporation that owns his own brand as the result of these efforts. That is, this is not news, it is \"meta\" news, and we must interrogate why recommends for news are not news at all. This is the only space on the internet where this even can be questioned without that critique being reabsorbed into a different brand since it is physically impossible for you to give me money and I am not a brand (or, if I'm a brand here, at least it has no power anywhere else except in the spread of ideas and perhaps critical method).\n\nAs for the form of human rationality that most takes advantage of the potential of current technology, that's not an easy answer. But it's pretty easy to point out that even within the internet, parasociality and emotional labor are a very recent phenomenon, there's even a term for it (web 2.0). That cannot be included in any form of socialist education and organization. Though I'm no luddite, I checked out that IMT youtube channel some party shill recommended and it's bad. Aesthetics do matter, it's not enough to mimic the most superficial aspect of a wired video (answer google autocomplete questions about communism!) without concern for form. That these content creators are gross as people and incompetent even at their ostensible job (Destiny is an obvious example) shows the immenent potential. Can this be harassed without capitulation to content? That's the question. What I do know is that capitalism is itself the ultimate parasite, human desire for knowledge and connection is innate, the commodity form adds nothing.",

If Marxist content creators can reach hundreds of thousands of people and all it takes for them to do that FULLTIME is financial backing, then what is so wrong with that.\n\nThen your job is to spread it even further by stealing it and sharing it for free. That is basic utilitarian logic. Why are you personally responsible for supporting it? You are reproducing what Netflix says about piracy except Netflix is a corporation. By acknowledging that they need your money to survive, you acknowledge they are workers. That means they should organize like workers. Why are you not helping them organize so that substack or amazon pay them a living wage without begging for donations (which, if nothing else, makes that content garbage. Haven't you ever tried to watch pbs?). The irony of what you're saying is it would actually be very easy to form a real human relationship with these people rather than a parasocial fantasy where you have no responsibility except that which is mediated by the money form (you realize from the other side creating content is exhausting and often miserable right? They absolutely think of it as a job). Help them unionize. But that's unimaginable, in the comflict between being a worker and being petty-bourgeoisie, the latter wins.

It's expected they will become offended, white men getting defensive over their language is nothing new. But more than that they were confused about being held accountable for language in the first place. It's not like they invented the term, it is a \"meme\" and they are merely the vessel. If you have a problem with it, take it up with the algorithm, I am a slave who must follow to participate in society. Just like information, the subordination of language to content is very new, very strange, and almost never interrogated. I am good at interrogating it because I am renoved from it but I am also bad for the same reason, since I can't understand at an emotional level what makes speaking in the language of the algorithm appealing. To me it's deeply disturbing and alienating, like a Philip K. Dick novel where you have to pay 5 cents everytime you say the word \"cool.\" I'm glad what I said got through to the person I was talking to but I fear it was the wrong thing as the result, a kind of naive humanism that content itself absorbs easily (since you can, in fact, meet your favorite content creator at twitchcon and, if you pay enough money, discover that they are as alientated as you from human sociality. There is no human beneath the performance). This is a structural problem which requires confronting content in its full power and full inhumanity, the ultimate revenge of structuralism (even Lacan would be disturbed at the direct level of linguistic control a meme necessitates).",
