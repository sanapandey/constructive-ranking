    "selftext": "Does anyone know what makes music and art in general good? Recently I've been feeling very down because the more I think about certain forms of media that I used to love, music and stories that used to drive me at times to tears, the more I begin to despise it all. It feels like something I love was ripped away from me and stolen away. I don't know how to feel about this and I'm both confused and dismal at the same time. I fear I'm being too metaphysical and yet no amount of self-contemplation and criticism has led me to feel any better about all this. \n\nWhy is it that I can't enjoy what I used to enjoy? Seriously, what makes art good? If anyone has any thoughts or knows of any books that delve into this more deeply, please let me know. I used to always abhor art critics and hated being told something is excellent by academics if I didn't agree, and so I've never even discussed art on its own merits throughout my whole life. Something was either \"good\" or \"bad\", and I didn't care to elaborate\u2014 it was obvious to me and if you didn't agree then I would leave in a huff. I hated dissecting art because art is the most human of all labours and shouldn't be subject to the crude autopsy of those snobby academic intellectuals that'll sooner desecrate its corpse, tying it to a chariot and parading it around town than to accept the simple beauty in art that we can all see, no matter how learned we are.\n\nBut what I thought was good now seems bad to me, and I have no idea why. All the while I progressively become more and more clinically analytical on the very things I thought should remain isolated from inquisition. I feel this when I read the novels I used to love. I feel this when I listen to the songs I used to adore. I feel this when I see the paintings that used to inspire me. Why?",

            "body": "This is a good question, and one that I've been thinking about myself, as I'm trying to analyze art with more precision. The question that perhaps needs to be asked is, \"good\" at *what*? Implicitly, the answer to this (at least in the liberal understanding) is \"good\" at making one feel a strong emotion, or \"good\" at making one feel like they have productively used their time by consuming it. This \"good\", however, is fundamentally based in commodity consumption: it's qualitatively identical to considering a specific brand of toilet paper \"good\" because it makes one feel \"good\" when they're wiping their ass. As Marxists and revolutionaries, we need to have an entirely different definition of \"good\" art, based on the class character and ideology of the work. We are fighters for the revolutionary proletariat, so art imbued with a proletarian, or otherwise progressive, class ideology, which strengthens the class and has a positive effect on the struggle, is \"good\" insofar as it plays a role in furthering human liberation and development. Art also has a quality of reflecting the contradictions of historical epochs of struggle: therefore, insofar as we strive to attain an understanding of the past (so that we can change the world in the present), art which, through its analysis, is conducive to that is also \"good\". The quality of art being \"good\", in a Marxist sense, is totally dependent on thoroughly analyzing it: art is not treated as a commodity, but an artifact of class struggle. This is how it should be, as Marxism is \"the ruthless criticism of all that exists\": there are no sacred cows, *everything* both merits and requires criticism.\n\nFundamentally, breaking with art-consumption as commodity-consumption reveals that you are beginning to think like a Marxist. You are on the right track, and what you should do now is investigate those artistic commodities that you once found compelling, and come to understand *why* (in a scientific sense) you found them compelling, and what they reveal about the conditions of class struggle in the time that they were created (and also in the present, as all art has two contradictory aspects: a past class context and a present class context, and these two can actually be somewhat different).",

I think you've given me a lot to think about.\n\n>Implicitly, the answer to this (at least in the liberal understanding) is \"good\" at making one feel a strong emotion, or \"good\" at making one feel like they have productively used their time by consuming it. This \"good\", however, is fundamentally based in commodity consumption\n\nI think you've hit the nail on the head there. I used to view what is good as what \"moved\" me; what makes me feel strongly one way or another. But now, this definition rings hollow. I can't, say, watch the Lord of the Rings or read The Hobbit without feeling disgusted at its monarchist and eurocentrist perspective. Aragon is the hero, why? Because he is born a king? To hell with that. I begin to feel angrier and angrier the more I think about it. I used to love the Chanson de Geste and all the other romances of the Middle Ages, but now, I feel intense disdain for it all. Roland is excellent because he is Christian, and so is Charlemagne. How simple and monstrous it all is! To think that the author genuinely believed in this filth, to have poured their heart and soul into writing it (because it all is very well written on a technical level) yet this is the best their very being can create\u2014 a monument to oppression and the deification of the ruling class. But this is all difficult, because literacy was low throughout history, and writing supplies were hard to come by. The vast majority of all historical works is reactionary because it was written by the ruling class and their servants, and so naturally it is inundated with their character, so it becomes very difficult to find anything in the realm of art that is not \"bad\". This all being said, I think I got your meaning here: that \"good\" art is defined by it bearing the essence of revolutionary struggle, did I get that right?\n\n>investigate those artistic commodities that you once found compelling, and come to understand\u00a0*why*\u00a0(in a scientific sense) you found them compelling, and what they reveal about the conditions of class struggle in the time that they were created (and also in the present, as all art has two contradictory aspects: a **past class context and a present class context**, and these two can actually be somewhat different).\n\nThis is quite difficult for me to swallow. Part of me doesn't want to pry too deep, because I'm afraid it'll hurt me, and the other part of me knows this is necessary to properly analyze the world. It's hard to willingly go out to make a good thing a bad thing, even though fundamentally it has always been a bad thing, and the illusion that it was good was only due to my ignorance at the time. On a side note, this whole conversation makes me remember how in reading Ancient Greek playwrights, the crude humour of Aristophanes drove me insane. How can liberals say his Lysistrata is \"ahead of its time\", when it is based on the misogynistic Athenian perception of the absurd (i.e. women holding political power)? How can they extol him, when his aristocratic words have led to the murder of Socrates, to the self-exile of Euripides (whose works I love so much), and yet no matter where I look, nobody else even comes to consider this all.\n\nI'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by past and present class context, is it that works in the past that may have held at the time a revolutionary context can presently hold a reactionary context? Something along the lines of how Thomas M\u00fcntzer's aims were not socialist at all, but all the same, he fought against the oppressive class society that made his fellow man a bondsman and serf, and in his context this is revolutionary, yet preaching on the basis of religious is now reactionary. Somehow I don't think this is exactly what you meant, so I'd like to hear you tell me how (and if) I got it wrong.",

                            "body": ">I'm not sure I fully understand what you mean by past and present class context\n\nI was referring to the fact that, as its context within class society shifts, the same work of art can acquire a fundamentally different class content, even when it formally remains identical. Here's a simple example: take [this obelisk](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.centralparknyc.org/media/images/locations/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Obelisk_20190328_005.jpg?mtime=1597871180). It was created during the New Kingdom period of Ancient Egyptian class society, and within that society it was an expression of the ideology of the ruling landlord/slave-owning class (the temple authorities broadly, and the king specifically), and served to superstructurally reinforce their exploitation of the peasantry and slaves. Now, while (apart from the wear of millennia) it formally has not changed, it has acquired a fundamentally different class context: it exists within a park in an imperial core city, and serves the superstructural role of reinforcing imperialism and white supremacy.\n\nThe same piece of art is an artifact of the class struggle at multiple different points in history, and an analysis merely of its initial class context would be wholly insufficient in revealing the actual character of its social existence. This sort of limited analysis is what you're doing with the *Chanson de Geste*: you're only analyzing its class ideology at the time its creation, not its class character in the present. You are not, after all, a 13th century European feudal lord: you seem to understand why *they* would find the ideology of the Song of Roland compelling, but the far more important question is why did *you* find it compelling, in the 21st century (presumably) imperial core, and what does that reveal about the contradictions facing your own class position in the present? It's certainly not an easy question to grapple with, but if you actually want to seriously analyze artistic commodities in the modern imperial core, it's an essential one.",

I can't stress enough how eye-opening this was. Yes, that's a very difficult question to answer. I'm not sure how to. I think I'm going to have to let it stew for a while, because this is really difficult to process. I'm not in the imperial core, but I'm already starting to guess as to why given my class position, and you've helped me start thinking about it more than I ever have. It's definitely not comfortable to have to come to the realization with what this all implies about myself and the work in general, but it's essential. Thanks.",

Commodity relations do not just replace everything with the logic of the market but substitute for it. Commodities become friends, family, lovers, community, desire, emotion, and belief. Of course this is affectively charged. We are talking about an objective process, beneath which lies not some authentic, organic form of these things which have been taken from you but only the impersonal, autonomous force of capital. That is why those who become disenchanted with liberalism's cultural forms in decline only end up mirroring it \"ironically\" and are drawn to fascism's self-aware substitution of mythology for reality (the allure being you're the one who knows it's all fake unlike the sheeple who still like things naively - the relationship between PUAs and the contemporary \"manosphere\" is an example which shows the older form of nerddom is nothing to miss). There is nothing underneath the spectacle.\n\nWhat I try to stress in every one of these posts about the same topic is that it's not about liking or not liking things. I like Lord of the Rings more than you because I actually interrogate the text and come to conclusions about it based on evidence.  It is not a substitute for anything else and I do not fear reading the text in case I discover my childhood has been robbed by the plodding writing or racist subtext. I simply like what is good and don't like what is bad and that is true of every work of art. \n\nUnfortunately reddit is not a great place to have this discussion because of the fractured nature of posting. You can't enter the Star Wars subreddit and disrupt the community by defending the prequels, it's just one among many threads and will disappear from the front page in a couple of days if you're lucky to get engagement. It is also too late, the era of unironic appreciation for popular culture is dead along with the fantasy of a normative culture by which subcultures could be contrasted. Now there is only subculture and ironic non-appreciation. Even Andor, which is arguably the best Star Wars media since Empire Strikes Back, doesn't have fans and can't save Star Wars (which of course doesn't exist). It exists, people enjoy it, and then go back to fantasizing about Maldalorian merchandise and whether George Lucas or Kathleen Kennedy robbed me of my childhood. The Acolyte almost had this effect but was not quite there and, again, the world makes it impossible for a single work of deconstruction to persist for decades as a twilight of the gods.\n\nIt's easy to have a meta discussion in which the terms have already been set. What's difficult is actually attempting to articulate commodity fetishism in a concrete, personalized form and, in doing so, revealing its illusory character. And before you ask, In have done this many times here. Considering pop culture discussion is my \"strength\" as a Marxist I have more concern than most for its affective power.\n\nAs for the imperialist core, that only matters because these relationships with commodities are far more developed in \"post-industrial society\" and, in a subculture where consumption directly correlates with devotion, rich first world citizens will be in a much stronger position to take leadership of fandoms. It has nothing to do with some third world subjectivity who is authentically rooted in pre-capitalist, non-fetishized social relations. If anything, the smartphone has democratized (in the crude libertarian sense) popular culture consumption and even older issues of modernity like decolonization, anti-racism, and democracy are absorbed into popular culture (kpop as a \"non-aligned\" popular culture in SE Asia and the Middle East). Hence, the contradiction that while the fracturing of the production process between first and third world is greater than ever, politics takes the same universal form of formless, horizontal, mediatized social movements that are incapable of making structural changes. u/Drevil335's post is excellent but I would push back against that small part.",

Instead, with this understanding, you can make conscious choices to engage with art that's genuinely good.\n\nthere was a recent discussion about this in this thread:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1fc4crk/music_consumption_as_a_communist/",

The reactionary aspects of a work of art were abandoned and replaced with revolutionary aspects, and that which was already historically progressive was further emphasized.

I'm not sure why my being sincere, honest, and bad at wording myself gets me so much flack so often, but it's most definitely my own problem to sort. All I can say is that it reflects poorly on me and I'm sad to hear you say so.\n\nI think you misunderstood me because you took such a problem with my writing style and didn't really bother to carefully read what I wrote, which I will take responsibility for because it's my fault if my writing-style is so grotesque that you couldn't manage to look past it. I mentioned how I enjoy Euripides's plays even though he himself was part of the Athenian slave-owning class because of the content of his works, and how I loved reading Thomas M\u00fcntzer's religious polemics in Engels' \"The Peasant War in Germany\". I understand fully that we must judge works by its content and not by the identity of the author. Believe it or not, while I may be dreadfully na\u00efve, I'm not stupid enough to end up only watching Soviet socialist movies or fantasize about moving to the DPRK. Even I know the ridiculousness of that, and frankly, this is the first time I've ever heard of such a phenomenon. Do people really commit to only watching these movies?\n\nThank you for linking the discussion. I had actually read it before and it's what prompted me to make this post because I wanted to explore the topic with my own peculiar struggles at grappling with the issue of art and music. It was an excellent discussion and I'm glad this forum has a breadth of such good discussions to look through.\n\nBut seriously, there's something to be gained here: why do you think I am a borderline parody? Is it un-Marxist of me to display my emotions in these words, is the way I express my indignant feelings at overt aspects of reaction in written works ridiculous? I'm genuinely curious, because I hear this a lot and I feel like the discourse becomes more about the way I worded my ideas and not the ideas I'm trying to put to words. Because while you told me that our goal is not to dismiss art based solely on its origin (which is not something I intended to say), it doesn't really tell me what I need to know: namely the quality which fundamentally makes something bad or good, and how I should go about determining this analysis (this was answered mostly by u/Drevil335, but I still have some problems fully understanding the concept). I want to understand why you think the way I write is so necessary to address. I'm not saying that I am offended, upset, or that I'm taking an issue with your pointing it out\u2014 there might be something for me to honestly improve on in this regard. After all, it is good of you to point it out to me, because that offers me an opportunity to learn from my mistakes and improve.\n\nThis particular criticism vexes me precisely because in saying that I write in the style of a parody, that then means both my words and the content of them is largely performative, when in reality I take great care to not even say the words \"comrade\", to call myself a \"communist\", or to have any kind of \"communist aesthetics\", like a profile picture or username for example. I do this because I am not those things; I am not in a communist party, nobody online is my \"comrade\", and we are all just strangers, and petit-bourgeois strangers at that. I strongly believe that someone has to earn the title of \"communist\" through real action and discipline, and of course, if I was one, I would not be here asking questions in this subreddit. Naturally, it troubles me when I'm told plainly by many people that I am coming off this way because there's likely a grain of truth in it and I have to correct this part of me before it gets out of hand.",

More broadly, I was thinking about \"communist\" norms of \"communist\" online communities, and the problem is not that you were committing a faux pas, it's that you seemed to be trying to adhere to such \"community norms\" in the first place. The reason you happened to be the specific target of my criticism was because the excessiveness of your style made it easier to do so, but in reality I think a lot of people fall into this logic, so don't take it personally. Even for people who act like a \"normal person\" and a \"serious communist\" -- I'm not sure that is a much better alternative, since we see people adopt similar acts on this sub, yet they still commit the same errors (reproducing the rhetorical style of a \"serious communist\" while failing to convey much of essence). As I said above the criticism of the rhetorical style is not the actual goal; the deeper essence is why some people are compelled to write like what they imagine communists would write like. I believe the latter is a real impediment because it indicates people are adopting what they think communist aesthetic is for purposes other than meaningful politics. \n\nTo be clear I'm not telling you that you shouldn't change your rhetorical style, I think it really does throw people off for the above-mentioned reason: it comes off as a bad parody since it seems to imitate communist rhetoric without the essence, but if you're gonna make a change, do it in terms of dropping whatever character you may or may not be playing, as well as for whatever merits that change may offer as you discussed in your above comment.\n\nEdit: I failed to phrase it as such above but what I'm trying to get at is the criticism of \"communism\" as an *identity* and *fandom commodity* and the logic that accompanies that.",

I am familiar with some forms of commodity fetishism but the style of giving a grand speech with a bunch of exclamation marks and calls to action for an imagined audience (we must rise up! etc.) is so embarrassing that I can't grasp its initial utopian impulse before being absorbed into fandom. My only guess is that it must relate to those video games where you play as nations or leaders in moments of great historical importance and everyone gets to play as Stalin and Hitler simultaneously (and everyone else except a contemporary liberal). I assume they combine actual speeches situated in concrete history (like Lenin's infamous polemical style or even older, late aristocratic modes of writing like Robespierre or Jefferson) with garbage attempts to replicate it by the actual writers (or modders) of the game, miseducating players on distinguishing the two. My only basis for this is watching a bit of Disco Elysium, which had surprisingly awful dialogue, and watching Megalopolis. Even though Coppola is a boomer, he is nevertheless closer to postmodernism than Ancient Rome, and the combination of historical quotes and contemporary dialogue ends up something like a reddit post aping Lincoln. Though Coppola can't fully commit to anti-Trump liberalism and peppers the script with \"ironic\" dialogue, precisely the parts that are defended to show the film is \"camp\" or whatever (the point of camp was for queer people to use the refuse of culture to construct a genuine community, so calling \"ironic\" products of normative culture camp is a form of pinkwashing liberalism and deeply offensive - but that's for another post).

They've never read the speeches.  Stalin and Hitler are just empty vessels -- the image of the thing -- for a player (or an AI, a set of preprogrammed behaviors and patters) to take over and then be actualized in whatever manner the player so chooses.  Sometimes there will be slight gameplay modifications to incentivize certain strategies (in Civilization 4, Stalin is \"aggressive\" and \"industrious,\" so his units are better at wars and he can make buildings appear faster, and he's more likely to arrive at the \"state property\" technology than others, which is just a slight bonus to wheat and industry).  Similarly, playing as the Chinese Communists in Heart of Iron 4, you can unlock \"Maoism,\" but this just gives you a 10% stability bonus and 10% discount on infantry weapons -- any engagement with history, if it's present at all, is subordinated to the game mechanics.  \n\nBut you are correct that the bombastic speeches appealing to emotion is basically how video games present concepts like organizing the masses (even at it's most abstract).  The key to this is that your character in gaming is an elite -- they are special, and they are usually the best in the world at something (usually whatever the core game mechanics are built around), and they, being elite and superior, are the only ones who can go around and round up the unthinking, static masses (the origin of the term \"NPC\") and only by delivering a powerful speech will you get enough bonus points that they will all follow you into battle (usually to be used as your cannon fodder so you take less damage yourself).  But this is also part of what makes Disco Elysium unique -- it inverts the premise of gaming and instead has you playing as a bloated alcoholic loser oaf who has failed and fucked up basically everything in his life (this is also the audience the game is appealing to, so maybe this is why it doesn't connect with a successful academic).\n\n>My only basis for this is watching a bit of Disco Elysium, which had surprisingly awful dialogue,\n\nI have to disagree with you here, but rather than defending the game as a part of the fandom (\"why dont you like the thing I like\"), I'm more interested in pulling at the implications.  Since I don't think anyone doubts your capacity for criticism of popular culture, there's only two possibilities as far as I can see, and I want to pick at them to see what comes out, as I've been trying to reckon with the question of gaming itself from a Marxist standpoint (/u/IncompetentFoliage really helped me with this, despite them hating gaming, as I would never have thought to go back to Plekhanov for a Marxist explanation).  \n\nPossibility one is that you are flatly correct, the writing is awful (again, I disagree, and I will defend the writing as clever and intelligent, but let's follow through).   I will add that this acclaim is basically universal among those who played it.  Disco Elysium is borderline unanimous as \"the best written video game of them all.\"  I'm not trying to appeal to authority, but point out that Disco Elysium is a low budget game with unimpressive graphics, very simple uninspired gameplay (choosing dialogue options and occasionally rolling dice with some point and click exploration) and few other features that make it stand out in a market overflowing with games *except* for its writing.  It could easily have easily been another of a thousand failed games that find no audience and instead it became one of the most popular games of all time, almost solely on the merit of it's writing and dialogue.  \n\nBut if we are taking this as you being flatly correct, then the implication is actually a generalized criticism of video games.  That all video games are awful writing, none have ever had good dialogue, and this would add a lot of weight to the possible conclusion about gaming that has been slowly dawning on me, but I still find myself resisting -- that games are almost entirely reactionary and irredeemable (basically like porn) as a hobby, and that trying to apply Marxist critique (for example the very good and interesting conversation on 'cottagecore' music in this thread from users with a background in music -- I've been trying to arrive at that sort of insight with regards to games)  is basically futile (like trying to criticize porn or a slot machine -- it can be done but it's basically useless).  In which case, then the conclusion -- again one that I've seen creeping on the horizon -- is basically to jettison gaming entirely rather than trying to find the most revolutionary or redeeming strands within it.  As I've said, I've tried to resist this conclusion but if that's a result of me defending my own privilege and sunken costs of my life, that explains my own bias, and being revolutionary simply requires overcoming gaming (something I've basically already acknowledged). \n\nThe second possibility is that there's a miscommunication within the medium -- something is being lost in translation since gaming isn't a medium you participate in or particularly care about.  Back when I was in college, I had a brilliant philosophy professor whom I had a report with and respected. One day the topic of *The Simpsons* came up, and his caustic dismissal of the show was that it was \"a st_pid show for st_pid people.\"  And since I enjoyed the Simpsons, and I thought it was intelligent and clever, my own commodity fetishism kicked in to defend the thing I had consumed and now saw in myself being the target of ridicule, and I spent real time and effort trying to demonstrate to my professor the cleverness and satire of the Simpsons to no avail.  For whatever reason (different lived experience, coming from a different era, etc) the medium was impenetrable.  I still stand by the Simpsons being a clever, intelligent show (at least in it's prime), so maybe this is something similar?  It might also be the format -- Disco Elysium's dialogue system was inspired by twitter, and I recall that you always hated that format.  Another possibility is the sample size, and that you chose an odd or unusual scene and without context, the substance is lost.  Or it could also be that you are just above the game and it's lessons are already beneath you and thus can't connect (one of the places where the writing succeeds and has a lot of fun is picking apart common sense centre-left liberalism, or notions of neutrality and the underlying essence behind it).  \n\nI think the litmus test would be to compare the dialogue to another game.  A clear and ideological example of awful dialogue to me would be [this scene from Assassin's Creed, where Karl Marx shows up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdRZhXDtmuw)  Aside from how clunky and stiff the writing is, Marx is reduced to a common parliamentary liberal, and in a video game called *Assassin's Creed* where you basically go around murdering away all your problems, Marx himself is saying political reform can only be achieved through democratic parlaimentarism.  This is awful dialogue to me (though I concede most games do have awful dialogue).  On the other hand, recent examples like *Baldur's Gate 3* and *Half Life: Alyx* are two games that have been acclaimed for their excellent writing (plus many other things) and dialogue, and have the same near-universal praise of the writers and writing that Disco Elysium received.  If *Baldur's Gate 3* or *Half Life: Alyx* also have 'awful dialogue,' then the answer then becomes clear that it is possibility number one -- all games have awful dialogue.  On the other hand if you look at *Baldur's Gate 3* and conclude that this is actually good dialogue, then I think you are simply missing something from the context of Disco Elysium, because its better than Baldur's Gate 3 and even the people who praise BG3's writing to no end will concede that one category (writing) to Disco Elysium.   Not trying to waste too much of your time with this, but I would be genuinely curious if there's any game you'd say had good dialogue, because I think that's part of what I'm trying to reckon with about gaming as a medium.  Maybe it is all bad and gaming has just left us all literarily stunted, but I feel like I need a counterweight for comparison.\n\nedit: phrasing",

And even some of the games I've listed are actually tacitly reactionary (Baldur's Gate 3's two most 'communist' coded characters are Stalin-coded Vlakith, an evil lich-queen ruling over a cruel \"totalitarian\" empire for her own sole benefit, and Wulbren Bongle, a gnome terrorist who is written to be a totally unlikable and irredeemable).

I used to play a few video games because that was the thing in my social circles, but realized long ago I was throwing away my time and getting nothing out of it so I just stopped. I've never been tempted to pick it back up. I understand the attraction but it gets old, once you've played a few video games you've played them all. (Friends of mine also got bored with playing video games but managed their boredom in another way, by getting into speedrunning where you hyperanalyse a game and wind up knowing more about it than the developers who made it).

There's nothing nefarious about Tetris or that game that plays on Google Chrome when your internet disconnects. Like you said on the other thread, chess is pretty innocuous despite its feudal origins. And not all games are a waste of time. Like I said, sports are altogether different from video games because they serve a practical purpose in connection with production (although *professional* sports are nothing like a pick-up basketball game). But per Plekhanov, games (in the broadest sense of the word) are essentially a reflection of labour. As such, the essence of games is quite in accord with the requirements of proletarian culture. I think the task for a future socialist society in dealing with the question of games will be to restore this essence to gaming.\n\n\nAlso, I have to say your example from Assassin\u2019s Creed was pretty hilarious.",

That is very interesting.\n\nBarely related - I have read a lot of old Soviet books (from the pre-revisionist era) on chess, both historical-nonfiction (history of chess, embellished biographies, etc) and theory books, and I have never noticed any \"political material\" in them, despite the fact that chess skill was a not-insignificant element of USSR patriotism and closely linked to their culture of mental and physical self-improvement. This is something I mean to look into further. I would imagine it's either due to the culture never having reached Cultural Revolution levels of superstructure transformation (e.g. keeping class struggle largely in the realms of production, government, and the more overt aspects of the superstructure such as popular cinema; it seems totally plausible to me that your average Soviet citizen might have seen labor, history, art/popular culture, gender relations, etc., as political but chess as apolitical) or due to the class background of the authors (of which I honestly have no idea).",

As I said, it's a question I've been working through.

This is where the internet, gamers, gaming 'culture,' and self-professed \"socialists\" all come to congregate, so if the conversation cant manifest here (might even be possible if some of the \"Marxists\" just took their supposed commitment with more sincerity, but alas) then I have a hard time thinking it will occur anywhere.  A serious communist party could not possibly have time for this, and that's really what I keep coming back to.\n\n> (a) your average pop-slop novel isn't much better in terms of portraying communism in honest or at least not outright reactionary ways\n\nI think this is the point I was trying to argue, but withdrew.  While it's clear there are novels that go beyond the pop-slop, the matter in dispute is whether there are any video games which rise above the pop-slop, or if, maybe, they are all pop-slop and even the best of them isn't capable of rising out of the muck.  That's the question I've been asking -- if Disco Elysium doesn't rise above the pop-slop, can we say anything within the whole category of gaming has?  Maybe it's just a lifetime of junk food, and I should just admit I'm unhealthy (in this regard).\n\n>(b) I would say that with the mobile-phone-ization of the world and the rise of mobile games as an object of interest, I don't know to what degree we can take that as the key factor (how are Fortnite and Candy Crush, two free games that can be played on any phone during a half hour commute, ideologically different from World of Warcraft and Balder's Gate?)\n\nThis is the thing that keeps me coming back to these sorts of questions and trying to insist on it.  Phones are everywhere, games are the thing that consume the most time and money of all things on those phones.  I didn't see Megalopolis, but cinema seems to be dying to me, reduced to Saturday morning cartoons (though gaming really ought not throw stones from glass houses) and gaming might just be the culture of this generation, such as it is.  But I keep thinking back to that scene in Snowpiercer, where the revolution gets near the front of the train and all the labour aristocrats are in the club dancing and snorting drugs, mostly oblivious to the world in crisis, and I keep thinking that's me, and that trying to find something useful or meaningful in the drugs and dancing is a misuse of time (even just me coping with the world being in crisis, and so terrible), and ultimately isn't capable of doing anything to instigate change.",

That being said:\n\n>  That all video games are awful writing, none have ever had good dialogue, and this would add a lot of weight to the possible conclusion about gaming that has been slowly dawning on me, but I still find myself resisting -- that games are almost entirely reactionary and irredeemable (basically like porn) as a hobby, and that trying to apply Marxist critique (for example the very good and interesting conversation on 'cottagecore' music in this thread from users with a background in music -- I've been trying to arrive at that sort of insight with regards to games) is basically futile (like trying to criticize porn or a slot machine -- it can be done but it's basically useless).\n\nComparing it to outright porn is a little too much for obvious reasons, but the slot machine comparison is a lot stronger. Interesting tidbit: the creator of Dragon Quest (one of the granddaddies of the RPG genre) was an avid gambler and even told his composer (who was an open fascist) to incorporate gambling music into the game's soundtrack. It's common to attack gaming for incorporating more and more gambling elements, but the seeds were always there.\n\nVideo games took off in the 80s-90s, which was a reactionary time for humanity as a whole. There hasn't really been an opportunity for a repetition of Lenin wanting to revolutionize cinema, for example. *If* such a thing happens for gaming, then it'll probably mainly be in regards to mobile gaming, since as /u/Particular-Hunter586 said that's a lot more widespread than triple AAA gaming. \n\nBut even that's dependent on factors that I can't really predict, eg would a revolutionary world demand a return to \"dumb\" phones for environmental reasons? If so, then there's not much to really say, the world couldn't support the existence of video games beyond extremely simple ones like Snake or Tetris. \n\nI haven't played Disco Elysium so I can't comment on your question about it specifically. It does seem to have that kind of irreverent modern Internet humor, from what little I've seen. A part of me feels like I should play it for obvious reasons, but I've never been one for dialogue-heavy games. They've always felt like poor imitations of novels or movies.",

I didn't know that about Dragon's Quest, but even that isn't as horrific as something like *Custer's Revenge* (NSFL; r_pe, misogyny, racism, genocide, settler colonialism, all in one vile package).  Even today there's an increasing trend (at least that I've noticed on things like Steam) toward \"adult\" (pornographic) video games, especially with the advent of VR, so as a medium it might be sinking deeper towards that irredeemable endpoint.\n\n>I haven't played Disco Elysium so I can't comment on your question about it specifically. It does seem to have that kind of irreverent modern Internet humor, from what little I've seen.\n\nThis is partially true, and probably the thing that is grating smoke's experience, and increasingly it feels like it was a poor, underthought recommendation, though part of what makes Disco unique is that it knows when to shut that off and have moments of genuine sincerity and solemnity, and treat certain situations with authenticity and respect.  One of my favourite scenes in the game (mild spoiler) is where you find a woman's missing husband, now deceased, and have to inform her of his passing.  He died pointlessly, falling through some loose planks on a decrepit boardwalk, and there's nothing you can really do except notify her and allow her to grieve.  It's sad and honest, and the comedy spigot is completely shut off for the entire scene, and it ends up being one of the most cathartic moments in any game I've ever played.  \n\nWhile I do like some narrative-heavy games, I mostly agree with you, though the genre that really stands out and fascinates me are usually simulations, especially as I get older and most other genres don't do it for me any longer.  Rather than being heavily scripted, they rely on vast interconnected systems, and the complex interactions between them make things like the story and events of the game totally emergent from these processes.  Dwarf Fortress is one of my favourite examples (arguably the most complex game ever made, yet not much larger than Tetris in its most basic file size).  The overall theme is more or less the same; you build a Dwarf Fortress, delve the earth too deeply, unleash magical horrors, and are ultimately overrun by them, but during that time you can have entire *Iliads* emerge from the underlying processes at work.  \n\nSimilar to Dwarf Fortress is Rimworld, and I saw a thread on /r/socialistgaming about how it was a communism simulator, which wasn't actually correct, and I was going to go in and correct them, but because that sub is a mess so I didn't bother.  But what the game is actually very good at is simulating and demonstrating the labour theory of value at work (whenever you produce something you see a little yellow meter above the character performing labour, made more efficient with higher skill or improved equipment), and realize the role of human labour power in the process of production.  It also simulates generalized commodity production very well, where you establish larger trade connections (a market), and then end up mass producing the most profitable commodities that you can to get the highest returns from the market.  It might sound strange, but years ago, back when I was really struggling with visualizing those things conceptually, that game helped me to immediately connect the processes to what was being described.  Simulations even have shown useful functions beyond leisure -- I've heard of astronomers at observatories who use Universe Sandbox to actually play with hypotheticals, and there was even that one person who landed a plane with an incapacitated pilot because they knew how to fly from playing Flight Simulator.",

I didn't beat the game but I found BG3 to have really, really bad writing and such vulgar reactionary moments with that brothel that I was surprised it didn't even receive more mainstream backlash by left liberal media. \n\nThat said I do read a lot, including some pulp trash once in a while, and the best games writing has got to be better than that. Novels are different I guess because it's the direct transmission of ideas from one person instead of the mass production process that goes into video games, there might be something to be said there. Albeit movies function the same, movies at their most progressive were socialized and enjoyed as public art in a social space. Books and often video games are \"consumed\" alone although they can be discussed after. Movies being watched alone at home is obviously a very new development. \n\nI'm floundering with this post because like I said I'm still struggling to understand how non-proletarian reactionary art can be good even if I can recognize something as good.

Thanks for clarifying more on your end.\n\nI really didn't choose to write the way I do to try to imitate anyone in particular. It never even crossed my mind to try to write as though pretending to be a \"serious communist\" or adhering to a community norm. I know it might sound ridiculous, but I write this way whenever I want to be serious, even if I'm discussing something completely banal. This is because I find I need to try to clarify myself as much as possible and I thought the best way to do that is to write as fully as possible. I could be talking about how much I like a movie I just watched and in a conversation with a friend I'd write this way (at least I think so? I find that people make poor observers of their own selves, I might be making all this up). I also find that I tend to get a bit too sentimental and emotional at times, even at the stupidest things which really shouldn't bother me at all. That might explain the bad poetic phrases.\n\nI'm not actually sure why I write the way I write because I never considered it. It could be because of the things (fiction, history, so on) I've been reading? Maybe I am pretending on a subconscious level\u2014 I'm going to have to actually do some introspection on it for a while. What I do know, though, is I am purposefully trying to come off as humble, as honest, and as genuine, because my intention here is to learn something from people I think have had the good fortune of knowing more than me and that's the quickest way I can think of to get some good answers to my questions. Just like I said earlier, though, this is how I act whenever I want to engage in good-faith conversation on just about anything. I'm now beginning to wonder if I've been sounding ridiculous in other circles too.\n\nIt's clear that it does throw people off, and that it's a problem I need to tackle. I'm not sure how to change my way of writing, and honestly I think if I tried to force it then it'd be incredibly obvious and also very annoying to me personally. Having to double back on what I'd just written and touch it up to make it more grounded seems to me to be a bureaucratic annoyance, and frankly it does daunt me to have to do all of that. Still, I'm going to give it some time so I can think about how I'd exactly change it and whether or not I really should try to make a deliberate change in the end. I can get rid of the poetical flourishes; that won't kill me, but the way in which I structure my sentences might be a bit too difficult. This might be a good time for me to try and really think about the ways in which other people phrase themselves and the possible reasons behind their choices.",

It is your melodramatic style of writing which attempts to give banal ideas importance through affective charge. You are trying to transmit your emotional attachment to works of art through your writing style itself but this becomes ridiculous for a few reasons. \n\nFirst, reddit is already a vehicle for expressing ones emotional attachment to things as a fan. Rather than transmitting your own personal emotion as a monumental, poetic expression, you sound like a generic lord of the rings fan. Actually it's worse, since unironic fandom has long been abandoned for a cynical attachment to corporations. You're the last person on Earth who figured out lotr is racist and sexist and while this may be a revelation to you and the cause of an emotional breakdown, to everyone else it's highly suspicious (you never attempted to talk to a woman or black person before about the things you like?)\n\nSecond, your style is also pretentious (using the actual definition of the word). Part of this is objective: the historical conditions that made poetry possible no longer exist, and attempts to express the individual self through a poetic form after decolonization and the entering of the mass of humanity into History looks ridiculous. Of course one could make the opposite point: poetry is more widespread than ever given the rebirth of short form text on social media and speech against writing. But that form of poetry (like a dril tweet) has its own style and logic. Attempting to sound like a \"great\" writer from the past is the worst of both worlds. This prevents you from developing your own writing style and your word choices are ripped from a thesaurus rather than integrated into a coherent, contemporary style. Again, this is highly suspicious given older poetry is rightly criticizee for its racism and sexism and that criticism can't be put back in the box. More fundamentally, it's obviously an affect which we are not interested in indulging. I don't know how you communicate in normal, lived situations where there is an incentive for clear communication but it is not this.\n\nThird, it is misguided to attempt to express your emotional attachment to art when that is precisely what is being critiqued. By putting this in the realm of personal expression, you are putting it outside the realm of criticism. Of course if you said \"I like Lord of the Rings and never thought about why there are no black people until now\" everyone would make fun of you. So instead you attempted to legitimize this banal thought with rhetorical flourish, as if enough emotion will transmit why this was so important to you. But the banal thought is productive and you must express it openly and take your lumps. Since your subjective consciousness cannot be transmitted directly into the brain of others (despite what Disney tells you) any attempt to do so will look ridiculous. Many have tried and at least you're willing to accept criticism. But your language is nevertheless a protective shield, a futile attempt to make your fandom more meaningful than everyone else's. At least you are honest enough to choose garbage pop culture rather than pretending you spend all your free time reading classics in Latin (which would be a different pathology). But even here you're hiding your true emotional attachments in a facade of different objects of consumption. Nobody becomes emotionally attached to Euripides's plays in the same way they do lotr because that form of attachment is a concrete expression of postmodernism, historically situated in commodity fetishism. Of course you can pretend: commodity fetishism necessarily absorbs everything into itself, including the past, so it's possible to imagine a Euripides fanclub with meetups, tshirts, fanfiction, etc. Anything for the illusion of novelty in the commodity form. But, like any object which resists fandom because it comes from an older mode of production, such an attachment would consist of everything except actually reading the thing itself. \n\n>Believe it or not, while I may be dreadfully na\u00efve, I'm not stupid enough to end up only watching Soviet socialist movies or fantasize about moving to the DPRK. Even I know the ridiculousness of that, and frankly, this is the first time I've ever heard of such a phenomenon. Do people really commit to only watching these movies?\n\nIt is precisely a lack of committment that is the problem. Cultural consumption of \"ML\" identity is about everything except sincere appreciation of socialist art on its own terms. If someone actually listened to North Korean music because they wanted to and judged it according to objective aesthetic standards that person would be fascinating and worthy of Marxism. Instead, Hasan Abi listens to a North Korean song in the car on livestream so he can watch the embarrassed reactions of others and viewers can be embarrassed for him (since preemptively embarassing yourself, known as trolling, is easier than attempting to express yourself and finding yourself insufficient to the task) and fit the tired joke that it is \"k-pop,\" a joke that the listeners laugh at out of pity given no one is actually confused but normal people don't immediately recognize North Korean music. I bring this up to point out that people who \"ironically\" consume socialist art have the exact same approach as those who performatively expose their emotional attachments to commodities: it is easier to like bad things ironically than like good things. But, to your general question, there are no good or bad things. It is only the process of critique which draws out the value of a work. It is Hasan and his viewers who have failed the song, not the song itself. It may be that lotr is actually quite good. We have not yet begun to discuss it, since your post is really a discussion of your own emotional attachments disguised as a discussion of the objects of those attachments, as if lotr forced you to enjoy it and tricked you into liking a racist thing. Lotr is just a combination of images and sound in motion. You are the object of criticism.",

            "body": "It would be more accurate to say what art is useful and what art is not useful - and this is historically specific. Looking at past periods we can say that the most useful art is that art which most accurately portrays the underlying social forces at play, which happens to be revolutionary art or, more accurately, the art that is wielded by the revolutionary class. Why is this so? Because art must freeze things that are in motion in itself and portray underlying contradictions in form and material to be useful for the viewer, and it is the revolutionary classes of their respective times that see most clearly and are attuned to the contradictions of their social and material world.\n\nArt that was useful to the ascendant Russian bourgeoisie (and their liberalism) was realism. Take the peredvizhniki, who rebelled against the imperial academy by attempting to portray social life and natural landscape more realistically - not only realistic subject matter but also in technique. Further, they were very concerned with the *Russian* countryside and people, for reasons that are easy to guess. While this occurred in painting you also had writers like Tolstoy and Chekhov in literature striving to realistically portray various slivers of Russian life - again, subject matter and technique. It was noted elsewhere in these comments that Lenin saw something to be taken away from Tolstoy, and Mao something from Lu Xun - something useful could come out of analyzing their stories. These were the artists of a revolutionary class in societies that had not yet overthrown the decaying fetters of feudal life, and their art is useful for analysis because it strove for an accurate portrayal of subject matter that may be relevant for study. We cannot say that more recent art movements that claim to be revolutionary are useful if they are not tied to the goal of furthering the revolution. Realism was surpassed only by socialist realism (a realism for the proletariat), not surrealism or any stupid cubist stuff. \n\nNow, where it is not wielded by the proletariat, we get the realism of, say, YouTube channels and livestreams sprouting up to document the opioid epidemic, migrant detention at the border, homelessness etc. Sometimes these are simply walking tours of sorts where the cameraperson does not talk nor show their face at all. Of course the goal of all such videos is spectacle - to commodify the viewing of \"the gritty real\" to gain a subscriber following and gather ad money from monopoly capital - and so they view their subject matter through the lens of the commodity (as a niche market to corner) and not the social. But could anything useful come out of analyzing them? If we analyze the content and the form then what might we find? It's impossible to say in advance. You may find that the art is deeply political and an accurate reflection of the class terrain, not only of the obvious subjects of the video but of the camera person and the audience as well.",

There's a tendency, and I'm not sure if it's a more recent phenomenon or not, to position art as being solely subjective and immune from objective criticism. This is of course anti-thetical to Marxism, and I always felt as such, but I could never quite answer \"why\" in a way that felt sufficient. My instinct was always to assume that only anti-capitalist art can be good, but this leads to incorrect conclusions about the nature of art.\n\nOther users in this thread have put it far better than I possibly could, but art becomes good through criticism. It's only through criticism that the objective class nature of art can be revealed, and this class nature is not so simple as \"is the art communist or not?\" - I'm sure the Dead Kennedys thought they were anti-capitalist. This process of criticism also allows you to ask fundamental questions about what constitutes art to begin with. Commodity fetishism has resulted in everything being considered \"art\" - it seems just about every product now has a \"craft\" version. How do you distinguish \"art\" from something that is merely a commodity? This is a question you must answer before you can determine what makes art \"good\". \n\nI think this question is more relevant than ever, as is evident by your emotional reaction to learning that Lord of the Rings is racist. But it would be helpful for you to investigate why you ever had such an emotional connection to these things in the first place rather than trying to rationalize those feelings by replacing them with \"good\" art.",

Your point is juvenile and art isn't 'valid' just because a human has a reaction to it. 'Feelings' aren't immutable - they're developed socially.\n\n>I don\u2019t know\n\nclearly. why say something so confidently if you can't even back it up the moment someone asks about it.",

This is a subreddit for Marxists and your comment was no different than any lame liberal garbage you see anywhere else on the internet - that's why I was asking for clarification. Could've plucked it from the most upvoted comment on an r/askreddit question. It's a bummer that you didn't even try to explain your thought process.",
