    "selftext": "A human I once called friend recently dropped some shit I couldn't believe what I heard. About sending away immigrants as soon as they commit the slightest crime. I tried to argue that criminals are a problem everywhere and it's not making any sense moving problems to other geographic areas, moreover treating people differently only because of their origins. The person felt my anger so they didn't talk back, but I knew they didn't change their mind.\n\nSo now I didn't contact that person since then and wonder if it's the right thing to just filter out my social connections like that. Am I wrong for being so drastic? Am I dramatic? I fear this will be a problem with lots of people perhaps even family. How do you handle situations like that? Can you just ignore certain political opinions of people you're close to?\n\nEdit:\n\nThanks to all of you for sharing your point of view. In the future I will not act differently than I did, I now know it was the right thing to do. When there's no hope in changing the opinions of the other person I will not engage with them anymore. \nThanks for hardening my perspective.",

TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics.

Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

Maybe I'm an outlier since I can't find myself getting terribly close to even liberals (especially since they tend to be offput by anyone engaging in actual radical political struggles, so the garbage takes itself out) but the idea of anyone enjoying the company of an unrepentant fascist is insane to me. Maybe the question of how to handle ideological differences in close relationships has validity with regards to revisionism and other \"Left\" ideologies - my group has a strict line against recruiting our dates, and against dating inside the org or contacts from mass work or members of other orgs, for example, so it's wound up that I've ended up dating or being close friends with anticommunist Black nationalists or \"anarchocommunists\" - but even so, this subreddit isn't a good place to discuss it.\n\nI won't pretend to only befriend people with a strictly radical alignment, as living in an imperialist nation and having family and classmates and being on a sports team would make that a soul-sucking existence, but come on. Even garden-variety liberal-fascists will frequently socially excise someone (as they should!) for overt racism. If we can't expect so-called \"communists\" to do so, can we expect these people to live in alignment with their morals to any extent whatsoever? Ultimately - as the smartest users on this site will remind us - none of this really matters all that much outside of questions of personal morals if we're not participating in a cultural revolution or members of an organized antirevisionist communist party, but I can't imagine someone with close relationships to the \"alt-right\" being the kind of person who would be allowed within a mile of a militant radical Left group.\n\nEdit: actually, I've changed my mind about the \"none of this really matters all that much\" part, since (assuming this person has any friends at all who are \"people of color\" or immigrants) they are exposing those people to significant danger, especially if the aforementioned fascist has expressed the sentiment that immigrants should be deported. Maybe \"none of this matters all that much\" if the question is \"how do you deal with people close to you hating on Stalin\", but I do not want the OP to get any ideas about how exposing their other relations to the imminent threat of fascist violence \"doesn't matter all that much\".\n\nEE: the more principled position, of course, is to study Marxism, work for communist-led class struggle, and lead the people (or be led by the people) in unleashing whatever revolutionary violence is deemed necessary against the \"alt-right\".",

The discussion leading to me not contacting them anymore is now over two months in the past. The person told me in the discussion it's very radical to let political ideologies end friendships when there are a lot of other common interests. At that moment I heavily disagreed with them but after two months just wondered if I may really be in the wrong (I didn't really think this, I guess I searched for confirmation?).\n\nSo the next time I have hardened my perspective and will not feel a little bit like the weird one \"being so dramatic\".",

You seem to insist that you came here to see if you were being too extreme as opposed to looking for validation to brush aside disgusting fascism.\u00a0If the former really is true then thankfully you came to the right place; the people who rushed to this thread to tell you to do the latter have been banned. As for the former, you have my blessings, if the blessings of a random internet stranger are worth anything to you, to take no shit when it comes to issues of racism, sexism, fascism, imperialism.\n\n\nWhether you choose to argue with or fight people over it is up to you I guess; as I told you I mostly just stop hanging out with such people, but if they're a person who has shown some sympathy for communism, and they're suddenly being shitty, then I might have a stern talk with them where I criticize them, or even yell at them if they're being extra shitty. Sympathy for communism is usually the dividing line for me because I expect the best from communists or would be supporters of the revolution.\n\n\nOn the other hand if someone I (used to) hang out with turns out to have maybe some pro migrant sentiment for example but is but it totally into NATO then I will probably not really bother on the personal level because I don't argue with liberal-fascists, again I mostly just stop hanging with them if I still am by this point. Many years ago I spent too much time trying to convince my petit bourgeois and middle class ex friends who were clearly fascists in hindsight but whom I thought I could propagandize for whatever reason and it never came out to anything. Today, if someone I know turns out to be like that, I'd rather focus on putting in effort to creating a communist movement, and then we can deal with these people in a collective and organized way.",

Any person of color reading such threads would be in disbelief if it wasn't so expected from white socialist self- anointed \"allies.\" Still, outside this subreddit you can't even convince anyone (on Reddit) that socialism is incompatible with owning a multi-million dollars mansion or Gucci shades. OP at least is swimming against the tide. \n\n>It's hardly even relevant to your communist being.\n\nThis I must object to. In the US settler context, it is far easier for a white person to be a socialist than it is to be anti-racist. Of course it is easy to call oneself anti-racist but to really fight against the material benefits of racism takes major sacrifice and, as OP implies, breaking with the normative values of one's surroundings and upbringing. It's obvious this would have ideological effects and Sanders already articulated a complete white socialist ideology for a new generation.\n\nI'm arguing with someone right now on Reddit who is throwing a hissy fit rather than admit they have no black friends and this might affect their worldview. And this person is supposedly involved with the PSL.",

Even further, what motivates these white people to immediately and desperately insist on the impossibility of standing up to racism every time it comes up? I think you will find that really standing up to racism will have many social consequences you did not anticipate as \"tolerant\" liberals are merely more defensive about their racism rather than fundamentally different than explicit racists. In fact here we are dealing with those that consider themselves \"socialist\" or even \"communist.\" One guy in the comments even considers himself \"principled\" because he speaks up if someone says something to him (but if they don't say anything then it's fine - as long as he is not bothered racism must exist).\n\nStill, it's a pretty easy subject to understand. Act as if you were a person of color. Your skin color would simply make the choice for you and there would be no need to consider compromise with racism. That you have been offered that choice is what you must reject in order to defend the humanity of people of color who are not given the option to participate in white peoples' compromises.",

I mean, [two Brooklynite rad-libs from the '90s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFGQdvYIJ0M) famously had a hit song about not trusting anyone who keeps the company of racists. The fact that your average one-time commentor on r/communism is less open to the idea that racist ideology should be viciously combatted than your average urbanite white Democrat is a testament to how important it is that this subreddit is moderated harshly, and also a testament to how this site is a bastion of fascism proper in a sea of social-fascist internet spaces.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0E: okay this feels like an unimportant enough post that I can derail it. It\u2019s interesting to me how They Might Be Giants is one of the only Amerikkkan rock bands I can think of to explicitly disavow anarchism (\u201cnot partial to anarchics with guitar picks\u201d) in favor of a (surface-level, no doubt bastardized, but still) espousal of communism - of Leninism, even. I wonder whether there was a meaningful difference between the \u201890s rock scene, and that of previous and later decades, that led to that in two otherwise lib-seeming white men. They famously represented the less hedonistic side of rock \u00a0\u2014 the tagline for their documentary was \u201cno sex, no drugs, just rock and roll\u201d, haha \u2014 and eventually shifted to making music to help kids with learning disabilities learn spelling and counting \u2014 so I can imagine that, in the circles they ran in and with the images they projected, dumbed-down communism was a better fit than the hyper-individualist anarchism of rock.",

The comment OP's post history is what happens if you spend time making friends with racist white suburbanites; you eventually adopt a racist white suburbanite opinion.

Going to Mexico after Costa Rica definitely leaves an extremely sour taste in my mouth. Even in parts of Costa Rica that are overridden with annoying tourists the locals still manage to be some of the most kind, accommodating, and hospitable people. I\u2019m geniunely appalled by the rudeness of the people in Mexico. At least if you get scammed in Costa Rica the people/person who scammed you work hard to make it up by having great conversation, buying you beer, etc instead of treating you like trash.\n\nTripadvisor or the travel sub?",
