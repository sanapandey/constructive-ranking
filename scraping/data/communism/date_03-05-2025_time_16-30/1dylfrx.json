    "selftext": "Hello! I live in sweden and am a member of a non-electoral communist party. Overall I think their party program is good. They also have a structure based on centralised democracy from what I understand. They also do not run in elections. I went to my first official meeting today, and the people I talked to also agreed that unions are basically the economic camp, and this party wants to work as the political camp(is this efficient?). But out of the 30 members in our group, which is one of a few in our district, only two came. \n\nIt is clear to me that the organising will in general come from and has to come from the most marginalised class, and globally that is the proletariat outside the western world (and frankly enslaved people and child labour from what I understand), and here in Sweden it is the immigrants or migrants and those who grew up here with parents who are migrants or immigrants. \n\nI personally grew up in a dysfunctional family (drug and crime problems) and in a majority migrant/immigrant school, so I know they share some of my big grievance with the state, like how cps treats children and families, and the treatment of the police (must be even worse for non Swedish and white families). But aside from my personal grievances, I understand that being forced to leave your home country and/or grow up outside of it, only to be ignored by the left and spat on by the right, in the country whose state upholds imperialism and neocolonialism that forced them to leave in the first place, is a huge grievance. \n\nMy first idea is writings in Arabic and other languages ofc. Like stickers and other quick things? I\u2019m also gonna ask my immigrant friends, but they work full time and don\u2019t bother too much with politics outside voting and protesting(understandable). I\u2019m also going to reach out to the other groups in our district and hopefully there is at least one person who\u2019s an immigrant/migrant or whose family is. The only thing we got now is an antiracism policy and anti imperialism policy, and support Palestine. But nothing specific.\n\nI wonder if there are any immigrants or migrants or 2nd generation in sweden or europe who are organising, and if they have any criticism, or/and if they have advice for how to improve the agitation/propaganda?

            "body": "People are not going to risk their livelihood for some kid who's been a communist for 5 minutes in a dysfunctional organization. I don't really understand what you're looking for posting again except some revisionist shilling their org (which is what you got). Why are you trying to come up with strategies on your own? Either convince the organization you're with of the correctness of your line and the importance of acting like a professional vanguard or abandon it entirely and work with the organizations the most oppressed proletariat actually have and trust. It won't be pleasant to begin a line struggle but I can't do it for you. And you'll have to be really confident in why your line is correct which so far does not seem to be the case.\n\nYour friends don't bother with \"politics\" because the term is defined poorly. Fighting for survival against repression from the state or the boss is \"politics,\" it is simply not organized because of the failure of revisionist organizations that tail the labor aristocracy. That doesn't mean you should only do mutual aid or legal work or whatever, immigrants are not some pure space untouched by NGOization. But they are also not as pathetic as you imagine, I guarantee you there are politics to be done under the leadership of the most oppressed beyond making freaking stickers. How can anyone trust you to protect them and win when they risk everything when you can't even convince 30 people to show up to a meeting? Not that I expect you to have any influence in your first meeting, which makes me wonder how long your patience will last when one meeting is enough for you to try to solve everything on your own immediately.\n\n>I personally grew up in a dysfunctional family (drug and crime problems) and in a majority migrant/immigrant school, so I know they share some of my big grievance with the state, like how cps treats children and families, and the treatment of the police (must be even worse for non Swedish and white families).

We are discussing the migratory proletariat as revolutionary because of its objective class position. This derives from a material analysis of how globalized capitalism actually works. The things you mentioned are areas which can potentially be of political importance but they are not the essence of the issue.\n\nE: I'm really not trying to be mean to you. Like I said in the other post, I want you to stop relying on social media and thinking at the speed of the Internet. You posted basically the same thread 5 days ago and after one meeting are full of ideas. Try implementing the ones you have before judging whether they work. I think we're actually doing you a kindness, any other subreddit would just tell you to \"get organized\" without any coherent theory of revolution, take your money and time if you listened, and have you do ineffectual tasks which feel meaningful for a while until you burn out and vanish. I'm telling you that any serious communist politics starts from \"better fewer, but better.\" Not only does this apply to people in your org, it applies to you as well.",

I see what you\u2019re saying though. My sob story isn\u2019t to gain sympathies, just people who have similar experiences.

I've been doing that for about 10 years on and off. So I'm really not trying to act superior, you cannot force a revolutionary party into immediate existence even if the need for revolution is immediate. All you can do is maintain your principles and struggle for them, even at the cost of excommunication.What I am saying is that this subreddit is somewhat unique in allowing you to theorize failure with like-minded communists. Every other subreddit will shill for \"getting organized\" or \"mutual aid\" or \"touching grass.\" They're just using you to further their own denialism.

If they don't follow it's not the nature of advertising to be questioned but a fault of the specific ad campaign or the will. Many people's lives have been sucked dry in this way and they can't even diagnose it themselves.\n\nOf course you have to organize, there is no alternative. But everyone, especially Americans, must follow Gramsci's famous slogan: \"pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.\" You must compel your body to act even whenn your mind maintains all distance from crude empirical reality. Be as skeptical of an ad campaign telling you to \"touch grass\" as one telling you that your children have to touch the ground at Disney World once in their lives or you've failed as a parent. That one is technically made by a corporation and the other a widespread belief people reproduce on their own is of little consequence, ideology accounts for both and practically there is little difference between \"Disney adults\" and DSA socialists on reddit or tiktok in their \"grassroots\" advertising function.\n\nCapitalism accidentally created a place with infinite information, free discussion, and global connectivity. They do everything in their power to bury these functions and saturate them with advertising. They've been so successful that many people have access to every book ever written and believe themselves incapable of reading, except when information is presented to them in the form of an ad. It is up to you to reconstruct what the internet could be and use it in that way. No one cares about your psychosomatic \"NEET\" status. That is itself a form of \"positive thinking\" where you tell your therapist how awful you are so they will tell you how great you are really, which is what you desired the whole time. Distinguishing essence and appearance is painful and takes work with objective reality, it can't be circumvented through will. Go out and do communist politics. Then complain here about it. No one will tell you that you're not positive enough and if you're not complaining you're doing something wrong, since by definition all currently existing communist politics are failures in some way (since success = revolution).\n\nE: of course there is something to be said about the nature of those complaints, as I hinted at most complaining is another form of advertising and \"self-empowerment.\" But before getting into the nature of critique, we must dissuade ourselves of the notion that the internet is \"too negative\" or opposed to \"irl.\" The internet is a great advertising machine and its main innovation was the facade of \"influencers\" as mediating the corporation and the consumer (you are the influencer in posting and act as your own advertisement, trying to convince yourself that consumption will short circuit the void of intersubjectivity). That is why the most \"negative\" and unfriendly spaces for corporations are actually the most delusional. That is why 4chan, which supposedly functions through negative hazing and universal hostility, is actually the most incredulous and naive and easily capitulated to right wing grifters. The best grifter is Trump, whose entire ad campaign is he's self-awarea grifter and therefore speaks directly to consumer rather than through the facade of the state and all of its 20th century, pre-influencer machinery. On the left, it is the same reason \"post-Marxists\" and \"anti-left\" forces like Platypus and Cosmonaut are actually the biggest suckers for the DSA grift, since all they ever wanted was to be heard and made to feel important.",

The answer is obviously not, so Swedes have a very real material attachment to imperialism, and instead of deflecting or ignoring this, that confrontation should be put front and centre in the discussions of Swedish communists, and instead of thinking in terms of what is best for Swedes, you may have to face the fact that what is best for Global Revolution is in fact what is not at all desirable for most Swedes (at least not in the short or intermediate term).

Just like anarchism is significantly less democratic and more open to abuse because there are no regulations and structures, leaving dues up to membership actually opens it up to more abuse, more peer pressure, and more opacity. The IMT is not alone in this, most parties pull the same MLM tactics to squeeze money out of people, but a serious party will treat being a professional revolutionary in a professional way.",

The IMT leadership has dozens of salaried permanent positions across the globe, and this is one of the largest and almost always unspoken places where huge portions of membership dues find their consumptive end point; financing the lives of the party leaders.  That their salaries are not remarkable is beside the point -- it's a living. While I dont have the proof of the financials, my own theory on the rebranding for the IMT is that they were facing a similar financial crisis to the one which is currently shattering DSA (where the COVID/George Floyd events assumed the start of never-ending party growth and lead to a spending spree, which has now been exposed as an illusion as Sanders \"socialists\" go groveling back to Biden and the Democrats to save them from Trump, and suddenly the party is deep in the red with no clear path back to the black ink except more members) -- hence the IMT's rebranding and excessive focus on membership drives (so much so that I've seen at least three users complain about it on /r/socialism over the past three months).  Professional revisionism is exactly what these sorts of organizations exist for, in the last instance.  It's the grand prize for sticking it out for a couple decades until you become the next generation of professional revisionists.",
