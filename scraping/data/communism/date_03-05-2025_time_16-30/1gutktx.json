    "selftext": "Hello, I\u2019m interested in learning about the people and events that shaped communist and anarchist theory and action. I\u2019m particularly focused on the period before Marx, Engels, Bakunin, Kropotkin, and so on\u2014essentially, before the 19th century. I\u2019m mainly interested in books, but if you have recommendations for other media, like documentaries or movies, they\u2019re also welcome.\n\nWith a bit of research, I\u2019ve found some books like\u00a0*The Republic*\u00a0by Plato,\u00a0*Utopia*\u00a0by Thomas More, and\u00a0*The Social Contract*\u00a0by Rousseau, but these feel somewhat limited. I definitely want to read something about the French Revolution and other pivotal events, but my historical knowledge is quite basic, so I could use some guidance. I\u2019m not necessarily looking for texts written exclusively in that era; a political or historical overview by a modern author would also be great. Thanks in advance <3\n\nPS: i'm Greek, so Greek sources/translations are welcome too.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
