Brazil is a crime ridden country, with over 40,000 homicides a year, figures that closely resemble the war in Syria. We know most crime has social roots in inequality, but the left discourse here is absurd: most lefties see the criminals as victims, ask for mass desincarceration and lenient sentences, end of the police and defend prisoners rights over the rights of victims of violence. That is a complete shot in the foot, because most people will never abide by that, and that is completely understandable. Working class people give sweat, blood and tears to buy a car or a smartphone, only to see lefties \u201cdefending\u201d the people that rob them at gunpoint, many times even killing people. The only sentiment is hate and revolt. We socialists should be able to canalize that hate towards something positive, but end up just point it at ourselves.\n\nMost socialists should look up what happened in the USSR if you were a convicted murderer or thief.

                    "body": "The inherent problem with your discourse is that the Brazilian \"justice\" and penal system is a complete farce and it's primary function is the violent repression of the oppressed classes as in all states under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and landlords. It's positive functions are virtually non-existent and in the manner it is set up it's impossible to reduce criminality, even on it's own terms. You are still hopelessly stuck within narrow horizon of bourgeois consciousness and as such reproducing reactionary ideas.\n\nThe \"left\" discourse is meaningless to me, these opportunists and revisionists are stuck discussing these issues within the scope of reformism which is completely worthless, and it is indeed viewed with derision by the masses as you say, for they are the ones most oppressed by an amorphous mass of criminality that has taken shape between the drug trafficking organizations and the militias which are largely supplied with weapons and operate in cahoots with the armed forces and police.\n\nSupport for desincarceration, lenient sentences and prisoner rights are the bare minimum that can be expected from a communist within a bourgeois dictatorship as he understands that the oppressed individual is most often already condemned even before he sits in the defendant's chair, both due to his class and most often his race, as after being arrested by a universally corrupt and murderous police force, he will be prosecuted by a bourgeois procurator and face judgement from a bourgeois judge. After arrested he will also most probably remain incarcerated for years pending trial inside an overcrowded prison controlled by the very same organizations the justice system is purported to combat and by an equally corrupt penal police. If he is not part of a criminal organization yet, he almost certainly will become now, often to avoid persecution inside jail. There is virtually no possibility of \"reintegration\" after release, as attaining employment becomes exponentially more difficult and, despite being provided in law, very few prisoners actually learn an useful trade within prison, through labour or educative courses. As a result incarceration increases the probability recidivism and may turn a non-violent criminal into a violent one. None of this can be remedied under capitalism and attempts to harden the \"justice\" system will turn  fascistic precisely like in El Salvador with mass incarceration without even the pretence of a fair trial within massively overcrowded dungeons.\n\nWhat matters to me is the communist line which is to delegitimize the bourgeoisie justice and penal system completely as tyrannical, inherently corrupt and as a perpetuator of criminality. The only solution possible is proletarian democratic justice, set up in areas controlled by the Communist Party and liberated from drug traffickers, militia thugs and the murderous police by a People's Army. The Revolutionary tribunals that must be constituted shall headed by elected jurors, judges and prosecutors exclusively emanating from the working classes and the Communist Party and liquidation of counter-revolutionaries, class enemies and other criminals shall be meted out according to the will of the masses.",

The masses will decide the sentence through Revolutionary Tribunals and it will be carried out by agents of the revolution, if the sentence is death then it will be also carried out, as it was in Revolutionary Russia by the Cheka and the Red Guards, in China by the PLA and the People's Militia and in Peru within areas liberated by the Shining Path.\n\nAs for your other questions, the answer has already been given. While People's Power is not established every communist must oppose the justice and penal system completely, it is a rotten reactionary structure for the reasons I have exposed and more. The task of communists is building up the Communist Party and the United Front, and, when feasible and appropriate, to begin building the People's Army, as without it revolution is impossible. The only way to remedy the suffering crime causes to the working classes is by putting them in power and being ruthless against it, everything else is an illusion.\n\nIn Brazil we are very far from having a Communist Party capable of initiating a People's War, so reconstituting it is the primary task of communists. If you still believe in a \"progressive\" function within the bourgeois justice system and claim to be communist you are a just revisionist, even worse since you appear to be a Titoist. You must actually study the works of scientific communism by those who never strayed from the revolution to correctly analyse reality or else you will remain stuck in bourgeois cretinism as you are now.",

However, crime is a problem - a material problem - today, and the radical left must have an answer that works in a short-medium term. Look at China, for instance. Material conditions are in an all time high, with significant reduction of extreme poverty and hunger. Still, we have the second largest prison population (nominal and per capita) and severe punishment for violent crime. If we are seen as allies of the thugs and criminals that affect mostly the working class, they will NEVER look at us as friends. You should read on Marx\u2019s view on the Lumpemproletariat",
