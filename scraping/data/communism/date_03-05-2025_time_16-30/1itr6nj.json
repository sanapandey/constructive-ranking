Back when I was in the bad habit of looking up thoughts on a writer on here and then choosing whether or not to read their works solely based on what I found, I saw a lot of back-and-forth between users I respect as well-read and intelligent, about whether Althusser was a Maoist or simply a contemporary of Mao. And I have to admit, though I don't usually like judging authors based on their \"persynal\" lives, I've been offput by (obviously) his misogynistic murder of his wife (which I know gets chalked up to insanity often), and also by his turn towards religiosity.

But from some quick reading around this morning, this quote from Ilyenkov seems to get at what my intuition is thinking about Marxism:\n\n\u201cMarx practises quite a different approach. Insofar as the universal exists in reality only through the particular and the individual, it can only be revealed by a thorough analysis of the particular rather than an act of abstraction from the particular.\u201d (From the dialectics of the abstract and concrete chapter 1)\n\nMy thought here is that if you are focused on material conditions and class conflicts at variant stages of development depending on the country, then the Marxist \u2018science\u2019 is a science of studying these conditions. And it is in the particular where the science lies, and where the essence of thrusting Marxist theory into praxis lies. As well as the fact that the metaphysical and epidemic nature of the dialectic requires this. \n\nAnd to clarify what I meant on the vocabulary point, it seems that the major examples of communist revolution we have in history both have significant figures that undertook the project of interpreting and applying Marxism to their country. Lenin cast the theory into the Russian situation of the early 1900s, and he did give a new way of speaking about Marxism. And definitely with Mao this is clear. So my point is that do we today need leaders and thinkers that are effectively casting Marxist theory into something that many people can grasp and feel applies to the world they live in? Thus what I mean by gain traction\u2014are many people, enough to make a revolutionary movement, going to do so by the theory and ways of speaking that are centrally Maoist and Leninist? How do we build up central figures and ideology to rally around now? \n\nAn example of a contemporary issue that is tough to grasp in Marxist lens for me is like how do I understand the world of tech and crypto and the forms of oppression that arise through them? And this culture of young men in America that is engrained in this tech/finance world? Even tho a large share are not in wealthy classes. To be clear, this is just an example and I know there is an answer out there and I\u2019ve read articles on current phenomena that give me some ways of thinking, but my point is that what I\u2019ve seen from at least these subs is a huge majority focus on these older, albeit brilliant, theorists. Rather than the contemporary questions that people may be curious about, and are critical for mobilizing share understanding and political action and support. \n\nAgain, forgive me if I am way off in some of this, I am still learning.",

This is a dangerous and poisonous idea because it's still used by revisionists today to justify their revisionism (even if they gleefully dismiss Khrushchev, Togliatti, and even the terminology -- all the ideas are still upheld by revisionism).  Marxism is universal, and it was not a matter of interpreting how you want and warping it to 'apply to their own conditions' because reality does not conform to your wishes; the point is that Marxism is correct about reality *and the people that Lenin and Mao were arguing against were getting Marxism fundamentally wrong.*  This has been a never ending struggle within Marxism, with countless revisionists and distorters trying to turn Marxism into something else (LaSalle, Duhring, Bernstein, Kautsky, Bukharin, Liu Shaoqi, etc) while the Lenins and Maos were the ones who understood Marxism and reality correctly, defended and upheld it, and were thus able to make effective use of it in a revolutionary way. \n\n> Lenin cast the theory into the Russian situation of the early 1900s, and he did give a new way of speaking about Marxism. \n\nThis is the exact opposite of what happened.  It was the Second International who began distorting, re-interpreting, and eschewing Marxism, with Kautsky famously \"pigeon-holing\" (tucking away and hiding) works of Marx and Engels which contradicted his positions in the build up to World War One.  It was Lenin who defended Marxism from these new interpretations, and insisted on the revolutionary essence, and stood for what Marxism had always been about, and then took this correct logic and understanding even further.  This is the key battle playing out in *State and Revolution,* and the entire point of Leninism becoming an -ism is that the lessons of Lenin applying Marxism in the age of imperialism were *not* particular to Russia, but rather a universal lesson for all of humanity in the age of imperialism, and Lenin's correct understanding generated the Marxist logic that lead to the revolutionary breakouts and breakthroughs around the world over the course of the 20th Century.\n\n>And definitely with Mao this is clear. \n\nThis is not definitely clear -- you are just speaking from ignorance (with confidence!) because you have no clue what the Yan'an Rectification was or who Wang Ming and the 28 and a half Bolsheviks were, and just need to assume that Mao bent and twisted and warped Marxism to be whatever he wanted it to be to \"fit\" for China.  *But it was the exact opposite.*  Mao fought uphill the entire way, even against the dominant party lines within the CCP at the time, and then even against the Bolsheviks in Moscow (including Stalin himself) who wanted the Chinese Communists to subordinate themselves to the KMT because China was not ready for revolution.  The entire point of Mao coming out victorious in the Yan'an Rectification is that he understood Marxism on a deeper and more fundamental level than even the orders from Moscow, and by insisting on correct Marxism he was able to tap into all the revolutionary potential that the Bolsheviks had overlooked and underestimated and miscalculated and neglected.  Maoism itself emerges later, in the battle against revisionism (the actual force which destroyed both the socialist-USSR in '53-56 and socialist China in '76-80) first as \"Mao Zedong Thought,\" because the struggle was taking place against the revisionists in China, but the lessons of anti-revisionism revealed themselves to be universal to all socialist construction, and thus the universal application of this understanding is Maoism, and only Maoism is Marxism today.",

As well as my influence from 'Online'-\"\"Communism\"\"(that I likely have not broken with completely). But I'm curious about Togliatti and this \"Interpretation\" Revisionism, do you know of anything on it? And the history of Togliatti?\n\nFrom what I know this Revisionism is a Part of Dengist Revisionism and is an inherent part of Meme-\"\"Communism\"\". Just one example, recently in r/Marxism someone referred to a [\"Flaw\" of Marxism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/s/YTWOMMIjey) being that it doesn't have a \"Roadmap\".\n\n> > Marxism has its flaws, the most obvious one being that there is no roadmap to get from capitalism to the classless, stateless form of communism.\n\nAnd someone replied saying it's not a flaw because Marxism is a \"Framework\" not a \"Blueprint\".\n\n> > Dude, I gotta disagree. Just because Marxism doesn't have a step-by-step roadmap doesn't mean it's flawed. It's a framework, not a blueprint. And each revolution's unique circumstances require innovative solutions.\n\nThis I think is a bit absurd as this wouldn't be said of chemistry, where it's known how to make hydrogen and oxygen from water or making sulfuric acid, etc. there are a number of ways to Make different Chemicals and materials but the Essential requirements are constant. Sulfuric Acid is H2SO4, just the materials to Make it will differ. One may not have pure Sulfur readily available but you may have pyrite which you can synthesize sulfur from, maybe water is limited but you have Natural gas abundant etc.\n\nSocialism is Still a transitional stage where production is determined by social need and Labor remunerated under the principle \"from each according to ability, to each according to work\" and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat Exterminates the Bourgeois Classes. Now whether this is done in a semi-Feudal Country with the Alliance of Proletariat, Peasant, and National Bourg Classes against imperialism or the imposition of a Dictatorship of the Proletariat of the Oppressed Nations over an Imperialist &/or Settler Nation is a matter of the difference of Form Rather than content.\n\nThe Essence is still the same but the form here is different.\n\nThough maybe this is still an incorrect way to think about it. I've just typed out my thoughts for a bit.",

And the history of Togliatti?\n\nUltimately he's not all that different from Khrushchev, although he was way out in front of him and he help clear the path for the Khrushchevite takeover within the Communist Movement.  It's mostly forgotten and buried now, but at one time he was considered a giant of international and communist politics, and his role in revisionism is worth digging up to remind everyone, since all of his errors never died and the logic lingers on among all kinds of revisionists (though especially Dengism).  See how OP wandered in here with *Polycentrism* already quietly taken to be obvious and common sense, and the entire science of Marxism already pre-supposed to be incorrect and requiring \"new approaches\" to advance, rather than the entire historical lesson of the last century being the opposite: that the people who insisted on the fundamental correctness of Marxism were the only ones able to advance revolution.  \n\nI think he was always a revisionist and opportunist (he had been an advocate of WWI for the Entente and just had the historical fortune of being in the right place at the right time to find himself as last leader standing for Italian Communism when everyone else went down, which made him appear to be the clear successor to Gramsci.  But where Gramsci's definitive political action was to orient the PCI towards the Third Comintern, Togliatti's trajectory is sort of the opposite.  He had been in Moscow when Mussolini had the Italian Communists all arrested, and so managed to hide out there under protection from Stalin until the tide of the war had turned, at which point he returned to Italy.  You see shades of his revisionism here already, where, instead of having the communists operate as an independent faction (the communists made up the bulk of the Italian partisans) he instead forged a parliamentary alliance with the King and Prime Minister and anti-fascist liberals, and promised an \"Italian Road to Socialism\" (basically the predecessor to Chinese Characteristics) -- where socialism in Italy would be achieved through bourgeois democracy, by working with and for the middle class, adhering to the constitution (which they would help author), and done without armed struggle, according to Togliatti.  This also lead to the disarming of Communist Partisans after the war by Togliatti (Pietro Secchia, the old 'Stalinist' who ends up marginalized, was the communist opposition here arguing to keep the weapons and build up for a forthcoming revolution -- sort of the logic that the Marxist-Leninists would have applied in Spain if the Republicans had won -- and Togliatti had to explicitly speak out against this), as well as him supporting a post-war amnesty agreement which was soft on fascists but considerably less favourable for communists.  But this was deemed pragmatic and necessary at the time, and would ultimately benefit the communist movement, or so the revisionists claimed.\n\nAfter the 20th Congress of the CPSU and Khrushchev's Secret Speech, there was considerable controversy and confusion within the World Communist Movement, worsened and exacerbated by political crises like in Hungary (itself a result of DeStalinization), and it's hard to understate how much damage was done by this.  Communist parties were now despondent and discordant, and the same movement which had appeared singular and united and invincible only a few years earlier had become broken and disillusioned.  In most cases, the Khruschevites won the ensuing political power struggles, but the fact that the Albanians and Chinese refused to give in to Khrushchev was itself a new crisis (the Great Debate).  Togliatti then introduces the concept of \"Polycentrism\" to suggest that there is not one correct interpretation of Marxism-Leninism, but rather there are many separate poles, and each one of those poles has a truth which is unique to it, and therefore it makes perfect sense for two different communist parties in different parts of the world to each reach completely opposite, completely contradictory conclusions and still both be correct and both remain allies.  Basically, Togliatti was saying, \"this question of communism isn't all that important; let's agree to disagree and all remain friends.\"  This is the pragmatic logic that most of Western \"leftism\" wants us to employ today (how many \"left unity\" threads do we see on a daily basis now from anxious ex-Democrats) and we should be grateful to Mao and Hoxha that they refused this compromise with revisionism, and insisted on Marxism.\n\nThe applied lesson of Polycentrism is basically postmodernism, and the idea that there is no objective truth or that it is unknowable, etc. and existed to uphold and explain the increasing incompatibility of political lines of different \"Marxist-Leninist\" parties following the 20th Congress.  But one of the most amazing things about Marxism is that political parties in opposite corners of the world are capable of reaching the exact same conclusions by applying the same logic and methodology.   It's the exact opposite thing to internalize from Polycentrism -- how physics works in Manila is not fundamentally different than how physics works in Moscow.  This isn't to say that different struggles may require different tactics and considerations, but if there's a difference it is objective and these should always be made concrete and brought out into the open the moment their existence is implied.  Dengists never want to point to these supposed differences in material conditions and say what they are (but this should be the precondition for stating that they exist and necessitate an alternative strategy), merely that they exist and so communism isn't supposed to be uniform and coherent between parties.  Like, for example, China and Vietnam are smart and wise for embracing/capitulating to market reforms, but DPRK and Cuba are brave and noble for resisting market reforms?  Which is it? It's inconsistent and incoherent, either China and Vietnam had a full capitalist restoration or DPRK and Cuba are really foolish for making their people suffer so much instead of embracing markets like China.  But someone will say \"different material conditions\" and then everyone is supposed to nod and the discussion ends there.  It's just Polycentrism in other wording, and no one really cares about what is actually happening (divisions between the DPRK and China are just supposed to be ignored and just pretend this is the 5th Comintern).  If these things are pointed to, then discussion can take place around them and objectively correct conclusions can be reached, but as long as 'material conditions' remains nebulous and vague and undefined then its not really about material conditions at all, it's about demanding revisionism be allowed to pass unchallenged.  \n\n>They cherish the greatest illusions about imperialism, then deny the fundamental antagonism between the two world systems of socialism and capitalism and the fundamental antagonism between the oppressed nations and oppressor nations, and, in place of international class struggle and anti-imperialist struggle, they advocate international class collaboration and the establishment of a \"new world order\". They have profound illusions about the monopoly capitalists at home, they confuse the two vastly different kinds of class dictatorship, bourgeois dictatorship and proletarian dictatorship, and preach bourgeois reformism, or what they call \"structural reform\" as a substitute for proletarian revolution. They allege that the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism have become \"outmoded\", and they tamper with the Marxist-Leninist theories of imperialism, of war and peace, of the state and revolution, and of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. They discard the revolutionary principles of the Moscow Declaration and the Moscow Statement, they repudiate the common laws of proletarian revolution or, in other words, the universal significance of the road of the October Revolution, and they describe the \"Italian road\", which is the abandonment of revolution, as a \"line common to the whole international communist movement\".\n\n>In the final analysis, the stand taken by Togliatti and certain other C.P.I. leaders boils down to this--the people of the capitalist countries should not make revolutions, the oppressed nations should not wage struggles to win liberation, and the people of the world should not fight against imperialism. Actually, all this exactly suits the needs of imperialists and the reactionaries.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sino-soviet-split/cpc/togliatti.htm\n\nalso this one from Albania is good: https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/albania/togliatti.pdf\n\nThe end result of Togliatti's Polycentrism wasn't a unity among \"Marxist-Leninists\" under the banner of Khrushchev, but rather it had the exact opposite effect and ended up heightening the divisions.  His death in Yalta and final words basically calling for PCI to separate themselves further from the \"erroneous\" Khrushchev is basically revisionist infighting leading to a new split within revisionism.  Instead of everyone agreeing to disagree and then getting behind Khrushchev and Brezhnev, the European communists instead used their \"many separate poles\" to plot a new course completely independent and divorced from the USSR (and even more divorced from actual Marxism-Leninism) and this is where we see Eurocommunism emerge.  And instead of being the ideological vanguard and headquarters for the revolutionaries during the struggles of the Years of Lead, the PCI embarked on the *Historic Compromise* with Christian Democrats while mostly condemning and opposing the Red Brigades (one of the main reasons they went after Moro).",

Kim Il-sung, Hoxha, and Mao should also be included as \"Stalinists\" who Khrushchev tried to get rid of but failed. This really was a seismic shift that affected every party in the world, except for the parties that had already capitulated to revisionism like Yugoslavia. So regardless of what you think about post-war communism in Western Europe or even Eastern Europe the Trotskyist attitude that they were all the same \"Stalinists\" is unhelpful. There were real struggles taking place between political lines and they had indigenous motivations, they were not merely puppetry of the internal struggles of the CPSU. Most of the time, revisionism had to be imposed from without, because these were people who had fought fascism and were not going to easily capitulate to it in a new form.",

But this only relates to the theoretical aspect of Marxism. The other side of the coin, and the one that both conditions all possible scientific knowledge about the world and transforms that world is practical activity. Thus the projection of a revolutionary path forward depends on a scientific understanding of concrete reality, not only as a set of particular conditions, but as a concrete totality, that is the historical totality of the state of the class struggle, its past and present on an international level. The assimilation of the international experience of the revolutionary labor movement has always been a necessity for Marxism. Even in Lenin\u2019s time this assimilation included Marxism, both its defenders and distorters. \n\nLenin indeed undertook the task of analyzing Russian conditions, but he also assimilated the experience of the labor movement worldwide. He synthesized these into a tactical-plan in What is to be Done?, where he both formulates the particular tasks of the Russian Social-Democrats and elaborates the some universal principles of the party of a new type. In many ways these two aspects of this work by Lenin are two aspects of one unity where the universal principle expresses itself through the revolutionary criticism of the economists, which subordinated the proletariat to the bourgeoisie in politics and reduced its activity to its economic movement. That is what Lenin shows first with arguments and what the subsequent revolutionary proletariat shows with facts. \n\nWhat eclecticism does is to claim that to understand reality we must break with the internal systematic coherence of the Marxist worldview, and dogmatism implies that Marxism is a theory that exists eternally. What dialectics says is that everything that exists passes away, and since Marxism places the transformation of the world above the knowledge of the world, Marxism, through the assimilation of the experience of the class struggle, not only revolutionizes the world, but also must revolutionize itself. This is what Lenin, Mao, Stalin, and Gonzalo did through their summations of the past experiences of the ICM, and the revolutions led by this ideology, their limitations and defeats provide the keys to understanding the laws of revolution, laws that do not preceded the praxis of the ICM, but are created by the praxis of the revolutionary proletariat. \n\nSo precise theoretical knowledge is absolutely indispensable for the WPR, since if the theory is unfit for the tasks, it cannot fuse with the masses in a revolutionary movement. It isn\u2019t a simple application of a universal theory, implying a metaphysical idealist view of theory, but a universal movement of social reality that for the proletariat demands knowledge of its revolutionary tasks, which are both of a theoretical and practical nature. Since the vanguard is first the bearer of the theory it is the only section that can initiate  the fusion of revolutionary theory and the masses of the class in an effective transformation from capitalism to communism (revolutionary praxis).",

He makes little attempt to investigate China during the GCPR, labelling the Chinese Revolution a bourgeois revolution following in the footsteps of Hoxha.
