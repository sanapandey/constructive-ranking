    "selftext": "According to Marx, capitalism encourages population growth to cultivate a reserve army of labor and also to expand available potential surplus value to extract (given that surplus value comes from the laborer, therefore more laborers means a deeper pool to fish for surplus value). \n\nToday, the population is actually shrinking or the rate of growth is shrinking in the advance capitalist countries, with the most stunning cases in Japan and South Korea. However, the population continues to grow at a good clip in poor countries.\n\nDoes Marxism imply that population grows most where the degree of exploitation is highest? Is it possible that the populations of the rich capitalist countries relative to those of the poor oppressed countries are so much less productive of profit that it's a matter of indifference to capital that their populations are shrinking as long as the global \"reserve army of labor\" keeps growing briskly in the zones of super exploitation?  Does this also imply that if the global population shrinks absolutely but super exploitation intensifies in the regions where the population is increasing, that global capital can continue to accumulate, refuting the position that global capitalism would collapse with a shrinking population? Could demographic pressures be one avenue by which the rate of profit tends to fall--as in capital would come up against diminishing returns compensating for absolute population decline by exploiting an expanding labor pool already exploited to an intense degree? \n\nI've been thinking about these questions, and I've reached the point where I thought I'd ask for more guidance here.",

It's from Chapter 25, a long and fairly complex paragraph, but here's the part that spurred some of these questions (let me know if I'm misunderstanding): \n\n\"But if a surplus labouring population is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus population becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalistic accumulation, nay, a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates, for the changing needs of the self-expansion of capital, a mass of human material always ready for exploitation. With accumulation, and the development of the productiveness of labour that accompanies it, the power of sudden expansion of capital grows also; it grows, not merely because the elasticity of the capital already functioning increases, not merely because the absolute wealth of society expands, of which capital only forms an elastic part, not merely because credit, under every special stimulus, at once places an unusual part of this wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional capital; it grows, also, because the technical conditions of the process of production themselves \u2014 machinery, means of transport, &c. \u2014 now admit of the rapidest transformation of masses of surplus-product into additional means of production.\u00a0The mass of social wealth, overflowing with the advance of accumulation, and transformable into additional capital, thrusts itself frantically into old branches of production, whose market suddenly expands, or into newly formed branches, such as railways, &c., the need for which grows out of the development of the old ones. In all such cases, there must be the possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points without injury to the scale of production in other spheres. Overpopulation supplies these masses. The course\u00a0characteristic of modern industry,\u00a0*viz*., a decennial cycle (interrupted by smaller oscillations), of periods of average activity, production at high pressure, crisis and stagnation, depends on the constant formation, the greater or less absorption, and the re-formation of the industrial reserve army or surplus population. In their turn, the varying phases of the industrial cycle recruit the surplus population, and become one of the most energetic agents of its reproduction.\"",

Capitalism doesn't \"encourage population growth\" because capitalism is not a person and it doesn't want anything. The structural incentives of capitalist production have mixed effects on population growth: the rise in the productive forces lowers infant mortality and makes birth and childhood safer leading to an increase in the population. Capitalism draws women into the workforce and allows adults to live longer lives, decreasing the incentive to have children young or have them at all. Capitalism privatizes health and old age incentivizing having children as an insurance policy but privatizes childcare and education incentivizing people to have fewer children. Capitalism vastly increased crop yields through scientific invention which increased the Earth's ability to support humans but keeps most of the world in a state of dependency that prevents this technology from being used by the majority. There is no single tendency that determines the others since capitalism is at its core a system of free labor with the right to sell its labor power on the market as a commodity. Capitalism can only incentivize this, it cannot force it. \n\nThe largest cause of population growth was the combination of late (and semi) feudalism, in which there is a direct economic incentive to have more children and increase the absolute amount of labor applied to the forces of production (the land) and capitalism, in which the market for increases in cash crop production is unlimited and the aformentioned scientific revolutions apply to populations that were previously controlled through periodic famines and high infant mortality rates. \n\nYou have some kind of conspiracy theory version of human relationships where people have children because capitalism tells them to. Do you have children? If not, why not? You live under capitalism so if it wanted something you would be first in line. People have children because they want to, no one is brainwashed or told what to do. Every person in Africa is just as capable as you at making a rational decision about this, it is simply that their judgement is different than yours because their incentives are different. This is where you should begin to think about these questions, not from a crude model of people as ants you believe reality supposed to conform to.\n\n>Could demographic pressures be one avenue by which the rate of profit tends to fall--as in capital would come up against diminishing returns compensating for absolute population decline by exploiting an expanding labor pool already exploited to an intense degree?\n\nThis is a reasonable question and the answer is yes, the addition of human beings who were previously outside the production process is the most straightforward way to add new labor power and, like all processes under capitalism, it must compound to continue to counteract the falling rate of profit. But this is only one of many sources of crisis and class struggle, it is not an absolute limit since the existing population can always be exploited further. Capitalism works with what it is given and anything outside the process of accumulation is an \"externality.\" Even circulation is outside the system in a sense, because even though commodities need to be sold to realize their value, capitalism has no direct control over this. It is only in the workplace that you belong to the owner for the period of time you have agreed to sell your labor (whether this agreement is made happily or with a full range of alternatives is not relevant to the basic difference between slavery, where slaves were directly compelled to have children, and capitalism where they are not). Advertising exists because no one can make you buy anything.\n\n>So then it doesn't matter if the population is actually increasingly globally for capital accumulation to increase, this can be done whether or not a population increases as long as there is enough of a \"reserve army of labor\" somewhere to feed into the \"rising composition of capital\"?\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"matter.\" Capitalism does not depend on an absolute population increase to survive because the reserve army of labor is a relative, not absolute quantity. But this is a source of crisis, as any bourgeois media source will tell you. No crisis is the end of the system, capitalism can always reconstitute itself if class struggle does not intervene.",

By encourage I was using personifying language to mean encourage as a system can encourage something, but I see that that's mystifying. The way you put is is what I meant: \"structural incentives.\" It seems to me, what you're saying, is that capitalism has certain incentives, some encouraging having children and others not, and that people make their decision influenced by these depending on the current conditions, which further implies that the current conditions in Japan, South Korea, and Italy are discouraging people from having children relative to, say, Nigeria and Ghana (though their brith rates are falling). Do you think this is because of the semi-feudal dynamic you mentioned in your response?  \n\nBy matter, I mean something like \"of no consequence,\" but your response indicates that it is of consequence, in the sense that it's a source of crisis, which is clarifying. \n\nThanks for your response!

The \"reserve army\" can come from the current labor force, as long as the composition of capital is increasing, not decreasing. In places with very high rates of exploitation like India or Subsaharan Africa, this process is much slower and the surplus population is much more dependent on the dynamics in the backward sectors of the economy.",

In fact in Capital he tried to explain why the opposite was the case: capitalism was making people redundant much faster than the rate of population growth. Capitalism has never been at risk of running out of raw labor power, except in rare specific cases (like Germany after WW2).\n\nConcern about the surplus population in the third world has always been out of fear of peasant revolutions and other disruptions to the social structure of imperialism. There has never been a negative demographic pressure on capital accumulation, but there has been and still is a massive positive demographic pressure on capitalist production relations and the underdevelopment entailed by imperialism.",

In rich capitalist countries, where populations are shrinking, capital isn't as concerned because the reserve army of labor is still growing in poorer, more exploited countries. As long as global capital can tap into cheap labor in these regions, it can continue accumulating wealth even with a shrinking global population.\n\nIf super-exploitation intensifies in these regions, global capitalism might still thrive despite demographic declines in wealthier countries. A shrinking population in rich nations may only significantly impact capitalism if it leads to reduced demand or productivity stagnation. The global reserve of labor can compensate for demographic changes in rich countries, allowing capital to continue its accumulation.",
