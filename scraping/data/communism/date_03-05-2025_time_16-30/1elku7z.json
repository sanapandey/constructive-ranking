You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Read these 3 Jacobin articles and this one MIM Prisons article for what's *not* a correct Marxist perspective on liberalism:\n[What Karl Marx Really Thought About Liberalism](https://jacobin.com/2020/10/karl-marx-liberalism-rights-igor-shoikhedbrod-review), [Socialists Don\u2019t Want to Destroy Liberalism. We Want to Go Beyond It](https://jacobin.com/2020/10/socialism-liberalism-marx), and [Why Liberals Should Unite With Socialists, Not the Right](https://jacobin.com/2020/09/karl-marx-yoram-hazony-marxism-liberalism).\nMIM Prisons [definition of liberalism](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/faq/liberalismdef.html) by MIM Prisons is better but they make it too confusing by distinguishing between \"liberals\" and \"Liberals\" and say things like \"liberal Liberals\". Honestly this might be their worst article in my opinion, especially towards the end when they say we can have both communism and political Liberalism, it just feels off for them. Apparently their reddit account is no longer active so there's no way of letting them know about it \n\nI also heard good things about both Samir Amin's The Liberal Virus and Domenico Losurdo's Liberalism A Counter-History, though I haven't read either. \n\nHeard [this](https://en.gegenstandpunkt.com/books/democratic-state) is good, planning on reading it\n\nIndirect:\n\nAnything by the big 5 Marxist theorists, even if it doesn't seem directly related to liberalism. One of the most memorable parts of Capital for me was when Marx talked about how liberal equal legal rights form the basis for wage labour and exploitation. All Marxist theory is the negation of liberalism.",

            "body": "This is a bit of a strange question, since history and debate are not really related. Does combatting the idea of \"authoritarianism\" mean explaining its genealogy as a concept? Technically yes, that is the only way to combat ideas, but that's not a rhetorical strategy. It's not like you're going to say \"actually what you just said comes from the thermidorian reaction and the regression of bourgeois philosophy in the face of the first proletarian challenge. Now let me explain that regression from 1795 to our conversation right now.\"\n\nMarx and Engels have good works on the history of bourgeois thought, Losurdo's work is bad and reactionary. It's a derivative postmodern study of some bourgeois philosophers as apologists for slavery and colonialism. Thr only \"innovation\" is that Losurdo considers himself a Marxist, rather than the genesis of this critique which is \"postcolonial\" criticism of Marxism as Eurocentric and an Enlightenment \"metanarrative.\" Presumably, this is because Losurdo's ultimate goal is to try to justify \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" as some form of illiberal communism which Marxism must be made to serve. But this isn't clear in the book, which again is simply a less interesting, pop-culture version of the work of Edward Said or Homi Bhabha. And even his innovation isn't really, Horkheimer and Adorno did the same thing in a much more consequential way (the second half of the book, which argues liberalism is immanent to fascism, is derivative of the more reactionary works of the Frankfurt school). It's also a bad book, mostly composed of block quotes from random philosophers and politicians with very little structure or insight.",

Not elaborating the whole history of a concept, but at least pointing out the endpoints of that history to reveal the distance between its origins and its amnesic use today.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1798okr/comment/k553agf/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1dds4jh/comment/l86ymrl/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/19ec6u5/what_happened_to_anarchists_in_the_soviet_union/kjfw9v4/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/14uu28f/comment/jrajnlb/\n\n\nIt seems to work very well as a rhetorical technique.",
