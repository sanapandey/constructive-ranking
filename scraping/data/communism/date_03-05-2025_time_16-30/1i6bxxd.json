    "selftext": "Hello Comrades, English is not my first language, so please bear with me. Basically, I can't find almost any source that can differentiate the economic decentralization promoted by Mao Zedong from the decentralization done by Khrushchev in the 1950s. The only texts I found were an article from the Hoxhaist party, and it basically claims that Mao promoted a decentralized economy with anarcho-syndicalist tendencies. From what I understand, there was a process of transferring the means of production to local authorities and promoting trade between different regions.\n\nAnother text I found were excerpts from the Shanghai Textbook, which stated (if I interpreted it correctly) that this decentralization was more about consulting local authorities than giving them actual power.\n\nWhat I want to know is whether these accusations from the Hoxhaists are true or exaggerated. What differentiated the reforms of Mao and Khrushchev? Do Maoists defend a decentralized economy (similar to the anarchist idea of self-sufficient communes trading with each other)? Wouldn't this hinder the path to communism, since the goal would be to progressively reduce mercantile relations in favor of conscious resource planning, and this decentralization only led to an increase in the role of the market? If this idea existed in the past, what is the current position of Maoists on it?\n\nSorry for the many questions, which may not necessarily be relevant today but arose after reading many economists associating Mao's decentralization with experiments for the later reforms of Deng in the 1970s/80s.\n\nP.S.: Apologies for using the term \"Hoxhaist\", I\u2019m just using it to differentiate them from Maoists.\n\nLink to the Hoxhaist article: [https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/rpo-china.htm](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-7/rpo-china.htm)",

I'm not familiar with the Hoxhaist criticism but the impression I got was increased local decision-making (at the factory level and in tandem with a push to blur the manual-intellectual labor + worker/manager divide) yet higher administrative levels still providing planning guidance, administrative tasks, and overall management / unification of local initiatives.  This also varied based on key and export oriented industries.",
