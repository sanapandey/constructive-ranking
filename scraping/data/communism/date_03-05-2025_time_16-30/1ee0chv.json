    "selftext": "A couple of weeks ago, I saw this argument between a Marxist and a liberal who upheld the subjective theory of value. The Marxist criticized it and said it relied on the notion of each person having a \"soul\". I believe this is referring to something in liberalism?\nI can't remember exactly what they said, and I've searched but can't find anything about liberalism's belief in each person having a soul.\n\nMaybe they were just being ironic? But it didn't seem like it, I think they were referring to an actual concept in liberalism. Does anyone know more about this?",

By producing their means of subsistence men are indirectly producing their actual material life.*\n\n*The way in which men produce their means of subsistence depends first of all on the nature of the actual means of subsistence they find in existence and have to reproduce. This mode of production must not be considered simply as being the production of the physical existence of the individuals. Rather it is a definite form of activity of these individuals, a definite form of expressing their life, a definite mode of life on their part. As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.*\"\n\nThe German Ideology, Marx and Engels\n\nand:\n\n*\"We pre-suppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour-process, we get a result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate his will. And this subordination is no mere momentary act. Besides the exertion of the bodily organs, the process demands that, during the whole operation, the workman's will be steadily in consonance with his purpose. This means close attention. The less he is attracted by the nature of the work, and the mode in which it is carried on, and the less, therefore, he enjoys it as something which gives play to his bodily and mental powers, the more close his attention is forced to be.\"*\n\n[https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/l/a.htm](https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/l/a.htm)\n\nI think this puts is well.",

As Wassily Leontief put it, \n\n> \u201cHowever important these technical contributions to the progress of economic theory in the present-day appraisal of Marxian achievements, they are overshadowed by his brilliant analysis of the long-term tendencies of the capitalist system. The record is indeed impressive:\u00a0increasing concentration of wealth, rapid elimination of small and medium-sized enterprise, progressive limitation of competition, incessant technological progress accompanied by the ever-growing importance of fixed capital, and, last but not least, the undiminishing amplitude of recurrent business cycles \u2013 an unsurpassed series of prognostications fulfilled, against which modern economic theory with all its refinements has little to show indeed.\u201d\n\nErnest Mandel:\n\n> \"Marx\u2019s Capital appears as a giant compared to any subsequent or contemporary work of economic analysis. It was never intended as a handbook to help governments to solve such problems as balance-of-payments deficits, nor yet as a learned, if somewhat trite, explanation of all the exciting happenings in the market place when Mr Smith finds no buyer for the last of his 1,000 tons of iron**. It was intended as an explanation of what would happen to labour, machinery, technology, the size of enterprises, the social structure of the population, the discontinuity of economic growth, and the relations between workers and work, as the capitalist mode of production unfolded all its terrifying potential. From that point of view, the achievement is truly impressive. It is precisely because of Marx\u2019s capacity to discover the long-term laws of motion of the capitalist mode of production in its essence, irrespective of thousands of \u2018impurities\u2019 and of secondary aspects, that his long-term predictions \u2013 the laws of accumulation of capital, stepped-up technological progress, accelerated increase in the productivity and intensity of labour, growing concentration and centralization of capital, transformation of the great majority of economically active people into sellers of labour-power, declining rate of profit, increased rate of surplus value, periodically recurrent recessions, inevitable class struggle between Capital and Labour, increasing revolutionary attempts to overthrow capitalism \u2013 have been so strikingly confirmed by history.\"\n\nAs for the so-called \"transformation problem\", there are multiple interpretations on how to go about getting rid of this \"problem\". I will go over some of these tomorrow when I have more time.\n\n> The reason to prefer the LTV is, as I said, moral.\n\nNo, our analysis is not based on morality but on science. Engels:\n\n> We therefore reject every attempt to impose on us any moral dogma whatsoever as an eternal, ultimate and for every immutable ethical law on the pretext that the moral world, too, has its permanent principles which stand above history and the differences between nations.\n\nIt doesn't seem like you've made the slightest attempt to read or understand Marx's theory, so why are you here? Just to argue?",

As Wassily Leontief put it, \n\nNothing in this quote addresses the LTV, that is to say none of these occurrences would demonstrate that exchange value is equivalent to the sum of socially necessary labor. Marx did not invent LTV so it wouldn't make any sense that these predictions would validate LTV any more than Smith's predictions would validate LTV. These predictions may be correct and LTV may be wrong, or these predictions may be wrong and LTV may be correct.\n\n> Ernest Mandel:\n\nAgain, nothing in this quote addresses the LTV! You are free to make an argument as to how these directly show V=SNL but the economic theories and long term predictions of Marx can be true without the LTV being true.\n\nIf we believe exchange value equals socially necessary labor, how would we test our hypothesis? We could measure both exchange value and labor inputs and compare them. This doesn't work because exchange value is not observable. We can find some proxy for exchange value (price, in the long run, perhaps) and regress that on labor time. This has found mixed results and is still plagued by the transformation problem.\n\n> I don't understand what you mean. Can you elaborate on this?\n\nLTV is a definition, not a deduction. For example, we KNOW that machines cannot create value outside of ossified labor under the LTV because only value is defined as socially necessary labor. It would be a contradiction to believe both the LTV and that machines create value. As a definition, the LTV is valid, but we cannot know whether it is a scientific fact or not unless we can measure exchange value and verify that it does, in fact, equal socially necessary labor. Until then, we can make a statement like \"the exchange value of a good is determined by the amount of oxygen required in its production\" and see no scientific reasons to prefer one over the other, as both are valid and neither is a fact.\n\nYou seem to believe that Marxism collapses without LTV. This is simply not true and many prominent Marxists have argued against the LTV. Exploitation can still exist even if V!=SNL.\n\nI am not saying the LTV is wrong, my point was that it is not some universal law to be discovered. Any theory of value will struggle greatly unless it distinguishes between humans and nonhumans, and any argument that attacks STV on these grounds would also apply to the LTV.",

Do you need to \"prove\" Newton's 3 laws of motion? No, the proof lies in the predictions and conclusions Newton draws from his axioms.\n\nAgain you've yet to demonstrate that LTV is a necessary component of Marx's theory or that it has predictive power. The Mayans correctly predicting an eclipse does not mean Kukulcan is real. Newton predicting the motions of planets does not mean he was correct about alchemy.\n\nRigorous scientific testing requires that we reduce confounding variables and propose directly testable hypotheses. If we are to test the LTV, there is no need to look only at Marx because as I've stated, other economists also use the LTV. We can measure socially necessary labor time (to some extent), so to test our theory we should quantify or measure exchange value and compare the 2. We cannot claim that the LTV is science then refuse to test the theory using the scientific method.\n\n> For all heterogenous commodities to be exchanged, they must have something in common. The only thing they really have in common is that they're products of labour--specifically, labour in the abstract.\n\nThis is plainly false for a number of reasons. First of all commodities have many things in common other than being products of labor. Anything produced by human labor must necessarily involve countless other physical processes and substances, such as carbon, energy, and mechanical work. Second, things don't need anything in common to be exchanged. I can exchange a rock I picked up from the ground for a different rock despite neither being the products of labor.\n\nEven interpreted very generously, that objects must have value to be exchanged, this does not indicate that value is fixed and embodied in commodities themselves.\n\nTo be honest I'm not sure why you're so attached to the idea that the LTV is scientific fact. As I've said before the LTV can be meaningful without being scientific fact and many Marxists view it this way. Capitalist exploitation is perfectly explainable without the existence of the metaphysical idea of value that is not observable and has not been found in any kind of statistical analysis. On the contrary it would be rather bizarre if this metaphysical idea with no causal power explained exploitation rather than the complexities of social relations.",

Why would you regress to their LTV rather than Marx's?\n\n> Rigorous scientific testing requires that we reduce confounding variables and propose directly testable hypotheses. If we are to test the LTV, there is no need to look only at Marx because as I've stated, other economists also use the LTV. We can measure socially necessary labor time (to some extent), so to test our theory we should quantify or measure exchange value and compare the 2. We cannot claim that the LTV is science then refuse to test the theory using the scientific method.\n\nMarx did reduce confounding variables in Capital, which was about the pure, \"ideal\" form of capitalism in which all consumers were rational with total knowledge and the market was at equilibrium, and he made testable hypotheses.\n\n> We cannot claim the LTV is science then refuse to test the theory using the scientific method.\n\nIt has been tested. History is the laboratory, and Marx's hypotheses have been confirmed.\n\n> This is plainly false for a number of reasons. First of all commodities have many things in common other than being products of labor. Anything produced by human labor must necessarily involve countless other physical processes and substances, such as carbon, energy, and mechanical work. Second, things don't need anything in common to be exchanged. I can exchange a rock I picked up from the ground for a different rock despite neither being the products of labor.\n\nThis is the first 4 pages of Capital dude. Marx writes, \n\n> This common \u201csomething\u201d cannot be either a geometrical, a chemical, or any other natural property of commodities. Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities, make them use values. But the **exchange** of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use value.\n\nThere's no need for a carbon theory of value, since we're specifically dealing with **exchange**. There are also digital commodities, so having carbon is kind of a strange choice?  \n\n> Second, things don't need anything in common to be exchanged. I can exchange a rock I picked up from the ground for a different rock despite neither being the products of labor.\n\nNow we're getting into the deep end of value-form debate, which is a dark, scary place that you don't want to go into (trust me). There's multiple conflicting answers for your rock example. I'll list off the ones I'm aware of, I haven't settled on one I like. I'll need to research more, because value is by far the most abstract concept in all of Marxist thought. Here they are:\n\n1. You actually *did* perform labor by picking the rock up off the ground.\n\n2. You did not perform labor, but it's still a commodity, since some commodities don't need labor, and therefore, no value (like land).\n\n3. You did not perform labor, and it's not a commodity, just like land is not a commodity (because it isn't reproducible),*  just something that is exchanged with no value.\n\n4. The individual act of exchange is not where Marx began, isolated from the rest of society, but started from the productive relations of commodity-capitalist society. So, your hypothetical is too small and based in idealism.\n\n5. If you *did* perform labor by picking up the rock, it still doesn't determine the value of the rock. Because the value of the rock would be determined by the socially necessary labor time--how long it takes, on average, for people to pick up the rock that people want.\n\n6. The rock isn't useful to anyone, has no use-value, and therefore has no value.\n\nI'll think about it and reflect on which one I lean towards. My personal view (I'm still learning, I'm only halfway through vol 1 of Capital) is this:\nYou haven't established when or where this rock exchange takes place. Is the rock wanted? Are we in pre-historical times? Here's my understanding: the act of exchange itself is how labor becomes really abstracted, how individual labor turns into social labor. It generates a substance called value. \nMarx didn't look at commodities and think, \"hmm, what do they all have in common? Ah, labor!\" That would be stupid, since it would be a mere conceptual abstraction, like how Bohm Bawerk said that utility in the abstract could also be the common trait of commodities.\n\nMarx began with the productive relations of a society with commodities, and analyzed the actual producers, from their labor to their exchange, and concluded that labor isn't just a conceptual abstraction, but a *real* one. Commodity exchange, and especially capitalist commodity exchange, *literally* abstracts labor and treats different concrete labors as homogeneous.\n\n> this does not indicate that value is fixed and embodied in the commodities themselves.\n\nThat is precisely Marx's point, actually. Commodities don't have value by themselves, without the humans' interference. This was the whole point of his section about commodity fetishism.",

This would not pass peer review in any respectable journal of natural science, for good reason. Simply put there is no contradiction between rejecting the LTV and accepting Marx's predictions about the course of capitalism.

Commodity exchange, and especially capitalist commodity exchange, literally abstracts labor and treats different concrete labors as homogeneous.\n\nThis is an interesting observation and a good way to hypothesize, but we are looking for a generalized equation free from intent. In particular it doesn't explain why we should prefer this over competing theories, for example a multi-factor model. In other words even if we have reason to believe that capital does create value from labor, how can we know if it ONLY creates value from labor? LTV answers that question in the negative without any empirical evidence\n\nI think this will be the last response I make, unfortunately I don't think we're making much progress. I would like to steelman your position though, since there have been good defenses of LTV in Marxian literature. Cockshott and Cottrell do a good job of advancing LTV as a scientific theory: https://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/eea97.pdf\n\nIn particular it outlines what is required to be a scientific theory, provides theoretical formulations of value, and then verifies the relationship with empirical data. I don't agree with the methodology or conclusions but it's an interesting read. Personally I don't subscribe to any theory of value, I do not think simple ideas of value have any predictive or explanatory power, and therefore they have any worth whatsoever in economics or politics. It is very easy to ignore value altogether and carry on exactly as you were before.",
