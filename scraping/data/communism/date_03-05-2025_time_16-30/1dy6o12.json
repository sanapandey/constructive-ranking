How France went from far right to far left in only a week?\nWhat do you guys think?",

            "body": "Hi, froggie here.\n\nTo make things simple, in June we had the Europeans elections, which are single-turn elections with proportional.l, i.e. the score is taken as a whole for the country. This election saw the far-right coming first with over 30%, and Macron's party second.\n\nSeeing this, Macron decided to revoke the National Assembly (the french president can do so once a year), saying the results of the far-right were \"concerning\" and that he took them as a proof of a lack of legitimity. So we had to go back to voting, this time for our representatives.\n\nThose elections are local ones with a two-turns system. At the end of the first turn, far-right was ahead in a lot of constituencies, with scores coherents with its showing during the Europeans elections.\n\nBUT! Right after Macron's announcement, the main left and far-left parties made an alliance which surprised a lot of people with its speed and strength. Add to that the fact that both Macron's party and the left alliance went more or less with the same policy of what we call \"Republican front\" (to put it simply, you can have more than two candidates during the second turn, but both Macron and the left called for their candidates who were in third place to drop out in order to give more votes to one another instead of taking the risk of seeing the far-right coming in first), and there you are.",

And 8.5 million is still a large number of people in spite of the constant propaganda. Likewise, it shows that the overall population is not ready for a revolution. For neither a fascist (thank god) nor socialist (sadly) one.\n\nBut even if this doesn't lead to any meaningful change at the moment, I would still see this as a net positive. Hopefully this is just the first step of many to move, not only France, but the entire west more left. But for actual revolution, I think it's far more likely that the global south will spearhead it.",

The NPF only has a relative majority, and the far-right has more representatives than ever in the fifth republic.\n\nOverall, the differences remain the same. The major cities and the west voted for the NPF or Macron's party, whereas the countryside and the south-east voted more for the far-right. That was expected tbh, it's been several elections where we saw the countryside and the former industrial regions (coal, heavy industry) shifting more and more to the right.\n\nThe organization of the NPF is a mix of the two. They presented a common program, taking from every consisting party former programs, trying to reach a compromise. Now the left in France is sadly famous for infighting, so as of now, we are hoping the alliance will stay strong.\n\nThat's it for your questions. Feel free if you have some more.\n\n(And sorry for my English, I swear I'm doing my best)",

All of these are significantly more complicated than what Americans understand about French politics.
