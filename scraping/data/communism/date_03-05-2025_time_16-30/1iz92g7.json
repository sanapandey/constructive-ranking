I always see large discussions in the comment sections and I wonder how many books have these people read to be so insightful about Marxism, Stalinism, etc. I wanted to ask and find out how many people have read the servers study list and how much it has helped them in there strive towards revolution?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is to contrast how capitalism has colonized the minds of people across many countries.\n\nGuevara gives important insights about armed conflict in a revolution, as a Marxist-Leninist himself. His book on Guerrilla warfare tactics show how a rebellion can succeed as an underdog despite overwhelming odds. \n\nMao and his Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung is especially relevant in its critiques of the rise of liberalism as a deviation of Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary socialism. He saw it as a form of individualism or bourgeois thinking that focused on personal interests over collective good and ultimately is more inclined to uphold the status quo rather than aiding the revolution.",

Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm\n\nLenin saw the recognition of the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat as so important that he even stated that:\n\n>Only he is a Marxist who extends the recognition of the class struggle to the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat. That is what constitutes the most profound distinction between the Marxist and the ordinary petty (as well as big) bourgeois.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch02.htm\n\nStalin simply enforced the dictatorship of the proletariat. Even then, the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually the most democratic political system that has ever existed since, for the first time, it represents a dictatorship of a majority over a minority and not the opposite (what, for example, happens under capitalism aka the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie).",
