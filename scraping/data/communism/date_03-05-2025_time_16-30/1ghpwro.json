    "selftext": "Obviously, a lot of military shooters are typically propaganda and specially imperialist propaganda for the United States, such as call of duty battlefield and so on. But there are obviously some games out there that try and do more critique of America, such as spec ops the line.\n\nAnd the way that halo is treated it really does feel like it\u2019s trying to be sincere about its message of humanity and not trying to be propaganda but at the same time, I wouldn\u2019t also be surprised if it was \n\nSomething so heavy  in lore usually doesn\u2019t tend to be able to be flexible enough for propaganda. Unless you\u2019re (from an outsider perspective) Tom Clancy is presume. ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

            "body": "If your question is whether it is ultimately any different from *Call of Duty* in being an ad for the Army, only in the fact that it is far less relevant now. Halo has been used by the American military as a tool for recruitment campaigns multiple times so it has objectively served that purpose. \n\nThe first game took the \"US military but in space\" concept straight from *Aliens* and shed most of its satire & substance. The plot was always based on a fascistic fantasy - you're taking on the role of a genetically-enhanced super soldier and stand as the primary obstacle to a genocide of a universally Americanized future human society. The sequels struggled to hide the influence of post-9/11 anti-Islamic sentiment with the massive emphasis on religious motivations for the war taking place, and introducing an antagonist-turned-protagonist that was even going to be called the \"Dervish\" (but the was name changed at the last minute.) \n\nThe games never offer any real criticism of the human society they depict. What little exists is found in the extended canon of the books and other media which a tiny percentage of people who play the games will consume, and it's not even good critique - what you get is \"maybe it was bad that the not-CIA did human experimentation but if they didn't humanity would be extinct\" and \"maybe the inhabitants of some planets outside the not-American core were a little mistreated but they all became terrorists and humanity was going to go extinct if they weren't stopped!\" \n\nI can't stress enough, but critique is not antithetical to propaganda. Critique is very often central *to* the presentation of propaganda. I don't think Halo even qualifies when its most critical state directly reinforces imperialism as a necessity, but I'd ask you why you think something like *Spec-Ops: The Line* (which does at least seem to be trying) isn't also serving the logic of imperialism and fascism that the American military is built on. If you examine it on anything but the most superficial level, you can see that it does.",

That seems unlikely to me.\n\nIf you mean that it has some pro-military traits, obviously yes. It's an FPS game where you're a member of the military.\n\nAlmost anything *can* be used as propaganda for almost any cause. That doesn't necessarily mean there's some deeper conspiracy at work. American culture is just pro-military in general; the creators of Halo grew up in that pro-military culture and were influenced by it.",

They then trained them as soldiers and used medical procedures to augment their bodies, killing and paralyzing half of them while teenagers. The aliens were not even known yet, this was all to use them to kill \"insurgents\" aka civilians and resistance fighters. The insurgents were very clearly fighting against a fascist empire that extracted all their resources and wealth. \n\nThis is all hinted at or shown in brief cutscenes in the games, but much more prevalent in the movies/books. In the later games ONI, which is their CIA basically, plays a larger role and is very clearly an evil secret cabal serving the interests of the elite at the expense of the people.",
