The common response has been to point out that the proletariat has always had conditions of precarious existence and that the system of Fordist guaranteed lifetime employment is a geographical, temporal, and demographic exception. Well yes, but if that's the case why have \"left\" politics oriented around this exception for so long (as well as \"theory\" to justify it) and why have even the inklings of a more precarious labor market in the imperialist core caused an existential crisis, requiring a whole new term?\n\nYou're free to smugly laugh at naive liberals who are discovering for the first time the system of labor brokers and believe someone who relies on an app is the same as a coolie being bought and sold like a piglet \u5356\u732a\u4ed4 (Mai Zhu Zai). I think laughter is better than sympathy since the two are still nowhere close and communism has a long history of capitulating to the labor aristocracy. But scientific study is better than both.",

The term \"precariat\" obfuscates the significant differences between proletarian precarity, petty bourgeois precarity, and the erosion of the labor aristocracy as a stratum (it's no coincidence the term gained currency in response to the Great Recession, when said labor aristocrats realized en masse that our position wasn't as guaranteed as we'd thought), and tries to lump them all into the same category. These things may appear comparable to the labor aristocracy, because our position as a stratum has both bourgeois and proletarian features, but trying to equate them on the basis of appearances ignores the different forces generating them and leads only to an inability to understand reality.\n\nAt the factory where I work, the most interesting thing about the temps - workers who are placed with us by a staffing agency, whose pay is typically 20-25% lower, and whose benefits are significantly worse - is that very few of them are white and many of them are immigrants. In other words, the distinction isn't due to \"gig work\" but precedes it.",

The \"precariat\" is just workers who don't have as many rights, i.e., they are marginally closer to conditions for the proletariat in the entire global south. The presumption that precarity is new or somehow worthy of a new class differentiation is a bit of reactionary propaganda trying to paint the \"normal\" state of affairs for workers as one of safety and security, a simple reversal of the truth, which is that the petit-bourgeoisification of Amerikkka and the imperial core was the actual anomaly. Capitalism *is not* comfortable; precarity is built into the system as a feature. It was only through the megalomaniacal subjugation of the entire world that the imperial core even briefly felt livable and comfortable. We are now bearing witness to the erosion of that comfort because capitalism no longer needs to pretend to be comfortable. Liberals are so pacified that they will accept slavery before they admit capitalism is a scam.",

This lecture is a part of sociology course for engineering where we are expected to someday manage workers on-site. Demographic of those workers is transitioning from white native majority to imported labour force mostly from brown countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, India). I suspect this is a way to label cheap foreign (specifically from brown countries) labour in a \u201cacademic\u201d way. \n\nWorkers from Asia are imported here by agencies that are colluded with the state. Officially, papers are clean and workers have a right to a minimal wage and adequate living conditions. In reality workers are paid much less then the minimum and housed like cattle, 5-10 people in a single \u201croom\u201d. Rest of the money is then laundered appropriately.\n\nSo, I agree. The term in itself is stupid, but I can see it being used in the future, specifically by \u201cleft\u201d circles where I live and it should be fought against then. I could be overestimating it, however.",

Yes I have some issues with him, but still; it\u2019s still worth reading. \n\nIn terms of phenomena and change - you can\u2019t tell me with a straight face that the male dominated, primarily industrial, proletariat of Marx\u2019 time is identical, conceptually, to the proletariat of today, who dominate service industry/gig economy and are often new wave migrants, and of course - women. As SpazLightwalker said, it isn\u2019t a new class per se, at least I wouldn\u2019t agree with Standing that it is; but it\u2019s a term used to describe new phenomena (yes I\u2019m aware issues of migrant Labour and short term contracts aren\u2019t new, but Standing describes the evolution of recent labour relations pretty well all the way back in 2011, better than I can in a brief Reddit comment). \n\nAbove all else; the left has to approach these new workers with new tactics. Stay with me here. I\u2019m not for a moment suggesting typical Marxist organising is now defunct because of Deliveroo/Uber/Amazon. But, we do have to recognise that unionisation for instance in these precarious sectors does require different approaches, for instance because these workers are dispersed and atomised etc., rather than standing shoulder to shoulder on a production line. For instance, Standing also talks about how male workers of this sort are easy targets for fascists as they are disconnected from traditional social circles with old modes of labour (I.e social clubs); it\u2019s worth a read. \n\nBasically I would encourage all Marxists to explore concepts beyond our traditional theoretical orthodoxy so as to enrich our own analysis, for instance decolonial theorists like Fanon; even if they aren\u2019t explicitly orthodox Marxists, should be engaged with.  I have no problem if someone analyses Standings work and disagrees (I for one, don\u2019t think the precariat are a new class, but rather a particularly downtrodden segment of the proletariat, one that does differ from the reserve army of labour for a few reasons). I assume he is in some ways a liberal and distinct from our philosophy. But I don\u2019t think concepts like precariaty, especially in advanced technological societies in the imperial core, are somehow entirely mute and dismissed purely because they diverge from a particularly rigid interpretation of Marxism.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve been clear and expanded on my original comment.",

The proletariat in Marx's time was only \"male dominated\" in the same sense that the modern work force is still [male dominated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy). Demographically, men in the industrial workforce were outnumbered by women and children - and in numerous instances they fought to keep women and children out of specific roles and industries, in order to maintain their own slightly better wages and positions (Engels wrote about this in Condition of the Working Class in England), just as whites fought against Blacks in industry in the u.$. after emancipation and u.$. citizens are fighting against immigrants now. For proletarians, work in Marx's time was even more precarious than it is now, with the effects of factory closures, mass layoffs, seasonality, and major convulsions in global and national markets being even more pronounced. Even \"working from home\" existed in the 1800s in the form of the piece-work system most common in textile manufacturing. The fact that different concrete forms of labor are being performed now doesn't change the underlying logic and requirements of capitalist social relations of production.\n\nThe prosperity and stability granted to laborers in the imperial core in the second half of the 20th century was built on the reconstruction of Europe after WWII, but this was a transient economic condition. The same old cracks in capital's rotten foundation showed themselves again in the 1970s, when a contraction of the reserve army of the unemployed that actually was fairly unprecedented in capitalist history meant workers could make demands that were too uncomfortable for capital to meet, and capital responded with mass offshoring. Moving capital overseas to reduce labor costs and extract superprofits also isn't new - Marx describes exactly how it works in volume 3 of Capital, and Marx and Engels' letters include observations on how it can ultimately \"bourgeoisify\" the working class - and the difference during this period was quantitative, not qualitative. Another of capital's responses (again, Marx described how this works) was to move into new sectors in search of higher than average profits, fueling the expansion of the tech sector beginning in the '70s as well. These were two of the factors that subsidized elevated living standards in the imperial core for a little longer. Again, though, excess profits are only ever a temporary phenomenon, and 2008 revealed what would happen when they ran out to members of the labor aristocracy who hadn't been born yet when precarity last existed on a large scale in the imperial core. For the first time, thousands of college kids were looking down into the abyss of proletarianization and seeing how deep that fucker went. However, this was just a specific manifestation of a phenomenon already well-known to Marxists.\n\nAs Marx describes in Capital, competition destroys the advantage created by each introduction of new technology and opening up of new industries, because it forces those technologies to become widespread and drives capital into the emerging industries until the rate of profit obtainable in them drops to the average or below it. Along the way, more and more workers learn how to operate these new means of production and create the commodities of these new industries, and as skills become more commonplace, their exchange-value on the labor market drops. Because proletarians are in competition with one another to sell the commodity of their labor-power (which Marx noted in the Manifesto, along with competition's detrimental effects when it came to the proletariat organizing as a class-for itself), they seek any advantage they can find - not just building themselves up by pursuing training and education and relocating to follow opportunities if they're able to, but by keeping others down (this is why racism, sexism, settlerism, homophobia, etc. are able to reproduce within the proletariat despite harming the class as a whole). The devaluation of a university education in the imperial core by both its increasing commonness and competition from equally educated and qualified immigrants is just the latest manifestation of a phenomenon that's existed as long as capitalism.\n\nThe features by which Guy Standing identifies the \"precariat\" in his [frankly silly TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnYhZCUYOxs) are \"unstable labor and unstable living\" (the universal condition of the proletariat in Marx's time); having to do \"unremunerated labor that is not recognized, and is ignored, but if they don't do it, they will suffer consequences\" (thousands of men, women, and children literally fucking died of overwork and industrial accidents in Marx's time because if they didn't put themselves in harm's way, they'd lose their jobs, which could easily be a death sentence too); and \"having a level of education that is above the level of labor they can expect to obtain.\" The last one, as I explained above, is just a recent manifestation of competition as a universal feature of capitalism - but it's also one that can, at least partially, [be considered bourgeois](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm). A college education is a product of countless hours of social labor, distilled through countless additional hours into the most important and foundational ideas of a given science or discipline - and then individually appropriated by college students as an investment which they expect will return a surplus. In that aspect, they've done what millions of petty bourgeois all over the world have, and just like so many of those petty bourgeois, they've now found themselves confronted by a market where they can't sell the commodity their capital is set up to produce at the average rate of profit, and may even have to sell it at a loss or not at all.",

The labor aristocracy is now a stratum under siege as well, watching the privileges for which their forebears fought and organized (and sometimes [hatecrimed and backstabbed](https://readsettlers.org/)), the ones they thought they'd always have access to, slipping away in realtime. Like the petty bourgeoisie, many members of the labor aristocracy are responding to this existential threat by turning to fascism. However, as a stratum of the working class, the labor aristocracy has another possible option: allying themselves with the proletariat, the ones whose existence actually is precarious, to overthrow capitalism. If we want to take the most optimistic view possible, the fact that the mishmash of categories in the term \"precariat\" sometimes includes ones like migrant laborers, who really are subjected to hazardous and oppressive conditions (see OP's clarification about how they encountered the term), could indicate the recognition of this option. If it is, though, I don't know of any instances where that recognition has turned into meaningful action. The fact that it would require labor aristocrats to throw away their privileges and commit \"stratum suicide\" is an obvious barrier.",
