    "selftext": "My family is Puerto Rican, and as a Marxist, I support Puerto Rican independence. My family is fine with this view, but I often struggle to discuss Puerto Rico with others, even those who consider themselves \u201cleft leaning\u201d. When I explain my support for independence, they usually counter by saying, \u201cMost Puerto Ricans don\u2019t agree,\u201d as if that invalidates my opinion. This response completely ignores over a century of American influence and propaganda, as well as the brutal crackdowns on the independence movement in the 20th century (Look up the Ponce Massacre).\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating because their argument often boils down to \u201cListen to Puerto Ricans!\u201d, as though that\u2019s the only factor worth considering (Not to mention most Puerto Ricans don\u2019t exactly support statehood, either. Besides, turnout in the referendums are low.) This is my main issue with the liberal tendency to believe that if a group doesn\u2019t seem to want something for themselves, it automatically means that stance is right. Of course, we should listen to oppressed people, but life is complex, and there are often external reasons as to why someone might not support their own liberation. For example, most of the working class isn\u2019t Marxist, but that doesn\u2019t mean Marxism is invalid. I see this kind of thinking mostly applied to people of color or non-Western nations, as Americans, particularly white Americans, often don\u2019t bother to learn about other countries\u2019 histories, even when the U.S. has played a significant role. This is why I don\u2019t agree with \u201cjust listen to x group\u201d; it oversimplifies things and avoids a real understanding of the issue.",

My family tends to also accept the liberal framework more although they understand what I am saying and don't try to call demean me personally. \n\nWhat I tend to emphasize is that the colonial relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico has led to the public consciousness being shaped by the United States. Puerto Ricans do not remember the Ponce Massacre. My own father who is a liberal was the one who taught me about Pedro Albizu Campos and other socialist figures in PR history. Yet they aren't able to recognize themselves who crushed those leftwing movements. Liberals don't understand that these referendums are heavily influenced by U.S. interests and economic pressures. I tend to emphasize that becoming a U.S. state will not help PR. You are already watching wealthy mainlanders invest in real estate and displace local Puerto Ricans. My family always criticizes that the local government never does anything but they don't understand how little control the governor actually has. Puerto Rico is a prime example of a neo-colony. We have the illusion of democracy. PR is just a neoliberal tax haven for wealthy people.",

The United States has destroyed Puerto Rico for many years now. Everything is automated. They don't grow as much sugar cane as they use to. The United States destroyed all the manual labor from cutting sugar cane to having it mechanically removed from fields.  The cost of living is very high in Puerto Rico. Many Puerto Ricans came to the US to find work and better opportunities only to discover racism and oppression here in the United States. \n\nPuerto Rico would be better off free and independent from US imperialism and colonialism. The richest people in the world has brought up a lot of land in Puerto Rico. The people who support Puerto Rico becoming a state of the US are voting against their own interests and people. \n\n\u00a1Que Viva Puerto Rico Libre Y Socialista!",

The traditional model ignored the social embeddedness of people and posed itself as class/race/gender etc\u2026 neutral while fully working within the bounds of the hegemonic ideology of a given era/region. But a crude standpoint epistemology, where the mere possession of a given identity confers perfect knowledge about anything and everything pertaining to that identity is clearly an overreaction and completely unscientific. There is still a role for expertise and investigation in forming knowledge, not to mention that this sort of standpoint epistemology is self defeating; as soon as two people who share an identity disagree, how is this adjudicated according to this viewpoint?",

This reveals that we make choices of what to support not based on majoritarianism but based on what we think is right. \n\nThat said, the reason you want Puerto Rican independence (I assume) is because of its exploitative relationship with empire. I think it can be helpful to push at the contradictions present in the ground truths instead of jumping to high level conclusions. Outlining what would be fair for the people of Puerto Rico, and how it is antithetical to US imperial interests to provide that, could be a more constructive starting point for why you believe independence is ultimately necessary.",

A historic number given how many typically abstain from voting. A growing number of young Puerto Ricans are starting to back independence, a movement once thought to be all but dead on the island. Even high profile figures like Bad Bunny have begun criticizing the PNP and pro-statehood factions though to be fair, I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s explicitly endorsed independence",
