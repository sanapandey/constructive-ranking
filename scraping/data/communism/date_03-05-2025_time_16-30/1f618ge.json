A few months ago I remembered encountering a protest where there were mass orgs chanting about \"Stopping the U$ War Machine\". The other thing of note is that currently some universities in the PH are housing refuges from Palestine, and there were events a few months ago as well where those people got to speak.\n\nThere are a few reasons though for the interest of the Filipino in the situation in Palestine, our country though historically catholic has a large muslim minority. A lot of OFWs work in the middle east. There are parallels drawn regarding war and U$ Military presence. \nThe other note is that the Philippines also has a stake in the conflict in Palestine due to actions in WW2, where Quezon allowed Jews to shelter in the Philippines. Due to this Filipinos (though not sure recently) have Visa-Free travel to Israel. There are also military and economic ties, in the form of our governments purchase of military equipment from Israeli companies. At least from here there is a way to connect the situation outside to our perspective inside (pantayong pananaw) which further connects to our ongoing struggle.\n\n\n///\n\nThis is tangential but I don't know where else to ask it but I've also seen in news articles of similar protests and chants in Japan. What is the stake of Japan in Palestine? There seemed to have been some connection in the past because there were radical leftist groups that had engagements with the Palestinian resistance. But I don't know enough to speak on it more.",

The take being that the U$ not only has military involvements in the middle east, but have military bases and equipment here in the Philippines.\n\nWhich is why I mentioned the 'pantayong pananaw', our stake in world politics is in how it informs us of ourselves not what we can do to the abstract world. As such there is a progressive point to combating U$ Military presence here (right now we even have recent agreements that bring Japanese military here), and connecting it to the Palestinian situation to show how all this talk about Amerikkka defending 'Freedom and Democracy' are bullshit, and we should not entertain their presence here.\n\nIn a funny way this has the material result of actually helping Palestinians, as it weakens U$ imperialism.",

Going off my experience talking to these people, they tend to have no understanding of Palestinian history or the Palestinian resistance, and are looking forward to the day when a \u201cceasefire\u201d is put in place and they can go home and forget about Palestine.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m being too uncharitable to the chant.

            "body": "(1/3) I was going to write a response to u/[AltruisticBag2535](https://www.reddit.com/user/AltruisticBag2535/) in Portuguese but as u/turbovacuumcleaner made a big commentary on the question of settlerism and the national question in Brazil I will just translate part of what I wrote and try to articulate better my view on this. Also I\u2019m posting this here because the comment chain was getting too deep and hard to navigate.\n\nWhen I mentioned the possible influence of US cultural hegemony on this matter I was specifically referring to something you u/turbovacuumcleaner pointed out which is:\n\n>As to the Black Panthers, there is no proper equivalent, but to say there are no major black, or black nationalist orgs is also wrong: there was the FNB in the 30s and MNU in the 70s, and the analysis of black genocide came from Abdias do Nascimento, the Brazilian equivalent of Garvey. (\u2026) Still, this black movement criticism targets miscegenation directly as a myth, and that the black question (and by extension, indigenous) has to be instead studied as between whites and non-whites. To make the concession of the several ways of addressing a black person, be it moreno, pardo, negro, preto, etc. is to fall into Gilberto Freyre\u2019s theories as the most complete form of Brazilian white supremacy\n\nThe problem I view in this line of thinking is that a very large number of people in Brazil that describe themselves as pardos do not view themselves as black or negros as the Negro Movement attempts to portray. It is very clear why that would be the case, \u201cnegro\u201d is very firmly associated with African descent and to a large section of pardos African descent may be minor or non-existent as indigenous descent is more prominent. As a result, \u201ccablocos\u201d and other miscegenated people who have no clear or visible African descent simply do not feel represented at all in any movement and choose to describe themselves into this dubious category of pardos as a result.\n\nThis is especially true in the North, Northeast and Center-West. The problem this creates is very different from the US in which the racial and national question is more evident. Even if a black or chicano person in the US does not have a national consciousness they (generally) do not have a \u201cconfusion\u201d or ambivalence over which race or ethnicity they belong to.\n\nAs you say if we are to analyze the situation dialectically there is no contradiction in settlerism having been recognized first in the US and later being applied to a Brazilian context but this is not the problem I was pointing out. The problem is precisely the formulation manifested throughout the Negro movement that lumps together all non-whites as one singular whole aside from tribal indigenous peoples when this is not the Brazilian reality. It is absurd because it\u2019s forcing an identity that does not exist on people, denying their self-perception of their own race. There must be a different analysis of the racial question in Brazil, the fact that this formulation that pardos and blacks are the same is upheld by the liberal negro movement should raise a red alert.",

                    "body": "(2/3) Regarding the matter of the existence of a national consciousness/identity which you also pointed out the other key difference is that in the US the national movements of the oppressed nations were constituted organically through historical organizations which struggled for the express purpose of national self-determination. The same has not occurred here, the organizations you cited, FNB and MNU, did not have self-determination as an explicit or implicit goal, in fact it was the opposite. You describe this as \u201cBundist nationalism with a decolonial/postcolonial veneer\u201d but unless I\u2019m interpreting this wrongly it clearly can\u2019t be the case for FNB which supported the Estado Novo dictatorship and had a close relationship to integralism.\n\nThis is something I was going to comment on after u/[AltruisticBag2535](https://www.reddit.com/user/AltruisticBag2535/) mentioned how NOI could be compared to the \u201cfanatical religious armed groups\u201d and the militias which exist today. I don\u2019t believe this comparison is apt at all unless it is about some group I have not heard of. The biggest example of a \u201cfanatical armed religious group\u201d in recent years is the \u201cComplexo de Israel\u201d in Rio which I view as emblematic of the difference between the black nationalism that exists in the US and the lack of a black or \u201cnegro\u201d national consciousness in Brazil. NOI may have been a reactionary organization but it did have a revolutionary goal which was the self-determination for New Afrika. This is what attracted Malcom X and other socialist revolutionaries to them. What is \u201cComplexo de Israel\u201d supposed to represent? It is a paramilitary drug trafficking organization terrorizing the population in conjunction with the militias \u2013 which are basically indistinguishable from the drug traffickers nowadays \u2013 and the police, using the genocidal zionist entity as a symbol of pride and power. There is not an ounce of revolutionary character to this, it is in fact one of the most grotesque forms of reactionarism imaginable.\n\nBut if we are to use FNB as an similar organization to NOI in Brazil the same problem appears. NOI had a revolutionary frame because they struggled for self-determination despite the reactionary impulses. When NOI had events with Nazis their motivation was separatism, the notion that the black nation must separate from the white-american nation. The revolutionary notion of self-determinism degenerated into the reactionary one of voluntary racial segregation but the background still existed.\n\nFNB never struggled for separatism or self-determination and their relationship with integralists was due to a communion of ideas and goals. The integration of the negro population into the corporativist Brazilian state as an organic part of it. To this end the negros would have to \u201cevolve\u201d into \u201ccivilized beings\u201d. There is no revolutionary background, only reactionarism. Aside from struggling against racial discrimination what revolutionary perspective did FNB and MNU bring to foreground in Brazil as Garvey and NOI did in the US?\n\nSo I still can\u2019t see how this supposed separate national consciousness has ever manifested itself throughout Brazilian history. I go back to the example of quilombolas because it is the closest analogue which exists but I also don\u2019t see how they can be tied to the larger negro movement as they became self-contained and formed their own common culture like creole people\u2019s throughout Latin America.",

                            "body": "(3/3) In the end the key problem is, how can a unitary national consciousness/identity be formed if a large segment of the people does not even see themselves as belonging to the same ethnicity and if no organic national movement ever rose up throughout history to showcase the historical constitution of this nation? If we are to utilize at least part of Stalin\u2019s criteria, the \u201cpsychological make-up manifested in a common culture\u201d does not exist among pardos and pretos. It is not possible to say a unitary \u201cNa\u00e7\u00e3o Negra\u201d exists in Brazil and to do so would be an example of importing a US concept and national movement into Brazil without any adaptation and this is what I see as a manifestation of US cultural hegemony. In fact I would say it is worse, because in the US maoist/revolutionary movement New Afrika and Aztl\u00e1n are recognized as being different historically constituted nations, no one says hispanics and black people are the same and that the struggle should be of one \u201cblack and brown\u201d nation against the white settlers.\n\nIf a \u201cNova Africa\u201d movement were to be formed in Brazil and another national movement for \u201ccablocos\u201d and \u201cmesti\u00e7os\u201d in general, as these peoples have very heterogeneous psychological make-ups throughout the nation and do not fit into a singular unitary national identity, it would be more coherent but the matter of non-existence of any manifestation of national consciousness still remains. Then there is also the matter of territory, as, unlike the US, there is no clear way to demarcate these supposed nations. When you talk about New Afrika and Aztl\u00e1n it is possible to delineate approximately where they are supposed to be formed as there is a clear concentration of these peoples in certain regions. Considering the differing self-perspectives that \u201cpardos\u201d and blacks have of themselves how could these nations even be demarcated? Aside from a large concentration of black people in Bahia I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible.\n\nAs this comment is already too long, I want to tie all this to the point I originally made, which is that the settlerism that exists in Brazil is a moribund one as a result of the lack of imperialist surplus value flowing into the country to sustain a massive white labor aristocratic/petty bourgeois base for a genuine settler nation. As you point out the whole of Latin America started as a settler project but in the age of imperialism none of them could advance to the status of imperialist nation as the Anglo-Saxon settler states. Miscegenation is then a result of this disintegration of the settler project, as white settlers were proletarianized or declassed completely in large amounts and many began intermixing with the people of African and Indigenous descent which constitute the core of the working classes but not the entirety of it. But this process of disintegration is not complete here in Brazil, and in the Southeast and South settlerism (perhaps a good translation to Portuguese would be colonismo to differentiate from colonialismo) is more pronounced then elsewhere in country. Perhaps in other Latin America countries the process of disintegration has advanced even further, like Paraguay and Peru, but this analysis is better left for the communists of their respective countries.\n\nThe communists should therefore have a focus on racial contradictions and not national ones, to finish the process of disintegration of this moribund settlerism through agrarian revolution and socialist construction. That pretos and pardos should be the main focus of communist organizing goes without saying, as they constitute the majority among the working classes but a white proletariat/semi-proletariat still exists in Brazil because even if it is not a predominantly semi-feudal country it is still semi-colonial as too much extra surplus-value is extracted from it through imperialism, immiserating the vast majority of the population.",

Additionally, defining what colonialism itself is, wasn't discussed yet and it's been unclear at what point, or why, some colonies were just colonies and others were settler-colonies. Technically all colonies require some degree of settlement by the metropole, though this doesn't immediately necessitate the form settler-colonialism takes of settlement with its garrison against the surround or its usage of superexploitation and slavery to sustain a growing, parasitic settler society. I don't think it's entirely correct when you and u/turbovacuumcleaner agree that *all* of Latin America started as a settler project (unless the implication is that the usage of *Latin* is distinct from just *South* America, to which I think that statement becomes more accurate but still not entirely clarified). With a clear dialectical understanding of the relation between colonialism and settler-colonialism, it would be more insightful to see where one form was principle over the other and how one form could exist in a moribund state as you state with regards to Brazil.",

I was mostly considering the nations in which the similarity with the US settler project is more pronounced (ABC countries + Uruguay and Paraguay perhaps). This goes to show how heterogenous the phenomenon really appears to be, the wider dialectical understanding of the relation between colonialism and settler-colonialism as you said is also still somewhat unclear to me. In the ABC nations the project was very explicit but regarding Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, a more in depth analysis would have to be made to determine what form was principle over the other or even whether settler-colonialism manifested itself at all at any point.\n\nIn hegemonic Brazilian academia a very vulgar mystified version of settler-colonialism is propagated, essentially differentiating the US as a predominantly settler colony (col\u00f4nia de povoamento) and Brazil as a \"traditional\" colony (col\u00f4nia de explora\u00e7\u00e3o), which is then taught in schools. It is how I was originally taught. As a result it is widely believed in common discourse that this would be the explanation for Brazilian underdevelopment. The idealist reactionary conclusions some liberals/social-fascists draw from this is that African slavery was a \"historical mistake\" and Brazil should have been a settler colony like the northern US, not utilising slavery to develop. The role slavery played in primitive accumulation in both countries is completely ignored and I suppose the genocide of the indigenous people's was a \"necessary tragedy\" in their minds. Therefore I understand where the inclination towards denying this obviously reactionary view and theorizing that Brazil was a white settler nation all along and still is comes from.\n\nThe main proposition I was highlighting in my comments is what I perceive to be the degeneration of settlerism in the age of imperialism within non-imperialist nations. The two phenomenons seem indissociable to me, as in, without the super-profits engendered by imperialist monopoly capitalism and the resulting formation of a wide labour aristocracy and petty bourgeoisie, settlerism cannot sustain itself fully in the current epoch and hence degrades into a moribund form, which in turn results in large miscegenation between declassed white settlers and indigenous and African descendants, hindering the constitution of a separate national consciousness/identity within these ethnic groups.",

This is not the origin of miscegenation at all, nor the fate of settlers here. Miscegenation isn\u2019t even new, it exists since the colonial period, founded on pillaging, rape and prostitution committed originally by the big landed bourgeoisie as a necessity for the lack of a vast settler army from the Portuguese, which is why settlers were deemed a necessity after the independence. It not only allowed for the preservation of big landed property within the families of these Portuguese settlers, but also to create a vast declassed contingent of mixed white, black and indigenous populations that had no access to land and were tied to the big landed bourgeoisie through patriarchal relationships. And yes, settler colonialism is dying, but not in the way you think through miscegenation (that leads to white supremacy), rather, through the failure of industrialization, increasingly less appropriation of surplus-value in imperialism and failure of turning Brazil itself as an imperialist country, as shown recently with the death of Delfim Netto: Delfim was the compromise between all bourgeois classes after the initial shock of the coup plunged the country into an economic crisis, expressed in his contradictory policies of satisfying both the compradors through monetarism and the national bourgeoisie through developmentalism; the failure in maintaining this compromise is what made Delfim being forgotten, with no classes wanting to claim his wretched legacy. Now, the settler white masses have to share increasingly less amount of surplus-value with the black and indigenous masses, they turn to fascism and imperialism in order to repress them. That the majority of the current black movement is social-fascist does not mean you get to discard every contribution that has been made by the most oppressed populations of the country as a \u201cred alert\u201d solely because of their petty bourgeois leadership that seeks to reach a compromise with the bourgeoisie, this is racism, plain and simple. Your points are not coming entirely as an advance on this discussion that has already started and is dragging all the sections of the white petty bourgeoisie to it, rather, they are a distant and tacit support for whitening, they are simultaneously an advancement, while leaving a door open for the attempt at regression, an abhorrent one.\n\nI was not planning on writing more because I thought the subject had reached its limit for the time being, but this is clearly not the case. You started from the idealist point of the existence of a white proletariat without providing any evidence for this, rather, this proletariat would exist solely because a LA does not, which in turn comes from the country\u2019s position as a semi-colony. I did not insist on questioning this because this opens the door to what u/smokeuptheweed9 was cautious for falling into reformism, but now that we have reached the point white chauvinism is being shown through this analysis, I have no option but to delve deeper here.\n\nDoes the white proletariat exist? I mentioned the settlers that arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo were rural proletarians, but were they really? Every class is in a constant state of motion, and the motion was not that this rural proletariat remained one, rather, it quickly bought land, turning themselves into the petty bourgeoisie and forcing all the country to slowly transition to wage labor, as this development had created a revolution in relations of production that lasted until the 1980s. This rural proletariat coexisted with slavery as well, not only that, the loans and policies for subsidizing immigration were all built upon slave labor; the white rural \u201cproletariat\u201d was built through black slave labor. These white immigrants did not transition from a rural proletariat to a labor aristocracy, they transitioned from a rural proletariat to a substantial petty and middle bourgeoisie. The big landed bourgeoisie expected miscegenation to happen through this, it did not. Property was preserved inside the ranks of the petty bourgeoisie, while the mixed indigenous and black peasant and slave populations were left to rot and became the proletariat (the basis for Vargas as a bonapartist \u201cFather of the Poor\u201d was built on top of this, as during his time, this class was still a semi-proletariat transitioning to industry, and it is what turned black and indigenous culture as the staple of national identity, despite preserving white supremacist ideology and its economic structures intact). There is still a clear [regional]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Munic%C3%ADpios_do_Brasil_-_Grupos_%C3%A9tnico-raciais_predominantes.png) divide that lays the territorial basis for arguing the existence of oppressed nations, contrary to your misconception. If a white proletariat exists, as does the vast white petty bourgeoisie, it can only liberate itself if it supports even more the liberation of the black and indigenous proletariat and peasantry, who will truly constitute the worker-peasant alliance. I did not digress into industrialization all that much as well, because its consequences are polemic, to say the least, and they are not really necessary for establishing the settler-colonial basis, or so I thought. A bad mistake on my part that I shall not make again:\n\n> At the same time, in Brazil, skepticism with the working class took shape in the sociological production that pointed the Paulista workers \u2014 in large part coming from the countryside and smaller cities \u2014 as a social category of satisfied and conservative people. In the Grande S\u00e3o Paulo, workers and their families quickly rose up the social ladder, conquering a far better material situation, and enjoying rights they\u2019ve never had before. They\u2019ve already made their individual revolution, and did not need social revolution. As always, sociological positivism sense aspects of reality, but omitted dynamic contradictions and limited itself to exposing the fragmented and static conjunctural frame [this last phrase is the actual important part to determine if this proletariat exists or not, and considering this and the next text are addressing the origins of the class that gave birth to PT].\n\nFrom Gorender\u2019s *Combate nas trevas*, and from [here]( https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02800458):\n\n> Brazil\u2019s roughly 100 million people can be divided into three groups: a tiny developed country of 5 million people with a level of consumption equal to that of the average European; a surrounding society of 15 million, living at the standard of the rich underdeveloped countries; and a vast nation of 80 million people subsisting on a standard of living that is among the lowest in Latin America.\n\nEven if we combine all the sections of the big and middle bourgeoisie, we would still not get 5 million people, much less 1/5 of a country living as the top of the oppressed nations (a number that increased even more in the early 2000s); a similar interpretation was shared during the Comintern: Guralsky stated the black masses shared the view the white masses were benefitted by imperialism, so it was up to the white proletariat to prove this was not the case. Even with this huge petty bourgeoisie, the majority of the country lives miserably as any other nation oppressed by imperialism, where proletariat and peasantry are truly found and, as it so happens, are black and indigenous, not mixed, be it pardo, mulato, caboclo or one of the other hundred ways of addressing color. Which then, brings me to my next point: miscegenation is a myth, and none of the categories that I mentioned above exist as identities. The pardo identity is a non-identity: the identity of not being white, but close to, so it has no choice but to increasingly more approach whiteness without ever truly becoming it, an identity founded on national and gendered oppression, developed so as to murk the possibility of creating [racial and national consciousness]( https://revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br/civitas/article/view/16939/10963): \n\n> The concept of miscegenation came to \u201ckill\u201d the possibility of the political affirmative of the racial question [This is where liberal scholars will promote social-fascism, it is  up to proper Communists to take their contributions from them and to turn those into truly revolutionary, because if it were left up to this class, this would be solved through public policies, hence, the quasi-program of Bundist nationalism.]. By emptying the perspective of power/violence of the colonial encounter, acting as a providential amnesia of historical facts, miscegenation celebrates the fusion of elements of the modus vivendi of the three races so that, in this cauldron, race itself is suppressed. This narrative becomes effective for maintaining the place of economic and subjective privilege of the white race and, in relation to the black race, to assist in the amnesia to historical horrors",

It is also the celebration of people coming from all countries of Earth, that came to this new part of the New World to fuse themselves through generations to the definitive formation of a nation that does not know race prejudices.\n\nAnd much more [recently]( https://nacla.org/news/2019/07/05/racial-democracy-reloaded):\n\n> it was the secretary\u2019s [former Bolsonaro Minister Weintraub] personal stories and constant use of racialized language that confirmed his discomfort with themes covered in social science classes. As the secretary answered some of the senators\u2019 questions, he persistently used the word \u201cmutt\u201d (vira-lata) to highlight his and the Brazilian population\u2019s miscegenation, doubling down on the narrative that there is no racism in Brazil because \u201cwe are all mutts.\u201d He legitimated his comments because, as he declared, half of his family had Indigenous and Black heritage (which, he noted, could be proven by DNA test), and were, therefore, \u201ctruly Brazilian.\u201d And the other half was from northern Europe, and therefore, \u201cwhite like a sheet of paper,\u201d as he said. The secretary\u2019s skin color, which he considered to be brown (moreno), was, according to him, the result of a mixture of northern Europeans with Brazilian northeastern,caboclos (mixed-race) from Cear\u00e1 state. Weintraub claimed that this background exempted him from any accusations of racism.\n\nIntegralismo and Brazilian fascism in general are peculiar because they are white supremacy without actually looking like it, and developed through the failure of the settler masses to complete the black and indigenous genocide under the pressure of imperialism: integralismo is the alliance of the big landed white bourgeoisie turned into junker capitalists, represented in Pl\u00ednio Salgado himself, the national bourgeoisie in Roberto Simonsen, and the petty bourgeoisie through the Schmidt Bookstore and the mass base of integralismo being from Italian and German immigrants. Once the conditions that gave birth to integralismo were no longer present, miscegenation was already consolidated ideologically through Vargas and these classes had become stronger, all fascists became generic liberals associated with the \u201cleft\u201d of the Goulart era: Vin\u00edcius de Moraes (who argued racism was something you solved in bed, reiterating Fanon once again), C\u00e2mara Cascudo, San Tiago Dantas, H\u00e9lder C\u00e2mara, Darcy Ribeiro (not an integralista, but that declared his fascination for it) and many others.\n\nThat pardo and all other mixed identities are non-identities is proved in their own instability and being unable to join the ranks of white supremacy, these are [transitional identities in the process of whitening]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Reden%C3%A7%C3%A3o.jpg). There is no \u201cpardo\u201d or \u201ccaboclo\u201d culture, rather, there is a transition from black and indigenous identities to white ones that is incomplete, therefore, they are not white. The \u201ccaboclos\u201d of 1957 were not a separate group of indigenous people, they were a transition that was reverting back to being solely indigenous, so much so they had to be destroyed with the real indigenous nations of the region. When the struggle for land advances, these identities collapse on themselves and give birth to indigenous and black ones again, an example of this happened barely ten years ago: the struggle around aldeia Maracan\u00e3 allowed for mixed populations to rebuild fragmented, and presumably dead, indigenous nations such as the Puri. Miscegenation does not prevent the formation of consciousness of oppressed nations, but it does make it substantially harder, which is why attacking the founding myth of Brazilian nationality is a duty of every serious Communist.\n\nYour line of thought is following the same reasoning as UV. Why is UV important? It was the sole national organization birthed directly out of 2013, and so far, no one has even tackled why it disappeared in the worst way imaginable: a seemingly anti-imperialist [program]( http://web.archive.org/web/20231116233533/https://unidadevermelha.blogspot.com/p/o-programa-vermelho.html) that included, among other things: Agrarian reform without compensation for landlords for destroying archaic relations of productions, nationalization of strategic assets from foreign companies and creation of councils of workers and peasants. Then, how the fuck does an organization with said program ends up, ten years later, as one that has as its motto: [peace, land and tradition]( https://web.archive.org/web/20240413002858/https://www.soldapatria.org/manifesto)?! Not only that, but that it stands for a tropical people modeled after Catholicism, forged by indigenous and black elements, tolerant and flexible, an organization that is centered in the traditional character of the people, with this traditional character being most fully expressed in Vargas\u2019 trabalhismo?! UV started in Communism and ended in integralismo!\n\nAfter UV\u2019s collapse, some of it\u2019s former cadres, including part of the original leadership, gathered in a new study group aimed at forming a new organization: the study group was focused on studying [revolutionary nationalism]( http://web.archive.org/web/20231116233439/https://unidadevermelha.blogspot.com/2016/11/renasce-gloriosa-unidade-vermelha.html), and resulted in the creation of Nova P\u00e1tria. A few years later, Nova P\u00e1tria turned into Frente Sol da P\u00e1tria, completing their transformation into integralismo. I could be reductive and say their assumption about revolutionary nationalism was already setting them up for fascism, as Brazil has no relevant history of anti-imperialist nationalism, but this would be wrong. The mistake lies in how UV understood the [black]( http://web.archive.org/web/20231121202715/https://unidadevermelha.blogspot.com/2014/03/normal-0-21-false-false-false-pt-br-x.html) and [indigenous]( https://web.archive.org/web/20231124033407/https://unidadevermelha.blogspot.com/2014/03/xenofobia-etnia-e-questao-indigena.html) question:\n\n> Other deviations that must be avoided, and that are not that strong \u2014 the black movement as a whole, in the international level probably in the international level, was already able to overcome this debate \u2014  are conceptions like \u201cBlack Supremacy\u201d. History saw before movements that were not as influential that preached racial superiority of blacks, many of them for religious reasons. They believed whites were the enemy, that they should be rejected and fought, and that the black people was superior, \u201cchosen by God\u201d. The most well known historical example is the Nation of Islam, that was quite popular in the US. They ended up in preaching \u2014 in reverse \u2014 what the black movement should fight: segregation and racial oppression, in the hopes of turning the black man a privileged one.  Such \u201cleftist\u201d (i.e. narrow, reversely \u201cracist\u201d) conceptions and practices in the heart of the black movement are not as strong as they once were, and ended up being overcome. Movements like the BPP, among other black organizations that rose with the decline of organizations such as Nation of Islam, and were responsible for weaving a character of fight to the black movement that should be seen as a reference even today. In this sense, we understand the white man, though privileged, should not be fought \u201cin itself\u201d, and what must be fought is \u201cwhite power\u201d: racial domination, white supremacy, \u201ccultural whitening\u201d (that praises religions such as Christianity, but demonizes African gods and other customs and African religions). \n\n...\n\n> As a result of our colonization and the many peoples that passed through the land, we have present social consequences, and as we are one of the biggest territories of the globe, we also suffer from the spread-out diversity of this territory. We have significant differences between regions, from striking and impossible to be ignored physical and cultural characteristics, and that reach the point of such estrangement that cause a separatist feeling of not feeling included in what\u2019s understood as Brazilian culture.\n\nWhy was the separatism surrounding aldeia Maracan\u00e3 so frightening? Yes, UV recognized in their program the self-determination for indigenous nations, and anyone can do this since we live under the assumption the indigenous people are such an absurd minority to the point they are irrelevant, but why would such a feeling develop in the first place, and why would they ask questions concerned with these indigenous peoples not feeling \u201cBrazilian\u201d, i.e. not feeling included in white supremacy that deliberately attempts to equal whites and non-whites as oppressed? Similarly, their fear of the black masses of the US attacking the country as a prison of nations spills over here as well, deliberately misrepresenting NOI. This does not serve to prove Brazil is a prison of nations as well, but that this question is unsettling enough to be explored to its deepest point, and that if these lines aren\u2019t taken to their fullest consequences, they will eventually regress to the point of fascism.",

I can\u2019t help but point out again that these discussions seem to remove Brazil from the Latin American context and compare it solely to the United States despite even greater similarities existing among between. Take Colombia for example, the nation with the highest number of African-descended people in continental Spanish America. There a distinctive afro-Colombian cultural identity exists and the territorial matter is clearly pronounced ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Colombians#/media/File:Mapa\\_de\\_Colombia\\_(poblaci%C3%B3n\\_afrodescendiente\\_2005).svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Colombians#/media/File:Mapa_de_Colombia_(poblaci%C3%B3n_afrodescendiente_2005).svg)) No unified cultural identity exists between mestizos and afro-colombians, because, same as here, these cultural identities where formed through different historical processes. Since no mestizo identity exists here, instead we have this problematic and dubious pardo. Communists can\u2019t take up the liberal negro movement\u2019s erasure of indigenous peoples without criticism as you appear to be doing since that is a racist, opportunistic position that erases one people\u2019s struggle to prop up the other. That article comparing Fanon and Gilberto Freye is an example of precisely this racist presupposition, mechanistically applying Fanon to a Brazilian context, aside from being steeped in nonsensical post-modernism that ends up going nowhere as usual.\n\nThe map you posted to is also precisely the type of incoherent and failed analysis that tailing the liberal negro movement will lead to. You group every mixed person from Bahia to Amazonas into one non-white \u201cnegro\u201d category and you say this lays the \u201cterritorial basis for arguing the existence of oppressed nations\u201d, ignoring the completely heterogeneous historical process that happened within each region. If pardo where to be eliminated and substituted with negro, cabloco and indigenous identities the matter could be more clear but we don\u2019t have that data.\n\nIf what you mean by saying that cabloco or pardo is \u201cmythical\u201d and no real identity is that these peoples should simply identify a part of the indigenous masses, it is also incoherent. Clearly non-tribal indigenous descended peoples and indigenous peoples living in tribes do not constitute the same \u201cnation\u201d or cultural identity, in many cases not even a common language exists as linguistic assimilation was very thorough for those no longer associated to a specific tribe. You could say the relationship between them is non-antagonistic \u2013 not sure about this either, considering garimpeiros and grilheiros attacking tribal indigenous land are mostly pardos/cablocos, this would require a much deeper examination \u2013 but grouping together non-tribal indigenous and tribal indigenous peoples into an attempted unified national movement would be idealist, non-Marxist. It essentially throws out Stalin\u2019s analysis of the national question out of the window completely. If in settler-colonial nations Stalin\u2019s analysis is insufficient, completely discarding it for a non-analysis like this, that groups people together solely out of phenotypical characteristics or opposition to racism and white supremacy is even worse.",

Here\u2019s what I wrote:\n\n>The two phenomenons seem indissociable to me, as in, without the super-profits engendered by imperialist monopoly capitalism and the resulting formation of a wide labour aristocracy and petty bourgeoisie, settlerism cannot sustain itself fully in the current epoch and hence degrades into a moribund form, which in turn results in large miscegenation between declassed white settlers and indigenous and African descendants\n\nHere\u2019s what you wrote:\n\n>And yes, settler colonialism is dying, but not in the way you think through miscegenation (that leads to white supremacy), rather, through the failure of industrialization, increasingly less appropriation of surplus-value in imperialism and failure of turning Brazil itself as an imperialist country\n\nTherefore, I said specifically the opposite of what you are trying to say I did. I reiterated more than once that settlerism is not decaying due to miscegenation but that miscegenation occurs gradually because of the failure of Brazil to become imperialist which in turn hinders the formation of a national question.\n\nThe fact that miscegenation has existed since the beginning of Brazilian colonization is not relevant to this discussion since I was specifically writing about the decay of settlerism in the age of imperialism since the pinnacle of Brazilian settlerism took place in the beginning of the consolidation of monopoly capitalist imperialism during the decades between 1870-1920, when nearly 70% of the population was white, after the successive subsidized immigrations from Europe from an all-time low of 38%, and it has declined to less than half today. Demographical transition, immigration or people \u201cchanging races\u201d doesn\u2019t solely explain this drop, this is what I\u2019m attempting to find a reason to, why miscegenation happened in Brazil to such a great degree since the beginning of monopoly capitalist imperialism on a world scale and not in other clearly recognized settler societies, and I can only find an explanation through analyzing the relationship between settlerism and imperialism the same as you.\n\nI could not read some of what you linked due to it being paywalled but the excerpt about 80% of the population living in abject misery essentially substantiates what I had written and seems to undercut your own argument. It also aligns with recent studies about income, which show that 70% of the population subsists on one minimum salary per capita, [https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/media/com\\_mediaibge/arquivos/32c7fd77cb1b91b74c2b2a9171febd8b.pdf](https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/media/com_mediaibge/arquivos/32c7fd77cb1b91b74c2b2a9171febd8b.pdf).\n\nSince we have to use IBGE\u2019s latest census data, if 43% of the population identifies as white, that means a substantial number of these people are within this strata of the population living in misery or near misery. The poverty that exists here cannot be compared with the one with \u201cpoverty\u201d in imperialist countries, if that was the case only the absolutly most miserable and war-torn nations would have a majority of oppressed people, an absurd proposition.\n\nSince we seem to have both come to the conclusion that each other\u2019s respective positions are unwittingly forwarding racism and chauvinism I will not be responding anymore. I have also exhausted all I had to say about this and don\u2019t want to continue doing this forever while you ignore most of what I write to then say the same thing. I only made these last comments to again highlight the opportunism and cynicism prevalent in the Brazilian liberal negro movement and how tailing it is a mistake that will lead to chauvinism against a good part of the non-white population and to upholding cultural identities that do not correspond with reality. It is no basis for analyzing the possibility of a national question in Brazil or even for tackling racism in society.",

I believe it is possible to unite the oppressed classes into a United Front, including the proletarian/semi-proletarian strata of white brazilians, as imperialism remains as the principal contradiction but as I explained, due to Brazil being a failed/moribund settler construct, the black, indigenous and miscegenated masses must be at the core of communist organizing and agitation, as they constitute the majority of the working classes (urban and rural proletarians/semi-proletarians/small peasants) and the racial question is still very pronounced since the disintegration of settlerism is an ongoing process.\n\nAlthough I can sympathize with the proposition that the progress of revolution in Brazil may have been impeded by the existence of an unrecognized national question among the black, non-tribal indigenous and miscegenated masses I am unconvinced by the evidence for the existence of a national consciousness/identity, especially one that groups together all these people into a singular cultural/ethnic identity as the liberal Negro movement attempts to do.",
