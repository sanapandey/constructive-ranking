I'm not very interested in postmodern and strictly academic theory. \n\nAny recommendations?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "> There are no objections, mathematical machines, which make it possible to perform the most complex computational operations at enormous speed, are of enormous importance for many areas of science and technology.  An outstanding role in the development of machine mathematics belongs to famous Russian scientists - P. L. Chebyshev, A. N. Krylov and others.  Soviet scientists are continuously improving mathematical machines.  One of the highest achievements in this field are automatic, high-speed electronic calculating machines of Soviet design.  The use of such computers is of great importance for a wide variety of areas of economic construction.  The design of industrial enterprises, residential high-rise buildings, railway and pedestrian bridges and many other structures requires complex mathematical calculations that require highly skilled labor over many months.  Computers facilitate and reduce this work to a minimum.  With the same success, these machines are used in all complex economic and statistical calculations...\n\nWho does cybernetics serve?\u00a0 \u2014 Problems of philosophy.\u00a0[Soviet] Academy of Science. \u2014 May, 1953",
