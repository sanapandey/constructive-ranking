You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I suppose trying to understand the genesis of these things is impossible. It is a discourse which gains a life of its own. That the OP has never had an original thought in their life, merely reactions based on basic race and class instincts, is obvious enough. Still, I have done a lot of research on Burkina Faso to try to get to the truth of the matter and found there's not much there. Behind the attempt to appeal to racists with a sympathetic, unthreatening third world socialist, the facts are unremarkable. Is there a real difference between Sankara and the unknown Jerry Rawlings (who was not unknown to Sankara and directly inspired him)? It's like that thread asking about who counts in \"ACAB.\" It's not clear the slogan corresponds to reality in the first place except in a crude, social fascist way. Trying to reconstruct reality out of discourses in this way seems highly inefficient at best, though probably alluring if your goal is to \"deprogram\" people (i.e. manipulate them into agreeing with you through the shortest way possible).",

In North America most people will learn something about the USSR and apartheid South Africa from school and other media, but Burkina Faso and Rhodesia are imagined to provide easy ways for someone who has read a wikipedia page or a reddit post to convince a \"normie\" with logic that communism/white supremacy is true or viable.\n\nFurthermore at least in many large cities, there are enough Ghanaian and Jamaican people from a variety of class backgrounds that Manley and Rawlings do not provide the safe blank slate which Sankara does. From my own experience when I was the sort of person who would have written something along the lines of \"Sankara was based,\" my biggest fear in talking about politics was being confronted with the \"my parents experienced communism in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ and it was terrible,\" and with Sankara there is virtually no risk of that. At least back in 2018/19, you couldn't even easily google a crime to accuse Sankara of. I remember some anarchist forum post about him along the lines of \"do we have anything on this guy?\"",
