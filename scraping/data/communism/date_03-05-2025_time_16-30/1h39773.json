Now, I don't have any access to any weapons, nor would I like to use one (unless necessary) \n\nSo is there any good self-defense martial arts. I've heard good stuff about krav maga. But I'm conflicted because some videos I've seen were pretty pre-determined and \"scripted\" in a way.\n\nHas anyone had experiences with street fighting or having to use them against a knife or baseball bats or something?",

TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics.

Idiots wont want to fuck with you if you're physically intimidating, my best advice though is if theres ever more than one opponent your best bet is to just run (this is where cardio comes in hand) and if theres just one unarmed aggressor learn how to grapple: wrestling builds strength and confidence a real \"im the baddest motherfucker around\" kind of attitude (i would know as im a wrestler), and bjj teaches you how to immediately end the conflict through a submission.

I do taekwondo, and we do some self-defence, but it is nothing like the rest; learning martial arts will help you, but the most important thing to remember is to only fight as a last resort, and distance is more important than how strong or fast you are. In a self-defence situation, your goal should always be to get away; otherwise, things could shift into you being the aggressor. I'd always just go for a kick to the shins or, if you have an arm-free an elbow strike. Be aware of what the other person can do as well, sometimes freeing your arm could make them open to punch you. To summarise look for openings and try to get away instead of fighting.",

Your intelligence is ultimately your best weapon, and being able to walk away or see a problematic person coming will be your most useful tool. However, as others have stated, there should be plenty of local academies to provide useful methods for general self-defense.",

Sometimes humor, well placed compliment or an absurd statement can get you out of a sticky situation.  I would say IF you can find a good teacher Shaolin Kung Fu is a good way to go.  It's the thinking man's martial art and not bound by the rules of the ring.  Long learning curve though.",

De-escalate the situation if you can otherwise run. Nobody wins a knife fight, somebody always ends up in the hospital. Also Muay Thai is great, most MMA gyms will have a well rounded self defense program. If they teach knife and gun disarms, make sure they\u2019re being realistic. They need to say something like if you\u2019re trying to disarm someone it is extremely likely that you will be shot or cut/stabbed. This is just how these things go, don\u2019t let them convince you that you can now go and fight crime or something. Just speaking from personal experience with some shady, toxic gyms I\u2019ve gone to. A lot of places care more about profit than actually helping people. That could also just be US Capitalism in action.",
