You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": ">Maoists allegedly killed a woman cadre of their outlawed outfit identified as Neelso alias Banti Radha by branding her as a \u2018covert operative\u2019, in Chennapuram forest area of Telangana\u2019s Charla mandal along the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border around Tuesday (August 20, 2024) midnight.\n\n>According to sources, the body of the slain woman Maoist cadre was found in the dense forest area near Chennapuram on Wednesday (August 21, 2024) morning. The incident triggered panic in the volatile forested border region.\n\n>In a statement released on Wednesday morning, the Maoist Andhra-Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee (AOBSZC) said Radha, a native of New Indiranagar in Hyderabad, was killed for \u2018betraying\u2019 the Maoist party and becoming part of a \u2018covert operation\u2019 by the police against the party leadership.\n\n>Radha joined the CPI (Maoist) in 2018 and worked as a dalam member and later as a zonal military instructor and a commander of the protection team of the top leaders of the outfit.\n\n>\u201cRadha turned a traitor at the behest of the police and she was suspended from the commander post three months ago,\u201d the AOBSZC secretary Genesh said in a statement.\n\n>\u201cShe was \u2018punished\u2019 after an inquiry with the consent of people for betraying the revolutionary movement,\u201d he said, claiming that they have foiled a \u2018covert operation\u2019 by the police to \u2018eliminate\u2019 the party leadership.\n\nThis is a significant development as previously traitors inside the party have been instrumental in covert police action - specially in the case of Kishenji and erstwhile polit bureau member-turned-revisionist Khobad Ghandy. The police will go to any extent to trap Maoist cadres as can be seen from the martyrdom of four comrades from Telangana:\n\n>Four comrades of Telangana were served poison in the food by the police informer and when they became unconscious they were handed over to police. The unarmed four comrades were brutally tortured and killed.\n\n[https://bannedthought.net/India/CPI-Maoist-Docs/Statements-2024/2024-06-18-CC-MessageOnJuly28-Eng.pdf](https://bannedthought.net/India/CPI-Maoist-Docs/Statements-2024/2024-06-18-CC-MessageOnJuly28-Eng.pdf)",
