    "selftext": "Tomorrow is the 129th anniversary of the birth of Soviet intelligence officer Richard Sorge (1895-1944).\n\nSorge recalled his formation as a communist as follows: \"The World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, had a profound impact on my whole life. I think that no matter what influence I felt from other various factors, it was only because of this war that I became a communist.\"\n\nHaving experienced the hardships of the First World War, having received several severe wounds, the young German non-commissioned officer Sorge began to wonder: \"For what reasons are wars unleashed?\" He was not satisfied with the primitive answers to this question in the camp of nationalists and chauvinists, but began to thoroughly study the works of Marx and Engels.\n\nFrom Richard Sorge's prison notes:\n\n\"... in the summer and winter of 1917, I began to feel especially acutely that the world war was senseless and thoughtlessly doomed everything to desolation. Several million people have already died on each side. And no one will say how many millions more will share their fate. Germany's vaunted economic machine lay in ruins. I felt this from personal experience, feeling hunger and a growing shortage of food together with numerous proletarians. Capitalism has disintegrated into its constituent elements \u2013 anarchism and speculators. I saw the collapse of the German Empire, which was believed to have a solid and unshakable political foundation. The ruling class of Germany, faced with such a situation, was hopelessly confused and split both morally and politically. Culturally and ideologically, the nation has fallen into empty chatter about the past, into anti-Semitism or Roman Catholicism. Both the military-feudal ruling class and the bourgeoisie proved unable to indicate a course for the state and a way to save it from complete destruction. And it was the same in the camp of Germany's opponents. The political demands put forward by Germany's opponents left no other way to resolve the conflict in the future, except the use of weapons. A fresh and effective ideology was supported by the revolutionary workers' movement, and a struggle was unfolding for it. This most complex, decisive and useful ideology sought to eliminate the economic and political causes of current and future wars through internal resolution.\n\nI studied this ideology in detail at the University of Berlin, especially its theoretical foundation. I have read both Greek philosophy and Hegel's philosophy, which influenced Marxism. I read Engels and then Marx, which came into my hands. I also studied the works of the opponents of Marx and Engels, i.e. those who opposed them in theory, philosophical and economic teachings, and turned to the study of the history of the labor movement in Germany and other countries of the world. Within a few months, I acquired fundamental knowledge and mastered the basics of practical thinking.\n\nThe development of the revolution in Russia has shown me the path that the international labor movement needs to follow. I decided not only to support the movement theoretically and ideologically, but also to become a part of it myself in practice. And since then, no matter what conclusions are drawn about my personal and financial problems, I have embarked on this path. And now, when the Second World War is in its third year and the war between Germany and the Soviet Union has been unleashed, I am even more convinced that the decision I made 25 years ago was the right one.\"\n\nThink for yourself/ Think now",
