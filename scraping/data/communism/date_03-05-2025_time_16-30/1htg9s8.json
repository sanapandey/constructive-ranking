How can things like this happen and yet people still say that capitalism is the greatest economic system we have and condemn people for believing that there is a way to solve these problems? \n\nI am so tired of people seeing things that are meant to bring class consciousness but instead blame it on Jews or immigrants and so forth. Karl Marx has written multiple books a hundred years ago and revolutionaries from all over the world have talked about it but people still don't listen.\n\nEvery now and then I come across a common problem that is caused by capitalism (e.g.: abundance of advertisements, poor public transportation) and I feel like going on a rant. I feel like my friends don't like being around me because I keep getting political.\n  \nAre there any tips to calm down and/or maintain hope that things will get better?",

Do you think it's absolutely wild that even within the limitations of youtuber Simplicissismus's liberalism (South Korea is corrupt and we as a community ought to have discussions surrounding this phenomena), the top comments with the most likes are the ones that sarcastically compliment the peninsula as having \"two dystopias\" or the ones that are only able to conceive North and South Korea with their own historical development in terms of overdone internet memes and video games? \n\nAnd then when you venture into the comment threads below those top comments, you have all sorts of weird gunk from people (and I believe these users are people and not bots, I'm not subscribed to that whole Dead Internet Theory) which range from humanist admonishments of South Korean society to isolated demands for South Korean democracy to hold their \"elites\" accountable like in the United States or otherwise, well-they might end up like North Korea! \n\nI mean, how else can you explain the MV Sewol Disaster of 2014? It was a situation where good people did nothing and bad people corrupted the apparatus responsible for the ferry to move correctly!? Those poor innocent children, apolitical figures who could've been vital for the South Korean economy but now lost to ocean waves, at the whim of mega-corporations (not monopolies, that term implies a historical tendency of capitalism which can be analyzed) like Samsung!\n\n>I am so tired of people seeing things that are meant to bring class consciousness but instead blame it on Jews or immigrants and so forth. Karl Marx has written multiple books a hundred years ago and revolutionaries from all over the world have talked about it but people still don't listen.\n\nAnd do you notice that your understanding of class-consciousness isn't that far removed from these leftist-conspiracy theorists-that is to say that you believe class-consciousness (or lack thereof) among \"people\" is a matter of how many people \"are in the know\" or \"able to understand\" like you do? That all \"people\" need is just more discussions in the void?\n\nNo wonder you lose your temper then.",

Posts like these are constant here and opinions like this in real life but it feels like an 'easy dunk' in a way?\n\nBut the part I vehemently, vehemently disagree with is you equating their borderline conspiratorial and dare I say social fascist understanding of capitalism (I deliberately did not watch that highly recommended 'south korea is a dystopia' video because 'dystopia' videos these days are basically a gateway into weird convos about society being filled with degenerates or smth, it's no coincidence that such videos are often made by openly fascist or social fascist channels) to why they are short tempered.\n\nI have pretty bad anger issues, all in my head. I don't necessarily lose my temper as often but I get pretty close to, and I have. You may call it petty bourgeois anger stemming from inaction and guilt in the face of genocide in Palestine, the war on the people of semi-feudal semi-colonial India, and I would agree with you. But the fact is that seeing Dalit people get lynched, women get raped in broad daylight, Muslims being lynched, seeing untouchability practiced around you, all this takes a toll. More importantly, this anger exists among the most oppressed sections of society and manifests as raging violence against the enemies of the people especially during uprisings. That anger is all to see on the tapes of Palestinian fighters during Operation Al Aqsa Flood.\n\nI know that isn't the same as the above poster losing their temper because they think they have 'woken up' while others are 'asleep', I feel like you do believe that losing your temper often is a sign of not being Marxist or something. Not to mention, I do not think that liberals even get that angry very often. In fact most of the time they are too busy having 'civil' conversations and debates, and just feeling smug sympathy and pity. Maybe I'm oversharing, but most of the Palestine solidarity liberals shed pity tears in those marches before taking videos of the carnival style protests for their instagram. But I was standing there most of the time, almost about to burst into a fit of anger, or beat up a Zionist or white fascist asshole (I have never fought anyone and I would get my ass handed to me by anyone competent at it) in the vicinity. I was also alienated from my uni's solidarity group because I was constantly calling out liberal politics and Zionist normalising ideology, which also ended up slowly decreasing the number of people I was actually willing to talk to.\n\nWith regards to you talking about that piece of shit in the pol-sci class who doesn't regard Cambodians as human beings, the point isn't that you get some epic Marxist dunk. In fact if I had an outburst I would probably look 'lame' to people there and it would not satisfy my ego or anything.\n\nEdit: I wanted to say this before but forgot to, but it is especially apt since I read that OP is a kid from Malaysia. Even if their anger stems from liberalism, that anger can still be a path for them to discover Marxism. It can be something that opens them up to revolution. Yeah sure maybe that's wishful thinking, but who cares?",

I will never forget when I sarcastically mentioned that \"our two political parties need to reach across the aisles when the nation needs them the most, like during the Cambodian bombing campaign of the 70s\" and this one guy (he wore a little american flag cap funny enough), looks at me dead in the eyes and goes, \"yeah man, that's what I'm talking about!\"\n\nBut my point being is that if I practiced liberalism on that day, I probably would've killed someone or more realistically get sent to the behavioral counseling building and a bad mark on my record. That is to say, if I debated with a person who clearly doesn't believe Cambodians are people, let alone someone would be receptive of a history in which American black proletarians didn't sing \"I like to buy the world a coke\" after 1965.\n\nIt's less frustrating to reject liberalism and it would've been less frustrating for me had I just walked out that building in general, chicken be damned.",

Whether I pull an epic Marxist dunk by rhetorically owning someone in a classroom due to my principles or not, it's inconsequential. \n\n>what are you talking about?\n\n1965 was when the Voting Rights Act was passed and signed by U.S President Lyndon B. Johnson. The professor and students, including the guy I mentioned, claimed that racial polarization had been quelled in the country through the democratic reformism and civil disobedience-practices embodied in that very legal document, such concepts they seldom see now being discussed in the \"Palestine Student Movement\" which is why polarization is back in 21st Century America (due to a lack of dialogue and online echo-chamber radicalization they claim).\n\nI did mention that the existence of the Black Liberation Army and Black Panthers, off to the side of the MLK Riots of 1968 entailed an existence of limitations to electoral reforms in that class-to which one student responded with \"yeah but we're not talking about that though.\" \n\nIf I wasn't clear, I apologize.",

That's just not interesting, and you're not the first one to do this.\n\n>Isn't everyone passionate about spreading their opinions and convincing others of the things they believe will make the world a better place out of love for humanity?\n\nAnarchists love humanity (well, if we ignore Nestor Makhno, Petr Kropotkin, Ted K, and the celebrity Luigi, to name a few of almost every Anarchist who implicitly reject history) but after 150 years of horizontal leadership and a politics of advocation for petty-production, the anarchist mode of interpreting reality is just wrong and they deserve to be violently bullied (like what the MIM did according to Hunter). \n\nThe establishing of a dictatorship of the proletariat, tyranny against the forces of reaction, that's going to make the world a horrible place for an increasingly smaller population of the world (the millions of kulaks, comprador bourgeoisie, settler petite-bourgeois, labor aristocrats, etc) but we don't give a shit about them (at least not their class interests) because by historical necessity, they will disappear as the rest of the world's population in the billions consisting of revolutionary proletariat and peasants, will usher in a superior mode of production. And emphasis on historical necessity, the conscious coordination of millions of people in production is just superior to the anarchy of the free market which can only produce parasites, financial crisis, and imperialist wars and has been demonstrated through the existence of the USSR and Red China, no one on here is a Marxist by the basis of \"loving humanity\" alone.\n\nAlso Marxism is not an opinion, it's just the truth.",

I think about that a lot, honestly - a question I have trouble answering is \"when *is* it worth pushing back, debating, calling out liberalism?\".\n\nEveryone on here understands that there's no possibility of debating or shaming liberal settler-aristocrats into Marxism, but is there a place for the instinctive responses of anger and violence (whether those are abated or intensified by an understanding of the class standpoint of the liberals rather than some knee-jerk response of \"those people are just stupid\" or \"I can't believe how evil people can be\")? MIM used to do agitation at bourgeois-feminist parades and pride marches, and table at lifestyle-anarchist punk festivals; this is anecdotal, but I've found close real-life comrades by getting in semi-public fights with former friends about the 2024 eleKKKtion.\n\nI'm inclined to agree with you that oftentimes saying \"well, I understand Marxism well enough to understand that these are a bunch of petit-bourgeois fascists, I'm going to let their comments slide and not lose my temper\" is a form of liberalism in and of itself. But I don't know what the answer is; obviously I'm not going to make a point of going to econ or history classes just to yell at liberals for their obvious self-contradictory, chauvinist, and racist remarks.\n\nWith the coke comment, I think flamez is riffing on [this](https://www.coca-colacompany.com/about-us/history/id-like-to-buy-the-world-a-coke) apical example of kumbaya-style multicultural liberalism of the 60s.\n\nE: I meant feminist *protests* but I think my typo was more apt.",

Most of the times, for me, I would say that the point is to let the people who aren't speaking (because they are afraid of backlash  or because they can't yet articulate their instinct that something is wrong into arguments) know that there is someone who doesn't agree with what is being said, that someone is willing to stand up for that, and that there is an alternative.\n\nIn this scenarios, I would understand that what a teacher or other student was saying was wrong, but I coulnd't exactly explain why. Hearing others articulate what I feel and \"thought\" (since it wasn't yet a thought, like I said more like an instinct) made me feel not alone and made me search for more information.\n\nSo I would say that, at least in some situations, it is important to get into arguments. More for captivating those that are silent than to convince the fascist/liberal that we are arguing with. And I say this against myself, since overall I tend to avoid confrontations in my day to day life, althought I recognize that as a flaw for a communist and am trying to change that.",

I didn't say that Marxists don't get upset or don't have emotions or have, what some people -probably just liberal psychology types- call, \"emotional regulation\". I said that when people experience frustration like the OP's and perhaps more broadly frustration -a distinct emotion from simply being upset- it is many times a result of not being able to understand and hence intervene in reality, something which requires Marxism. Keywords also being \"many times\". Not \"most times\" or \"always\"; not because I know for sure that the latter two terms would be incorrect, but because I don't know for sure that they would be correct. Also I don't believe there was any snark in my response.\n\n> I get upset over things even if my knowledge dictates that I shouldn't because I don't think emotions are 100% rational\n\nAgain, I'm not making any claims about \"emotional regulation\".\n\n> and what you said is still a frustration that comes with being a Marxist\n\nAs I said, frustration, at least in such cases, comes from not being a good enough Marxist. If you understand reality and know how to change it you would not feel frustration. You may still face defeats and feel upset but frustration is something else. The OP faces an all too familiar to me frustration.\n\n> nobody can be a perfect Marxist\n\nThe truth is Marxism and being a bad Marxist means being wrong means not being a Marxist at all. There is no such thing as perfect Marxism, there is only Marxism and not Marxism. To me your argument sounds like the philosophical position some people have that says people can only approach or estimate the truth but never fully determine it. From my understanding that is not the Marxist position.\n\nEdit: I somewhat sympathize when it comes to trying to challenge posts made for the sake of \"owning\" people which serve to terminate Marxist thought. Not that it happens in this sub unlike the rest of Reddit, but perhaps it could happen. However I think in this instance your energy is misplaced.",

It is indeed no wonder that inability to understand and change the world leads to frustration and subsequent emotional outburst as a result of that frustration. How do you differentiate if it's snark? The fact u/Flamez_007 actually tried to explain things to and help OP makes me think they were not being snarky.\n\n\n> no single individual can have a full grasp on the truth which is why communists work in concert with each other with free criticism and implementation of a mass line.\n\n\nSaying that the truth can only be reached through group effort and / or consensus is a more developed position than saying that no one can fully grasp the truth (which as I said is what your argument seemed like). But I'm still not sure if it's correct, or perhaps it is but is simply not useful because no one ever engages with reality as an individual in a vacuum. Of course being able to understand the world as an individual presupposes building your understanding on top of the work of others, but Marxism already contains that within itself. So I think it is possible for someone to be a correct Marxist by themselves, but this doesn't imply that they've arrived at every truth independently, only that going forward they can make some correct assessments by themselves.\u00a0\n\n\nRegardless, this doesn't change my fundamental claim. No matter how Marxism is reached, I insist that it is the inability to be a Marxist which causes feelings of frustration, at least in cases like OP's.",

Marx was wrong (overestimating, at the very least) about the reactionary nature of the peasantry, as Lenin proved; Mao recognizing and working to correct Stalin's errors (as he himself said; I'm not doing some \"Mao was good and Stalin was bad\" western-Maoist-anarchist thing) was a critical factor in the heights reached by the Chinese revolution. And while we're at it, I would guess that the plurality, if not the outright majority, of the time that someone on this subreddit calls someone else \"wrong and non-Marxist\" (correctly!), it's because they fail to recognize the reactionary character of the vast majority of the First World. But Mao himself (as well as Sison and Gonzalo) made this same error, and it *was* an error (I see people dismiss it sometimes with \"well they just couldn't have known better\", as though each of those three didn't have extensive contact with First World communist parties). Though Marxism is truth and to be anti-Marxist is to be wrong, \"being wrong means not being a Marxist at all\" discounts the fact that even the most capable revolutionary Marxist leader is oftentimes wrong for many reasons.",

I also want to add that you shouldn't shame yourself for being young since children and teens are capable of being more correct than adults. under socialist China, the youth were seen as political actors capable of criticizing adults with more power than them rather than people isolated from and incapable of understanding \"the real world\" (which is how they are treated under bourgeois society). you shouldn't replicate this oppressor position and use it to attack yourself.",

While you obviously would not advocate for them to do meditation (that would be very obvious liberalism) I believe your position\u00a0allowed their liberalism too much space, hence them reaching this conclusion.\n\n\nu/Sea_Till9977 is more correct but themselves admit that some of their frustration manifesting as anger has a petty bourgeois origin. I am not sure everyone in this thread telling OP that it's okay to be angry or whatever understands the fundamental origin of OP's emotions, that being what I've been saying repeatedly, as to me was evident in their original post. I have faced the exact same frustrations u/Sea_Till9977 has faced in Palestine solidarity but again I attribute this to my lack of Marxism rather than my grasp of it. If I understood Marxism better it would have been much less frustrating because I would've known what to do instead of learning those things the hard way. Of course as I said in my initial response in some ways this is probably a natural stage for an aspiring Marxist to go through. The frustration itself means I am now urged to learn Marxism better and think in a Marxist way more. This I believe is exactly what u/Sea_Till9977 was referring to when they said the anger can be channeled productively. Since the beginning I've been advocating for OP to study Marxism while others have been telling them basically that there is nothing they can do about it (hence OP coming to meditation).",
