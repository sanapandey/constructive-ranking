Some of the claims in this article read like cobalt mining corporation propaganda. China is operating in the Congo under the logic of capitalism: maximize profits and extraction and minimize costs and taxes. The idea that China is providing meaningful infrastructure in the Congo is an absolute joke, Chinese companies have been in the Congo for twenty years and there have been minimal improvements in infrastructure or spending on the people of the Congo. The millions of dollars that China has spent on infrastructure pails in comparison to the billions of dollars of minerals that they extract every year and most of the infrastructure they invest in is roads that they used to get the cobalt out of the country.  Artisanal mining is not going down it\u2019s been undercounted by those who are invested in  minimizing the problem. Chinese companies work hand in hand with the Congolese bourgeoisie to extract minerals and avoid taxes. They have not improved working conditions of the Congolese miners, because that would cut into their profits. I\u2019m sorry to burst your bubble, but Chinese companies are not in the Congo to help the people of Africa, but are there to get minerals. If you actually read the book you would actually hear testimony from Congolese miners about their material conditions.",

China\u2019s investments in Congolese infrastructure is totally inadequate when compared to the massive wealth they are extracting from the country.

Foreign investment in the mining doesn\u2019t improve working conditions and hasn\u2019t for the past twenty years. China has no incentive to improve working conditions and hasn\u2019t. There are still Congolese children working and dying in Chinese mines. Also you didn\u2019t read the book, so maybe study up first. Then come back and we can have a real discussion.",

Is supporting the people of the Middle East and Africa in their struggle against the oppression of Chinese capital a \u2018traitorous\u2019 act? The patriotism of an oppressed people resisting the aggression of a foreign enemy on its own soil is progressive and just, but the \u2018patriotism\u2019 of expansion in search of resources and markets outside its own territory is a reactionary imperialist behaviour. At the beginning of the Chinese capital's massive entry into Africa, the local people warmly welcomed it. But soon they realised that Chinese capital was not so different from that of the West, and the revolt of the African people became more and more violent. Are these narrow-minded Chinese nationalists supporting the revolt of the African people, or are they siding with Chinese capital and defending its interests? The answer is obviously the latter.\n\nhttps://bannedthought.net/China/Capitalism-Imperialism/2012/Cold%20Wave%20Series%20of%20Articles.pdf\n\nedit: I should add, this article is mainly about the Bo Xilai affair, not Chinese investment into Africa -- this paragraph just stood out since it was written by communists in China interrogating the role of Chinese capital being exported abroad",

                                    "body": ">searching resources and markets outside own territory is now considered as imperialism? What type of communism theory is this?\n\nYes, this would be the Export of Capital and is one of the key components for Lenin's theory of Imperialism, which does not automatically require occupying a country by force.  Saying that imperialism is \"occupying a country to steal their resources\" is basically a liberal definition which ignores how imperialism actually operates or the actual process going on, driven by finance capital. \n\n>Only thing i can think of is that you are a Marxism-extremist\n\nMarxism is extremist by definition -- Marxism demands the forcible overthrow of the present state of things; a total transformation to all human social existence, and the most radical shift and dramatic change to society in all of history.  It's any sort of \"moderate,\" self-limiting, compromising, domesticated \"Marxism\" that you need to watch out for, because that is not Marxism. \n\n>You do know that Marxism does not apply in USSR, China and Cuba.\n\nMarxism did apply in the USSR and China at one point in history (USSR: 1917-53, China 1949-76) but no longer.  Today Russia and China are both ruled and dominated by capital and the law of value.\n\n>Being critical of market economy is so Marxism which no country is following it today.\n\nBasically correct (we can point out that DPRK and Cuba do still resist to some significant degree), but this isn't because Marxism was incorrect or failed, but because the Marxists were defeated and overthrown, by capitalist-roaders who oppose Marxism, who then killed and repressed the Marxists and stole their seat of power.  \n\n> Im Chinese and we would like to call ouselves socialist. Exchange infrastructures for resources is basic socialists market economy. \n\nAnd this is an incorrect label.  The revisionists in power in China today were the enemies of communism, which Mao and the Cultural Revolution had tried to fight against, and today they are still forced to call themselves \"socialists\" to claim the legacy and legitimacy achieved by Mao and the communists, while betraying the revolutionary essence and communism itself to advance narrow national interests of the Chinese bourgeoise.  There is no \"socialist market economy\" -- markets are necessarily antithetical to socialism, and carry all the logic of capitalist production within them, and commodify anything which comes into contact with them; and if they must exist, they need to be contained and fought against and not allowed to expand (or at least admit the expansion is a terrible setback and defeat for socialism).  \n\nI would actually encourage you to read the article I linked, as it is a very good assessment of many incorrect ideological outlooks found within China today, and makes a very clear case that the current \"C\"PC are revisionists and that the restoration of socialism within China begins with organizing outside of that captured institution -- and more acutely, against them.  The fact that it comes from communists within China is actually rather important, as well.  I look at your profile and realize you've found an audience of Dengists who tell you what you want to hear, and tell you \"China is 'socialist,'\" but the short truth is that we are the communists and they are not -- they are the capitalist roaders, once again wrongly calling themselves \"communists.\"  We side with Mao and Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao while they side with Deng Xiaoping and Liu Shaoqi and Jiang Zemin and Xi Jinping (they may pay lip service to Mao but they hate what he actually did and stood for).  We stand for socialism against modern revisionism, and we insist that Chinese socialism fell in 1976; it will not be restored without great struggle.\n\nedit: phrasing",
