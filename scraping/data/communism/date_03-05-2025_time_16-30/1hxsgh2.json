    "selftext": "1)Are there any hacktivist groups who has revolutionary left ideals(not anarchist, a lot of \"popular\" groups act anarch). i mean the first thing in mind is Anonymus but recently they act like pro-dem in their official accounts, i don't know much about them but maybe they have a problem with their \"administration\" even though i don't have an idea about their form of organization.\n\n2)If any of you are in computer science(developer, cybersecurity, academy etc.) or interested in CS as a hobby, how do you implement these ideological values? \nI for one am transhumanist and i believe even though tech became a dopamin p*rn in capitalist society it could become a very important step in evolution in a socialist/communist society(especially internet and the peoples habit to connection that came with it).\n\n\n3)As you can understand i am kinda obssesed with the CS/Tech and Revolution synthesis, so i would love it if you know any author who wrote about transhumanism and anti-capitalist revolutions and such. (even though i am not an anarchist, anarcho-transhumanist books/researchs would be useful too)\n\n\n",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
