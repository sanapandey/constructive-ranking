I was being an idiot. I did some learning, growing and now I can barely remember a time when I didn't support the DPRK. I am impressed by their perseverence. The move to acquire/develop nukes and ways to deliver them is the best deterrent against US/NATO aggression and now Western countries are taking them seriously. Not to mention that they apparently provided Russia with a million (and by some reports several million) artillery shells while the collective NATO and all their partners couldn't come up with a million. lmao",

Or I've been denied a way to make a living and been subject to constant surveillance because my father who patriotically fought the Japanese said that certain people were heroes who then defected to the North (my father was kidnapped, tortured and killed by the state with no accountability). Why should I trust your conversion? Who cares about your mood? That's what it means to have an opinion on the DPRK, it's not for fun. You need to articulate more seriously the nature of your support because the fascist regime in occupied Korea takes it seriously.",

But you've merely circled back to my original question. If the supposed solidarity of white people with the Korean people is contingent on politeness and the line between racism and \"socialism\" is that fragile, why should the Korean people trust the OP? \n\nTo be clear, Korean people don't give a shit about you or the OP. They gave up on the principles of white socialists long ago. I am being generous by even engaging with your racist video that, for a reason you refuse to articulate, you found extremely compelling.\n\n>not knowing better\n\nKorean people do not have this luxury first of all. It is also a lie, you do know better because you are a living, thinking human being, not a rock. It should be trivially easy to admit you were racist in the past and that, for people of color to trust you, you need to openly interrogate why you believed in racist ideas and how they might linger in your thoughts today (obviously the you of the past did not think your beliefs were \"distorted\" so why should the you now seem different in 3 years?). Racism is pretty normal in white society. And yet, this admission which you've already indirectly made is impossible to openly say. Why that is the case interests me. Rather, I already know why. But watching ideology play out concretely always has elements of contingency where new things can be learned about hegemonic liberalism.",
