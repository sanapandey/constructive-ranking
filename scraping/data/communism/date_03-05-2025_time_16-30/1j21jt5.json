                            "body": "No need to debunk. History itself ridicules fascist mythology.\n\nYou've probably heard of Engels' *Peasant War in Germany* and how Kautsky did a bit more follow up work in his study of the Radical Reformation and subsequent Munster Rebellion in his *Communism in Central Europe in the Time of the Reformation*. You will recall then that there were many actors struggling during that time including the followers of Munzer - peasants and plebeian urban workers who wanted to overthrow the feudal order in favour of a religious communal existence. After Luther's capitulation and Munzer's death there were some who wanted to continue the fight and they violently took over Munster and established a very short lived communal government. Menno Simons and his followers, the Mennonites, were birthed out of a rejection of the \"Munster Commune\" and its radicalism - preferring reformist capitulation. They found their place in the Dutch Republic on the land of noblemen who tolerated them (to great advantage) until freedom of belief was confirmed, henceforth spreading yet remaining a people who Kautsky defined as \"a small, well-to-do middle-class community, of no importance, either to the proletarian struggle for emancipation, or to the development of socialistic ideas\". Here is where Kautsky leaves off.\n\nFrom here on out the Mennonites seek increasingly large portions of land to practice their \"communal way of life\" based upon their reading of the scriptures and the life of Jesus - in materialist words, unfettered access to land on which to pursue their religiously-coded method of material reproduction (which becomes much clearer as time goes on, more land is gained, and production increases).And as the land and production increases, so shift the Mennonites in how they define their social existence in relation to others. \n\nOver the years there was migration to and settlerism in many different places. Much of the Swiss and South German Mennonites settled in Colonial America while a group from the North settled in the Kingdom of Poland near the Vistula Delta. It is this latter group that eventually becomes the Russian Mennonites. The Mennonites who settled in the Vistula Delta area held were first welcomed by an edict of King Wladislaw IV in 1642 in favor of their settlement and working of the land. Over the next century or so, the Mennonites amassed up to 300,000 acres of land in this region, yet faced problems from \u201cthose who were envious of their economic successes\u201d (1) and, upon the annexation of the area by Prussia, from the military and church taxations which were based on land ownership, the issue of tributes (which they did not want to pay). In response, the Prussian authorities prevented the Mennonites from acquiring more land, preventing the community from having the desired amount of land available for each Mennonite family unit. In other words, a feudal fetter which the nascent Mennonite Capital could not overcome if not for more migration and settlerism.\n\nIt was around this time that the Russian Empire had obtained land around the Lower Volga regions and in the area now known as Ukraine by removing the Turks from the land during the Russo-Turkish war. Catherine II issued a call throughout Europe for populations to settle the land for the Empire, which appealed to the Mennonites of the Vistula Delta region. As such, many of the Mennonites migrated and began to establish colonies in the south Russian Empire in the latter half of the 18th Century, where they enjoyed significant privileges and freedoms and ample access to fertile land \u2013 easily surpassing the amount of land they owned in Prussia. However, with growth in the population came issues of land access and ownership; with the original communal land already divided among family units, some families became landless and had to work small plots of land on the outskirts of the colony while others simply purchased more lands on which they erected estates. The response was to divide the communal land into smaller pieces and to expand the colonies and give the landless families acreage in new, daughter colonies. In these conditions of economic success and land expansion the population of the Mennonites in the empire grew substantially throughout the 19th Century; in fact, many of the native (Russian) population were hired as laborers to help furnish the expanding industry. \n\nIn the 1870s, another splitting and migration occurred: in the face of some challenges to their autonomy by the Imperial government (who wished to have more than just agricultural product from the Mennonites to fuel the imperial project), around ~18,000 Mennonites left the Russian Empire to settle in Canada and the United States. Canada had invited the Mennonites to settle land in the south of the newly confederated province of Manitoba, in which the government had successfully quelled rebellions of the Metis and Indigenous populations and from which they were in the thick of the process of violent westward expansion. The Canadian government granted two large reserves of land and even amended the Dominion Land Act to attract Mennonite settlement, and the Mennonites \u2013 once a key piece of the agricultural project of the expanding Russian Empire \u2013 proliferated in settler colonial Canada as early roots of the westward Canadian settler colonial expansion. \n\nThose Mennonites who remained in Russia continued to prosper, though their capitalist endeavors garnered negative sentiment from the Russian and Ukrainian peasants and from the laborers that they hired. One such former laborer was Nester Makhno who, along with the Ukrainian peasants, began to target and raid the wealthy Mennonites during the Russian Civil War. In response to this the Mennonites, with the help of the German army, formed fighting units to retain and protect their privilege and property. The linkages between the Mennonites and Germany deepened as the Mennonites faced further challenges to their status from the socialist project of the Soviet Union, including the collectivization and redistribution of the land in the post-NEP period, and the redistribution of the Mennonite labor to other industry across the geographical range of the Union. This was necessary repression of class (keyword \"class\") and reorientation of land and labour to build the socialist project. It was in reaction to this that the Mennonites began to see themselves as ethnic Germans and associate themselves with the Nazi project which used the Mennonites (and other German settlers) as propaganda pieces for their own imperial ambition \u2013 a mutual project which culminated in the Nazi expansion into the Soviet Union in WWII and Mennonite collaboration in its settler colonial expansionist project and genocide. Historian Ben Goossen writes a lot about this in many online articles and in a book of his called *Chosen Nation*.\n\nSimultaneously, in the years following the Soviet Revolution (especially in the collectivization years) and during and after WWII, large amounts of Mennonites left the Soviet Union; some went to Germany, and many went to join the Mennonites who had taken part in the settler colonial projects in the Americas. The fascist historians like to say that most of the Mennonites who stayed in the Soviet Union \"disappeared\". Of course, many were rightly repressed for their fascist sympathies and actions, but based on how the desired definition of Mennonite is tied to a specific relation to production (all religious and ethnic definition simply cloaking this fact) then we can assume that at least some of them simply assimilated into Soviet society (hence disappearance of the identity but *not* the physical person). It is not surprising then that there are heritage tours for Mennonites - sounds like the Zionist project in how it ties the specific pieces of land to the blood as a necessity for the identity, so to speak.\n\nTo summarize, the Mennonites are settlers par excellence. They ran the settler gauntlet several times, being able to migrate to cleared land several times and prosper in the pursuit of their own material interests. Such material interests shifted from a religious communalism born of the era in which struggles against the economic tribute were occurring (but a rejection of its radical message in favour of reformist collaboration), to a desire for capitalist expansion that was nurtured by the development of their internal productive forces through migration to settler projects and stymied by socialist land/labour distribution - complete with a shifting superstructural justification from the religious scriptures to imagining themselves as diasporic Germans. The Polish Kingdom, the Russian Empire, and the Canadian government all had an interest in importing the Mennonites for their own projects of production, and it was only because these projects coincided with the Mennonite project to reproduce their developing classed existence \u2013 from communal peasants growing rich into capitalist farming \u2013 that the two were brought together by migration. And it was the socialist project of the Soviet Union and the elimination of Mennonite privilege that drove the Mennonites to align with Germany, struggle through violent means, and emigrate again; throwing off the religious veil and its \"pacifism\" when the ascent of its Capital was threatened.\n\nIn a nutshell: religion, nationality, ethnicity, migration, settlerism, and violent struggle are all emergent phenomena intertwined with the negotiation of class status and this is especially obvious in this example. \n\n(1) - This is taken from Mennonite historian Cornelius J. Dyck, which I have to include because it is so ridiculous. He laments that \u201cPerhaps the Mennonites, on the other hand, failed to take time for their poorer, non-Mennonite neighbors and scorned them for their poverty\u201d. So much for loving thy neighbor lol!",
