    "selftext": "\u201cOwing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of him.\u201d\n\nThe above is a quote from the first chapter of the Communist Manifesto. While it is incredibly accurate, I was wondering how it will be tackled in a socialist society. If we work in a large scale project that\u2019s bigger than us, it is inevitable that an individual\u2019s contribution to a project can always be regarded as being a cog in a wheel. \n\nIs it that when a large scale project is undertaken in a socialist society, an individual finds solace in the fact that their work is directly for the benefit of the masses which they find fulfilment in, as opposed to churning out returns for stock holders? \n\nAs you can see, my thoughts are all over the place in this matter, and was wondering if there is a book that tries to make sense out of the issue.

I wonder if there is any text that talks about how this plays out or is intended to be played out in a socialist society",

While in socialism this can be used to free workers. (Less hours etc). This means the worker can spend more time on his individual exploration and development of his own personality and crafts.\nSo there will be a rather positive development of the relationship of workers and their labour",

            "body": "You seem to be somehow seeing that passage in isolation from everything Marx just wrote in the six paragraphs above it, which are the exposition of the basis of alienation. Let's try this again, and if you still don't get it, you should read the Estranged Labor chapter of the Paris Manuscripts and Part I of The German Ideology for an even more detailed view of what Marx means by alienation.\n\nIn its most basic sense, \"alienation\" is the selling of property. The basis of capitalist production, which is necessarily production for the market, is the creation of all the things that constitute society's means of reproducing itself as commodities which are private property. Thus, everything the proletarian needs to continue to live confronts him as the property of another. But unlike the peasant or the bourgeois, he has no means of production of his own, no way of producing any commodity he can exchange for the items he needs to consume to survive - he has nothing except his own body, and the capacity to create things, the labor-power, contained inside it. Thus, he has to sell his body and his creative power and give it over completely to the will of someone else who owns the means of production. In doing this, his own activity becomes a hostile power outside himself and in opposition to him - hostile because he is producing commodities for others who keep them away from him through the barrier of private property.\n\nThe capitalist also experiences the necessity of alienation as a hostile force, because like the proletarian, he also has to eat to live, and he also has to first alienate his product in exchange for money to buy food. However, there are other capitalists he must compete with in order to do that, and each is forced to take specific actions by the conditions of competition. \n\nIt's because of these conditions that neither the bourgeoisie nor the proletariat are able to control their actions, despite society being composed of nothing but their actions. They are instead controlled by their combined social activity, \"like the sorcerer, who is no longer able to control the powers of the netherworld whom he has called up by his spells.\" \n\nThe elimination of private property and its replacement by social property, and the replacement of production for the market by production to directly meet human need, overthrows the relations of alienation and allows humanity to take conscious control of our own social productive powers and relations, rather than having to act as atomized individuals at the mercy of something outside of and much greater than ourselves (in spite of the fact that that something is nothing other than the combined actions of the whole society).",

And the reference to the work of artisans under feudalism and its transition under capitalism was an analysis that described the exacerbation of alienation, and not necessarily an advocacy.",

                            "body": "The conditions Marx describes in that excerpt, where conditions of work are monotonous and generally unpleasant, are a specific outcome of the driving logic of capitalism. Under capitalism, the purpose of production is to make a profit, and meeting human needs is incidental. If a specific human need is not sufficiently profitable to meet, or if meeting that need (e.g. the need for better working conditions) eats too far into the capitalist's profit margins (what constitutes \"too far\" is determined by the forces of competition), then that need goes unmet, even if the capitalist as a person might wish it could be met.\n\nThe answer to this isn't a regression to the fragmented and individualistic conditions of production under feudalism, which is impossible anyway because humanity can no longer survive on that basis. Instead, it's the social organization of production to collectively meet human needs in a manner that does not reproduce the hostile and antagonistic social relations (which are the basis of alienation) that are an integral part of capitalism. And meeting human needs means meeting all human needs, including the need for working conditions that don't destroy the worker's physical and mental health and stifle their development as a human being.",

One who labours to produce without any control over what to produce, how much to produce. Without any control over the profits of the production. This is where the alienation happens.\n\nA socialist society would address this by eliminating wages, by eliminating private property, and giving the worker full control over the means of production. A worker could play a \"cog\" role in the overall group collaboration, but wouldn't experience the alienation because they have control over what they do, how much they do, and the value of their doing it.\n\nI think [this](https://www.yorku.ca/horowitz/courses/lectures/35_marx_alienation.html) a decent lecture that will help you to understand alienation better.",
