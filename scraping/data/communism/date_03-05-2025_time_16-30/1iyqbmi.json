You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

His idealistic notion of equilibrium as the absence of contradictions is opposite to the Marxist method. This notion has already caused much damage to Marxism through the arch-revisionist Walrasian interpretation of Marx.\n\n>the proletariat need to develop methods of self-management\n\nThe question is what is the development of 'methods of self-management' exactly. A group of workers can 'self-manage' under capitalism without breaking with any of its logic. They simply become capitalists themselves. What has to be done is the substantial change in the production relations until the conscious 'self-management' of the whole society - communism - is reached. This can't be done with an imposition of 'method' from without, because the mind cannot advance further than reality and any economic scheme imposed to it needs to have as its premises the actual relations of production, no matter how sophisticated it is. That's why both your view and Bogdanov's are revisionist. It's not that technical methods of production and administration are not important, but that they are secondary and subordinated to the class struggle. In the Socialist transition, the formation of a capitalist class is an immanent possibility and it has to be dealt with at every step of the way through political action, until the complete abolition of classes.\n\n> If we're playing the revisionism game then we can claim that for any work of Marxism written after Marx's death.\n\nThis is nonsense and calling it a game is offensive, revisionism has a clear and scientific meaning and it's not equal to everything that's not Marx",

This is a very important distinction because the consumption of bourgeois science without critique is the tailism of it and amounts to nothing new. That's why despite Bognadov's elegies to science, Lenin said that his philosophizing was nothing but empty phrases. It is also politically reactionary because it can't provide a clear, scientific analysis and strategy to the revolutionary movement. Like economism, which subordinates the Party to bourgeois ideology in terms of strategy and tactics, the tailism of science subordinates it to the hegemonic bourgeois philosophy of science.\n\nHere Ilyenkov writes about the context and significance of the critique of Lenin to the Russian Machists in *Materialism and Empirio-criticism* and why it was so important to the revolutionary movement at the time:\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/ilyenkov/works/positive/index.htm",
