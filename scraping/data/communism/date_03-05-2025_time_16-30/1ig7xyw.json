    "selftext": "On February 3rd, another anniversary of the death of Richard Linsert is observed. He was one of the most notable figures in queer liberation during the Weimar Republic and also played a prominent role within the KPD (Communist Party of Germany). Linsert was also part of the WhK (Scientific-Humanitarian Committee) and worked closely with key figures of the queer movement at the time, such as Magnus Hirschfeld, a member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party) but with certain ties to the USSR. For example, it is known that Hirschfeld had connections with Lunacharsky, so he was not part of the reactionary wing of the SPD. Regarding Linsert, I haven\u2019t found any texts dedicated specifically to him, but rather to the \"first homosexual movement\" in general or to Magnus Hirschfeld in particular; in these, Linsert\u2019s figure appears tangentially but still somewhat significantly.\n\nBeyond all this, there is something I can\u2019t quite fully understand: what was Linsert\u2019s stance towards the USSR, especially under Stalin\u2019s government? I read somewhere that he was critical of Stalin\u2019s leadership, but I haven\u2019t found anything concrete to support that. If anyone has any texts about his position on this, I\u2019d be interested. Ultimately, I\u2019ve read some about his activism in sexual liberation, but I haven\u2019t found much information on how he viewed the Soviet project or whether his perspective aligned with the official line of the KPD. I would love to know more about his legacy. If anyone has information, sources, or even reflections on this, I would be grateful if you could share them.\n\nThanks in advance for any contributions.",
