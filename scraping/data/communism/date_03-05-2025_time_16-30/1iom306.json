He viewed \"caste as a frozen class\" when the truth is that capitalism really did unfreeze the blood lineages of imperial Europe and created mobility of classes i.e caste is actually an unfrozen class.\n\nAmbedkar is not grounded in enough materialism and again never engages with the question of caste in any material fashion. However, he deserves a lot of credit simply for precipitation of caste consciousness in modern leftist Indian political thought",

Even mediaeval christian Europe had the \"great chain of being\" and feudalism was organized along bloodlines.\n\nThis has a major implication: Even if we somehow magically did society of all casteist culture and created an egalitarian society, caste-like relations would pop up again unless the material basis of production is changed, because that's what happened in societies that weren't hindu as well, some time very ironically starting out as anti-caste movements.\n\nAmbedkar thinks that you can destroy caste the destroying the  mere superstructure i.e burning the manusmriti. But I think he couldn't realise that even if you treat the symptoms you don't cure the disease, that disease being the material conditions of production. Tackling both base and superstructure are important but Ambedkar only focuses on the Superstructure part and doesn't pay any attention to the base.",
