You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Subsequently a day later, the Samidoun organization [released a statement](https://samidoun.net/2024/10/we-keep-resisting-us-and-canada-sanction-samidoun/) basically saying \"nuh uh\" to the sanctions and that they'll continue the struggle for the Palestinian Prisoners and Palestinian right to resist, dictating: \n\n>The Palestinian people, like all colonized and oppressed peoples, have the right to resist to liberate themselves and their land from colonialism and occupation, from the river to the sea. Those who resist occupation and oppression \u2014 the Palestinian resistance \u2014 are not only heroes of the Palestinian people, they are defenders of all of humanity.\n\nThey then did a bit of damage control by stating they are not affiliated with the PFLP, nor any terrorist organization listed on one of the naughty lists of the U.S., Canada, or the European Union. \n\nWhich is understandable when you still want to do work without painting a bigger target on your organization though I am slightly disappointed. Not necessarily out of some principle that I can defend myself over but out of a more, juvenile want in hoping that Samidoun would double down and say \"yeah, we support the PFLP, so fucking what?\" \n\nLike similar [to that one time](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/samidoun-doubles-down-says-death-to-canada-an-accurate-summation-of-its-goals) when their members wearing Hamas head bands burned the Kkkanadian flag in front of horrified white moms and cops in Vancouver and they released the statement after the incident stating: \n\n>\u201cWe acknowledge that the community was shocked by the phrase, and the burning of the Canadian flag that came after the march was concluded. Yet, we at Samidoun stand by this phrase as the call to action that it is,\u201d wrote the group in a lengthy statement posted to Instagram.\n\nI wish there was a way to find an archive of the old Instagram account so I don't have to rely on a second-hand source but it's whatever. (note: I don't endorse left-wing adventurism).",

You recognize that your desire for Samidoun to openly admit to something that would get its members deported, tortured, or worse, is \"juvenile\", and yet you still expound upon it. As u/Sea_Till9977 said, you do not understand the difference between some group of white moms being horrified, and the organization being put in immediate threat of dissolution, deportation, and death, for its members, most of which are Palestinian diaspora. Stating that they aren't giving money to groups that would cause them to face the most severe repression possible, that is, groups that are part of the Islamic Resistance, is not \"damage control\", it is strategy. What was the use of this comment?\n\nYour research assignment for today: what would happen to the leader and treasurer of every Samidoun chapter in the U$ and Kanada if they did put out a statement saying \"yeah, we support the PFLP, so fucking what?\" This is serious, I'm asking you to dig through the jargon of what the Treasury's statement was, and look into counterterrorism measures taken in the U$ in the past.",
