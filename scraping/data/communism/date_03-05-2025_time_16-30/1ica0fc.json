    "selftext": "Moving through leftist circles I have occasionally ran across this term and people identifying as it or some people using it as an insult. From context of the reference it seems that it\u2019s someone who typically is pro Stalinism or someone who supports violent action and authoritarian forms of marxism. In looking it up I found that it was a term first used by British anarchist to criticize the ussr. As well as several different competing definitions I have found. \n\nI am not personally making any claims against anything and not looking for arguments. I\u2019m just genuinely curious and I am looking to understand what this form of Marxism actually stands for and what makes it different than other forms. Thanks for any information! ",

So anyone from MAGA on cutting aid to Ukraine to petit bourgeois liberals who are against overt genocide to Khruschevites-Brezhnevites-Dengites to actual communists (people who uphold Stalin and Mao and reject Khrushchev and Deng) can be a tankie. In rarer cases it's used by anarchists for anyone who upholds Marxist and Leninist principles. \"Marxist-Leninists\" who try to reclaim it however are revisionists and unserious people.",
