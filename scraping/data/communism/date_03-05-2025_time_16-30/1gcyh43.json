TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking.

I remember before I started seriously studying Marxism (and in particular Marxist political economy), and thus, back when my commitment to Marxism was out of a sense of duty and guilt and mental repetitions of canned denunciations of the first world petit-bourgeoisie rather than out of an understanding of how capitalism functions, every random internet \"Marxist\" retreating to (liberalism/esoteric spirituality/fascism/fandom) felt like the end of the world to me, because it made me realize how truly shaky the foundation of my worldview of Marxism-as-belief-system (as opposed to as science) was. And I think I remember users talking about a similar thing in the thread on Zac Cope.",

I was hesitant to even make the comment in the first place because I figured the answer as to why she pivoted was sorta obvious, but curiosity won out. \n\n\n\nI think your inquiry is interesting and has definitely made me think about why I did ultimately decide to ask. Frankly at least in my case there\u2019s a lot of truth to what you say, I can honestly say it was jarring to see the juxtaposition of her old posts with the new. Not necessarily just the fact that she had turned reactionary, but that the kinds of things she\u2019s able to say with a straight face these days are just so completely awful and laughable given the vast majority of her post history. I guess I thought there would be more of an attempt by her to justify her current politics using Marxist language. \n\n\n\nI have lurked here since only a short time before the invasion of Ukraine, and at that time I was going through a process of unlearning a lot of reactionary \u201cleft\u201d  thinking (and still very much am). I have only just started reading Capital and still lack that deeper understanding of political economy that you mentioned. I can say for myself that my lack of knowledge usually keeps me from joining in conversations here because I often don't feel that I have anything substantive to add yet. I would like to be a more active participant in discussions here which is why I made this account, but I do admit to lacking complete confidence in my grasp of Marxism like you posited. \n\n\n\nNow I wonder how much of that hesitation to engage comes from subconscious fear of critique vs simply wanting to preserve the level of discussion here. Surely I should at least be able to come up with better questions in the future. \n\n\n\nThis was long winded and focused too much on myself, but you gave me a lot to think about.",

It's certainly a moment for self-reflection and criticism, as it definite reveals a latent liberalism deriving from my own theoretical immaturity and lack of engagement in struggle (as well as my class position, of course). I can especially relate to your comment about the persistence of \"canned denunciations of the first-world petty-bourgeoisie\", as this basically describes a great deal of my mental content on an average day: the contradictions between my scientific understanding of the world and capitalism (or at least it's rudiments, as I've only read the first seven chapters of the first volume of Capital), and ideology deriving from class interest, constantly reassert themselves in my mind, which can make it difficult to actually think in a Marxist manner or, crucially, even to study.\n\nThere are *a lot* of liberal reflexes still lurking in my mind, and occasionally they re-assert themselves with full force, putting it into a state of heightened contradiction; they never actually affect my world-outlook in a serious or lasting way, but basically inhibit me from further developing it or putting it to use in analyzing concrete phenomena. They have definitely become less intense as I have become more serious, though. I suspect that a lot of it is actually reproduced by the hatred for class enemies. No amount of canned denunciations can (in themselves) lead to serious Marxist thought, and they have a tendency of actually producing their opposite; purely visceral hatred of the petty-bourgeoisie easily turns into a recreation of petty-bourgeois thought as soon as the external conditions alter, as the former lacks a firmly Marxist understanding to anchor it. When my mind is at its most revolutionary, I often find that I don't hate the petty-bourgeoisie as much as I feel myself to be utterly above them: I don't fear them (that's really what this hate is: a form of expression of the fear of being \"infected\"), but instead totally understand the historical logic of their existence, and their doomed position as a class. The hatred is still there (as it should be: what kind of communist doesn't have hatred for the class enemy?), but it's definitely not the principal aspect.\n\nThis is something that further development and study (as well as, perhaps, a change in personal circumstances) will certainly rectify, and I'm glad that you brought this topic up. I've been consciously self-criticizing the vestigial liberal aspects of my consciousness lately, and your comment gave me a good opportunity to reflect on my recent experiences in struggling with liberalism.",

If your whole life experience is the spectacle of American privilege I guess gossip about the supreme court justices is politics. But no one else in the world cares. Per the example of \"blackredguard\", sure you decided personally that working with the Democrats is the essence of Maoism. It's not like your naive American horizon is some great stand against \"ultraleftism,\" it's just irrelevant and expected to an Indian peasant. Obviously some rich American will act according to their class interest. Americans lack perspective and the proper self-shaming, too much self-empowerment utopian ideology that eventually turns to liberalism when not satisfied by communism achieving immediate results.\n\nHaving read *Settlers* (DoctorWasdarb is a white settler reactionary, not her being hacked) it gave me my confidence in analyzing what's called \"politics\" and \"communism\" in the United States. Such outlandish position is about what to expect from white settler \"communists\" or at least the formers one, like David Horowitz (who unlike DoctorWasdarb worked with the Black Panthers side-by-side although it worth mentioning that by the time the BPP was working with Horowitz it was already deepening into the infamous \"survival program\"). At least BRG was trying to connect the dots with the Black revolutionary past. What about her?",

Does she view this as a \"phase\" or something, like a teenager with their emo phase? Like, \"oh yeah I had my communist phase a few years ago.\" How does she justify that regression in her mind? Someone else pointed out that it's probably that liberal \"pragmatism\" but again, as someone who actually posted some decent stuff to this forum (as far as I remember, I didn't really use this sub much when she was active but read her through search) how can she even cope with that level of cognitive dissonance? I would expect some sort of revisionism/social fascism but to go all the way back to somehow caring about the fucking Supreme Court and ATF?\n\nIt reminds me a bit of Zak Cope but it at least makes more sense in his case how he can regress since it's tied to his career, but to switch up beliefs on an anonymous internet forum with zero connection to the real world? I just find it bizarre even though it does make sense with her background.",

While I would certainly need to do further investigation on it to more confidently understand its nature, I suspect that its a regional settler variation of the general petty-bourgeois anxiety produced by the degenerating state of modern imperialism; it articulates the underlying fears of many settlers about the prospect of their potential proletarianization, of US imperialism coming apart at the seems, throwing them into the world of pain, war, and exploitation that they know exists outside their national cocoon of luxury. There's definitely also the settler ideology of the fetishized rugged white man defending himself and his community against the (usually oppressed national) \"enemy\" present in some forms of its articulation.\n\nThis sort of ideology snuggly fits within broader reactionary \"post-apocalyptic\" fantasies/fevered imaginings, and everything written above equally applies to films like *Mad Max* or fears of \"water wars\". Climate change very much also occupies this place within the reactionary (broader first-world petty-bourgeois, not just settler) consciousness. It's striking, from my personal experience, how often the most apocalyptic outlooks on the future of the human-climate system are coupled with naked social-fascism and petty-bourgeois revanchism.",

The \"antagonist\" of the film appears to be a vulgar representation of neoliberal anxieties about Trump (a rich white US president \"undermining American democracy\" and suppressing the media and journalists, who act as the lionized protagonists). The opposition faction is almost entirely nondescript, though the US breaking down along racial lines is alluded to and the climax of the film depicts the White House under military siege and the president being summarily executed by brown people. The audience is ostensibly meant to be glad Trump \"got what he deserved\" for causing the downfall of settler democracy while simultaneously mourning American settlerism's descent into \"savagery\". There is also a passing mention of a Maoist insurgency in Portland which I rolled my eyes at.\n\nThis is the type of thing where one can come to a fuller understanding of it by just substituting the US with Israel. Imagine neoliberal Israelis making a movie about Netanyahu corrupting Israel's sacred democratic institutions, featuring settler journalists for *The Times of Israel* as the heroes opposing him and ultimately culminating in a shocking scene of the previously flourishing Tel Aviv under siege and Bibi being ruthlessly executed by a mob of Palestinians, the \"only democracy in the Middle East\" now overran by a nondescript encroaching mass of violence and lawlessness. To anyone else in the world this immediately comes across as incredibly self indulgent racism, as does everything the Israeli \"left\" does. Incidentally, right now they are protesting over Netanyahu dismissing a war criminal who described Palestinians as \"human animals\", and the supposed sanctity of Israel's \"lawful and democratic\" institutions in contrast to Netanyahu's \"authoritarianism\" and cronyism is at the forefront of their rhetoric. They also explicitly make the argument that legalist neoliberalism is better at fascism and oppression of the global south than right wing cronyism and that this action will directly lead to IOF casualties and operational failure, which is quite relevant here.",

Local media and critics were mentioning it non-stop because of the lead actor being a celebrity here, and how the movie hit close to home (the 6th of January there and 8th of January here), as US and Brazilian liberalism, and by extension their fascism, have been following the same path for some decades. I don\u2019t agree about the fear of proletarianization being present, at least to a relevant degree, if anything there is an implicit plot of petty bourgeois reproduction surrounding Lee Smith, the older journalist interpreted by Kirsten Dunst, and Jessie by Cailee Spaeny, with the latter admiring the former, but fated to live in her shadow up until Lee\u2019s death that is captured by Jessie\u2019s lenses, thus setting her as the proper petty bourgeois successor.\n\nThe vagueness was not what caught my eye, but violence. It is a tense movie, filled with crude violence, death and a pervading sense of insecurity that something can and will happen at any moment. It isn't a pleasurable watch by any sense of the word, it was made to cause discomfort to the viewer, as most art should be, but lacking the other more relevant part of art: to make the viewer question it, and, in the process, question themselves. The discomfort and shock value of the movie are made so that liberalism comes out stronger in the end, but unlike run out of the mill liberalism that celebrates abstract unity for the sake of it, here the recognition is that this unity is increasingly more implausible in reality, so unity has to come through an idea, a fantasy of terror and coercion, the movie's messaging is liberal, but delivered by fascist means, the result of the real process will be nothing more than liberalism coming closer to fascism.\n\nThis is why it is tense: every American knows they are frightening. The US is horrifying. What if this war machine suddenly turned inwards? What if the world's biggest arsenal turned on itself and all white people suffered firsthand what oppressed nations are suffering right now? Tensions must be deescalated, imperialism saved from itself, otherwise, this may prove to be a future that no one will come out as a winner. Liberalism must be restored by the fear-to-be of powerless liberalism, for a dead liberalism means fascism, but also the Portland Maoists.",

Meanwhile Trump has made appeals to multicultural \u201cprosperity\u201d as a North Star while promising means-tested austerity.\n\nNot that these are any actual shifts. While superficially we might say that there are apparent differences between orienting the prison-house and empire around citizenship or whiteness, these are only temporary consequences of the process by which the latter is transformed to fit into the shifting mold of the former.

I'm using this subreddit mostly as measure for that but even with all the splits and collapses of various Maoist groups, there was at least enough energy in those implosions to provide some forward momentum towards a revolutionary line, even if it was mostly through negative lessons. Perhaps I'm too optimistic about that but I think the alternative of there being little/nothing to work from at all is pretty grim and would lead one to just revert back to a liberal as they meander through Dengist TWism.\n\nPalestine's revolution is still providing a basic reminder of the futility of opportunism on the ground even though there hasn't been much done with that, though I'm anticipating a sudden shift toward \"political education\" given what I can see in my locality. I don't think it's a fundamental break from the pragmatism behind mutual aid but it at least drops the baggage of the latter and you can just get right down to political differences, without having and pretensions of \"doing the work first.\"\n\nChicane and First Nations organizing may be the next hot topic given what's coming out around the \"Latino\" vote for Trump. I'm skeptical of the data but the basic political function of completing the integration of the Southwest (something which didn't occur to the degree it did for Irish and Southern Europeans in the East Coast) is something to become very keen on. I find it useful to make the distinction between Chicane and Latine as a divide between oppressed and oppressor nation, despite what terms people may use to identity. At some point it will likely be necessary or just even inevitable to unite Chicanes and First Nations under one national identity given their already existing closeness in every aspect of nation which Stalin describes.\n\nOther than that, keeping an eye on the various liberal reactions to the news around the \"Latino vote\" might provide some at insights.

I substituted that term in place of the specific phenomenon I've seen in my area. At least in the cities, I notice a merging (economically and culturally) of Chicane and the specific Native tribes that exist here, but that is only my limited view of the situation and am still developing it further. I've yet to get a grasp of the current situation on the reservations, which is a glaring issue and lends itself to sloppy analysis like what you criticized.\n\nRegarding the polling data, I am aware that it is a particular slice of the total \"hispanic\" vote (Latine, Chicane, and all) or lack thereof, but you are right, especially about the latter. I would still say the same phenomenon is present of a broad, \"Latine\" or \"hispanic\" racial category which obscures the historical background on which something like a \"red Latino vote\" suddenly appears out of. My pending explanation is basically the historical summary I gave in the other comment but I'm still in even just the early stages of research. If that explanation (even if somewhat underdeveloped currently) doesn't present any necessary causality then I'd like to know your thoughts why? I've stagnated a bit in this part of the overall study of the \"Southwest\" so getting any feedback would be appreciated.",

I also wonder how your explanation holds up given that the sharpest percent change occurred in southern Texas. like the New Mexico counties with the darker red shifts, they are majority Hispanic and voted blue in 2020, but they are also larger counties population-wise (especially Webb county) so the sharp percent change seems like a pretty big deal.",

The point is that the question of documentation is a contradiction within Aztlan and I would argue the primary one, based off of my own organizing experience with migrant workers (although I am not in the Amerikan southwest where Aztlan proper is located so you or /u/cyberwitchtechnobtch should correct me if this is different there).\n\nThe current push to outlaw birthright citizenship is an erosion of this divide, given what was once a definite future (undocumented workers have kids who then tie them to the land through jus soli) now becomes uncertain. Now, whether this becomes reality is still up in the air (it would be political suicide for the Republican Party among Latine aristocracy but is also necessary for the continuing function of the national bourgeoisie) but this does align with a general trend in the instability in the perpetuation of the neoliberal prison-house characterized by a \u201cmulticultural\u201d oligarchy of comprador factions. One thinks of the death of affirmative action (a mechanism by which candidates are picked from the oppressed nations for collaboration with Euro-Amerika) or the expansion of ICE which disturbs the balance of decriminalized migrant exploitation. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more that doesn\u2019t immediately come to mind.\n\nAs you mention though, this is hardly an issue Holocaust Harris and Trump disagree on.

More interesting still is the Democrat reaction, which is to embrace ICE as a way to \u201cpunish\u201d the Latine compradors for betraying the national order and enabling \u201cfascism\u201d.

Rather, my intention was to highlight that whatever strides have been made (and I do think they have been made) should be fought for and advanced rather than taken for granted. Fifi Nono\u2019s work on the cult-form, and Kites\u2019s early writings, for example are on my mind as of late, since both of these analyses arose out of the conditions of the 2015-2021 period and represent a real fruitful path forward, even if mostly to identity dead ends or incipient revisionist trends. However, these are first steps and more must certainly be done to synthesize these lessons into a productive and anticipatory line in the present. I was mainly railing against any sort of knee-jerk reaction to the aforementioned faux-radicalism, and instead being able to soberly analyze these movements beyond any apparent shifts in rhetoric.\n\nAn example is what you bring up regarding Chicane nationalism and the lessons of assimilation within whiteness. Like you, I\u2019m skeptical of this process overall for a few reasons. \n\nFirst, if assimilation in the Southwest were so simple as a basic appeal to citizenship then it would have long ago been done\u2014 labor arbitrage is not a new process and while the crises born from a migratory proletariat continue to heighten, I don\u2019t see the grounds for a qualitative shift at the present. Second, it\u2019s difficult to make conclusions about Chicane/Latine voting patterns given both candidates were broadly pro-deportation and border enforcement. There\u2019s a case to be made that Trump was the \u201clesser evil\u201d on the question of [deportation](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/MIGRATION-DEPORTATIONS/akpeoeoerpr/) for example, given his general mismanagement of the border wall construction and the widespread publication of ICE actions relative to the 2021-2024 period. Third, voting hasn\u2019t finished yet but it doesn\u2019t appear like Trump gained a particularly large groundswell of support compared to Harris\u2019s drop-off. The particular political orientation of Latine compradors is thus not immediately clear to me yet.\n\nThere\u2019s more to say here certainly, but I haven\u2019t investigated this in depth so I\u2019ll defer to Mao\u2019s timeless quote here. Hopefully you or others have things to add to this reply, or will in the coming days as the full picture becomes more clear.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m fond of the separation of the two as well because it allows us to internalize indigenous critique of settler-colonialism in the Southwest while also acknowledging the oppressed Chicane nation that does exist. It\u2019s often been used for cynical ends but the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo *is* an inflection point worth exploring further. I\u2019ll have to reread my notes for MIM\u2019s work on Aztlan to comment further though.",

At the time the north still had the holdovers of the Spanish system of caste, accompanied by corvee labor and it was beginning to establish close ties through trade/commerce with the Euro-Amerikans coming from the east. For a brief period there was unity between the Mexican elites of New Mexico and the Euro-Amerikan bourgeois but as we know from *Settlers* this was only one side of the coin of settler society and the other side, with it's lust for land, soon took over with the invasion in 1846 kicking off the Mexican-Amerikan war. After the dust cleared (I'm skipping a lot here obviously) what was left was still the prior social structure of New Mexico pre-invasion: a divide between the *rico*s and sustenance farmers, which was only further solidified with the Euro-Amerikan bourgeois deepening relations with the elites in the years leading up to the war. Now that the u.$. had officially occupied New Mexico (and the rest of our modern Southwest), any potential for a native bourgeois of New Mexicans was swept away and the elites were either proletarianized into what would become Chicanes or integrated into Euro-Amerikan societies. The exact data on who became what, is unclear and I'm not sure if it even exists, but we can see the echo of this finally in those polling stats.\n\nThis was a long winded way of getting to that point but hopefully describing some of the history gives a greater view of the overall moment we're in and what a \"Latino\" identity is historically conditioned by and the underlying contradictions which spawned it.

That process happened with organizing against Arpaio's terrorizing of Chicane, migrant, and probably even some Native masses and its happening once again around Prop 314 in AZ, but in a significantly weaker form and with less mass mobilization.\n\n>Do you see any possibility for communist organizing/radicalization among these self-created organizations pushing for change in the legal struggle?\n\nI've only just started getting inroads to investigate this particular form of struggle, so I really don't know yet. I have a better outlook on it than I do organizing around Palestine currently, and there are at least the appearance of the lower and deeper masses being present within these current legal struggles but the cadre circle here is too underdeveloped to really take any productive line on it. My estimation currently is that this is part of an emerging trend around migrant (and Chicane?) organizing in general, particular regarding housing/rent struggles and legal reform. LA Tenants Union (LATU) has managed to organize a wide network of migrant and Chicane masses but from [every document published](https://latenantsunion.org/en/resources/) on their website, it's completely drenched in Leftist slop (even down to that annoying DSA graphic design style). Surprising I can't see any tangible links to the DSA but I can certainly smell their presence. Other than that there is also [Nashville People Power](https://www.instagram.com/nashvillepeoplepower/) (NPP) in Tennessee which is also organizing predominantly Spanish speaking tenants (presumably migrants mixed within there). Their politics are of a similar sordid and shabby quality but with a more openly \"Marxist-Leninist\" leaning due to their affiliation with [A Luta Sigue](https://www.alutasigue.org/) which seems to just be a \"Marxist-Leninist\" reaction to the failures of the DSA while fundamentally not breaking with it or at least revisionism at a fundamental level. If you aren't already, I would simply keep an eye on these developments since they seem at least involve some degree of the lower and deeper masses, though seem to be disparate yet connected in seemingly mysterious ways (that NPP group strangely has the same graphic design and overall bend as LATU, so perhaps I'm just out of the loop with what the DSA is doing within the housing realm these days).",

That doesn't mean that physical laws developed by us are ahistorical concepts, they are conditioned by the historical conditions under which they were developed, and never fully correspond to reality.

It is only practice that can unveil the approximate, limited character of old concepts and develop new ones that further our understanding of reality and enable us to better direct our practice, while still keeping whatever was true in the old concept (albeit in a modified form). Experiments are part of this practice. We force reality to change on our own terms to test and develop our own knowledge of it.

Each step in the development of science adds new grains to the sum of absolute truth, but the limits of the truth of each scientific proposition are relative, now expanding, now shrinking with the growth of knowledge\n\n> From the standpoint of modern materialism i.e., Marxism, the limits of approximation of our knowledge to objective, absolute truth are historically conditional, but the existence of such truth is unconditional, and the fact that we are approaching nearer to it is also unconditional. The contours of the picture are historically conditional, but the fact that this picture depicts an objectively existing model is unconditional. When and under what circumstances we reached, in our knowledge of the essential nature of things, the discovery of alizarin in coal tar or the discovery of electrons in the atom is historically conditional; but that every such discovery is an advance of \u201cabsolutely objective knowledge\u201d is unconditional.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1908/mec/two5.htm\n\nWith every advance in the social knowledge of physical processes, the closer that knowledge corresponds to reality. Physical laws are independent of human activity, that's what I meant in Nature having a 'temporality' (in the sense that it is not static, it still has its own history) different from human development. It is their discovery that is a historical, social process, which imprints in them (that is, in the concepts which supposedly correspond to reality) a conditional character to be surpassed by a future advance.",

It won't answer the question but it will tell you what natural laws are not:\n\n>Hence Historical Materialism looks upon the works of science, the concepts, substances, natural laws, and forces, although formed out of the stuff of nature, primarily as the creations of the mental labor of man. Middle-class materialism [Pannekoek means the vulgar materialism of Vogt, Moleschott and B\u00fcchner], on the other hand, from the point of view of the scientific investigator, sees all this as an element of nature itself which has been discovered and brought to light by science. Natural scientists consider the immutable substances, matter, energy, electricity, gravity, the law of entropy, etc., as the basic elements of the world, as the reality that has to be discovered. From the viewpoint of Historical Materialism they are products which creative mental activity forms out of the substance of natural phenomena.\n\nSo claims Pannekoek.  But Marxism agrees with the natural scientists, and distinguishes between laws and knowledge of laws.  Laws are what u/not-lagrange means by \u201cPhysical laws ... independent of human activity\u201d while knowledge of laws is what u/not-lagrange means by \u201cphysical laws developed by us ... the concepts which supposedly correspond to reality.\u201d\n\nPannekoek further argues that natural laws are generalizations from observed phenomena, basically summaries of groups of past events (and hence inherently conservative).\n\n>On the basis of his experiences man derives generalizations and rules, natural laws, on which his expectations are based.\n\nThat's empiricism, which is pseudoscientific.\n\nAs for Lenin, he touches on the question in his notes on Hegel:\n\n>The concept of *law* is **one** of the stages of the cognition by man of *unity* and *connection*, of the reciprocal dependence and totality of the world process. ... *NB* for modern physics!!! ... (Law is the\nidentical in appearances) ... Law = the quiescent reflection of appearances NB ... NB Law is essential appearance ... **NB** (Law is the reflection of the essential in the movement of the universe.) (Appearance, totality) ((law = part))\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1914/cons-logic/ch02.htm\n\nInsofar as Lenin says that laws are a stage of cognition, he also says that\n\n>The essence here is that both the world of appearances and the world in itself are moments of man\u2019s knowledge of nature, stages, alterations or deepenings (of knowledge).\n\nI need to clarify my understanding of what Lenin and Hegel mean by \u201cquiescent reflection,\u201d but hopefully this points you in the right direction.\n\nMore simply, Spirkin says that law is necessary connection.  Hegel says law is essential relation.",

Moldova during the Russia Revolution had its own movement that organised Soviet power which took over the country until it was defeated after invasion from the Kingdom of Romania that sought to incorporate Moldova as part of a national-chauvinistic expansion which rolled back revolution in Moldova and hindered the development of their productive relations, only for conditions to advance again once Moldova was able to secede from Romania in 1940 and became a Soviet Republic; Romania allied with the Nazis to attempt to retrieve them but were eventually pushed back by the Red Army with the help of the Moldovan partisans.\n\nIt is clear, historically, that a notion of a Moldovan national identity did exist, that it wasn't just an invention of Russian imperialism, and whenever it was contrasted with Greater-Romanian nationalism, it would always prove to be more progressive. Is it possible that if both Romania and Moldova were to become socialist again, that they would seek to unify with each other? Probably, and that would be a progressive movement if it leads to a greater unity for the proletariat classes in both of these nations, but these aren't the conditions that exist today as both  are comprador dictatorships; Moldova being annexed would only result in them becoming a backwater region of the EU, and it would have dire consequences for the ethnic minorities of Moldova who would clash and resist integration  with bourgeois Romanian-nationalism, mainly Gagauzians, Ukrainians and Russians, thus we deem the greater-Romanian nationalism that seeks to control Moldova to be a reactionary movement, and that a Moldovan national-identity can still be worked into becoming progressive bulwark against chauvinistic expansionism and unite the ethnic groups of the country into becoming a cohesive national unit again, like it was when it was a Soviet Republic.",

It should be underlined that the the status quo in Moldova itself (i.e. almost the whole left bank of the Dnestr seceded from Moldova in the 90s) is a concequence of the immedite manifestation of this reactionary Romanian bourgeois nationalism that came with the complete restoration of capitalism. Since then the Moldovan comprador bourgeoisie under the florid parole of \u201epeaceful return\u201c wants to annex Transnistria. With the recently imposed tariffs against Transnistrian export goods (which essentially constitutes an economic blockade) to Moldova and the EU they want to accelerate their sought annexation. The forced \u201ereturn\u201c to the comprador dictatorship of Moldova is in it\u2018s nature reactionary but what makes this case even more peculiar is that they would be coercefully incorporated in to a country in which the ruling class itself ogles with the unification with comprador Romania and therefore ogles with the negation of the Moldovan nation. Indeed only socialism can solve the immanent contradictions of the current Moldovan social formation and therefore liberate it from imperialism.",

But considering the current conditions of imperialism I would say that every semi-feudal country is semi-colonial but no every semi-colonial country is semi-feudal. Ukraine and Moldova for example are not semi-feudal, as collectivization occurred when they were part of the Soviet Union, but they are immiserated and backwards much like many semi-feudal countries and their industries have mostly been reduced to the export of commodities and semi-industrialized products. As for Hungary and Poland I cannot determine with certainty which is what compelled me to ask the question in the first place.\n\nAs for your other observation, I'm aware of that, I said the the nature of capitalism is bureaucratic, not that the bureaucratic bourgeoisie is necessarily primary. But regardless where one exists the other does too, the difference is which one is primary at a given moment of development. From the PCP regarding what is bureaucratic capitalism:\n\n>\"Capitalism develops within a semi-feudal country like ours; at times in which, having reached the monopoly and imperialist stage, the entire liberal ideology corresponding to the free competition stage has ceased to be valid. Imperialism does not tolerate an economic program of nationalization and industrialization in any of those semi-colonial nations it exploits as markets for its commodities and capital, and as sources of raw materials. It forces them into specialization, to monoculture (in Peru petroleum, copper, sugar, cotton), suffering a permanent crisis of manufactured products, a crisis derived from this rigid determination of national production, by factors of the capitalist world market.\"\n\n>(...)\n\n>The quoted paragraph proposed that capitalism develops in Peru, but it is a capitalism subjected to the control mainly of North American imperialism, not a capitalism that allows a national economy and independent industrialization; but quite the opposite, a capitalism subservient to the imperialist metropolis which does not tolerate a true national economy serving our nation, nor independent industrialization.\n\nAs I said these countries may not be semi-feudal but the nature of capitalism that exists in them is extremely similar.",

The question of Azerbaijani nationalism, for instance, warrants a different evaluation today as it relates to post Islamic-Revolution Iran, compared to when it was a socialist movement struggling against the Pahlavi dynasty and attempting to leverage the Red Army to secure independence from Imperial Iran in the mid-1940s. These two forms of Azerbaijani nationalism, though both in conflict with Greater Iranian nationalism, serve two separate functions that stem from their differences in class character. Perhaps this could be a case study to look into.",

I think that taking an incorrect line on the labor aristocracy and need for an international (and perhaps an incorrect line on PPW? I haven't studied enough to take a strong position on that debate) doesn't make a Third World or peripheral communist party revisionist by any means (Jose Maria Sison famously duked it out with MIM about the revolutionary potential of the white proletariat, and he's still one of the greatest Maoists to have ever lived leading one of the most successful PPWs ever).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gkd0o8/comment/lvmfcuj/\n\n>Didn't know that TIKKO fought aside US proxies in Syria, that is an unfortunate mistake to say the least. Still, I think that that's simply a rightist deviation rather than the chauvinistic revisionism of Amerikkkan \"communists\" going to fight over there.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1gkd0o8/comment/lvmg2ud/\n\nWhat makes you say these are simply mistakes rather than manifestations of revisionism, specifically within the context of \"Third World or peripheral\" parties? To be clear, I'm not trying to say you're wrong, since I don't really know enough about the topic to speak on it definitively. I just haven't gotten around to a deeper study of revisionism yet so I'm curious how you made these determinations, particularly considering that earlier in the thread you pointed out (correctly imo) that making it a matter of \"third world = more oppressed = less revisionism\" is overly simple. It's also possible that I'm misreading these comments, so apologies if that's the case.\n\nMore generally though, how does one determine whether an incorrect position is due to some kind of underlying revisionism or due to a (more easily fixable?) deviation by an otherwise genuinely Marxist party/individual?",
