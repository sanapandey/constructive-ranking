You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "Whenever AI comes up in \"leftist\" conversation spaces the conversation almost always revolves around how first world labor aristocrats and petty bourgeois individuals interests are threatened by big business. You might also see a conversation about how it uses a bunch of water in data centers. Though some trotskyites surrounding those formerly in the ISO insist LLMs are a tool for the liberation of American \"\"\"workers\"\"\". \n\nI don't really know too much about LLMs to know how realistic it is that mental labor will actually be automated by that particular technology. Though more interesting and what almost never gets discussed is how the training and moderation of LLMs is heavily dependent upon the exploitation of low waged workers in the third world to view and tag data[. Workers in Kenya get paid like a dollar an hour to look at pictures ](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/)depicting graphic violence, or read perverse internet fantasies all day so that petty bourgeois students can use Chat GPT to \"write\" bad essays and overpaid software engineers can use github copilot to do their job for them badly. \n\nThis isn't a new phenomena, tech companies have have [long relied on such work to moderate content](https://apnews.com/article/kenya-facebook-content-moderation-lawsuit-8215445b191fce9df4ebe35183d8b322) and facilitate the profits that allow them to overpay tech workers in places like the united states. Though it is interesting that whenever this comes up it is could AI be used to control workers in the future, and this is always in reference to whether AI could automate the work of college professors, software engineers, doctors, office workers etc at some point once it gets \"good enough\". AI already \"works\" right now because of the exploitation (not sure if this is the correct term?) of third world workers. The pay is somewhat more than those who are working in the informal sector (or even in the formal sector as well) Though still pays 10-50 times less than what it would in the US. \n\nI've heard of tools under development used to like review or supervise footage from like the border between the US and Mexico or like the walls built in the west bank by the ZE but I don't know enough about them to know if this a novel threat or a continuation of the same sort of already existing practices.",

There are several popular subreddits on this site dedicated to \"nostalgia\" for the forms of capitalism they participated in before the internet.\n\nI suppose the difference between the effects of the internet and AI specifically is that, unless you owned a stake in Sears, you had no reason to care that the local shopping mall was now dying because of the internet. Retail workers lost their jobs but few people fantasize about working retail and so there is no one to mourn it. AI on the other hand poses what seems to be an existential threat to the career paths that many young people who spend most of their time online care about. They fantasize about being successful writers or artists or performing some other kind of stimulating labor and making money off of it and yet AI is very rapidly making that fantasy seem untenable.\n\nSomeone else in this very thread even said \"It\u2019s only threat is making workers think they are replaceable\" but what it is actually doing is making the petty bourgeoisie realize that they *are* replaceable.",

                            "body": "Back in the day, the petty bourgeoisie treated the internet like it was the Promised Land. You can find any number of books from around the turn of the millennium about how the internet was supposed to usher in a new golden age of equality, free speech, and power to \"the people\" (i.e. the petty bourgeoisie). Of course it didn't do any of those things because they're just the ideological fig leaf for naked material interest, and what the internet did do was open up new markets for the petty bourgeoisie. \n\nThere's a whole ecosystem of petty producers out there who rely on the sale of commissioned art and fiction for their survival (or at least their beer money) and they're the ones whose bottom line has already been impacted by AI. Why pay someone $50 to draw a picture of you and your anime waifu on vacation when you can have DALL-E do it for free (or a small subscription fee)? It's also an ideological blow to the petty bourgeois fetishization of creative work. This might not be all that interesting, but it's relevant to the kind of petty bourgeoisie we encounter here on reddit.\n\nWhat's potentially more interesting is the use of AI for functions traditionally performed by human managers, because it affects the labor aristocracy more broadly. We all know about automated resume screening tools, but there are also companies offering automated performance review tools, and even products that are supposed to analyze potential new hires' social media to determine \"whether they're a good fit for the team.\" This is relatively new and underreported, although a liberal bourgeois book just came out about it (The Algorithm by Hilke Schellmann if anyone cares to read it).",

A petty bourgeois driven to frenzy by the horrors of capitalism is a social phenomenon which, like anarchism, is characteristic of all capitalist countries.
