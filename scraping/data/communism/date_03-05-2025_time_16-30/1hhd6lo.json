Unfortunately that is impossible, theit dependence on the internet to think for them is precisely why they made a good mark for the IMT in the first place, for whom \"communism\" is simply a social media brand (with a qr code and everything).\n\nOP I can't think for you but if I could, I would think that asking this question after months in an organization is a sign that you've wasted your time. It's nothing to be ashamed of but the truth is out, now it is your fault if you continue to throw good money in with bad. \n\nAs for your question, it is fundamentally flawed because you are confusing multiple levels of abstraction. That I have the weapon of Maoism doesn't mean I can now tell you \"go to this building on this date, ask for this drink and give this password when asked. Then you have a guaranteed revolution.\" Politics has its own relative autonomy as does every aspect of the social totality.\n\n Even telling you that would be a sign of a healthy organization instead of one stringing you along.",

A grift is a condition in which a party exists to perpetuate itself, not because of politics which are either identical to other groups or uninteresting, but because of the self-sustaining logic of its leaders. Whether a party is a grift or not is therefore not particularly important, the DSA serves a real political purpose but it is a reactionary one. The IMT is superfluous compared to the other ex-Trotskyist organizations which are not only all the same, they are all merely a less efficient DSA and therefore have no reason to exist except for the relative advancement a smaller, more controlled space allows. It's not productive to focus on the personal corruption of Kshama Sawant who uses an organization to have more leverage in the DSA than if she was just a member. Like, do you really care about Netanyahu's personal corruption or the Israeli genocide that enables it?\n\nThe reason I bring it up is because the IMT's recent rebranding really is a grift. It has no substance and leads to no restructuring, new politics, or wider historical importance. It is only notable as one of the first capitulations of an actually existing organization to the logic of social media rather than a social media grift taking the appearance of a party. Otherwise I don't think of the IMT at all. As I pointed out, the OP is not a victim, their engagement with communism as a brand is exactly matched by a \"communist\" organization based around algorithms. It is only now, in a state of exhaustion and frustration at basic questions like \"what is communism?\" that they are capable of more.\n\nWhat more do you want to discuss?",

            "body": "The short answer is that we don't know, and any prediction that we make now will necessarily be influenced by capitalism and the supporting ideology of liberalism. It's also not a particularly useful exercise, given that even somehow accurately predicting post-revolutionary conditions does nothing to advance our immediate revolutionary goals. Thus the practice of hypothesizing a future which is not yet in hand is itself a sort of bourgeois indulgence.\n\n\nWe know that capitalism is inherently unsustainable, and that it will inevitably succumb to its own contradictions. Socialism and communism are not, however, inevitable, and so a more prescient question would be: How do we ensure that it is socialism which emerges from the carcass of capitalism? This is something I'm still working out for myself, as well, but it seems clear that the frontline so to speak is the struggle against imperialism. Consequently, one's praxis will necessarily need to consider where they are situated relative to the mode of production on a global scale. This is more straightforward for those living in the periphery than those living in the imperial core, because the site of conflict is directly accessible to the former. For the latter, it is deliberately obsfucated by a complex network of bourgeois sleights of hand. We need to be more proactive about dispelling the ideology of liberalism for this reason, but we can still ground our action in organizing against imperialism. For this, I would specifically try to get involved in whatever national liberation movement(s) are active in your area.",

A weakness of many self-described \"communists\" is their inability to take this question seriously and answer it in a straightforward way.\n\nThe answer you are looking for is that there would be no barriers to basic social progress. Life will be oriented around what is best for everyone and the world-ecology's long-term health, using rational power made available by central planning. We can assume that most industrial capacity would be devoted to healthcare, and much of the rest gradually phased out as sustainable and equitable ways of life are developed.\n\nIn the very short term on a local level this would mean being able to do all the things that we can't do now in our frozen, backward society. For example, we can nationalize all the delivery services and take advantage of the communications revolution of the internet to make door-to-door delivery efficient. After all, delivery has a higher efficiency potential than individuals traveling in private cars to brick and mortar retail stores. This can't be done in the current capitalist environment because it involves ending huge amounts of profiteering in the process of distributing food and consumer goods.\n\nDepending on who you are talking to, it is easy to come up with a relevant example of an instant benefit from communism. If you are in a train station that has been gutted of chairs by the anti-homeless regime, and the person you're talking to is sitting on the floor, well, communism would allow us to put chairs in there, because under communism we provide everyone with actual places to sleep as a first priority, so we don't feel some perverse need to make waiting areas uncomfortable.\n\nThe catch here is that communism is highly democratic and you can't say that your own personal set of ideas are what WILL happen. It is important to emphasize that these are things that CAN happen via direct democracy and central planning whereas under the current system they can NEVER happen.",
