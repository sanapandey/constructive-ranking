You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They took advantage of their relatively small size and strong infrastructure and education system to become an attractive place for investment, particularly from Japan, which while still mired in its own economic issues was very very wealthy, and Korea was a very easy place for them to invest money.\n\nIt cited no source especially the claim that Thailand \"still has a fairly weak infrastructure\" or that Thailand specifically chose the \"sustainable and particularly agrarian path\" where controversies surrounding sugarcanes burning made it clear. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8f8ca1/comment/dy3gqg2/",

If you think pop-history is a problem because of the way grants work, askhistorians is only pop-history because it is up to random people and the upvote system to ask \"interesting\" questions. Further, at least peer review exists though it is laughable in fields with political pressure, there is not only no peer review on reddit but there is no guarantee the person answering your question knows anything at all or has any qualifications except the random preferences of some mod.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/5qgj42/comment/dcz9hsr/\n\n\nThe fact that people are responding to questions from random redditors (the ones with more upvotes being more likely to get answered) can't be determinant since r/communism101 is capable of taking garbage and producing knowledge from it through critique. Nor can the fact that we don't know the qualifications of the people responding, since we're all anonymous here too and our ideas stand for themselves. The main thing seems to be the formalistic moderation policy with the fa\u00e7ade of being unbiased and apolitical (which is what prevents the equivalent of peer review as your ban demonstrates), possibly coupled with the incentive of karma accumulation as social capital. But is this structure really comparable to academia?\n\n\nAlso, since your comments on that Korea thread were removed, we're unable to read them. Would you mind sharing what you wrote?",

You literally skipped the most important part: the formation of the People's Republic of Korea under the retreating Japanese and its explosive growth across the peninsula. This allows you to paint a picture of the US occupying forces facing disorganized and vengeful peasants, organized but authoritarian collaborators, and communist radicals (and begrudgingly choosing the collaborators) when in reality the Korean people were already organized in a democratic, multi-class and broadly nationalist governmental structure that included every major figure of the time.\n\n>Rather than the US finding a chaotic situation they specifically chose to ignore the PRK and reorganize yangban and capitalist collaborators and violently suppressed anyone who resisted. You mentioned jeju in one sentence but completely ignore the Autumn Uprising(s), the violent suppression of democracy by US troops and not right wing locals (which had nothing to do with the 'Soviet model' empowering peasants; could you be more racist?), and the empowerment of Syngman Rhee despite no popular support (including among the Americans) because every other figure with legitimacy saw how obvious it was that America was an occupying force destroying the legitimate government of unified Korea.\n\n>There are many smaller problems with the story you create but the whole thing rests on a lie. I don't know much about pre-modern Korea but if this is the standard of \"ask historians\" on subjects I do know this subreddit is buzzfeed but more pretentious.\n\n...\n\n>That person is not an expert, they are just a random person. I am between an MA and PhD in Korean history. My post history is irrelevant since I have no interest in posting on this forum, I only posted because the idea of some random person answering a good question so poorly personally offended me, particularly under the illusion of 'expertise.' For example, this person claims to be an expert in Bruce Cumings, but the main original research in Cumings is laying out a full ethnographic analysis of the Autumn Uprisings (built on by GI-wook Shin and Clark Sorensen's analysis of Red Peasant Unions). This is nowhere to be found in this person's answer so what exactly is he an expert on? Additionally, Cumings wrote his major work over 20 years ago. Since then there have been many works (Suzy Kim's Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution and Martin Hart-Landberg's Korea: Division, Reunification, and U.S. Foreign in English are some examples) of works which show this poster's bastardization of Cumings is simply nonsense. B.R. Meyer's is nothing, a journalist who writes pop-garbage. Being an expert on him is like being an expert on Kim Kardashian and calling yourself a media studies scholar.\n\n>Why would I be civil when this person with no expertise (and I don't care about academia, if he wasn't falsifying history I wouldn't call him out for this) has mod approval while I get chastised? Furthermore, what exactly is the point of mods who don't have the ability to judge truth from falsehood, you seem to be basically babysitters. Obviously not everyone can be an expert in everything but since in the OP there isn't a single qualified expert in anything related to Korea it seems the point here is just to be civil no matter what with mod approval to massage some egos. The level of questions is low enough that most can be answered with a little wikipedia surfing but modern Korean history is a bit too much for /u/koliano. Again. I have no interest in civility, I am interested in truth and falsehood, particularly when someone is regurgitating a version of history that would seem too right wing for \uc720\uc601\uc775. Korea is not a dictatorship anymore, they do not need fascist sycophants in English language scholarship.\n\n>How ridiculous that you would claim my understanding of North Korea is not rooted in scholarship. What right do you have to say this? Please link me to any research you have done on North Korean history, I have JSTOR access.\n\n>Thanks for making this forum pointless and driving away any real experts who are not interested in wikipedia Q and A.\n\nAs for why that place is bad, besides everything you said and the fact that it is basically wannabe academia (which is even worse than academia) is that you are not allowed to critique the premises of the question except in a crude empirical manner. This means that the initial racism of the question I linked can only lead to more racism to make *Shogun* blush. They do not even understand the concept of critique except a couple of sentences from Foucault they maybe encountered in a class. But the Marxist method, which is the only way to determine truth, is unknown to a community which is at the forefront of the vulgarization of academia into an extension of social media. I don't know if you heard about that woman whose PhD on the history of smell in literature went viral with Twitter fascists because the concept that smell could be racist is supposedly absurd. Actually her project sounds interesting if tedious in its focus on literature but, disappointingly, her defense was to stake a claim for academic work in the general sphere of knowledge production and respecting expertise. I don't envy being a target but the correct response would have been to say \"correct, the ideology of smell is one of racism, colonialism, and capitalism. Fascists are right to fear my research, the only error is their dishonest framing of these claims as too absurd to discuss.\" Rather than picking some identity politics nonsense, fascists accidentally found a pretty reasonable Marxist analysis of something well known. But academia is so weak it can only assert \"don't forget about me, I can contribute to bluesky too\"",

Meyers which is why I mentioned it, so there's some missing context.\n\nRegardless, the basic point is still correct: the faux-academic style of your posts and the refusal to actually \"unpack\" the original racist question makes the discussion useless. I'll pick a random example \n\n>For comparable reasons of national ideology, we American colonels can\u2019t exactly entrust the future of the Korean peninsula to a localized assortment of peasantry, not least because we are proceeding into an era in which the containment of Communism is of the utmost importance\n\nWhat is this weasel word nonsense? The \"national ideology\" of the US you're speaking of is fascism and racism. Who is this performance of neutrality for? \"Collegiately\" is extremely oppressive in academia but it is strictly enforced, albeit passive-aggressively, because it is ultimately a capitalist institution like any other workplace. To see people perform it for no stakes is just sad. Ultimately my offense is at the basic pretensions of that subreddit (with unfortunately does affect this one as it miseducates people in what learning actually is) and you were sort of in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know how you got the mod's approval to be part of that Q&A but I refuse on principle to prove myself to them through some song and dance. Look at that thread I linked.

Not that the revisionist idea of a blameless North ever held much water outside hagiographical DPRK propaganda\n\nIs just inexcusable. The DPRK is not your punching bag and you don't get to determine the appropriate amount of \"communism\" by throwing it under the bus for your liberal audience. Since that post I've finished my PhD and I still know very little about the DPRK's scholarship on the period, far too little to mock it in an online minstrel show.\n\nE: I didn't look at the recommended post until now about Japan\n\n>I would also argue that Japanese racial supremacy was more deeply rooted and \u201corganic\u201d than Germany\u2019s, owing partly to the fact that racism remains a problem in modern day Japan to a greater extent than in Germany.\n\nSo glad the mods have determined this is a \"quality\" answer.

From my introduction on that very panel: \"**/u/koliano is the furthest thing from a professional historian imaginable**, but he does have a particular enthusiasm for the structure and society of the DPRK, and is also happy to dive into the interwar period- especially the origins of the Korean War, as well as any general questions about the colonial era. He specifically requests questions about Bruce Cumings, B.R. Myers, and all relevant historiographical slapfights.\" In my opinion, AskHistorians is about making posts that specifically rely upon cited historiography, not solely expert testimony. I enjoy that. Yes, it certainly has a liberal slant, as does so very much of the anglosphere, but I think that there is still occasionally value in posting good information for people seeking it. I don't think you're too communist to post there, I think it is the aggression (which I respect, and think there is definitely a place for) that got you banned. Anyway, for my part, I would never claim to be anything more than an enthusiast. (I have read Suzy Kim, though! I even met her at a panel once.)\n\n3. On this quote: \"For comparable reasons of national ideology, we American colonels can\u2019t exactly entrust the future of the Korean peninsula to a localized assortment of peasantry, not least because we are proceeding into an era in which the containment of Communism is of the utmost importance\" To be very clear, I am locating these statements *in the mouths of the American occupiers*, I am trying to express to the reader that *because the overwhelming American purpose* was to *stop the formation of Communism*, they could not respect the autonomy of the Korean people in the same way that the Soviets did, because that would have inevitably resulted in a peninsula-wide communist DPRK. I'm just trying to explain the mechanism. I'm certainly not justifying it. \n4. Regarding this: \"Is just inexcusable. The DPRK is not your punching bag and you don't get to determine the appropriate amount of \"communism\" by throwing it under the bus for your liberal audience.\" I am not judging the DPRK for any purpose here, certainly not for lack of communist credentials. I am saying the idea , which has been advanced in some readings of the origins of the Korean War, that the North was purely invaded by the South with no intentions of kicking off the inevitable civil war to come, is ahistorical. But there's no moral dimension to that conclusion. Why wouldn't the North invade the South, or at least be building towards that outcome? It was a weak, evil puppet regime engaged in the mass slaughter of Koreans.\n\nAnyway, I don't really post on reddit much anymore to begin with. But occasionally I like hopping on and browsing random historical questions. I don't treat the answers on AskHistorians as gospel any more than I would any other internet post, they're simply jumping off points that require the inclusion of their sources so you can follow up on them if you're interested.\n\nYou are clearly a very well read individual. I think if you were able to gain access to places like AskHistorians your voice could be a strong one against many liberal bromides, but you would have to wear a veil of very liberal politeness, and I get why you wouldn't want to do that.\n\nI'm glad we were able to do this. Thank you for the engagement.",

The first half of the post is entirely \"meta\" concern with Federici as a person and what she's \"supposed\" to be doing with no concern for the truth \n\n>The OP of the earlier thread already hit the crucial point: Federici isn't a historian writing history: she's not critically analyzing primary source evidence and then-recent secondary scholarship in light of each other to draw new conclusions about how we can best understand the past wie es eigentlich war. She's a philosopher writing a philosophical critique of a philosophical system in which she happens to take her talking points from things that 19th and 20th century scholars said about the past. Detethered from being an explanation of history, there's a lot to be said for understanding and financially valuing reproductive labor as labor; there's a lot to be said for gendering Marxism in both its original form and in the sense of modern Marxist actual historical writing (it exists, and can be quite excellent). But that doesn't mean Federici has important insight about understanding the late Middle Ages, the early modern era, and especially witch panic. And her motivations shape that disjunction at every turn.\n\nFirst of all, who gives a shit? Second of all, the irony of both of your obsessions with academia and sources is if you wrote any of this in an academic book review, you would immediately be kicked out of academia. Not only because this patronizing, sexist attitude is alien to collegiality but Federici is an important scholar (who is both a historian and a philosopher, what an absurd, reactionary, and outdated argument - the pretentious use of a 200 year old latin quote from Ranke unproblematically is laughable) whereas you're both irrelevant in the academic hierarchy. As you can guess, obsession with politeness, academic rigor, and primary sources is entirely one sided, the post in question is simply a shittier review of certain secondary sources, no different from any other amateurish effort from r/badhistory.\n\n>She latched onto witch trials, I'm guessing based on their position in late 80s/90s historiography and popular culture as a hot topic of research, a hot topic of feminist research, a hot topic of feminist research starring \"nasty men being nasty\" (h/t my advisor), and a hot topic of materially minded (\"the body!\") feminist research. And she was not going to let go no matter what the actual evidence and current (ca early 90s, from here on out) research said.\n\nThis is honestly just sexist and gross. \n\n>Federici chooses these because they line up with the narrative she needs to tell to make her point. The most glaring omission in her historiography here is the lack of R.I. Moore's The Formation of a Persecuting Society, first published in 1987 and na enormously important book in medieval historiography (i.e. she knew about it). It's particularly bad because Moore tells a non-Marxist and not purposefully feminist version of a very similar narrative. He argues for the genesis of modern European society in oppression, not as \"capitalism\" grinding out the centuries by replicating \"feudal\" oppressive categories, but for cultural and political power as well as reifying \"class\" distinctions, but class being stereotyped through particular oppressed groups (lepers, prostitutes). In other words, when Federici published Caliban, medievalists were buzzing with the same basic phenomena expressed in different language. An explicitly feminist intervention in that narrative would have been amazing at the time, frankly still might be if you can get use Dyan Elliott's work as a jumping off point to be critiqued and nuanced instead of accepted full-heartedly. But I digress.\n\nBesides the irony of complaining about Federici's spelling errors while making your own, this is a rote use of academia-worship for anti-communist purposes. Whether Federici cites some book or not is irrelevant. What matters is the truth. Moore is not a Marxist, therefore he is wrong and does not belong in Federici's work. Again, reading this person advise a woman what they should be doing makes my skin crawl, and it's particularly remarkable that men are so arrogant they think a fucking nobody on the internet can talk like this to one of the most well-known scholars alive. The rest is just the same anti-Marxist drivel disguised as what \"the field\" was doing or what Federici \"should have\" known or done. I do not care about the field, I do not care about citation, and I do not care about academia. That you do, despite not being a part of it, is some kind of pathology. It is one I can't understand because most posters on that subreddit are failed academics and I can make fun of them on the terms of their own self-worth. One of the few side benefits of my job. \n\nAs for the \"factual\" debunking, it is not worth much effort in reply. The first claim that she overinflates the number killed is uncited and irrelevant (it appears to be from the first page of google since even wikipedia points out that there are scholarly estimates that are much higher), literally an argument ripped from Zionists about some minimum number required to be \"genocide\" (a term which only appears once near the end of the book and is used for a specific reason that is not acknowledged at all by this person). The second claim is a basic misunderstanding of Marxism and Federici's argument about social reproduction theory, presumably because that concept requires some knowledge of Marx's concept of abstract labor. Though it is extra funny that, for all this bleating about contemporary sources, the counter is Max Weber. Even if you accepted these arguments, this post in no way meets the standards of a book review or an academic critique. The argument of the book, the sources it does use, or the substance of the chapters are not engaged at all. Like, have any of you people actually read a published book review rather than a blogpost?\n\nWhy is this sexist, low quality screed the final word? Because it was written on reddit by someone who deigned to stoop to your level whereas Federici is an old woman and a scholar who doesn't have time for this nonsense. So again, the concern with academia is completely false, what you are really concerned with is feeling like you matter in a little reddit ecosystem and weaponizing academia to do so, which is only possible because the irrelevance of that ecosystem is beneath the attention of professional academics. It's sad and these are just examples from the last week (and some of the few that get any feedback at all). That's the substance, there is nothing behind the curtain. If I called any of this out I would immediately be banned (again).\n\ne: I have to add that the post by u/AusHaching equating Federici's work to Heinrich Himmler is somehow even more offensive and disgusting. I honestly think r/badhistory is better since at least they know they are frauds (a subreddit I only know about because there is a similar amateurish effort there to \"debunk\" Grover Furr's work which is now the final word forever on the subject).",

First due to the reason even what is more generally cited is confined to english, as works in other languages are not as well considered as those or of european languages or mandarin. Secondly because no one can determine if the citations are actually due to the actual content or due to internal biases that detach from truth. This is a fundamental flaw of western academia (which is now also, since the 90s, a lot prevalent in the third-world, as in china and latin-america) that was inflated in the web\n\nThe reason of this whole side of problems along others are those that that prevents me to not being very skeptical of academia reason to exist (or the university model) outside the first-world. Self-learned individuals with general sharper fundamental graspings of philosophy and history than many BAs and than some PhDs in some topics is what made possible many of the early left and later marxist forces, from the early 20th century to the 70s and to now (many of the current mlm parties and \"orgs\" as a good example) to exist in many countries and works to be written. Wikipedia, Reddit and Discord are places where people with no actual capacity other than encyclopaedical mass-reading of works they do not even properly grasp deep enough and cannot think independently into their theoretical underpinnings impose their views and censorship by politeness, control of who can use the discursive violence, memes, fascistic cultural humour, or which kinds of currents can take prevalence, which allows any discord intellectual wannabe of marxian tones to joke of those who defend stalin or cambodia. I see Smoke being a victim of this, even if he is an expert and has the credentials.\n\nIn this sense, i think latin-american academia, with all its petty-bourgeois flaws and left petty-bourgeois marxist revisionism and blatant social-fascism, still shows a little bit less worse of a model: not allowing external spaces from academia to try to talk for it in public discussion of politics in very polemic topics or for very specific topics by \"throwing sources\" or showing generic and vague credentials, but by referencing who they are and the level of the work they do and how is that considered by others, because only relying on citation numbers are more than useless and peer-reviewing has major flaws. this makes wikipedia pt as an example as a joke and not taken seriously as much as it could be (although it is a mess), and reddit and discord to not have enough participation of left \"orgs\" (which although being shitty, are not just dooming us altogether by emulating the west, and do not place these already fucked up orgs to attacks of \"servers\" of \"anarchists\", \"communists|\", or whatever, who far more heavily emulate western \"revolutionaries\" and are actually, far more than usual,  fascists). It hurts the moment where actual consistent marxist works and marxist parties appear where there are none, but there will be people who know of the topics better than them and truth can be confronted at the web and at the streets and unions or any place. Truth is still there. Academia in brazil for example completely failed to prevent rightist ideologues from talking to a pissed off petty-bourgeoisie and to a proletariat that was pissed off against the petty-bourgeoisie.\n\n\"I am saying the idea , which has been advanced in some readings of the origins of the Korean War, that the North was purely invaded by the South with no intentions of kicking off the inevitable civil war to come, is ahistorical. But there's no moral dimension to that conclusion. Why wouldn't the North invade the South, or at least be building towards that outcome? It was a weak, evil puppet regime engaged in the mass slaughter of Koreans.\"\n\nAnd why does this matters in terms of reddit? the main point of contention where it really matter (public mainstream discourse) about the korean war, globally, is that far-right fascists attempt to frame north korea as having attempted an aggression to reinforce harshly the propaganda of north korea being a genocidal regime that wished to remove liberal freedom and which wished to impoverish the population and enrich itself.",

Anyone who tries is pushed out long before they make it to the level of publication (and if by some miracle you made it that far, peer review would squash any attempt at Marxism). Why one would choose to reproduce this oppressive institution on the internet in one's free time is beyond me, or it would be except nearly all the mods of r/askhistorians are failed academics who use their position to generate alternative careers for themselves or are trying to use it as leverage to stay competitive on the periphery of the job market.

Case in point, [Craig Johnson](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ioltxr/ama_craig_johnson_researcher_of_the_rightwing/) (another one of those self-proclaimed academic historian experts on all things related to Fascism and Marxism) had a Q&A session on r/AskHistorians a good week ago regarding his podcast and a book he's writing about preventing your child from becoming a fascist (which he blames as the result of teaching bad lessons in masculinity, bad young childhood media programming, and not enough socialization). Because no one mentioned Dimitrov, the questions and Johnson's answers were about as boring as they went (yes fascists prey on the insecurities of men during crisis, yes you should talk to your dad about QAnon, yes you should still join an org-what org i don't know but it's the only way) A quote from Johnson:\n\n>If you think there's room to budge them \\[your parents\\], start from a place of empathy. What appeals to them about Trump/fascism? Is it the revenge fantasy? Is it racism or sexism? Is it the (very real) understanding that politics as it is normally practiced in the US will almost certainly only exploit them? Is it simply a desire for change?\n\n>Whatever it is, start from there. Don't condescend, or yell, or debate. Talk. This is why I wrote the book for caretakers of young people, because I thought they were the only people I could justifiably ask to be empathetic to people spouting fascism.\n\nJohnson then got 19 responses for this section of his top-rated answer alone, all of which were deleted by the moderators in mass. *What were they? What did they say in response to Johnson? We will* ***never*** *know.*",
