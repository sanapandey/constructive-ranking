You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a selection of interviews and essays. It opens with Foucault debating with some Maoists. They expose pretty succinctly the problems with Foucault's thought, and Foucault is somewhat able to articulate its uses. It's also good to dip in and out of. I don't really consider him an author you need to read cover to cover to get the gist.",

Of those who have read, they are unable to articulate anything actually interesting in the text, merely indicate that something is supposed to be interesting because it is important or long. \n\nTexts are not in themselves interesting. You have to make them interesting. Talking about reading is sort of like talking about doing the dishes. It's obvious you're stalling because it's easier to not read than to take responsibility for reading and forming opinions which are subject to critique. And while people have limited time, I think we can drop the American faux-populism when we're using our time to post on reddit. \n\n>Currently reading Capitalist Realism\n\nWhat does Mark Fischer get from Foucault that is interesting? If you weren't able to find that, increasing the volume of readings will get you no closer.",

History of Madness is also a good work to understand the origins of mental institutions. It's even possible to see how mental institutions served the purpose of behaviour normalization from the start, often removing from people their free agency over economic or moral concerns (families forcibly commiting their members over wanting to marry someone else, or presenting divergent social and sexual behaviours, etc.). I tried reading The Order of Things (Les Mots et les Choses), but that was a difficult one, I barely understood anything. Just the general \"there are different epistemes and they change over time\" and so on. There are also his very last lectures that have been published as books, about ancient philosophy. \"The Government of Self and Others I\", about the concept of parresia, or \"frank speech\", as a dangerous form of speech that \"talks truth to power\" even if that means risking death. \"The Government of Self and Others II: The Courage of Truth\", a great study about the school of the cynic philosophers. And finally, \"The Hermeneutics of the Subject\", drawing a lot from stoic philosophy like Seneca.",
