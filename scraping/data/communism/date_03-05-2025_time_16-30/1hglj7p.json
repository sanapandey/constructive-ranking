    "selftext": "This was originally going to be a post immediately reflecting on the collapse of a chapter of an organization I was in last year, but I never got around to posting it. I felt like it would be a good a time as any to post it now given I've had time to let these reflections mature, and that the topic has come up in a few recent threads lately but has never really been given the chance to be discussed at length or beyond superficial observations.\n\nHopefully this sparks discussion, and any questions about specifics I'll do my best to answer.\n\n\\----------------------\n\n**General Lessons**\n\nI began to try engaging in deeper discussions within my org and putting forth a more Marxist basis. Seeing as it collapsed, I obviously failed at that goal but in that failure some lessons can be drawn along with some problems to consider.\n\n* Actually engaging in open criticism is a perniciously difficult thing to do for most petty bourgeois college/graduate youth. Given this is the social composition of most Socialist orgs on Occupied Turtle Island, this is one of the primary hurdles to overcome. Some may find it comes easier than others and I unfortunately found (and still sometimes find) myself in the latter camp. For those like me, there is no immediate answer other than to simply practice your ability to spontaneously defend Marxism and give principled criticism. In lieu of a true Communist party to provide a consistent demonstration of what that looks like, you will unfortunately have to figure that out by yourself. Certainly look to those around you for inspiration but this is likely not something that is directly taught/practiced by the existing parties or orgs, especially if they are organizationally immature.\n* The overall feeling of isolation was rather demoralizing at times. This was exacerbated by the lack of structure within the org, but even with a better functioning structure, combatting pragmatism is a tedious, protracted struggle. Maintaining a firm position in general became only more difficult with a lack of political maturity, as doubt haunted me constantly and I would sometimes question if I even grasped basic understandings. This further damped my ability to criticize. What this revealed to me was that studying Marxism was only half of the equation, the missing half was to be able to actually apply it. This was the lesson I took, as I felt I had a good enough grasp of Marxism to participate in this sub (even though many of my comments had been short jabs at liberals who wander in - that itself masking over my own shortcomings), but when applying my grasp of Marxism to in-person organizing, those shortcomings became impossible to ignore.\n* The aforementioned issue of isolation had its specifics to my org and my own behavior but in general, it's something that's simply a feature of upholding the revolutionary line. In my specific case, trying to uphold it (or whatever warped/wrong version of it) as a singular person is where many of the problems lied, and I should have attempted to unite with just even a single other person who was more sympathetic to theoretical struggle. This would have immediately solved the feeling of social isolation and also of intellectual isolation. While this subreddit is a good place of reprieve, it is not a substitute for cadre, as it's impossible to discuss the specifics of your situation without having someone closely informed on it too. Completely doxing yourself to strangers online wouldn't even be able to substitute that. \n* Geographical isolation/separation or just geography in general is one of the less commonly discussed topics I've seen anti-revisionist Marxists in the u.$. discuss. For my org specifically, a consistent problem was the physical distance between members. Distinguishing whether this is a subjective or objective problem was difficult. Perhaps if participating in the org was a more motivating experience, the distances we were travelling would be more trivial, but figuring out at what point distance becomes an objective problem is not obvious. I've never come across any analysis of suburban sprawl on organizational practices, though I wouldn't expect that to be something ready-made or particularly pressing for Marxists right now.\n\n**Truly Understanding Democratic Centralism**\n\nAs evidenced by some of the struggles outlined above, it is clear democratic centralism was nowhere to be found. And it's not that members weren't aware of its existence as a concept, one of the core educational texts for the org was ARAK after all. What I came to understand was the gaping hole that existed at the bottom of our politics (or lack thereof), in which all the social habits of the imperial core petty bourgeois sought to fill.\n\n*Hell is empty and all the devils are here*\n\nI'm being slightly dramatic for my own amusement but the significance of this realization, the significance of politics in command, of having concrete, definite principles that are in accordance with, and can navigate, the contours of the political landscape they act in, can't be overstated. Going outside the melodrama, the seriousness of what *can* and *has* happened when politics takes a backseat is evident in many instances. A clear one is the persistent phenomenon of SA incidents and their poor handling by a swath of organizations of the Left. In the case of my chapter, we were fortunate the worst that happened was some sour feelings and burnt bridges. Another chapter wasn't so lucky, and like all cases of SA in Left orgs, national swept it under the rug at first and then gave a messy attempt to solve the problem. Again, with politics not at the forefront, being consistently and openly struggled over, anything will fill that gap and even worse, present the fa\u00e7ade of \"politics\" with everyone none the wiser.\n\nGiven this, democratic centralism will begin, or already be, broken down. It was specifically this quote on Democratic Centralism from Lenin that grounded this realization:\n\n>Criticism **within** the limits of the ***principles*** of the **Party Programme** must be quite free (we remind the reader of what Plekhanov said on this subject at the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.), not only at Party meetings, but also at public meetings. Such criticism, or such \u201cagitation\u201d (for criticism is inseparable from agitation) cannot be prohibited. **(emphasis mine)**\n\nObviously, arguing against the basic principles of one's organization violates the unity of it, *but* having principles on which to ground those limits is also essential. In our case the issue was twofold.\n\n*The limits of putting politics back in command*\n\nGiven a situation where politics has taken a backseat to other things, economism, friendships, leadership positions, there are certain limits to placing it back in command within an organization. First, if there is no broad support, it's more likely in trying to criticize the overall lack of politics in an org, you'll probably just be expelled if you're confident and persistent, or ground into passivity if you lack that (as was the case for me). Second, if there is a chance that this could happen, actually understanding *what* politics need to be put in command is the bigger question. Certainly Marxism, but a dogmatic adherence to it only gives the illusion of solving the problem and reality itself remains unaddressed. \n\nThen there is probably the more fundamental question which I've overlooked until now, which is the basic outlook on party formation vs various \"orgs.\" As of right now, there is no other choice for Marxists on Turtle Island but to form a party as the immediate task to orient *organizational* activity around. The existential question that I kept raising to myself and the org I was in was the total absence of a party. To dip into specifics, I was in AnakbayanUSA and one of the main existential issues with the existence of an Anakbayan formation here, is that there is no party to draw the mass org into higher levels of struggle. Not to mention the basic necessity for its existence was absent for most chapters, given Filipine communities tend to be scattered outside of places like San Francisco. Students being a key source of revolutionary cadre and activists is something particular to the class structure of the Philippines as a semi-colony. That is nothing like what exists here in the u.$. as academia is the stomping grounds for the compradors of the oppressed nations here to either abandon, sell out, or confuse the struggle. Perhaps in San Francisco, or places with sizeable communities of Filipine people, would have a better basis to conduct struggle but even then, where will it go? Economism will continue to be endemic as that is the horizon of what a singular mass org can fight for in its own terms.\n\nThe solution I've found is to truly stick to the advice on this subreddit of not *joining* an organization. And to elaborate with my own insights, it's specifically, *joining,* i.e. becoming a member, that should be avoided. Participation, in whatever form that can take that doesn't involve commitment dictated on the organizations terms, is still necessary. Unfortunately this leaves one vulnerable to a lack of discipline but I think that is a temporary sacrifice worth the benefit of not being sucked into an organization whose basic activities are a complete waste of time. Discipline can be built better elsewhere anyways. The essential point is participation and study as an initial phase and in the process you'll hopefully find at least one other sympathetic anti-revisionist and you can unite and struggle with them. From there, you can begin to build a cadre circle using the contacts you should be accumulating from *participating* in events, public meetings, open discussions, protests, film screenings, etc. After expanding the cadre circle to a few more people, only then can the question of joining organizations really be a practical activity.\n\n**The Chicken or the Egg - Practice or Theory?**\n\nReturning to my organizational experience, one of the main struggles within the organization was between engaging in practical activities, or internal development. Going off the analogy, which comes first? Practice or theory? This was the accepted, though unspoken, framing within the org, even by me at the time. Squaring the two off like this shows how the framing was erroneous from the start. What this was ultimately about in the org, was *which* practice, and the theoretical struggle was between liberal pragmatism and an immature (not fully formed and containing deeper, unperceived roots of liberalism - on my part) grasp of Marxism. This \"theory versus practice\" struggle is an echo from the New Left era, [though with it's own articulations](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19780401.htm), the essence was the same in its struggle against pragmatism. The point remains that the struggle against pragmatism is ongoing and truly understanding its nature today is crucial.\n\n**On Burnout**\n\nThe inevitable result of what was explained above is ultimately in the vague realm of \"burnout.\" However, the real question should be about what exactly \"burnout\" is. To approach that question, starting from one of the attempts at mitigating this, \"burnout\" is where I think a possible clue lies.\n\n*The Specter of \"Capacity\"*\n\nOne of the common words that was thrown around in the organization, and many other orgs on the Left here, is \"capacity.\" Just like burnout, it too was never clearly defined or examined. Now, there are objective limits in regards to organizing, geography was mentioned above as one, and others can be uncovered through the course of struggles. However, the way capacity was used carried a more subjective character and was usually based on people's judgement of their own responsibilities vs the organization's and that perception was further muddied by the confused politics of the org.\n\nOn the one hand, this judgement usually carried a petit-bourgeois character, favoring personal responsibilities. Yet on the other, the responsibilities of the org were increasingly directionless and produced a general demoralizing confusion, which makes the turn to more pressing responsibilities in one's personal life, regardless of class character, understandable. The only times the org experienced productivity was in conjunction with major political events, which injected some sense of politics to work around, despite its fleeting nature. When that eventually deflated, people's (me included) commitment waned and the absence of principles haunted in the form of \"capacity.\"\n\nThis perhaps may reveal a general insight into \"burnout\" as a phenomenon that occurs when an organization's principles and actions do not align with the forces of reality. Trying to fight against the current in of the sea of totality, either because those currents are not understood, or entirely rejected will inevitably result in overall exhaustion (a commonly described symptom of burnout). Additionally, in observing those currents, understanding what must be sacrificed in order to navigate them and take the correct course is necessary too. However, doing the latter without first doing the former is rather dangerous, and the Red Guards was evidence of that.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, I hope this reflection resonates with others, my thoughts are somewhat scattered and re-reading this a few times I can see where some of my previous conclusions clash with my current ones. But perfection is the enemy of progress and criticism would be more productive than rumination at this point.",

Potentially this is fine, since demographically speaking people in cities are far more likely to be working class, non-white, immersed in political struggles over housing, etc. Unfortunately, the inverse is that universities are also mostly found in cities, and in the wake of decades of deindustrialization and urban decay it is this tendency which tends to take over, meaning orgs are overwhelmingly young students. One can see this, for example, in the centrality of LA/NY to Marxist parties today and the withering away of former centers like Oakland and Detroit. This also has to do with the lack of public transport even in cities (including LA) making the separation between universities and the city de-facto suburbanized (for example the isolation of protests at Columbia University from the rest of the city which helped lead to defeat), with the university sub-region dominant. \n\nAs you point out, this could be overcome if you were asking people to drive in traffic to do something meaningful. Instead it just becomes another form of hierarchy and warped centralism favoring the petty-bourgeoisie (with geographical centrality and the free time and money to regularly commute to meetings, events, protests, etc.) hidden behind the idea that you should suffer more to prove you want it more. \n\nThe only real solution is for the party to have branches everywhere. But that's easier said than done and cities are always going to be centers of politics, even if we are talking about satellite cities (trying to reprioritize cities like Long Beach or Baltimore as working class alternatives to LA and DC). But yes, I agree with you that a lack of fundamental principles in an org manifests concretely in feelings like this: I'm commuting too long to waste my time; I'm not friends with everyone because they all go to the same university; I'm spending too much money relative to the results, etc. and at this level it's easy to either remain at this understanding and simply disappear from politics or, if you're more committed, blame yourself for your own weakness. Feelings are not wrong, anxiety is the body trying to express what the mind cannot. It is up to you to build on those feelings and come to a theoretical understanding of their cause and possible resolution (in objective reality, not subjective consciousness).",

I remember one of the meetings being in a suburb an hour away and having already been close to the area the night before, I just decided it would be easier to park somewhere nearby and sleep in my car to go to it, just so I didn't have to waste gas by going back home and making a long commute the next morning. It was pretty silly of me to do in retrospect, but it was that experience which made me want to think about geographical layout as something to really think about.\n\n>The only real solution is for the party to have branches everywhere.

Even the worst organizations are still black holes of emotional energy and, even if the political line of an org consists of doing nothing but handing out cupcakes at church, the ostensible issues they use to lure members are very real: genocide in Gaza, climate change destroying life on earth, violent repression of people of color and queer/trans people, and all the horrors of capitalism and imperialism. The contrast between the seriousness of these issues and the weakness of the communist movement should cause you to feel despair, that is a normal response. Shitty organizations do not have the right to blame members for having feelings when those same feelings were used to recruit them in the first place.",

Within these constraints, though, I've found it difficult to criticize the org's revisionist line, despite my total confidence that it's false, or bring up topics that I sense would be \"controversial\" to it (the Peruvian revolution and Gonzalo's contributions within it is an example, which is probably also a reflection of my general lack of investigation on the subject and my uncertainty as regards to the proper line regarding Gonzalo's contributions to Maoism); it's definitely largely a manifestation of a latent petty-bourgeois tendency of fearing to rock the boat/intensify contradictions, or to somehow \"offend\" the people around me, and something that needs to be struggled against and rectified.

I think being serious about Marxism and the politics is huge. And I\u2019m gonna save that lingo \u201cideological poverty\u201d because it sums it up really well. Appreciate the discussion comrade.",

The group I'm in (CPUSA), while located in a capital city, has a few members in satellite cities 30+ miles out who usually attend meetings online.\n\nEither way, great write up. As someone fairly new to a group and communism in general, I find myself noticing some of the frustrations you listed here. Lack of politics, spending scarce time and resources on actions that go nowhere and don't even draw new members, etc. The individual members in my group all seem to be in their own worlds and there's somewhat little direction or discipline, especially with regards to time management. Like how can you expect to contribute to the struggle when you can't even nail down a time for a casual discussion group?",
