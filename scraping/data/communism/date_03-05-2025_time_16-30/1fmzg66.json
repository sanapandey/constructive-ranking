    "selftext": "The results of the 2024 Sri Lankan elections have been declared. For the first time in history, the Sri Lankan communists have been able to secure a whooping 56% votes (5,740,179 votes) and are now able to form a leftist government in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Jathika Vimukti Peramuna was found in 1956, with a strong affiliation for Maoism. They created cells throughout the country, educating the working class on Marxist theories before launching an insurrection in 1971, and then again in 1987. Though both of them failed in the long run, they managed to create significant ideological impact.\n\nIn 1987, the party faced an ideological change where they broke away from Mao Zedong Thought and instead gained allegiance from the Soviet Union. They decided to participate in electoral processes which gained them a more positive attention from the general public.\n\nJVP went through a series of successive state repressions, to the point of being almost completely wiped out. It was eventually resurrected by Amerasinghe in 1999. From that point on the JVP slowly built up its base again, while facing sudden internal strife between social democratic thoughts and hardcore socialist outlook.\n\nThe party remained active throughout the economic crisis of Sri Lanka, and its activities has eventually born fruit.\n\nThe new president of Sri Lanka is Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the leader of JVP.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this historical win of communists in Sri Lanka, and how do you think will this affect the power balance in South Asia ?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia4ckysoieqd1.jpg?width=597&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f5d00a12c178cbf271340cec183b825890f0bd9\n\n",

The CPI(Marxist), from what I know, has not become a social-democratic wannabe simply because it does not follow Maoist ideologies and instead seek reform from within. They have done some groundbreaking work in India, unthinkable at that time.\n\nThe CPI(Marxist) ruled Kerala is still one of the best states India has to offer, and it was certainly nothing like that when India gained her independence in 1947 until the CPI(Marxist) under EMS Namboodiripad started the reforms. They became so popular that the moment Kerala had its first independent election, the first CPI(Marxist) government was elected to power.\n\nParticipation in bourgeoisie election is not blasphemy. This hardline leftist thought is what alienated Lenin from his fellow comrades, and it turned out that Lenin was right all along. \n\n\"Participation in parliamentary elections and in the struggle on the platform of parliament is obligatory for the party of the revolutionary proletariat\u2026As long as you are unable to disperse the bourgeois parliament and every other type of reactionary institution, you must work inside them, precisely because there you will still find workers who are stupefied by the priests and by the dreariness of rural life; otherwise you risk becoming mere babblers.\"\n\n- Lenin,\u00a0*Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder*\u00a0(New York: International Publishers, 1989), pp. 40\u201442.",

Years under experiences of \u201cparliamentarism\u201d all over the world with no achievements should tell you that with incoherent concrete analysis and party line, electoralism is just a symptom. Elections are a major issue of concern for communists during certain periods/places, and the CPI(Maoist) solution was to call for a boycott, or to burn ballots as the Peruvian communists did; the goal is not to get more seats, and aiming for legal recognition from a semi-feudal fascist state like India is rightist capitulation.\n\nIs there a fundamental modern difference between the CPI(Marxist) use of parliament than JVP, other than the fact that the latter won? You can argue that CPI(M) is not social-democracy but instead \u201crevisionist,\u201d but that\u2019s trivial and the emphasis of the comment was on the left desperation that grasps at electoral victories of social-democratic, or \u201cMarxist\u201d, parties with less than 50% of the votes.

Quoting Tamil political leaders in praise of the JVP tells you absolutely nothing about what Tamils think because the Sinhalese state destroyed the organization that actually represented them.\n\nIt\u2019d be like if Israel crushed Hamas and dismantled the group politically and militarily (not saying they\u2019re like the LTTE ideologically) and then held an election in Palestine, or if the British during The Troubles destroyed Sinn Fein and the IRA and then held an election in Northern Ireland. Of course opportunist political leaders would arise out of such a fragmented political community who would accommodate themselves to the existing state of affairs, but we would all say that the results of such elections would be illegitimate and not to be celebrated.",

They all have their own critiques of the LTTE but are united in their support for the project of independence and reject the legitimacy of the Sri Lankan state that now militarily occupies their land - which the JVP enthusiastically supports.",

The result is piecemeal reform via social fascists who will satiate some minor economic demands of the proletariat and peasantry while giving further economic concessions to the petite bourgeoisie to preserve their class rule against mass rebellion the way it occurred in Bangladesh, in Sri Lanka and is continuously manifesting in India. In Pakistan, this stream was gaining momentum under the Imran Khan brand. The BJP has gone so far in this crisis that it is calling for land to the tiller in some states! These developments are part and parcel of the comprador bureaucratic bourgeoisie and big landlords trying to cope with the evolving discontent. The question that will once again become criticial for revolutionaries is one of taking the economic demands beyond the economic needs to political ones in the conditions of mass rebellion.",
