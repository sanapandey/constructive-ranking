You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So a festival from the Palestinian Prison Solidarity Network was hosted in Brazil, but you can't really say that the current struggle of the Brazilian peasantry waged by the LCP has any immediate material impact on the national-liberation struggle in Palestine led by the Axis of Resistance, they can't money, guns, supplies, refuge, etc. and they aren't powerful enough to apply leverage to the Brazilian government enough to make that difference.\n\nI'm not saying that their struggles are totally isolated, all struggles against imperialism are ultimately connected, but it seems like a meaningless declaration to say that their struggles have merged. Whatever, I might nitpicking.",

Although that might be one result of political unity. The anti-imperialist struggle of Palestine and in Brazil shares many poltical objectives.\n\nI would also read the title more carefully. It does not say that the struggle has merged. That would be the agrarian revolution in Brazil and the national liberation war of Palestine.\n\nIt says that the peasants merge the struggle. That is the struggle that they carry out. That is, in the political goals and in context of the title, the consiousness of these.\n\nI would read more up on the development in Brazil the last year and particularly the last few months. The cause of the Palestinian is just not another case of a flag being waved in solidarity. It plays a particular role in the consciousness of struggling peasants in some very decisive moments. The development of the solidarity with the Palestinian Resistance plays a role that has very important results.\n\nI talk about more then just inspiration or \"everything is connected\". It is politics. It is in the context of a revolutionary movement that has a very advanced understanding of the oppressed nations struggle for liberation as part of the proletarian world revolution.\n\nIt is this decisive place it has in the consiousness of people in this struggle that this title says the peasants merge the struggle.",

Inb4 \"a victory for the proletariat and peasantry anywhere is a victory for the Palestinian resistance\" I'm talking acts like coordinated, mass-supported attacks on Israeli embassies, weapons manufacturers, etc., the kinds of things that the Palestinian resistance is oftentimes in direct coordination with (thinking here about the Blekingegade Gang, the RAF, etc). So I think that saying that an ideological, consciousness-raising, or propaganda-focused act on the part of the LCP isn't a \"merger\" just because there's no direct coordination with the Palestinian resistance is misunderstanding what it means to merge the struggles of two people. \n\nThough, I haven't read Lenin on the merger (u/Bubbly-Ad-2838, would you mind linking where he talks about it?) so I could be wrong here.",
