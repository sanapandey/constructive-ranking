What\u2019s you take on the subject? I tried doing some research but everything I found was quite biased, any suggestions on where to learn more about him other than the terrible dictator rhetoric found everywhere?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Not only must they defend \u2018their\u2019 resources from imperialism, but also they must defend their privileged position from \u2018their\u2019 workers who must bear the ever increasing economic demands of the west. Regardless of how wealthy Libya (or Venezuela) are, they cannot compete with the massed economic and military forces of western imperialism. It\u2019s just harsh mathematics. Gaddafi and Maduro both know this and were compelled to strike a balance between accommodating the west and social reforms. They are hostile to both the west and their working classes. Meaning their working classed are deliberately disarmed and isolated from the international proletariat, who are also deliberately disarmed by their local nationalist pseudo left parties and union bureaucracies. Unable to resist the west, instead the the burden falls on their working classes in the form of falling living standards, state repression, etc.\n\n\n\nThere is no way forward for these national reformist movements, not in the current epoch, were all problems are global problems. By extension, it falls to the international working class to do away with capitalism.\n\n\n\nThere are two articles I\u2019ll share; \n\nCogan (https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2011/05/gadd-m02.html) on the assassination of Gaddafi; Lobo\u2019s (https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/07/30/ejfc-j30.html) a great article about Maduro after the recent election.",

Without them capitalist imperial hegemony will never break. \n\n\"The international working class\" is not working very well at the moment, if at all, to do away with capitalism. It is not a real power at all. Creating more socialist countries is the way to establish a strong international working class with actual power. \n\nIMO next goal for the International working class, should be to establish a world order where nations are free to build socialism and communism, in their countries. This is in reach *only* because sovereign countries like China and Russia, and the idea of a multi polar order.\n\nInternationalism is not opposite to nations, but in fact based on nations. International socialism needs socialist countries.",

The entire history of the USSR and China shows that.\n\nAlso, none of the countries mentioned above are socialist.",
