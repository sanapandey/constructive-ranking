You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "The Soviet Union signed mutual assistance treaties with the governments of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in in the Autumn of 1939, shortly after the outbreak of WW2, which allowed them to establish military bases in their territories. They used the treaties as an opportunity, around the time of the fall of France, to organise local Soviets and communist parties and lead them towards establishing their own governments through revolutions that were mostly bloodless because of the presence of the Red Army which prevented the bourgeoisie from cracking down on them. The People's Assemblies that were established by communist front-groups with the backing of trade-unions in all three of the Baltic States then voted to become Soviet Republics.\n\nWhy did the Soviet Union \"occupy\" them? Because the Baltic states were a liability to the defense of the Soviet Union, especially as they were essentially German client-states when they first seceded from Russia and became proto-fascist dictatorships during the interwar period. Germany gave them up as a (temporary) concession to the Soviets after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact so that they could secure their eastern flank while fighting France. France fell much quicker than anyone could predict which gave the Soviet Union urgency; the mutual assistance treaties with these dubious governments weren't enough, they needed to consolidate their western frontier and establish socialist governments that would be aligned against the Nazis in an inevitable war, rectifying all of treaties signed during the Russian Civil War. The USSR didn't have time for Inbetweeners like Poland, the Baltic States and Finland, Finland didn't succumb to revolution like the Baltics and became a Nazi ally that almost doomed Leningrad.\n\n\nE: Also, with regards to the elections supposedly being falsified, you must understand that every election held in socialist countries will look \"falsified\" from the perspective of liberals because they can't comprehend that the bourgeoisie must be excluded from these processes in order to attain true democracy. The elections in all the Baltic states were obviously opposed by their local bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie who wished that it was the communists that were excluded instead.",
