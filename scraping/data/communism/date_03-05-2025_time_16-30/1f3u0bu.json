I had a talk about creating another Comintern as a union of all progressive, anti-revisionist communist orgs instead of just creating the 73859th org, but isn\u2019t doing this just doing the 7399583728824th international?\n",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However I would challenge the premise upon which you built your conception of the first option. Why should an anti-revisionist, revolutionary communist organization (and hopefully eventually a party) be limited to three people, and who said it would \"get nothing done\" (assuming of course we are always talking about getting things done in the explicit and sole direction of achieving communist revolution)? If by \"changing first world commie parties/orgs for the better\" you mean changing the political landscape for communism as a force in the first world then I don't see what your task can be besides working towards creating and establishing an anti-revisionist, revolutionary communist party, which currently doesn't exist in any first world country. However if you mean how you can change *existing* parties/orgs \"for the better\" then you've already lost the game because you've accepted entryism as the horizon of your practice, despite your seeming denunciation of it at the beginning of your post.",

To you, they're just these uncontrollable things that fall down from heaven. It's unsurprising that the only options you see involve \"getting nothing done,\" because that's the current limit of your personal praxis from your current lack of Marxist comprehension of the world.",

My claim wasn't that the Petite Bourgeoisie is joining \"Communist\" Parties but that those \"Communist\" Parties don't organize Primarily among the Proletariat(of course some organizing can be done among the Petite Bourgeoisie but it is secondary and Subordinated to the Party and should not take over party work). These \"Communist\" Parties also have a Petite Bourgeois class character rather than a Proletarian one actual Communist parties should be.",

These are the largest protest since the -massive- protests against the invasion of Iraq. It is not that workers do not want to see peace or act in solidarity with someone from another country, it's clear that they do. Workers are always blamed for these failures, but the real blame lies with the upper middle class leadership of these movements, are are incredibly hostile to workers organizations (peace movn't, trade unions) and would much rather make a deal with imperialism than to the hard work of revolution to actually do something for Pakistani day laborers or Gazan children.",

I think we see it time and time again, that a (perceived) lack of revolutionary conditions are used by revisionists to justify reformism. In Cyprus that takes the form of \"We can't do revolution while being a small country that is occupied by 2 NATO armies, the Turkish and British ones, and which maintains the presence of another NATO army supposedly willingly in the unoccupied parts, the Greek one\". Hence we need to [insert all kinds of reformism], including most prominently by AKEL, \"we need to focus on a bourgeois solution to the Cyprus Problem before we can think about revolution\". Of course AKEL doesn't openly advocate for a *bourgeois* solution, but that's the real essence. And on the Cyprus Problem this is not even a position espoused *only* by AKEL revisionists. Me and you have also briefly discussed how Third Worldism may be used as an excuse for inaction. I think in a sense that is evident here; Third Worldism (or a certain understanding of it) is literally justifying \"doing something\" (i.e. some bullshit instead of anything revolutionary).",

Even if OP got the responses they most needed to hear, it is all but guaranteed they were only seeking validation for a choice they have already made - their commitment to basic Marxist concepts is tangential (lacking the introspection to question the ethics of their *current* position as an extension of the problems with the promotion) and at that point, it's so unlikely that the opinions of redditors will meaningfully change what you do. \n\nE: Though I could also be deriving this conclusion from the fact that they ultimately didn't even bother... maybe if they really did investigate it further, there would have been a small amount of hope.",
