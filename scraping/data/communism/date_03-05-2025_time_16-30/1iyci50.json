James Connolly was an EXCELLENT Marxist and labour leader - he was shot after leading the Citizens\u2019 Army in the Easter Rebellion in 1916. His writings are very much worth reading. The history of the Official IRA was also tinged with various socialist thought.",

However, there was also a strong trade union movement among other things - see the 1913 lockout. \n\nWhile class consciousness was undoubtedly rising, the nationalist movement was more split. James Connolly was the most renowned socialist, and his writings are an essential read. Others however were more conservative leaning. A lot of people were also deeply religious, probably due to the fact that Britains oppression of Ireland was historically deeply rooted in religion.\n\nIn 1919, Ireland had a war of independence with Britain, this led to a treaty that partitioned Ireland. This led to a civil war in 1921 between the pro and anti treaty sides. \n\nThe pro treaty side ironically backed by Britain, this was a very gruesome war that pit families against each other and has dictated Irish politics since. The two major Irish conservative parties come from either side of this war, and for decades people have voted based on what side of this war their family were on so Ireland have only ever been ruled by one of these two parties.\n\nOut of these two wars we did gain an Irish state, the leader of which was \u00c9amon de Valera. EDV took our state which was a fledgling and decided to essentially hand it over to the Catholic Church meaning they set up the key institutions and dominated Irish society for decades.\n\nThese years of bloodshed and the co-opting of the nationalist movement by conservative religious figures essentially killed the class movement. The church then ruled with an iron fist for decades.",

It controlled much of what could be said on the radio until very recently (in the \u201870s, Irish radio was still being censored, for example) and any reference to queerness, abortion and communism was redacted.\n\n\nThe relationship between the Orthodox Church and Imperial Russia was exactly the same, yet Russia had a revolution and Ireland didn't. What I'm trying to tell you is that there is more to the failure of communists in Ireland during the 20th century than just the church being conservative, almost every revolution in history has had to deal with reactionary clergy, including even the IRA in Ireland which had an antagonistic relationship with the Catholic Church.\n\n>Polls aren\u2019t reflective totally of political views per county, but they can be a good reflective of where people lie and how the country feels\n\nThe problem is that you are dismissing class contradictions within \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cthe country\u201d, and a poll with a sample size of a few thousand people will not reflect the perception of the most advanced classes in society. Besides, it will take time for communism to regain mass support in the first world due to its relationship with imperialism, which has fostered a petty bourgeois consciousness among large sections of the population. The priority for communists in the first world is not to win elections or attract vast numbers of supporters, but to build a party capable of consolidating the interests of the proletariat and intervening effectively in moments when a revolutionary alternative emerges, grounded in a synthesis of theory and political practice.",

Socialism Made Easy is an excellent starting point, along with some of his earlier works with the Scottish and Irish Socialist parties of the time (SDF and ISRP, respectively).\n\nI find that his essay Sinn F\u00e9in, Socialism and the Nation raises some excellent points regarding the practice of SF and how they continue to operate in this day and age; continuing a nationalist movement instead of a proletarian one.
