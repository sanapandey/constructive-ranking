Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

It is completely dead. I'm honestly baffled that this is the diplomatic solution the CPP is advocating for. Can't say I know the actual solution myself but I imagine that, as of now, Ukraine agreeing to officially cede the entirety of the five oblasts Russia has partially or fully annexed since 2014 would be the bare minimum for negotiations to start.\u00a0",

I do wonder why this section is even included at all - is the CPP just unwilling to appear affirmative of Russia's intentions in adopting such an obviously unrealistic neutral stance?",

As for the inclusion of this section by the CPP, as you see I'm myself baffled so for now your guess is as good as mine. Unfortunately at face value it comes off as the party being very out of touch (by almost 3 years) with current reality. Given the scale and importance of the conflict you'd think they'd do better in that regard.",

Obviously though, Minsk is never coming back; the Ukranian bourgeoisie is not going to federalise the state, and Russia is not going to undo their annexation of the oblasts and republics in Eastern Ukraine, especially since they're slowly winning the war in Donbass.\n\nLike you, it's hard for me to imagine a solution. Even if there's a ceasefire after Russia seizes all of Donetsk and/or Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, it's going to be a ''frozen conflict'' like the Korean peninsula; Ukraine is going to disintegrate as a nation, Russian capitalism is in crisis, and the threat of a World War is looming. The only true solution is a socialist reconstitution of Ukraine and Russia.",

So even a freeze is out of the question. Of course circumstances may dictate otherwise especially if NATO gets more directly involved as it increasingly is, so I don't know.\n\n\nAlso, I find the explanation that a capitalist crisis in Russia is one reason for the war a plausible explanation but what do you base that assertion on? Bourgeois analysts either assert that the Russian economy will collapse any minute or that the Russian economy is actually doing okay. I tend to find the latter more likely for probably obvious reasons but it's still a bourgeois analysis. Perhaps you're aware of something I'm not.\u00a0\n\n\n> The only true solution is a socialist reconstitution of Ukraine and Russia.\u00a0\n\n\nYes, however my estimation is that there is currently no vanguard organisation with even a semblance of ties to the masses in either country so it looks like\u00a0the end of this war will unfortunately be dictated on bourgeois terms.",
