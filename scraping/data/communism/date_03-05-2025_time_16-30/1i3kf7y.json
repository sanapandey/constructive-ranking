    "selftext": "Hi everyone. I have a very silly problem and am honestly ashamed of going to my friends and family for advice. I (29F) have been dating this guy (29M) for a couple of years now, and I radicalised a lot during this time. This has always been sort of a problem but I don't know whether and how I can solve it anymore. \n\nHe is not someone super politicised, and we have always had trouble talking about politics, not because we disagree on everything but because he is very stubborn and I am very passionate, so I get very anxious about him opposing my ideas (in my defence, I have been really trying to be a better listener). I know that's on me, but we both grew up in an upper-middle-class environment, and he works in a neolib evil corporation. Besides, he is privileged in every other way possible, which is a recipe for conservatism. At the same time, he is the classical human rights stan, NGO volunteering, etc. - which means that he is not totally oblivious about the problems I care about, just looks at them as something solvable from within the system and not as a consequence of capitalism. I, on the other hand, started there and radicalised, and now dedicate my life to revolutionary politics. \n\nWe got together because of similar hobbies and some core values, and it has been overall good. We have worked a lot on this to make it work. But I have been getting more and more nervous about the core values I have to ignore to make this work, especially now that we are talking about the next steps in our relationship. Recently, he told me he is not and does not think he will ever be anti-capitalist. He cannot understand the problems of capitalism as inherent to this system, which frustrates me since explaining that is literally part of my job. What the hell am I doing if I can't even convince my boyfriend?\n\nBesides, all of my friends make fun of me for defending a radical narrative and engaging with activism while sleeping with the devil and managing to maintain this relationship. I also miss being able to talk about some things I really care about with him instead of having to lecture him on all the basics whenever I want to have a conversation and end up talking to myself. I feel like I am cheating on my ideals, but at the same time, I love him.\n\nAm I crazy? Is this too absurd?  I know it is completely irrelevant to this group, but I thought it could be good to listen to some like-minded people's advice on this. Thanks and sorry for taking up this space.",

Maybe you and a few settlers you magically convince will be willing to undergo class suicide to make the world a better place, but individuals don't make history and you can hardly agitate and organize around this.

But I couldn't see myself with a conservative or liberal in the long term.\n\n\nPS: my ex that had a copy of the communist manifesto and I realized that we were very organically in sync on our world views even though I hadn't read it until after we broke up. We were 18 though, very young.\n\nPSS: I saw a comment about trying to radicalise him. Hmmm I disagree. You shouldn't base your relationship on a hope that you can change him. I had another partner who was managerial class and girl, no matter how many protests I took my to (even ones about environmentalism) he would pander to me to my face, but then do the complete opposite when I wasn't there. You can't change a person who doesn't want to change.",

You probably can't. He is being honest and recognizes his own class interests.\n\nThe question for you to ask yourself is how serious *your* commitment to revolutionary politics really is. Getting into a committed relationship with someone that does not explicitly share your politics is not that much different from investing in a 401K or getting a mortgage - you're building your life around your capitalistic future and that action reveals in it your feelings about revolution. You already live in contention with your boyfriend and while you can continue living in contradiction for the foreseeable future, eventually you will be forced to choose. There will be a point when being a first world communist is no longer easy but has real stakes or communism fades from your mind, and the result is either regressing to liberalism/fascism or shedding the contradictory elements from your life. When your \"loved ones\" are taking up arms in defense of capitalism and you are facing persecution or death what will you do?",

You said you \"read theory for life\" so I guess you work in academia but you're either avoiding any ethics involved in marxism or as I pointed, you're very dishonest human being. So I will have to guess presuming similar situations that I might figure myself in considering people that are in a similar situation here where I live but I will have to try to respect the cultural differences. I am sometimes astonished of how souless and detached from humanity people living in the core of U$ empire actually are.  \n  \nBy your description you seem to be attached to a relationship that is only lasting because you cannot dettach yourself of a highly consumerist lifestyle and a very toxic circle of friendship. This is actually so obvious that you have already figured yourself out but you are afraid of actually taking marxism seriously and leave the miserable U$ euroamerikan consumerist lifestyle that you do not want to lose. This is actually something I have noticed about some \"colleagues of colleagues\" in brazilian suburban context that put a facade of \"feminists\" but their social role as white woman that serves as wives of managerial white man who works in banks and other \"upper class\" suburban parasitical jobs in which income is way too high for you to commit class suicide, are as untouchable as you can imagine. This is something J. Sakai extensively talks about in Klass, Kommunity and Kulture in the book Settlers, perhaps you haven't read it so I highly recommend you to do so. Hopefully you will get the answer that you need to get because I am sorry to inform you, your relationship is not lasting.

I mean, even if they said that we wouldn't talk about politics whenever we went to a bar, they'd always end up making stupid racist and nationalistic remarks, and then they'd repeat their rule about not talking about politics whenever I reacted to those remarks, effectively shutting me down every time. That became too much for me to deal with. I'm more of a mainstream communist, a bit of a revisionist even (much of what has been written needs a major overhaul to be applicable to our modern era, in my opinion), and I'm always willing to debate people instead of throwing silly temper tantrums like some stupid toddler whenever someone says something I don't agree with, but seeing a bunch of fascists every week was too much for me.",

But since you also started there and became radicalized you may be able to radicalize him as well. \n\nSince you say he is somewhat interested in human rights have you talked to him about various progressive beliefs? Like LGBT rights, trans-women are women and trans-men are men, decolonization, fighting white supremacy, anti-racism, science is real, waifuism is valid, water and food are human rights, housing is a human right, etc?

If you are a Hindu, you date a Hindu or have your love convert - the same if you are a Moslem, Zoroastrianist, any religion; the same for morals, if you are a vegetarian, they must also be or become a vegetarian, even if they don't exactly hold the same moral reasoning as you, they at least have to take the action. \n\n\n\nYou may say, \"but that's forcing your values on people\" - yes, your values which you believe are correct. The difference between our values and the reactionary values of others is that our values are right, and will improve the world, so from our perspective, we believe it's very correct to force them. \n\n\n\nFor communism, it's both theory and action - our class struggle requires both solid theoretical grounds, and people getting out and doing things that actually push us way forward. If you're in a community where you're struggling everyday, where you have to fight, where you see the struggling and suffering in the streets, your liberal darling will almost certain see it your way in time due to your influence. When I surround myself with comrades, even when I fundamentally still disagree with their core positions (let's say they're an anarchist), I still start seeing at least their reasoning, and I feel stronger for having that context now - this is because we're both out and struggling, anti-liberals, ultra-progressive, and fundamentally a part of the class struggle.\n\n\n\nNow, class struggle is going to intensify over the next years. I don't have to tell you, even our privileged settler life is going to be increasingly subject to precarity, because the capitalist class now just wants to take as much as they possibly can right now, since they think they have absolutely no threats, and in the short term when they themselves are ruling, they are correct. \n\n\n\nAs for him saying 'I'll never be an anti-capitalist' yeah, so would I 15 years ago - you of \\*today\\* will never be an anti-capitalist. You of tomorrow absolutely can be!\n\n\n\nI'm gonna break with my other comrades here, and say you can change someone's opinion even when they are not materially effected - even if they are wealthy, if they were abused as a child, or socially isolated, or went through genital mutilation, or any number of things, that can be their revolutionary flash-point, which can radicalize them either way. Do remember almost all communist leaders were originally petty bourgaise, and yet they all ended up fighting with the masses. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Find a way to make him communist, possibly by connecting to the bad things he might have suffered due to this society, or break up with him, because fundamentally you cannot be radical and be mated with someone who believes in our enemy.",
