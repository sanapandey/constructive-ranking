    "selftext": "To Our People,\n \n-------------------------------------------\n\nThe Communist Party of Turkey is closely monitoring recent developments, which have accelerated following statements by MHP (Nationalist Movement Party) leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli, intensified with the jihadist group HTS (Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham) taking control of Damascus with the support of various countries in Syria, and entered a new phase with the written statement from Abdullah \u00d6calan. Our party\u2019s authorized committees are evaluating this process in all its dimensions. Today, we would like to share some of our observations:\n\n -------------------------------------------\n\n\n1. The cessation of the conflicts\u2014referred to as the \u201csilencing of the guns\u201d\u2014is a development that cannot be opposed. These conflicts have led to the estrangement of citizens based on ethnic origins, dragged them into a bloody confrontation, divided the working people, and distanced them from real solutions to Turkey\u2019s problems. TKP views calls for peace and any resulting agreements reached or to be reached in this regard as a positive step.\n\n -------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n2. However, it is crucial to examine the objectives, basis, and methods of the ongoing process. The statements and positions of the involved parties, as well as our observations on the ground, do not allow us to share the optimism expressed by some circles.\n \n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n3. First and foremost, the claim that this process is driven by Turks and Kurds is inaccurate. The key players are the political power or the People\u2019s Alliance (ruling alliance led by AKP), and the PKK and its affiliates, which have called for self-termination. A process shaped by certain class, ideological, and political preferences cannot represent all Turkish and Kurdish people. In this context, the phrase \u201cTurkish-Kurdish fraternity,\u201d especially used by government circles, does not reflect reality.\n \n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n4. The notion that \u201cif Turks and Kurds form an alliance, Turkey will become the most significant power in the region\u201d\u2014an argument put forward a decade ago\u2014is once again being promoted by those involved in the process. However, Turkey\u2019s problems will not be solved by maneuvering within regional power struggles; on the contrary, such moves will only create new challenges. TKP warns that, as in the past, any attempt to advance Turkey\u2019s regional ambitions through a Neo-Ottomanist perspective will come at great cost. The expansionist and conquest-driven strategies that have been openly advocated in the media for months will lead only to disaster for our country and our people. Instead of making claims beyond our borders, we must build an independent, sovereign, and prosperous country within our own territory\u2014where all citizens live in freedom and equality.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n5. Similarly, efforts to establish \u201cdemocracy and fraternity\u201d in Turkey based on religion are extremely dangerous. None of the issues in the public sphere can be resolved through religious references. In fact, many of Turkey\u2019s current problems stem from the erosion of secularism and the influence of religious sects, which feeding off the country just as monopolies do. While  TKP firmly upholds freedom of belief and worship as an inalienable human right, we also emphasize that religion must remain separate from politics and state affairs.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n6. We are also struck by claims from ruling party circles that this process represents a major step forward for democracy in Turkey. The reality today is starkly different: extreme poverty and deep social inequality prevail, justice has been entirely eroded, and tyranny and unlawfulness have become the norm.\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\n7. Contrary to what is implied in \u00d6calan\u2019s statement and often asserted by pro-government circles, the PKK is not a Marxist organization. At a time when the self-termination of this nationalist-based organisation is on the agenda, we will not remain indifferent to the government\u2019s cunning attempt to shift the responsibility for the past onto revolutionaries and socialism. Marxism is fundamentally incompatible with nationalism infused with liberalism or with having alliances with the United States or Israel.\n \n-------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n8. The Communist Party of Turkey is determined to ensure the fraternity of the oppressed, the poor strata, and the working class by fighting against imperialism, exploitation, monopolies, and the rule of religious sects. We seek to unite the vast majority of Turks, Kurds, and all others\u2014regardless of ethnic origin\u2014who have been deprived of this country\u2019s wealth, not through heroic references to the past but through the realities of today.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\nCommunist Party of Turkey\nCentral Committee \n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n\nhttps://www.tkp.org.tr/en/agenda/statement-by-tkp-central-committee-on-ocalans-letter/",

This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here.

The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

If so then why bother publicicing a statement at all.\n\nAny communist party engaged in struggle will inevitably face repression, why should the fact they could face arrests or violence justify revisionism or opportunism?\n\nThis does not stop other communist organizations in Turkey from doing much more than just speaking positively of the kurdish struggle.",
