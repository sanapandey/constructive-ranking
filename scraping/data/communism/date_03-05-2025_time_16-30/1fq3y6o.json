    "selftext": "I recently moved to the UK and wanted to get familiar and hopefully involved with the UK communist scene. Before joining a particular party, I wanted to subscribe to a paper + magazine. The ones that got my eye are:\n\n* \"*The Communist*\" paper + \"*In defence of Marxism*\" magazine (Revolutionary Communist Party)\n* \"*The Socialist*\" paper + \"*Socialism Today*\" magazine (Socialist Party)\n* \"*Socialist Worker*\" paper + \"*International Socialism*\" magazine (Socialist Worker)\n\nI would really appreciate if you could share your experience and recommendations. Being new it's still unclear to me how these differ in terms of tone, approaches and party history.\n\nThanks!",

            "body": "\"*Socialist Worker*\" paper + \"*International Socialism*\" magazine (Socialist Worker) < This is a Trotskyite publication and as such should be disregarded as left in appearance, right in essence. Trotskyites defame the USSR as a \"deformed worker state\", sided with fascists and to this day work to prop up social-imperialist parties under the guise of 'entryism'.\n\n\"*The Socialist*\" paper + \"*Socialism Today*\" magazine (Socialist Party) < The \"Committee for a Worker's International\" is a Trotskyite organization, and it's member organizations and their publications should therefore be ignored.\n\nThe legitimate Communist movement today is represented by the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties, and their website is solidnet.org. I can't speak to a good publication in the UK but I can generally advise that Trotskyite publications are a dime a dozen, especially in western countries as the main social-imperialist parties are hotbeds of Trotskyite traitors who run highly effective propaganda operations intended to snatch up young progressives and turn them into agents of imperialism and reaction.",
