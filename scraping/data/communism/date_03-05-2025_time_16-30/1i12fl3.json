After only a few months of this shock therapy, the practical whole population going against the Yeltsin government, this would be known as the \"Russian Constitutional Crisis of 1993.\", Going for around 2 years before the russian white house was shelled by the russian government, killing 2,000 people to continue its shock therapy, and it goes on and on.\n\nThe Dissolution Of The Soviet Union was one of the greatest tragedies in human history, without the USSR to protect or defend any of its nations that they supported, were able to be colonized and go into capitalist shock therapy again, it's really pathetic that people bother to defend a system that is just this.. really its just a definition of a terrible system to further the benefit of the capitalist class.\n\n:)",

Not the Dialectical Materialist Truth.\n\n\nThe USA is external(condition) to the US\"S\"R while the Basis of Change is internal to the US\"S\"R. The USA interfering inside the US\"S\"R only happened because of the internal Capitalist Revisionist development.\n\n\n> the russian people who called the soviet union home, held a referendum was held to ask the people if THEY, not the party deciding, if the soviet union should remain independent or should generally dissolve, 76.4% of the population of the USSR said that a communist state should remain,\n\n\nIt's been [commented here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/1hyb5md/comment/m6oe1wt/) why the referendum isn't a good source due to framing issues and questions asked.\n\n\n> The Dissolution Of The Soviet Union was one of the greatest tragedies in human history\n\n\nNo the dissolution of the Union of Soviet \"\"Socialist\"\" Republics was not the greatest tragedy in human history. That would probably go to the USSR falling to the Counter Revolution in 1956 or the PRC falling suite in 1976.",

You don't get to blame imperialism for the defeat of socialism because the primary task of socialism in the age of monopoly capitalism is to topple and overthrow imperialism -- saying imperialism won is a political critique which demands you ask why socialism failed to do it's job, which really means that the USSR was guided by incorrect politics.  Which ties back to the OP, who hasn't yet reckoned with the fact that the people leading the charge to destroy socialism in the USSR were not actually from the West, but rather the leaders and members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.  The anti-communism was coming from inside the house.",

Russia was invaded by almost every global imperialist power in 1919(?) with the express purpose to destroy the Red Army and reinstate the Tsar. Why didn't the Communist Party fail then? Why didn't socialism fail in WWII? Why did it fail when, comparitively, much less external pressure was being placed on it? Either imperialist capitalism is in fact stronger than the organized dictatorship of the proletariat, or perhaps the DOTP was non-existent and the state was so thoroughly weakened by revisionist bureaucracy that it toppled under its own internal contradictions. A distinction revisionists refuse to acknowledge.\u00a0",

A much more important document corroborating the claims would be this one:\n\n[A Proposal Concerning the General Line of the International Communist Movement: The Letter of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Reply to the Letter of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of March 30, 1963](https://bannedthought.net/China/MaoEra/GreatDebate/AProposalConcerningGeneralLineOfIntlCommunistMovement-1963-Full.pdf)\n\nFor at least a decade or so, this was considered one of the most important and famous documents in the entire history of the world communist movement. It's a back and forth between the revisionist-USSR and revolutionary-China, each trying to justify their positions to the other.  \n\nThere are lots of other documents from this era, including many pro-Soviet arguments and positions which really only make things even clearer, mostly located here:\n\nhttps://bannedthought.net/China/MaoEra/GreatDebate/index.htm#GreatDebate\n\nAnd EROL is a great resource as well, especially for digging up the history of communist parties in the 60s and 70s (just click on China if you aren't sure where to begin):\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/history/erol/erol.htm",
