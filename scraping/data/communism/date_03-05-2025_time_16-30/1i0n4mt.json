If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

The transition to communism (from a socialist society) means that over time, with the development of productive forces, the value of goods becomes so low that, instead of having their distribution regulated by money, they could be distributed for free.\n\n>I'd love to know what other people have suggested\n\nHere is what Stalin suggested, as recalled by Molotov:\n\n\"Before the first post-war session of the Supreme Soviet, one of the marshals, Vasilevsky, I think, asked him how he imagined communism. \u201cI believe,\u201d Stalin said, \u201cthat the initial phase or first stage of communism will practically begin when we begin distributing bread to the population for free.\u201d And then, I think, Voronov asked: \u201cComrade Stalin, what about bread for free, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d Stalin led us to the window: \u201cWhat\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cA river, Comrade Stalin.\u201d \u201cWater?\u201d \u201cWater.\u201d \u201cWhy isn\u2019t there a line for water? You see, you haven\u2019t even thought about the fact that we could have such a situation with bread in our country.\u201d \n\nThis is from Feliks Chuev's \"140 conversations with Molotov\", in case you are interested.",

Every year there are more and more people in debt, more and more people struggling to make ends meet - and this goes for most of the world. A good way to agitate is to turn someone's frustration towards what is really causing it. For example, if one is concerned about \"migrants taking their job\", you (the agitator) explain that it is the haute bourgeoisie (though try not to use scientific terms when agitating to people not used to marxist terms) making the government of their country bring in migrants en masse to lower wages. Or, if one is concerned about very low social benefits, you explain to them that the government has no interest in supporting the poor/elderly/etc, and that it is ran by the haute bourgeoisie for the haute bourgeoisie.\n\nWhen attempting to introduce the very idea of communism, one also needs to look at their environment. For example, how anti-communist is the country one is agitating in? Because bringing up communism in say, the US would be much harder than in much of the former USSR or as far as I have heard, many countries in latin america. Remember to think dialectically - there is no single way or argument that works for everyone.",

Before telling someone to read the collected works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin, you must first  prove why marxism is correct through more simple examples, or else you will sound like a religious fanatic. (Obviously this method can sometimes work since there are some people who are already interested in political/economic/philosophic literature, however we both know that the overwhelming majority of people are not).\n\n>Is this not destined to fail, as the vast majority of these people have a material interest in maintaining imperialism?\n\n1. The petty bourgeoisie, especially in poorer countries, does not exclusively have a material interest in maintaining capitalism. This is Trotsky's position on the \"total counterrevolutionary nature of the petty bourgeoisie\" that Lenin (and life itself) proved wrong.\n\n2. In my reply I said that \"capitalism is an agitator's best friend\", clearly implying that agitation works best for people already disillusioned with capitalism (i.e. proletarian, petty bourgeoisie, unemployed - anyone who is frustrated with the current state of affairs).\n\nFurthermore, if you disagree with this, can you provide an example of how you agitate?",

I\u2019m asking out of genuine curiosity, because this made me think of the non-native people who are not descended from colonizers. The people in the US who are descended from slaves and indentured servants who were brought here involuntarily may not know where their ancestors came from.\n\nMy reply:\n\n> Why have you presupposed the fact that the revolution which would enable total decolonization happens with no changes to the population structure of settler states in the process? Or, for that matter, why deportation is the only option available to revolutionaries?\n\nTheir reply:\n\n> **u/ Th3-Dude-Abides:** My question was to the person who wrote \u201cWhat does that look like? That looks like kicking them off the land and shutting down their institutions\u2026\u201d I know nothing about decolonization, so I haven\u2019t presupposed any facts. I asked them a follow up question about their statement because I wanted to better understand what they meant. I took \u201ckicking them off the land\u201d to mean deportation, but I am uninformed so I easily could have misunderstood.\n\nMy second reply:\n\n> ...The presumption you made lies with your \"97% of the population\" number. That describes the population structure of the U$ as it is now. In every successful anti-colonial revolution that has occurred, a large percentage of the settler population flees, and a large percentage are killed. The question of what is to be done to the settler population that remains can only be answered when the revolutionaries can act upon it.\n\n> I'm not saying you were being a reactionary, but you came very close to echoing a common reactionary anti-decolonization sentiment: presume that total decolonization involves deporting 300 million Euro-Amerikans to Britain or Germany (in your case you at least applied it to all of the non-indigenous people) overnight, act incredulous toward the logistics of doing so, and then decide that this imagined future proves decolonization isn't worthwhile.\n\nWhat I was interested in addressing was anti-decolonization arguments made on the basis of their supposed infeasibility, which OP didn't assert directly, but the questions they asked seem to be the same line of thought. It's little to do with what could happen bu\n\n> Unless you are using \"eradicated\" in some kind of metaphorical sense I assume you are saying all settlers should be killed, no?\n\nEradication of the class means eradication of the class - the complete proletarianization of the bourgeoisie (which Autrevml1936 discussed) eradicates the bourgeoisie but so too does killing or indefinite imprisonment or deportation of members of that class also accomplish it. When I say 'eradication' I reference the full range of ways with which classes can come to an end.\n\nNo one in this subreddit is going to pretend like revolution or decolonization are peaceful processes but sometimes I think there is a reluctance to acknowledge the implications of violence in a direct or non-euphemistic way. Yes, the socialist revolution brought to settler states may end with the settler population being largely killed off. This happened during the Haitian Revolution to most of the non-slave population and we uphold that. We would still uphold a revolution that ends the settler-colonial regime in the US and Kanada and replaces it with socialism even if that is the outcome there as well.\n\nBut I am not talking about what \"should\" occur. That can only be determined in the process of carrying out the advanced stages of a revolution which is not currently happening in the imperial core. I found Autrevml's response disappointing given that they have been blunter in the past:\n\n> [...Are you Amerikkkan Settler?
