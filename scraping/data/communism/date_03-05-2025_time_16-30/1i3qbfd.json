You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The fact that he didn't affiliate himself with any groups doesn't change that he did it on behalf of the working class since it was a working-class-related issue. I fear that his act will make it easy for authors and journalists from the right who want to demonize the working class, and it will have lasting effects. It will also lead some millennial parents to raise their children sheltered from politics to keep them out of prison.",

He is a young radicalized individual who wanted vigilante justice and revenge on the class that persecuted him. This made him a sympathetic folk hero rather than a representative of a group that can be harassed\n\nhe cant be an adventurist who harmed the socialist movement, because he wasn\u2019t part of the socialist movement.\n\nWith all that said, as a folk hero, he inspires a lot of people to tap into and look at their rage and apathy against capitalism in a deeper and more meaningful way.\n\nIf socialist organizations spend their time pontificating on and condemning him as adventurist, they\u2019re willingly throwing away an opportunity to seize the moment and offer people new ways to channel and look into that rage against the system.\n\nWe can look at this action and say \u201cit didn\u2019t change anything, but it made us all feel good and understand our place in the system a little better\u201d\n\nbut if we say \u201cit didn\u2019t change anything and he was stupid\u201d we isolate all the people who felt represented by this expression of class hatred\n\nedit: Ive changed my mind on a lot of stuff i said here^ posted a second comment expressing newer thoughts.",

The demand for higher quality healthcare that is cure-focused and caters to those within the U$ is at the expense of the people of oppressed countries and some in internal semi-colonies/colonies. In the short-term to medium-term after a revolution here, the quality of healthcare will decrease access to medical drugs and infrastructure will decrease, being used elsewhere where it's needed more. Instead holistic and prevention-focused system will be developed, similar to that of prior socialist countries. In the long-term this may be better for even the petty-bourgeois today in quality, but in the short to medium term it is not and will actively harm them.\n\nThat is why the demand for \"universal\" healthcare is social fascist, as it sucks up resources from oppressed countries and some sections of internal semi-colonies/colonies for the sake of the majority o people in imperialist countries.",

I think especially for those in imperialist countries what is crucial to keep in mind how revolutionaries are fighting for the *international proletariat*, not for a particular section of the proletariat or other classes. A start will be to understand what the proletariat and class struggle even is. That's a difficult thing, especially trying to apply it.\n\nThe majority of work within the U$ is providing services to people(called \"unproductive labor\"). Most work directly or indirectly helping to produce commodities(called \"productive labor\") being exported or highly mechanized(often high pay and these machines are built elsewhere). The proletariat, who is the driving force of revolution, is found primarily in the productive sector, facing oppression and exploitation by the bourgeois. It's the most concentrated and important class in production, being dispossessed any/all other forms of wealth and forced to \"voluntarily\" perform wage-labor to survive. The only proletariat within the U$ today are arguably a section of migrant workers, but even they have a noticeably better situation than workers in their home country or even other migrant workers(i.e. in Gulf Countries, Singapore, etc...). Historically the situation may have been different, with New Afrikans(the Black Nation) forming a agricultural and industrial proletariat, with that now being outsourced and replaced by migrants. Further back, European migrants may have formed a proletariat, but, at the least, by now they are assimilated and largely petty-bourgeois.",

The fact that his (alleged) action had such widespread support attests to this. Furthermore, the fact is that it already happened, and paternalistically waving our finger would accomplish nothing but alienate ourselves from those who sympathize with Luigi.\n\nSimilarly, Marx had warned the Paris workers that it would be premature to revolt, and yet during and after their attempt at the commune, he openly supported and commended them \u2014 only criticizing the weaknesses in their strategy. Similarly again, Lenin certainly disagreed with Blanqui, but IIRC he still regarded him personally as a proletarian hero. Luigi, of course, is no paris commune and no Blanqui, but the point is that condemning him and criticizing adventurism need not be the same thing.",

This kind of classless moral \"solidarity\" with a \"leftist\" Ted Kaczynski without the obvious racism and bigotry tell me everything I need to know about the whole \"Luigi\" media spectacle thing. And the obvious opportunism coming from the Amerikan \"left\".\n\nOh and don't forget you wrote literally wrote this;\n\n[Settler-Colonialism Is Not \u201cThe Primary Contradiction\u201d\n](https://lavender-news.com/2024/06/27/settler-colonialism-is-not-the-primary-contradiction/).",
