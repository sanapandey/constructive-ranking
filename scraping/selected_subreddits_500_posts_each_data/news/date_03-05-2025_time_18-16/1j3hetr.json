This is literally just a team sport to them where as long as the other team suffers more than they do they're completely fine with anything coming out of Trumps mouth. So they're okay with getting fucked economically as long as \"DEI hires\" no longer get special treatment.\n\nIt is literally insane when I go to places with large low income MAGA populations voting for the person who is blatantly fucking them in the ass to give billionaires more and they're basically begging for more.",
