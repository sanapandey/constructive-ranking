I'm glad I realized so young late teens through early 20s cause it took years to unlearn so much and rewire the happy me.\n\nI really don't understand how some just refuse to take that step. Like do they enjoy being that miserable? What an awful way to spend your life.",

If you never give yourself the option to try something new, you don't have to be scared or wonder if you're brave enough to try etc. \n\nI think a lot of it also has to do with the fact that if they stray too far from the conservative mainline, they may be rejected by that community, and possibly their families. It's why leaving the Mormon church is hard because you basically get cut off from your family and friends once you're ex-communicated.\n\nLastly, I think people sometimes dig in against living a less hate-filled life because it's too upsetting to think about all the time and energy they've already wasted being miserable. So it's safer/easier to just continue being miserable and hateful. \n\nSeems like a terrible waste of life to me.",

The first part of your post does a great job of explaining this and how all people, not just conservatives, can become trapped by ideas... but also, the second half of the comment, and all the \"omg so true!\" replies, captures how little empathy we can have for people we don't like, and how quickly we can invent nonsense to 'other' them for it.\n\nThey do it, you do it, I do it, we all do it.

He was spouting off that she \"forgave him\". Like, she was hospitalised because she was struggling to live, then died. Nowhere would she have been able to say she forgave him. He just decided it on his own.\n\n\nSomehow, I feel some of these stories are going to be like that. \"My dead child who was unvaccinated totally forgave me for sending him to a measles party and them dying.\"",

He was coming home sick constantly, but somehow I never tested positive for Covid.\n\nThe last time he got sick, I suggested casually he take a Covid test, and then added hastily, \"There's a big surge going around right now, lots of other shit too, but it'd be good to make sure it's not Covid at least,\" and he blew me off initially.\n\nThen he barged into my office a few hours later wagging a negative test in my face, which means he waited until I wouldn't know he was taking the test, so if the results were positive, he could have lied about it/attempted to deny he had it. There's no other reason to wait to take it hours after your wife suggested doing so, except that you want to control whether or not she sees the results. I can't fathom why anyone would want to hide a negative result--and he *didn't*, but he sure didn't want me around to see if he got a positive one. That really fucks me up when I think about it. Dude had a life insurance policy on me. I'm sure it'd pay nicely if his immunocompromised wife got fuckin' Covid and it killed her or some weird shit. Is that probable? I want to say, \"I doubt it\" but fuck if I know anymore. \n\nI can only imagine what he tells people.",

HHS\u2019 efforts include offering technical assistance, laboratory support, vaccines, and therapeutic medications as needed ...\n\n...We must engage with communities to understand their concerns, provide culturally competent education, and make vaccines readily accessible for all those who want them...\"\n\nThe vitamin shock & horror seems to be due to this paragraph: \"While there is no approved antiviral for those who may be infected, CDC has recently updated their recommendation supporting administration of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection. Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality.\"\n\nThe linked CDC article says \"...Supportive care, including vitamin A administration under the direction of a physician, may be appropriate.\"\n\nImmediately after that Kennedy goes on to say \"Parents play a pivotal role in safeguarding their children\u2019s health. All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.  The decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\"",

The **World Health Organization (WHO) recommends administration of an oral dose** of 200,000 IU (or 100,000 IU in infants) **of vitamin A** per day for two days **to children with measles** in areas where vitamin A deficiency may be present.\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869601/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11869601/)\n\n>**In the United States** (US) general population, **vitamin A deficiency is rare**, estimated at 0.3% in 2013.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567744/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567744/)\n\nThere must be some overlap between the children with severe measles and those with vitamin A deficiency. The fact is, high doses of vitamin A are recommended treatment for severe measles. Of course, the best medicine is prevention, so good nutrition and vaccination are preferred to any post-disease treatment. Do not let your feelings for RFK Jr. lead you down dismissing the facts. The same thing happened with COVID treatments like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and monoclonal antibodies. Just because someone you don't like says it, doesn't make it false.",

Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\u201d\n\nHe also sent a bunch of MMR vaccines to Texas. He further explained in his op-ed that good nutrition and sanitation improved outcomes for measles, that using vitamin A sources like cod liver oil can help treat it (which is true and good information to disseminate to the public), and that a balanced diet rich in vitamins is the best defense against most chronic and infectious diseases, which is about the only thing he said that deserves fair criticism since the best prevention for things we have vaccines for is the vaccines; but it\u2019s also not entirely unfounded either. Disease rates and outcomes are better in people with better nutrition. He did encourage people to talk to their healthcare providers about receiving the vaccine though, he just said that the choice to get it is a personal one, which is also true. \n\nLike I said, I think the guy is a fucking shitweasel along with the rest of this regime and a total quack but we don\u2019t need to stoop to their level when it comes to disinformation. It\u2019s easy enough to fight these morons with facts, we don\u2019t need to make things up or exaggerate them. There\u2019s plenty of ammunition without doing so.
