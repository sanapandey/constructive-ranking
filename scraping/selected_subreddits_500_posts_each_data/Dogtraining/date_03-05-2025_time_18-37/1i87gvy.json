    "selftext": "Original Post (3.5 years ago) : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ptdnr4/dog\\_snapped\\_at\\_baby\\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/ptdnr4/dog_snapped_at_baby_help/) \n\n  \n3ish years ago I made this post about my reactive rescue dog snapping at my 8-month old. I've gotten lots of messages asking me for an update so I thought it might be helpful to post this. Our daughter is now 4 years old and I'm happy to report that she and Danzig (who is almost 9 now) are bffs. \n\nBut the road to get there was LONG and the first few years were nerve-wracking as hell. Many comments in my original post recommended rehoming him. We decided to try a few things before going that route because we know our dog and we thought we could work with him. But we did arrange with my parents that he would go live there if there was no progress. Thankfully, we didn't have to do that but I am NOT using this post to tell you that you should not rehome your reactive dog if you have kids. If anything this is a cautionary tale about the amount of work that goes into keeping your family safe. Dog bites happen fast. In many cases, the lengths we went to might not be possible. \n\nThis is what we did to make it work: \n\n1) kept them totally separate unless they were supervised. Supervised does not mean an adult in the adjacent room doing something and occasionally checking on them - it means actively watching them both. Things gets crazy in a house with a small kid, so this was really hard. But we took it very seriously and made sure that everyone who visited or watched the baby knew that the dog should never be in her personal space and vice versa. We never gave the dog the opportunity to get annoyed by her being too close to him because we never let her too close to him unless it was fully safe (i.e. him sitting next to her while she's in her high chair, him sitting next to her while I'm holding her, etc.) This was the hardest part because it took constant vigilance, especially when she was crawling/walking and getting into everything.\n\n2) We met with a behaviorist who recommended putting him on Reconcile, which we did and he has been on ever since. He still gets anxious sometimes, but never to the extent that he used to. \n\n3) We worked with the behaviorist on understanding what situations triggered his anxiety and recognizing the signs of stress so that we could fix the problem before he got so stressed that he felt he needed to react. This is different for every dog but for him the trigger was usually being approached while he was laying down. Being loomed over when he's in a prone position is very stressful for him. We made it so that he would never be in the position to be approached like this \n\n4) We worked really hard on the \"place\" command. When he laid down in our common space - immediate \"place\" to his bed. We put his bed in an area that was inaccessible to our toddler and never allowed our toddler near his bed. We also worked on \"leave it\", which comes in handy a lot but we would also use it when he started to show anxious interest in the kid - \"leave it\" and \"place\" until he started to understand that he's not allowed to mess with her and if he's anxious about her he needs to retreat to a safe place. Eventually he just started doing it on his own.\n\n  \n5) we worked with our kid from day 1 about respecting the dog and not messing with him. We still work with her on this but she fully understands that the dog is sensitive about his personal space and if she messes with him she will get bitten. We work with her on learning about his body language, like rolling over on his back means he\u2019d like to have his tummy rubbed but moving his face away from her, hard stare, a low tail, etc, means he needs space.   \n  \n6) we actually moved. There were other factors that went into the move aside from the dog/baby situation, but it was one of the things that made the biggest difference imo. Our house at the time was really small and cramped and there was nowhere the dog could go to get away from baby noises and stuff, I think it was really stressing him out. Once we moved to a place that was more spread out we started noticing that when he was stressed he would just go upstairs and nap and come back and be fine\n\n7) as soon as she was able, we had her feeding him and giving treats. As soon as she started eating solid food regularly (I guess around 1.5 years?) a lightbulb seemed to click for him and he realized that she was not a loud annoying grub, but a small human with treat giving capabilities who was always sticky and dropping food on the floor for him. This is really when things changed in a big way and he started to bond with her.\n\n  \nAll that to say that if you find yourself in the same boat we were, there are thing you can try before you commit to rehoming. However, getting through the next few years until your kid is old enough to be recognized as a family member is hard because you\u2019ll have to constantly supervise them and stay on your toes. Bites happen so fast. If you're not watching and catching the signs of stress, you've already lost. And, like with any training, it's never \"over\" and you need to remain consistent. Even though the two are friends now, I would still never allow certain situations to happen like them snuggling or her annoying him while he's laying down. His anxiety is a part of him and it's never going to fully go away. \n\nHope this can help others! ",
