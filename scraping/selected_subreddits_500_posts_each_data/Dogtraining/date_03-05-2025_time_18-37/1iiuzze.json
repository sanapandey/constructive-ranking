    "selftext": "I recently adopted a chihuahua.  He is extremely disturbed by TV images and, to a lesser extent, voices coming from a computer.  He looks directly at any TV without looking away, and will begin sniffing frantically at the air, running around sniffing, looking behind the TV, and so on.  He seems to think this is some sort of sorcery, people who do not have a scent and disappear from certain angles.  \n  \nHe eventually begins growling and barking, something he never does otherwise.  The only other time I heard him bark is when he was super stimulated by meeting my neighbor's dog, and that was because he was happy and it was an appropriate time to bark. He's never even barked at a vacuum or real people walking down the hallway of my apartment building.  And he seems genuinely distressed/scared by the TV.\n\n  \nThis is not a cute and trivial thing for me.  I'm a cinephile, have been for decades, and film is my main passion and hobby in life.  I watch more than a movie a day on average.  I need to find a way for this dog to accept the existence of the TV.\n\nObviously I could try leaving the TV on, but I live in an apartment complex and a dog barking his head off is not really appropriate.  I can't ignore his behavior, he paces and jumps over me and seems so angry.  Otherwise he's a completely silent dog with some young dog energy but no behavioral issues.\n\nI think maybe he was a stray before we got him and never experienced any technology.  Should I expect him to get over it eventually?",

At the very bottom, where the floor met the tub surround) while figuring out why there\u2019s water in one per of the room, but not the other",

It really opened my eyes to how often shows and movies have dogs barking in the background that I never usually noticed! He would be running behind and looking for the source as you say yours does.\n\nI didn't do anything specific other than avoid documentaries about dogs at first as I couldn't be arsed with the inevitable drama. It's been a few months and he's now totally unbothered by even the most ferocious barking on TV. I was actually thinking this the other night, he didn't even twitch at some super aggressive and loud dogs barking on TV as he knew it wasn't real.\n\nI think it takes them a while to just get used to the concept of a TV and that the TV will produce all sorts of noises but it's nothing to worry about.",

The strange thing is he is transfixed and disturbed by the images, and doesn't react to the sounds specifically. I definitely had dogs growing up who would bark if there was a knock or doorbell on TV, but never one that would look at the TV except in a few odd moments before they decide it's not important.",

You have to start with a break from the trigger to lower their stress levels. If you need tv / sound / ect on use head phones to give him a break.\n\nYou have to move at his pace as well I say weeks but it might only take days you do it slowly so he can build up repetition of likimat + tv, which will ultimatly make him enjoy the tv. If he reacts you stop access to the likimat and turn the tv off, take a break for 30 min or so and try again.\n\nThis is how you get dogs used to having their nails done and grooming as well\n\nYou can't punish reaction out of them, you just can't say 'no' and have him stop - you have to make him feel like TV is no issue because currently it's an issue for him.\n\nA trainer in R+ training will help you get your timing right but using this method even if you have bad timing training will just take longer it won't hurt the dog.",

I will have high value treats with me while watching television and will reward him when he stops barking at the television.

You can also give a bone for the dog to chew on or a lick mat, that also helps!",
