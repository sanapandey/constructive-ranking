    "selftext": "Okay I want to start this saying SHE DOES NOT EAT TREATS ON WALKS! she won't even look at them when she's on a walk, I've brought out pieces of chicken and she's not cared one bit when on a walk about any form of food. she's hot and pulling problem where she won't stop pulling or stay by my side at all, she's constantly got to be at the front. I've looked at a few videos but all of them try and give the dog some form of treat reward but she doesn't care for treats when walking. I want to train her positively because she's a rescue who's been abused in her previous home, and I don't want her to be scared of me or worried I'll hurt her when we're out together. she's just turned 2, husky x labrador mix. \n\nsorry the writings a bit muddled up, I just really need some help so I can take her on really nice proper walks places because she deserves it ",
