    "selftext": "I got him at 8 weeks, and began taking him on walks once he warmed up to me and his surrounding area about 10-12 weeks old. He did excellent on walks. Winter came and I wasn\u2019t able to get him out for like a month and now he refuses to leave the driveway. I spent countless hours outside on the road trying to get him to come and he refuses. He is very good motivated, but treats are of no use in this scenario. How can I get him to go on walks? A dog with this much energy cannot be housebound. I need to get him outside. ",
