    "selftext": "We have a 3yo kooiker/sheltie mix. She has no history of incontinence. We moved 6 months ago and there were no problems then either. For the past month she has been leaking urine droplets after we've come back from the last walk of the day right before bed.\n\nWe called the vet in case it was a UTI or smth but they said there would be other symptoms since it's been going on for a while. Also she didn't have any problems with this at my parents during christmas. We also read that it could be submissive behavior and tried to not greet her when she got back from the walk. It helped for a little but it came back. \n\nShe does drink water a lot but we don't think it's her actually having to go since there's no puddles but rather drops here and there almost immediately after she's off the leash. We've tried taking her for longer walks during the evening too in case it was incontinence but that hasn't helped either.\n\nWe never scold her but we don't really know how to encourage her either. Does she know it's happening? This happens ONLY after the last walk on the evening. Has anyone had this problem or know what we could try next?\n\n",

We never scold her on it though as we're not sure if she notices it happening or if it's smth uncontrollable like tail wagging.\nWe are in a new location but she doesn't have accidents anywhere else and this behavior has started after 4 months of living here.\nThe incontinence only happens at a very specific time every day almost like clock work.",
