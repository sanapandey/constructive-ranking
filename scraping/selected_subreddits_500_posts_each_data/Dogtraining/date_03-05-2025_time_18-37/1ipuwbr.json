    "selftext": "I have an 9 year old spayed morkie who has suddenly started barking in her crate at night. Vet checked her out okay, no other changes in her behaviour, food, water, exercise. No changes to the household. She has been crate trained since I got her as a puppy. \n\nShe loves her crate and appears to still love it. She goes in on her own accord, and will even go in and paw at the opening if I\u2019m up watching tv late and she wants me to turn the tv off and leave so she can have the room to herself. \n\nShe knows the bedtime routine of \u201cpotty, cookie, crate\u201d and still does that willingly. At night I close the crate door because of a cat that I caught years ago on camera going into the room and swatting the dog so she would bark and then \u2018since I was up anyways\u2019 the cat would get her breakfast 30 minutes early. So the crate door is closed at night and the cat gets nothing until my alarm goes off - been that way for 5+ years and works for us.\n\nShe very rarely - maybe a handful of times a year, bark in the middle of the night needing to go potty. I take her potty, she pees, and then she walks herself back to her crate. \n\nWhen she was a puppy somehow stumbled on her \u2018cut off\u2019 point with barking. If she wanted to go potty she would bark until I took her, but if she was doing it for play or attention she would give up at 7 minutes. She\u2019s like clockwork LOL. \n\nOccasionally she\u2019ll have a dream where she wakes herself up and I\u2019m guessing because she feels startled she\u2019ll bark, but by 7 minutes she\u2019s fallen back asleep. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t bark when we leave the house, every time we\u2019ve seen her barking on cameras when we\u2019re not there is when there\u2019s been a noise at the door - mail, someone knocking, package delivery, or if the coyotes have been close enough that you can hear their howls - all the dogs in the neighbourhood end up joining in. She communicates 95% of the time by huffing disparagingly at you and not barking LOL \n\nEverything was how it\u2019s always been until four night ago when she barked in her crate for more than 7 minutes, I took her out, she went potty, she walked back into her crate herself, I went back to bed. About 10 minutes later she started barking again, I waited the 7, took her out but she didn\u2019t have to go, went back into her crate no differently than any other time. Ten or fifteen minutes later she started barking again\u2026. Potty attempts, nothing, vet check and no urinary issues, UTI, bladder issues, u/s showed fully empty bladder, etc. \n\nThree days ago I had to run an errand so I asked her to go in her crate, usual routine, she did it willingly, I watched her on the camera as I left the house and while I was out and she was fine. Didn\u2019t bark until I was pulling in and she heard the car. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s an issue with the crate specifically, or the room, being alone, etc. I took this as a good sign and thought maybe it was a bad dream and then nerves the next night, but that a positive 1.5 hours in there that afternoon showed that she was back to feeling calm in there. \n\nThat night we did \u201cpotty, cookie, crate\u201d, she did her little skip over the curb of the crate, watched her in the camera and she curled up and went to sleep. Twenty minutes later she was barking again, it lasted more than 7 minutes, took her potty but she didn\u2019t have to go, she hopped back into her crate herself (she doesn\u2019t get a cookie after potty breaks - only once at bedtime, and no snuggling/playing/attention), and I crossed my fingers. The barking started up again, didn\u2019t go potty, walked back into her crate herself, etc. It repeated all night. \n\nThat day she was tired but I made sure to play with her and keep her active hoping that the tired plus activity would mean she\u2019d fall into a really solid sleep that night. Nope. Same new pattern of barking constantly, for hours.\n\nI check the first time she barks for more than 7 to make sure she doesn\u2019t need a second potty, but she never has. I don\u2019t want to create a pattern where she\u2019s got a way to interact? Leave her crate? I\u2019m not sure by barking for 8 minutes now so I let her bark for longer. \n\nLast night when she started barking I went into the room, left the lights off, opened her crate door, and sat still on the sofa to see if she would show me what she wanted. Maybe there was a toy stuck somewhere she wanted or I had dropped a treat and she wanted to go get it. Nope. She can be a bit Velcro so maybe she wanted contact or attention - though maybe she\u2019d try and interact with me or curl up to sleep on my lap. Nope. She calmly stepped out of her crate, hopped onto the ottoman, laid down and went to sleep. Thought maybe that meant that there was something with the crate or her bedding after all. Took it apart, cleaned it, but left the memory foam mat out - it can get warm and I thought maybe she was overheating and getting uncomfortable because of that. Didn\u2019t seem to make any difference.\n\nTonight the usual \u201cpotty cookie crate\u201d routine with still no hesitation on her part. I left the mat out of her crate thinking maybe a starting fresh night without it would give her a better chance if it was temperature related. (She doesn\u2019t like the mat in summer). After 7 minutes of barking I took her potty - no go. Shortly after the barking started again. \n\nI feel like I have to be missing something obvious. She doesn\u2019t seem to have a problem with the crate or being alone or sleeping or drinking enough water/passing urine or exercise/activity, and I\u2019m worried that if I start to address the wrong cause that I not only won\u2019t fix what\u2019s upsetting her but create an issue surrounding something we\u2019ve never had an issue with.\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate a second pair of eyes and to hear if anyone\u2019s seeing something I\u2019m missing or not piecing together. Thanks \ud83d\udc9b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                    "body": "Dog got the all clear from the vet - no issues found.\n\nWe\u2019re in the middle of a deep freeze so the walks have been shorter than usual - we go in when she asks to be picked up (does this when she\u2019s cold) or leads us back to the house. We play more games inside on cold days - she loves fetch with her ball or squeaky toy and can do that for 20 minutes at a time a couple times a day, play hide and seek - hide her toys and ask her to find them, obedience training 5 min at a time a couple times a day. A couple times a week we do a puzzle.\n\nShe has access to a couple different chews and I\u2019ve made her favourite available these last few days. \n\nI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s separation anxiety because it\u2019s so limited and such a sudden onset. I found the articles about frustration interesting and I\u2019ll refer back to them for sure, but I\u2019m not sure if frustration is the problem that she\u2019s trying to communicate to me or if she\u2019s frustrated because I\u2019m not getting what she\u2019s trying to communicate. We do a lot of activities that have a delay between action and reward, or that it takes more than one step to get a reward. I change up the rewards so that sometimes they\u2019re a cookie, sometimes a pet/scratch, sometimes a toy, sometimes a verbal good girl - not always high value rewards, and she doesn\u2019t seem to get frustrated by those activities.\n\nShe has never just barked - with the exception of being offered the chance to go potty, she was never given attention for barking. If she wants my attention she will make a half bark/half huff chewing sort of sound and then wait for you to look at her. She obviously wants my attention and is barking to get it, but I\u2019m missing what\u2019s triggering it for her.",
