    "selftext": "Hi everyone, basically we are moving back to the family house in the mountains and it has so many open points of entry and exit and I would like recommendations for GPS trackers for our dog in case she goes wandering in the area (will be worn all day long). \nThe area has cellular coverage. Also maybe recommendation with fencing options. ",
