    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nWe have an approximately 5 year old staffy/pitbull mix. We rescued her back in August. When we first met she lunged at us but after an hour she warmed up and now she is our baby. She cuddles us, and is so super sweet. Shes incredibly smart and seems very trainable. We had an in home trainer for 4 visits help us with basic commands (sit, stay, walking on the leash, etc.) and it went very well. \n\nShe definitely is very attached to my wife and I and isn\u2019t great meeting other people.  When anybody comes into our house, she tenses up and barks a lot. If we don\u2019t have her leashed, she will lunge at them aggressively. We\u2019ve used a muzzle so she hasn\u2019t bit anyone. \n\nObviously we want to work her through this. When the trainer was here once, she ended up cuddling up with one of the visitors. But we can\u2019t seem to get her used to anybody else. \n\nWe have an amazing dog sitter we want to use when we travel, we want her to spend time with our nephew who loves dogs, etc. \n\nWe have a consult with a local training facility who claims they can board her for 3-4 weeks and deal with her fear but I\u2019ve never done anything like this before. \n\nAll advice and input is appreciated. This dog is an angel and I want her to love others and feel safe around them the way she is with me and my wife!\n\nEdit: We think she was stray for a long time and probably been abandoned so that might be part of her fear but we have so little info on her background.
