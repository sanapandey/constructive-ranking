    "selftext": "Gator is extremely smart and picks up on tricks really fast. I taught him all his tricks the first month we had him. (Been slacking on it lately.)\n\nBut he is NOT understanding Take/Hold. He immediately spits whatever I give him out after grabbing it, if it isn't able to be chewed. Otherwise, he chews it, LOL.     \n\nI can't figure out how to build duration and teach him that I am not asking he chews it. I think he thinks I want him to chew it.\n\nThis is a huge hurdle to get him to do other things I want to teach him to do. (i.e. Like picking something up after my mom drops it or bringing a towel when someone asks.)",

I tried to find another posting like it, but a lot of them are about chewing, and people say to get something they can't chew... Which Gator immediately goes, \"Ew, I can't chew this! It's metal! And even if I try to hold his mouth gently for a second, he doesn't get it and just tried to spit it out. \ud83d\ude05      \n\nThe concept is just not clicking with him.",

Try to transition to \u201chold\u201d being done on his own without you holding it. Something shaped like a paper towel tube would work well, because you could keep your hand near it and let go/grab on and off as needed. \n\nI taught my pup \u201cbeg\u201d this way, he started sitting on his butt all cute-like but would always hold my hand with two paws for support. Had to teach him to hold the position, then transitioned to pulling my hand away/only letting him hold with one paw while he figured out the balance/what I was wanting him to do.",
