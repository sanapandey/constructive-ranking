    "selftext": "When Otto was 5 months he was fine being alone for about 3 hours, no matter the time of day. Thanks to a lot of training with leaving him alone for longer and longer periods of time.\n\nAt 8 months he suddenly wasn't at all anymore. So we started the training all over again. 5 minutes alone, 10 minutes and so on.\n\nNow, at 1 year and 3 months, 85 % of the time he's fine home alone for 3-4 hours if we first go for a long walk in the early morning, then leave him alone downstairs for about an hour and then leave the house. But if we do the same ritual any other time of the day that's not the morning, it doesn't work at all. He howls, barks, paces, ...\n\nWe don't know what to do anymore. We feel like we've tried everything: training of couse, lick mat, crate, thundershirt, calming music, boring arrivals, silent departures, closing the blinds, ... And sometimes he's totally fine alone so I'm at my wits end. Help?!",

We follow the exact same ritual every time. But it just not being morning seems to be a trigger by itself. Although mornings don't work 100 % of the time either.\n* **Control and manage exposure to the triggers with desensitization.**\u00a0\\--> Have tried this a bit but could do more. Although again: sometimes he is fine with us leaving so the triggers apparently don't always trigger him.\n* **Fake 'em out.**\u00a0\\--> Done\n* **Do not leave food or chews for the dog**. --> We don't anymore\n* A behaviourist may also suggest an appeasement pheromone or an anti-anxiety wrap in cases where there's no risk of harm to the dog. Early intervention is important. --> Doesn't work",

Sometimes they feel like they are protecting and guarding the house and if you\u2019re in a busy area, there\u2019s always something to defend against. Crates or at least confining the area sometimes help reduce their stress because they don\u2019t have such a big area to guard. Not sure of the breed of the dog but this is sometimes hard wired so draining energy and limiting space is a good tactic to see if it helps",

Like if possible just walk out the door without even putting on your shoes, turn back after closing it after a couple of seconds, and go back in preferably before the panic. Then eventually he would learn sometimes you guys leave without the usual ritual but you'll be back before it's scary\n\nI'd also contact a positive reinforcement trainer",
