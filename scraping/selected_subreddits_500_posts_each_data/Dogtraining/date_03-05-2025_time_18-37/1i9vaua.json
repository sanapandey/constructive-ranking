    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nour 8 year old labrador (9 this year) got diagnosed with sciatica on Tuesday, she didnt go on her usual walks a week before hand (thought it was just her anxiety) but would go on quick ones with my mam.\n\nNow she wont even leave the house for a walk, i give her a soft tug on her lead and she\u2019ll follow me to the grass outside the gate but immediately pulls home.\n\nShe\u2019s on arthrocam and it seems to be working (has been lying on her back and isnt pacing anymore) aswell as anxiety medication.\n\nWhat can i do to help her get out again?\n\nthanks :)",

            "body": "From the About/Wiki page here:\n\n> A slip lead is a lead that runs through a ring, creating a loop that can be placed over a dog\u2019s head for a single collar/lead combo. **It is NOT advisable to use a slip lead, as it has unlimited tightening and can hurt your dog, and its asymmetrical nature means that it will not easily release when held in some orientations.** The advantages of a slip are that, in an emergency, they are compatible with dogs of any size, stoppers can be applied that will prevent tightening too far, and that any regular leash can be converted into a slip lead by using the handle end as the \u201cring\u201d to create the loop. It can easily be \u2018slipped\u2019 on your dog if your collar breaks, or if you find a stray dog you don\u2019t need the exact collar size in order to lead it around. Knowing how to convert your leash into a slip lead is useful, as long as you are aware of **the damage it can cause both to your dog\u2019s neck and to the dog\u2019s relationship with you if it tightens.**",
