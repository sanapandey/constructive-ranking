    "selftext": "So I have a 14 week old female Golden Retriever.  She is very energetic and strong for her age.  I have her on a small flat collar and a skinny leash.  I find her to be very difficult to control in terms of pulling on the leash, almost to the point of making me fall.  My balance has gotten worse as I have aged, and I do plan on getting a trainer soon.  Does anyone here have a good suggestion for a collar and leash?  I do not want an e-collar or prong collar as I do not believe in those methods.  Thank you very much!",

You cannot simply slap one on a dog and start walking with it immediately. It's important to include this information directly alongside any head halter recommendations instead of assuming people will realise it on their own without prompting.   \r\n\r\n(Unless you typoed and meant to refer to a body harness rather than a halter?)",
