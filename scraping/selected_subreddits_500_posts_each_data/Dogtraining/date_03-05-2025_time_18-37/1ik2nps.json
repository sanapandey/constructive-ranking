    "selftext": "Hoping for advice on how to teach a submissive dog how to engage in play. \n\nMy dog (beagle terrier, 20lb, 2F, rescue) loves humans, physical touch, treats. She is the most submissive, loving, trusting, nonreactive dog I have ever met. \n\nWe introduced her to kitties last night, and it went really well, no aggression or distress. \n\nBut the baby kitty wants to play with her SO bad. Pup lets kitty sniff, paw her. I can\u2019t gauge anything close to a reaction. \n\nBaby kitty follows us around and even wanted to sleep in our bed. Again this all seems almost invisible to my dog. \n\nPup never really learned to socialize, I take her to play group a lot and she likes to sniff and greet all the dogs, but stays close to the humans. She will chase her own ball, but if other dogs want the ball she gives up immediately. She never wants to leave so I guess she likes to watch the action. Other dogs ask her to play and she usually just stands there.\n\n She does seem to like massive calm dogs (big handsome bois), and small <15 lb dogs, and occasionally plays with them. But she always initiates and rarely accepts invitations. \n\nKitty seems like a good size/temperament for a playmate and I was wondering if there are any tips on bringing out my dog\u2019s playful side?",
