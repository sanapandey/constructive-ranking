We thought it might be interesting to train some actually useful skill, like warning us about dirty toddler diapers. \n\nHow would you go about training doodle to identify dirty (poop) diapers? He responds best to food motivation ",

            "body": "In order to train something a little more complex like this, you always start with having a very clear picture in your mind of what the final behaviour is expected to look like. Imagine you\u2019re a zoo keeper and you need to write down the training goals for someone on the next shift to train to the zoo animal when you\u2019re not gonna talk to them in person and you can\u2019t make any assumptions about what they will successfully guess in your intent.\n\nWhat is the environmental cue you are planning on teaching here? Is it any dampness of diapers, whether water or urine or poop or other? Is it specific to poop only? At what distance will you expect the dog to notice this in the end? What reaction do you expect the dog to give, that you will clearly be able to differentiate between him trying to communicate \u201chey I noticed a poopy diaper!\u201d Vs any of the other things he might want to communicate to you?\n\nOnce you have the details of what you want sufficiently outlined, it will be vastly easier to create a training plan that guides towards that.",
