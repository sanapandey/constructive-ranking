    "selftext": "Hi all! I have a 10-month goldendoodle. He is SO GOOD at letting us know when he has to go downstairs by tapping at the door. Our real issue is if we are upstairs, he does not have that way of telling us. I have purchased and tried to use the button method with him, but he isn't interested in it at all. It doesn't seem to matter the treat or reinforcer, he is not interested in it or a bell.",
