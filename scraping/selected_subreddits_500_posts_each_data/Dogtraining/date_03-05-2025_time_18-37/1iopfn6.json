    "selftext": "My 4 year old lab/pointer/pit mix is a rescue who we adopted when he was a little under a year. He\u2019s sweet and has great instincts, has learned many commands and tricks easily, loves people, and is very gentle with kids (we have two). However, he is a beefy guy with a pitbull\u2019s body paired with an extremely excited personality. When people come over, he is so wiggly and wants to lick everyone everywhere. Most of the time he doesn\u2019t jump, but every now and again it seems like he can\u2019t contain his excitement. At 60 pounds, his approaching people with such excitement can be overwhelming. We\u2019ve tried a lot of different training tactics like four on the floor, having guests ignore him until he sits, having him in a separate room when guests come over, having him on leash, and just about everything else you can think of to tone down his excitement upon meeting people.\n\nWe can\u2019t really afford a professional trainer right now, so kind words and advice would be helpful. I feel like I\u2019ve tried everything short of a pro trainer, but maybe I\u2019m missing something.",

At that point you could release him, while telling guests to continue to ignore him for a bit. If he gets overexcited when being released, I'd put him back on his place and perhaps he just doesn't get to interact with any guests while they're there.",
