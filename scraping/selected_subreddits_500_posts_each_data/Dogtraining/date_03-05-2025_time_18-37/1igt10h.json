    "selftext": "I 24f live with my parents 61f and 67m and my two children 4f and almost 1 year old. I moved back in may last year after a bad relationship and trying to pick up the pieces. Anyways, the dogs only pee and poop on my children\u2019s stuff and if there is nothing on the floor but something on the couch they will go on their stuff on the couch. They have peed on my bed when there is absolutely nothing for them to go on of the kids or they  will go on the legs of the baby\u2019s high chair and when she has a walker they\u2019d go on that. They are not my dogs, they are my parents and my parents have resorted to keeping them in their room with their sliding glass door open. They are chiweenies and 3 of them are 7 years old the other one is the mom and mom is a chihuahua and 9 years old. They don\u2019t go on my parents stuff or in their room at all. They did this before we lived here and would come to visit. Is there any hope for them?",
