    "selftext": "As background, my dog is a small chihuahua/terrier mix from a 60 dog hoarding situation. Given his background, he's made enormous strides and is basically happy and well-adjusted most of the time. This is one of the few remaining problems we're trying to work through.\n\nIf I drive to a walking path, my dog is always fine on the paths (note this wasn't always the case - he used to be terrified, but he's now a great walking companion with just a tiny bit of remaining stress like a little more panting then usual). And, if I take him out to go potty from my house, he's also fine.\n\nThe problem is if I want to go on a real walk starting from my house. We back onto a great walking path, so this is something I often want to do. He normally starts out fine and then, after a little bit (5 or 10 minutes out) he decides he wants to go home. Once he's made this decision, he really cannot be nudged out of it. He is either going back home or he is going to stand where he is. The path behind our house is no different from any other walking path we go on - sometimes it's crowded, sometimes it's empty. It makes no difference.\n\nOn our longer walks away from my house, I am always with my husband, whereas I'm mostly walking him alone near my house. But, even if I take my husband, Scamp turns around 70% of the time.\n\nI really don't know what kind of problem I'm facing. Is this a leash training issue? Is it a reactivity issue? Or is it just a weird hoarding dog artifact.\n\nAny advice welcome.\n\n(I should note that he does not show obvious stress signs when walking near the house, as we see at low levels on other longer walks. He's not panting, drooling, licking his lips, etc. However, he is far more alert to sounds, etc near the house, like someone rolling a garbage can or a car going by. He does not seem to be tuned into the environment in the same way on walks away from the house.)",

A combination of that and just basic socialization work has made him much much better in most walking situations, I'm not convinced, though, that the remaining issue is reactivity, but I don't really know what it is and I don't know how to address it.\n\nOne way we dealt with his (fear? reactivity?) in the past is that I never forced him to go further then he was comfortable. He's greatly expanded his comfort level everywhere but right around my house, so now I wonder if making him feel as if he was completely in charge of the walk was a mistake.",
