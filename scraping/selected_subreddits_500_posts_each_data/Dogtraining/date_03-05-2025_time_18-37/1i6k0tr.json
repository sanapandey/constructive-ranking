    "selftext": "Hello - I am training my dogs to use a Carpet Mill and need to find a harness that will work well with it.\n\nDoes anyone in this group have experience using a Carpet/Slat mill and have harness recommendations? \n\nThe harnesses I have for them are \"no-pull\" so designed to discourage pulling and I need to find a harness that is designed for the opposite (or at least is comfortable and doesn't discourage pulling) since the mill works based on the pressure of the dog being held back and trying to push against forward against it.\n\nOn the Grand Carpet Mill site there is one they sell but that seems like overkill for my needs -- looking for something perhaps similar but less expensive and easier to put on/off them (bonus if it's easily/quickly adjusted so I don't need two different ones for my two different dogs). \n\nThanks for any recommendations!",

I am seeking harness suggestions specific to Carpet Mill training -- which are not the same you'd use for traditional leash walking as suggested in your equipment wiki (\u00a0If you want a harness with optimal comfort for your dog check out designs like the\u00a0[TTouch](https://www.xtradog.training/product/ttouch-harness/),\u00a0[Mekuti](https://mekuti.co.uk/harness_shop.htm),\u00a0[Haqihana](https://performancedog.co.uk/product-category/for-your-dog/haqihana-harnesses-and-leads/), or any one of the RuffWear harnesses. These are by no means the 'go to' harnesses, but this is the design that is favourite from a comfort perspective for your dog.) ... and there is nothing that I can see about Carpet Mills in your equipment topics link...",
