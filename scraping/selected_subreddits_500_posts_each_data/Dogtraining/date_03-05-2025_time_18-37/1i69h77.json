    "selftext": "I have an Aussie shepherd puppy currently 2.5 months old. He seems to always want to bite legs and hands no matter how many treats we toss or try to give him or toys that we may literally put in his snout to divert his attention to it without avail. He is usually fine but as soon as crazy hour hits which is between 9-11pm he would into a hype mode and lunge at you or any body part that he can get a hold of to bite! \nIs there anything that we could do? I heard the velociraptor stage starts from 3 months old but for mine feels like he already started it. We can't take him out yet as he isn't fully vaccinated yet ",

            "body": "The biting and lunging during those late-night zoomies is totally normal, especially for an energetic and intelligent breed like yours. At this age, puppies are still figuring out how to control their impulses, and when they get overtired or overstimulated, they often express it by biting and going into \"hype mode.\" One thing that might help is to focus on calm, mentally stimulating activities like puzzle toys, sniffing games, or even licking mats before the zoomies hit. This can help tire his brain out without overstimulating him physically.\n\nIt\u2019s also super important to make sure he\u2019s getting enough rest. Puppies need a surprising amount of sleep\u2014around 18 to 20 hours a day! Sometimes when they don\u2019t nap enough, they get wild in the evenings because they\u2019re overtired. You could try enforced naps in his crate or a quiet space throughout the day to help him recharge.\n\nFor those crazy moments, structured play like tug or fetch can give him an outlet, but keep it short and end the game before he gets too worked up. If he gets too hyped and can\u2019t redirect to a toy, giving him a safe space to decompress (like a crate with a calming chew) might be helpful. You\u2019re also right about the vaccination concerns, but you can still give him mental enrichment through exposure to new sights and sounds by carrying him to safe, low-risk areas or letting him watch the world from a stroller or your arms.",
