    "selftext": "I just recently adopted my GSD, shes about 2yrs but REFUSES to pee or poop on leash. I have been taking her on leash for the past two days waiting for her to go so that I can mark it and hopefully get it on a command but she refuses even though she clearly needs to go (once we get inside she wants to go back out) Im moving to a condo soon and theres no yard and a no long leash rule so im trying to get her prepared for that now, so far shes peed once on the carpet inside which i know she does only if she really cant hold it. I havent gotten her in trouble for peeing or pooping in a certain spot before but maybe previous did? Im assuming it may just be previous trauma carrying over in why shes not comfortable around me. \nShe does have reactivity and anxiety and will be going on fluoxetine in a couple days and was also curious if anyone has experience with this specific situations and if fluoxetine helped?\nI dont know where to go from here, we\u2019re moving in a few days and I didnt realize this was an issue with her until recently.
