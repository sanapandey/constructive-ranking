    "selftext": "Hi, I am having a bit of a conundrum with my dog. He technically belongs to my parents but we all live under the same roof currently.\n\nThe dog growls a lot, mostly just chatter and it is non-aggressive. But sometimes... His heckles do raise at me and he growls at me. I love him, I haven't had any problems with him otherwise. This is always around my mom. He makes a lot of non-aggressive noise when my parents hug, or if I hug/touch my mom.\n\nToday is the first day he's actually made me feel anxious. My mother just had dental surgery and she's been sleeping in her bed with the dog. After 2 hours, I went to check on her and he immediately started growling at me when I entered the room. His heckles went up but his tail was wagging only a little the further I went into the room. He got into my face when I approached the bed and growled more but his lip didn't curl or show me teeth. He was standing over my mom (literally) and started to wag his tail but his heckles were still raised and he was still growling at me.\n\nMy first thought was maybe he is resource guarding my mother instead of a toy/food/etc. I'm not an expert so I don't know if that's what it is. When the 3 of us (and the dog) sit on the couch, he is totally calm and he leans on me with his whole body and he often times will literally get into my face to lick me or just look at me. He is always wagging his tail when this happens and he gets super happy and excited when I laugh (Idk why me specifically but he literally jumps like 3 ft in the air and wiggles when I really get laughing).\n\nI'm often the one who \"disciplines\" the dog (telling him to go lay down in his bed when he's begging, basically trying to correct bad behaviour, etc) and maybe that contributes to it? I legitimately have no clues as to why he is this way towards me. Please help!!!",

I have also been present at his most recent vet appointments and they all seem to tell me he's got no issues and is healthy. He has never guarded an item, just my mom, which makes the training different and a bit more difficult.",

Dogs wag their tails for a variety of reasons, most often because they are happy, but it can also be an indicator of anxiety or aggression.",

My own dog does it with me when any new person is in my house until he gets used to them, and he does it if I'm unwell and in bed. I tell everyone who wants to approach me to immediately back off if he is growling, become happy and cheerful, pay attention to him, and throw a treat elsewhere so he leaves me alone. If he is still growling, then I ask them to leave us both alone, but we will keep trying. If my dog still continues then I leave wherever me and my dog are both together. \n\nMy own partner (new at the time) got bitten by my dog for not listening to me or listening to my dog growling as a sign to back off.

Raise hackles is frequently associated only with aggression, but you can watch two dogs who are engaged in friendly play also have raised hackles.   \n\nBased on your description this was definitely a warning.   Anytime a tail is high and stiff and wagging like a metronome, combined with other signs like the growling and raised hackles, it's a \"back off or else\".  You might have also noticed the dog's ears were placed different  than when it's relaxed and calm. The body was probably stiff and the mouth closed.  \n\nDogs express a ton of information via body language.  https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/advice/how-to-read-dog-body-language/",
