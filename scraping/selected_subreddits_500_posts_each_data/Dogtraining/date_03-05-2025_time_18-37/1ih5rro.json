    "selftext": "My dog is 8 years old. I\u2019m a 21 year old woman so the fact that hes around 40kg and string is a problem. we\u2019ve had him since he was 1 and he\u2019s never been the best on the lead. He wasn\u2019t trained from young and it seems like he just really doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s doing wrong. Sometimes he just catches a smell and yanks me in a random direction. It\u2019s gotten to a breaking point today where he yanked me so hard I\u2019ve fallen over and bruised and cut up both of my knees. I\u2019ve heard of the saying you can\u2019t teach an old dog new tricks but I\u2019m really hoping someone has some advice. We\u2019ve had him using a nose harness where the lead connects to the front of his collar and pulls his face if he tries to pull us but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working any. I\u2019ve also tried stopping when he pulls and waiting for him to turn his attention back to me but him being so strong it isn\u2019t working as I have no choice but to be pulled by him or let the lead go. I was looking into a full body harness but not sure if that would help any. Somebody please help \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb",

            "body": "Safety harness with multiple clip options, one of them at the front of the chest. (Believe me, it's a game changer). \n\nThe chest one is your main hero. Due to the position of the leash in front of his body, he won't be able to pull with as much force as when the leash follows a straight line off of his body. \nA second lead or lead end attached on his back just for safety, one hand on both at all times, and when he gets pulley, the chest one can be used to redirect the force he puts in. Just walk away in a right angle, with the chest point being the one that holds the connection, the back point just being a backup. He'll have a much harder time pulling backwards/sideways than forwards. (this is also why it has to be a safety harness that he can't slip out of, so look for ones that strap not only around the chest but also near the waist/end of the ribcage. choose one with padding and good pressure distribution, and adjust it to his body well). \n\nI sometimes use one lead to attach to both ends, placing it across my back for some added counterweight (never wrap it, or let it cross in any way where it can tighten around you). Make sure to have a steady stand whenever you stop, balance is much more relevant to not fall than strength is, and I've seen strong guys get toppled by not so strong dogs just because their stance was off.\n\nAlso, if he has triggers that he especially pulls to, don't be afraid to hold on / place the leash in a leverageable way around a tree, lamp post, or anything else that is more sturdy than a standing human would be. In the winter, wear proper shoes so you don't slip.\n\nSet timers for walks instead of routes, and on days where you don't feel up for working through the pulling, take a second person, bring him out to potty and then play games inside.  \n\nThat's all for safety. For comfort, try finding something that motivates your dog, be it food, a toy or your attention. And make walking next to you the most fun thing. Start small, and breathe. Walk in slopes when he is a runner, repetitive movement patterns sometimes calm nerves. Also actively allow him to sniff when you know it can't be helped. Maybe go somewhere with a long lead, see if there is a radius where he will naturally check in with you, let him sniff, but reward any check ins with you. Sometimes, after sniffing everything, the dog will suddenly offer a nice close walk. And then you make a freaking party of it. \n\nBreaking patterns may also help. If he rushes out the door as soon as the collar goes on, put it on without going outside. Get both of you ready, then go back to what you were doing before for a while. Scatter food while you get ready, sit with him and throw food/toy/etc in the hallway/driveway/wherever you notice him getting into an \"outside is near, must run!!\" Modus. Make these places not a precursor to exciting outdoors, but exciting themselves. This is a thing that takes weeks, months and more - but some day, you'll have walked around the block without him going into racemode/tunnel vision.\n\nGood luck, and any dog can be taught new tricks - it just takes a while sometimes. And if you feel too overwhelmed, consider having a session or two with a trainer to get an outside live view.",

Instead of just stopping. \n\nThe walking to heel training I found to be slightly different, has to be done alongside though I would teach heel first in a low distraction space- a verbal command to walk to heel then *continuous* rewards (like a good boy and a treat every 5 steps) when he does this. Repeat the command and reward continuously until you can spread it out between treats and just use a verbal reward. That\u2019s normally a good starting point. \n\nMy dog was 3 when we rescued him and it maybe took 2 months to be consistent but he\u2019d never been on a lead before as far as we knew\u2026",

It\u2019s very much like putting a bridle on a horse, it gives you control of their head and makes it a lot harder for them to pull with any force. I\u2019m pregnant and my husband is deployed. I cannot afford a fall right now and my dog is 95lbs of draft dog. The gentle leader is the safest option available. As mentioned above teaching your dog to walk on a loose lead or in the heel position is super important I\u2019ve just found it to be much more manageable with a gentle leader.",

From a book called control unleashed but there should be videos on youtube\n\n-and recommend looking into the \"circle method' for loose leash walking. It's based on lunging horses so should work for big dogs. \n\n-when he can focus on you a little bit on walks, you can start using the sniffs as a reward for gentle walking. Good luck and stay safe and if it's unsafe for you to walk him atm then there are ways to exercise him indoors for now! Happy to help more",

I'm assuming you're using a standard leash, which is about 6 ft long. The shorter the leash, the more a dog will pull. Simply because they have less space and they do tend to move faster and more sporadically than us. A longer leash allows them to move around a bit more without adding tension which would essentially be pulling. I only ever use a long line when walking my dog and it has definitely helped reduce the pulling.",

Didn't personally learned this leason with whiplash, but with a 15 foot friction burn. But I'll say it again-- 10/10 used a super long leash at the park for the whole first year I took my puppy to frolic about.",

So you haven't actually started training yet. There is so much training advice out there but don't worry yet about that, it's one step at a time.\n\nYour first step is understanding that you CAN train this dog and need to make the commitment to begin the journey.\n\nThe second step is finding a decent harness and leash set up so that you are in total control of the dog before you start the training.\n\nAfter that, think about one single thing that you want to correct more than anything else.

It doesn't have to be abuse or hurt to be punishment, it simply is something that reduces a behavior. \n\nSo, I'm assuming good faith here, so I'm providing knowledge. \n\nIn learning theory there's things that increase a behavior (reinforcement) and things that reduce a behavior (punishment). Reinforcement and punishment come in additive and subtractive, or positive and negative but due to the fact some people attach good/bad to their positive/negative I'm going to use mathematical terms. \n\nSubtractive punishment exists where you remove (hence, subtractive) something to decrease a behavior. For instance, time out, removing yourself when a puppy bites.\n\nAdditive punishment is where you add something to reduce a behavior, such as a leash pop to lessen a dog's pulling behavior. What is added here is what we call an aversive, which is something the dog will take steps to avoid. \n\nAdditive reinforcement, or positive reinforcement, is adding something to increase a behavior. A treat, pets, etc for correct behavior would fit in here. \n\nSubtractive reinforcement, removing something to increase a behavior. Aversive use is added here too, this would be the pressure/release training where you pull up on the lead until the dog sits. \n\nUnfortunately, people have baggage on the word punishment, so trainers and society alike have changed the word from \"punishment\" to \"correction\" to make people less sensitive about it. Correction is not a scientific term in behavior science. Punishment is. \n\nWe disallow negative reinforcement and positive punishment here due to scientific consensus that aversion can be avoided and it's best to because of the harm it can provide. I can go into that as well if you require. \n\nFeel free to fact check me here.",
