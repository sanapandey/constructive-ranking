    "selftext": "I have a cockapoo he\u2019s 1 year 5 months. He resource guards me to other dogs, if we go to family\u2019s house with other dogs he will go to bite them if they come near me.\nHe goes to daycare and is very well behaved there, it\u2019s only around me. \n\nI\u2019m nervous now he\u2019ll always be like this he doesn\u2019t resource guard food/toys. I don\u2019t have kids yet but I\u2019m worried when I do he\u2019ll be vicious to sharing me with them, and it would break my heart to not have him with me. \n\nAny advice on how to combat this would be so appreciated. Thanks ",
