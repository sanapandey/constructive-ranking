    "selftext": "Hi! So recently we\u2019ve adopted a 6 month old lab. Overall he\u2019s great, learns commands quickly, easy to run energy out of, not too destructive, but we\u2019ve had issues with him peeing when he\u2019s too scared or too excited.\n\nNow I know it\u2019s common in puppies who may not have complete control of their bladders, but he doesn\u2019t have any issues holding it, he can go the full night without any problems. He also knows that backyard time means restroom time and sees frequent trips out side throughout the day. So it\u2019s definitely due to something else. We have already been trying to build his confidence through training and frequent days out where he gets to interact with lots of other dogs. But it seems that the problem is getting worse rather than better.\n\nWe know from the shelter that his previous owner said he had been in a \u201cdog fight\u201d. He has a gash on his neck from it. We are calling bullcrap on that because he has no issues with other dogs. He\u2019ll always submit to them but never pees, he just wants to love on them and play. Now humans are a different story, if you raise your voice too much, get him too worked up, come up to him too fast, he pees. So we think his old owner might have been abusive or even just too rough with him. It\u2019s horrible I know, we are so happy to that he gets to be in a loving home from now on.\n\nIf anybody has any ideas it would be greatly appreciated. It\u2019s not too hard to clean up or anything as we have full hard wood so we\u2019re not really upset with him at all and are more worried about him.",

I also found resources for working with a scared dog. I need more help on when. Those exercises are not working and it feels like this behavior is almost subconscious.",
