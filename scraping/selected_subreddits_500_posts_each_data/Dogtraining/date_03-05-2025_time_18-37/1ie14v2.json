    "selftext": "We adopted a 1yr old mini poodle who has been with us for almost four months now and we are still struggling with housetraining.\n\nHere\u2019s all we\u2019ve done:\n- he goes out the second he wakes up, 15mins after each meal, every 2 hours, and right before bed \n- we have high value treats he only gets for going outside\n- we use trigger words and praise him A LOT when he goes outside\n- we work from home so inside he\u2019s always been supervised and contained to the main living room \n- when he\u2019s had accidents we clean the area thoroughly and sternly tell him he should not go inside but we\u2019re careful to not scare him\n-we keep a bell by the door that we ring right before leaving and we always mark it with the word outside but he\u2019s ignored it exists so far\n- we\u2019re in a high rise apartment so we\u2019ve been carrying him when we\u2019re in the hallways/waiting for the elevator because we want him to learn outside means outside the building not just our apartment (he unfortunately had an elevator and a hallway accident before) \n\nHe is still having accidents inside, often carelessly peeing right in front of us and what\u2019s been hard is that he gives us little to no warning. Sometimes we catch him circling around but other times he\u2019s chilling and just gets up and pees. If we catch him in the act he doesn\u2019t react to being told stop, no, or even being startled with a sound. We even pick him up and he will continue peeing while being held by us, he truly doesn\u2019t care. We have no idea what else to do and we\u2019re starting to feel frustrated because he has had accidents when being invited to our friends and family homes so they can meet him and it\u2019s just not ideal for him to do that \n\nHe came to us pad trained so we did have his pads inside the first few weeks he was here but we have since removed them because we don\u2019t want the pads to be his preferred option forever, so now I wonder if perhaps that was a mistake? I kind of preferred him using the pads because now he just pees wherever he wants when he does have an inside accident and with the pads at least he\u2019d mostly go there \n\nWould love advice if anyone\u2019s had the same struggle with an adopted dog, unfortunately we know very little about his background as a young puppy so it\u2019s hard for us to know why he\u2019s been so resistant to learning all this and we have no idea what else to incorporate to help him learn this.\n\nHere\u2019s all we\u2019ve done:\nbeen hard is that he gives us little to no warning. Sometimes we catch him circling around but other times he\u2019s chilling and just gets up and p",
