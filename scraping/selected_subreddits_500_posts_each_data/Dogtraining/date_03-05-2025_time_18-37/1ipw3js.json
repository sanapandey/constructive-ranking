    "selftext": "I have 2 dogs. \n1 - Link, almost 8 years old, pomeranian, neutered male, had him since 10 weeks old\n2 - Charlie, almost 1.5 years old, pomeranian, neutered male, we've had him a little over 1 month. \n\nWhen Charlie first got here, things did not go well. Link was very upset about having a new dog in the house so they were completely separated about 90% of the time due to fighting. After a couple weeks, they started playing, going on walks together, hanging out peacefully and Link stopped guarding areas around the house and such. \n\nBut recently, we started dealing with bad behaviors with Charlie and I'm unsure how to handle it. \nCharlie has become very attached to me. I work from home so I'm with the dogs almost all day.\n\nWhen Charlie's on the couch or bed with me and he sees Link, he'll snarl and/or will jump up and initiate a fight. The weird thing is that I can have both dogs on the couch or bed with me peacefully (usually Link was in the space first). Charlie will know that Link is there, but after awhile, Charlie will start growling anyway. When this happens, I always get up and make Charlie leave the area. Afterward, he usually tries to initiate play with Link.\n\nCharlie will do the same with my husband\ntoo, but he works a lot so not as many instances have happened. \n\nNow Charlie is no longer allowed on the couch and I'm working on crate training him for bed time.\n\nOh and also just tonight, Charlie was laying under a chair as I was working. He heard Link coming and got very aggressive toward him. He hasn't had an episode off of the couch or bed before BUT this was also a new space he was allowed in. Just before Link came, Charlie got scared by the printer making noise. \n\nAny recommendations on how to tackle this? I'd love to be able to hang out with both dogs on the couch safely and have both of them sleep safely in our bed. \n\nMost recommendations I've seen for dealing with this involves food...but unfortunately, the dogs are not always nice with each other when it comes to high value food. They've gotten significantly better but they're not 100% good yet. \n\nMaybe we need to work on the food problem first? If we can get them to safely take treats around each other, maybe that'll calm some of the anxiety Charlie seems to have?\n\nCharlie is a pretty skittish/easily startled dog. He will cower when I accidentally drop things or if we make loud noises with pans. He'll growl and bark in the middle of the night sometimes if he hears a noise.\nWe've never smacked him or yelled but if i make hand motions toward him, he'll cower. He used to scream when we would walk toward the car to get in but that's slowly getting better. He will not stop barking when people come over. Maybe there's a lot of fear that needs to be worked out... Who knows how he was treated before we got him. \n\nHe hasn't displayed any aggression toward people, just Link. But I also haven't tried touching him when he gets mean because i don't want to find out how he'd react!\n\nI'm open to any suggestions! Thanks for reading!",
