    "selftext": "Hi all,\nWe acquired a 11 week old puppy a week ago (he is now 12 weeks old). \nWe have been extremely litigious getting him outside often to go to the bathroom at the park across from our apartment. Overall, our little guy has been really good! I have noticed however, he will go to the bathroom outside, something will get him super excited towards the end of his walk (another dog, cars going by, just overall excited to get home) and he\u2019ll come back into our condo sniff around for 2 secs and immediately pee before we have a chance to do anything about it. Do you have any suggestions to curb the excited puppy peeing inside? Thanks",

In the meantime, reward the pee EVERY SINGLE TIME. Our guy got a treat and a \u201cgood potty\u201d every time he went. By the time he was 16 weeks you could tell him to \u201cgo potty\u201d and he would pee and get a treat. It\u2019s all about the positive reinforcement. Good luck!",
