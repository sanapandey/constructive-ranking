    "selftext": "Hi everyone, I have a 9 month old large breed mixed puppy female that for the past couple of weeks has been jumping all over my girlfriend and biting her hands when she walks the puppy alone. The puppy is quite big at just over 50lbs.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried using treats and commands, making her sit with the leash by firmly raising the leash directly above her to calm the puppy down, and turning away but none of it seems to work. The puppy just ignores the treats and keeps jumping at my girlfriend or trying to bite the hand. She hasn\u2019t drawn blood yet but bites hard enough to turn the hand red and give bruises. \n\nWhat can we do to try to stop this? I\u2019m thinking of using a muzzle and training her with treats to desensitize the puppy to the muzzle for now but would like to be able to eventually have my girlfriend be able to walk the puppy without being jumped at and bitten. The walks are also kept relatively short, just a pee break in the middle of the day but the puppy always manages to jump and act out in these few minutes. However it never happens when I walk the puppy so I don\u2019t know how I can train the puppy to not do it.\n\nWe feel lost about how to approach this and it\u2019s affecting our lives. Please help!",
