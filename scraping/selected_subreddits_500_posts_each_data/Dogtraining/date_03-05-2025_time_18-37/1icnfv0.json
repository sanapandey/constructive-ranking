    "selftext": "Got a rescue in mid June. Long story short, he was the exact opposite of EVERYTHING they said about him. He was a whole mess. It was a tough few months when we got him home. I used to foster so I have experience with the \u201cquirks\u201d that come with rescues including separation anxiety but his was off the charts. Even if one person left THE ROOM and the other 2 people were still there he would SCREAM. He was also an absolute land shark despite being like 2.5. He bit the vet. Bit us. Broke the skin on each of us at least once or twice. Also the hardest dog I\u2019ve ever had in terms of potty training. \n\nAnyway, lots of work was needed. Starting with basic manners and just how to exist in life. He\u2019s doing MUCH better! The biting has been reduced to just during play and he learned about his \u201cbite strength\u201d so if he does use teeth it\u2019s gentle. Our only \u201caccidents\u201d in recent months have been when he\u2019s going for a toy and unintentionally gets the hand that\u2019s holding it with a tooth. FINALLY got him potty trained. No accidents at all in the past few months. We can leave the room now, too! \n\nI\u2019ve also been teaching \u201ctricks\u201d of sorts.\nHe picks up a lot of it quickly, but some things not at all (roll over is a no go). He does sit, lay, stay, leave it, dance, twirl, high five, and he will give you his paw if asked. \n\nNow the big issue is grooming. First place refused to let me stay with him which of course set him off immediately and he screamed the whole time. Big mess. I feel like they set him up for failure and I should have just said no and left. I get that a lot of pets/kids actually do better without the parent there but some just don\u2019t and they wouldn\u2019t listen. They blamed him, then me. Basically saying I wasn\u2019t training him well. Mind you, I already explained his past and this was only like 1.5 months after we got him so idk what they expected but whatever. I tried a new place and she was happy to let me stay. I tried to be present and helpful but also stay out of her way and he did MUCH better. No screaming at all. She was able to do the full groom. I helped keep him distracted with treats as needed. He did fight during the drying and the paws. A lot. Had to wrestle and hold him to keep him still enough for her to quickly do it. \n\nIt\u2019s his back paws that are the biggest issue. He certainly won\u2019t willingly give her his front paws like he does for his tricks but it\u2019s doable. He FLIPS OUT over the back ones. Nothing aggressive. Think like, trying to handle a rabbit that wants to escape your arms. So I figured I would start doing the \u201cgive me paw\u201d thing again at home but with the back paws instead of the front. So I started at square one just with laying my hand on them, not even holding it yet. He is NOT having it. He jumps around like a rabbit every time my hand goes towards the paw. Will not let me even touch it with a single finger. I\u2019m not sure how to adjust this to help him deal with it. Do I just keep trying what I\u2019m doing until he gives in or is there a better way to do it with the back feet compared to the front? ",

            "body": "I would work on progressing towards touching the paw. So basically break down the task into small tiny steps. Starting with just showing him your hand then offering a reward. As he gets more and more comfortable progress into just reaching towards the paw (not touching) then reward as he gets more comfortable with that then add in a reach and touch for a second and reward. Again as he gets more comfortable increase the time you leave the hand on the paw. Slowly increase and progress this into lifting the paw. \n\n\nI would do a similar concept with the tools you\u2019re utilizing. So show him the clippers, etc then reward, then work up to moving them closer to his paws as he gets more and more comfortable viewing them. \n\nAlways work at his pace! If he\u2019s showing discomfort immediately STOP the session and offer a few rewards. This is teaching him that he can trust you to stop when he tells you he needs to stop and will also help strengthen your relationship with him.",

He\u2019s clearly not ok with that. \n\nInstead, work on rear paw targeting. Get him to make the choice to hand you his foot. Do NOT start with anything remotely resembling paw-to-hand, or worse hand-to-paw. I\u2019d make very slow (think months) progress from a rear foot target like a platform, to you being beside him when he targets, to shrinking the target, to having your hand on the target, to eventually targeting your completely immobile and unresponsive hand. \n\nIn the meantime, just do your best to keep the nails under control, if that means walks on concrete or whatever that\u2019s better than setting him back into panic mode.",

            "body": "You might have to avoid grooming to manage this fear while you work on his comfort with basic husbandry, like contact with various parts of his body, including back paws, etc. I'm a big fan of target training, which works well on all animals when you want them to turn a certain way for access to something, but it works especially well with dogs, to turn them back and forth for brushing, giving paws for nail grooming, or wiping after being out in the mud, for example.\n\nStart with treating him every time he looks at you when you call his name. The progress to touching your hand with his snout - this is the most basic contact for dogs. Then you can start asking him for different paws, etc. Start with the front ones, that you said he's willing to share more comfortably. Once he understands a touch gets him a treat, see if he'll then give you a back paw. If he doesn't seem interested, you may either be moving too fast or need a higher-value treat.\n\nAlso, be sure to learn dog stress signals; they communicate a lot about their mood through subtle-to-humans body language, like lip-licks, yawns, ears drawn back, side-eye (a.k.a whale-eye - a dog will always turn its head toward something he wants to engage; looking sideways at something shows his discomfort, and more importantly, distrust with that thing), etc. Be sure to back off if you see any of these before it escalates to escape attempts or even snapping.\n\nAlso, if the undesirable behavior may be fear-based, counter-conditioning with treats might only be able to do so much before the dog starts to just change his behavior for the treats and revert when you stop. In more severe cases, the dog may develop an aversion to the treats, as he might accidentally learn they signal the thing he is afraid of.",
