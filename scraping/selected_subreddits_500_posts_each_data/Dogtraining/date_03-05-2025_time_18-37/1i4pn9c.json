    "selftext": "Hi, \nI am looking for advice from anyone who has been in this situation. \n\nBackground: We have a 4 year old male mini dachshund, and our daughter just turned 1. Our dog has always been the epitome of a lap dog to my husband and I, absolutely loves to cuddle with us. We initially had no doubts that he would warm up to our daughter, however he never really seemed interested in her and was downright wary of her as she began to crawl. There have been a few growling incidents that have made us become very vigilant with making sure it never went farther and have tried to give our dog more positive reinforcement when interacting with our daughter. Our daughter adores the dog and is always trying to bring his toys to him, but we always keep a close eye on their interactions because I\u2019ve always been afraid of exactly what happened today.\n\nI feel it\u2019s also worth noting our dog has displayed symptoms of anxiety around other dogs. Often wants to be in our laps and becomes very stiff and still when another dog approaches. I notice some of these signs when our dog has interacted with children in the past but it has never gone past this stage, and other times he seems to warm up and engaged in play with the children (never with other dogs though, only my parents dog who he\u2019s known since he was a puppy and is the same breed). \n\nToday our daughter crawled next to our dog while he was sniffing his bag of closed food in the pantry. I saw it coming from a mile away but could not react fast enough. He bit her on the face and drew blood. We are absolutely distraught. I don\u2019t know if this was a sign of guarding or she caught him off guard or what. He has given warning growls with his food with my parents dog in the past but never with us or any other humans, we often hand fed him his kibble for the first few years of his life. I know he was displaying silent signs of stress, and I feel absolutely sick that we didn\u2019t catch it fast enough, but it happened so fast. We want to know that there is hope but I also am wrestling with the fact that failure would likely be at my daughter\u2019s expense, and already was. We live in a rural town in Canada, there is only one dog trainer who services our area who my husband has emailed today but I feel at a loss on what to do. Please if anyone has any online trainers who deal with this type of thing. I am living my nightmare and we are willing to do anything. ",

We allow our dog lots of space and choice and try and keep him separated from our daughter however it is just not feasible 100% of the time, unless we were to gate him in a different area of the house, however this feels more like a short term solution rather than a long term solution. We would like to know if it is possible to change this behavior and if there are any online dog trainers who may be able to help with this situation. Our dog is healthy and regularly has examinations by the vet, based on the signs of stress visible prior to the incident I don\u2019t believe he reacted out of pain.",

I am not an expert.\u00a0\n\nHere are some thoughts:\n\nMuzzle: \u00a0There is a kikopup video online about muzzle training.\u00a0\n\nModify the environment: \u00a0You might decide to move the dog\u2019s food out of reach of the dog and out of reach of the toddler. Up high? \u00a0You might want to separate them using a pen.\u00a0\n\nTraining: \u00a0The gold standard in trainers are Veterinary Behaviorists who are board certified by the ACVB or CAAB. You can use [this link](https://www.dacvb.org/search/custom.asp?id=4709) (you might have to use 500 miles as your search criteria), then request an online consult if they are not near.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes one session is sufficient. They are amazing (life changing) but they are expensive and there are few.",

I'm not an expert by any means but I have had several dogs including a couple that had similar issues. It's very difficult to reliably train a dog that is triggered like that. It's an instant reflex. We got a second dog a while back that was the most lovable docile thing we'd ever seen, then when our small granddaughter walked in he snapped and tried to attack her. Fortunately we have dog gates up specifically to protect the little kids that are often here, even from dogs that we've never seen an issue with. We discussed the incident with dog people including our vet and none were confident we could ensure safety. From your description it looks like the behavior doesn't totally surprise you and it's not some kind of freakish situation.",

I wish we could go back and have worked harder to get him accustomed to her when she was less mobile, we just thought he would eventually warm up to her. I know it\u2019s not crazy uncommon for dogs to not love the crawling stage. But obviously this has crossed a line, I just can\u2019t wrap my head around the fact that we got to this point and I feel like a failure.",
