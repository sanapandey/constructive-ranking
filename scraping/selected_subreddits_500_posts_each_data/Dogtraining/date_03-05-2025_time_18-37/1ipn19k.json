    "selftext": "5yo French bulldog. We've been 'bell training' since he was 10 weeks or so. Problem is, he will only ring the bells if I'm standing within 5-8ft of the door. He has *never* rung the bells of his own accord - he doesn't seem to make that mental leap that \"hey, I have to pee, I'm gonna ring the bells so someone takes me out\". Instead, he will wait and wait and wait and finally pee wherever he is stitting/laying when he can't hold it any longer. Sometimes he doesn't even stand up, he just pees while he sits or while he's curled up on the couch or bed. \n\nVet has checked him out, all good there. I take him out every few hours to avoid the puddles but I feel like this has actually backfired on us because he doesn't understand he can ASK. I'd say he is technically already potty trained because he only has random accidents when we don't realize he has to go in between our usual potty breaks (for instance, he had a lot to drink and has to go sooner than usual). \n\nHow can I modify this so he understands he has to initiate?

            "body": "This is always my issue with these bells. People seem to think that they will teach their dogs to ring a bell, and the dog will be potty trained. It may surprise you to realize that the bells don't mean the dog has to pee and they never will. \n\nThe dog learns the bells mean they go outside. That's it. I would either get rid of the bells or just ignore them completely. Your problem has nothing to do with bells.\n\nYour dog is not fully potty trained. Potty trained dogs don't pee inside. And they ask to go outside. Either by standing at the door, barking, or ringing bells. Your dog DOES pee inside and also DOESN'T ask to go outside. It's one thing if a dog is left home alone longer than expected and does have an accident, but just peeing inside regularly between going out is more than just an accident.\n\nThe general concept is that the dog needs to learn he cannot pee inside. Right now, he thinks it's ok to pee inside or outside. And it's more difficult to teach them they cannot pee inside the more they rehearse that behavior. You basically need to go right back to basics with your dog. Take him out every hour so he does not have accidents. Every accident is setting you back. When inside, tether him to you so he can't wander off and pee. Learn to see the signs he has to pee. Such as trying to get to a regular pee spot, sniffing, circling etc. If he DOES start peeing inside, make a loud noise and pick him up and run him outside. Yes, while he is peeing. That is a really clear way to teach the dog you can not pee inside, only outside. \n\nOnce your dog finally grasps that he is not allowed to pee inside, he will start asking to go outside. Whether he uses the bells or he walks to the door or barks etc.",

            "body": "We had this problem with our dog. He's from a hoarding rescue and he absolutely did not understand that he could ask for and receive anything but food. We started giving him high value treats (bits of deli turkey) each time he peed and pooped outside. When he started to signal, we just gave him the treat when he came back in.\n\nHowever, his signal is just standing by the back door (we don't have bells). So, if he heads out of sight and has been indoors for more than 2 hours, we follow him. Until he's 100% trained (he has an accident about once a month when we slip up) he really cannot be trusted to wander the house on his own.\n\nBut, I'm a little concerned that he's peeing where he lays. My old dog started doing that when she was pretty old - it's an unusual thing for a healthy younger dog",

                    "body": "Yeah, I'm concerned too. My dog peeing where he lay or sat was always a warning sign something was wrong because dogs generally really don't like peeing all over themselves. Even puppies will pee or poop somewhere else, like a corner of their crate, not on themselves. I always took my dog immediately to the vet because it scared me everytime it happened. Peeing in his sleep the first time was due to bladder crystals. Peeing where he sat while staring at me, as if he didn't realize he was doing it at all, was liver cancer. Peeing in his sleep the last time was due to the cancer coming back, although I already knew he had it that time; I had to put him to sleep less than a month later.\n\n\nOOP, has your vet done an abdominal ultrasound, just to be sure? And a full urinalysis and bloodwork panel as well? I would also want to make sure there's no pain or something causing him to not want to move fast enough to not pee while still sitting or laying down. I'm not trying to scare you and perhaps your dog *is* just a little unusual about his bathroom habits, but it doesn't hurt to get a second opinion, just in case.",

Like while laying on the couch \"let's go potty\" and wait til he gets up (even if you need to repeat once or twice) for you to get up. Emphasize to him that he's leading the way by continuing to make it clear we're going potty by saying it. \n\nAfter doing this for a bit, or if you're already at this step, do everything the same but try to stand further and further away, ultimately out of sight when giving potty command\n\nMy dog hits a horseshoe that hangs on the doorknob and he can sometimes be stupid about it. I reiterate that we're going potty and I stand there letting him think I'm too stupid to understand before she hits shoe. \n\nThink of this as separately from potty training and more like teaching a new trick, even if you think he knows it. He's telling you he clearly doesn't! \n\nSo start over in terms of teaching the bell and also making you're intentions known *away* from the bell to show pup you can need to potty while in over here and carry that thought over there.",
