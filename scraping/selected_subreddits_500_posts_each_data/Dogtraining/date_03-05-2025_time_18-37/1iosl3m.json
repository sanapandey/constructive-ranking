    "selftext": "Thinking of adopting or fostering a dog. \n\nHaving seen a family member who adopted a dog that turned out to be reactive and then she got sick and had to spend time in the hospital. She had to ask relatives to take care of the reactive dog. They all ended up hating the dog. This is not something I want to go through.\n\nIf I adopt a dog from shelter and it turns out to be reactive within 3 months, how ethical will it be to return the dog? Posters online seem to advocate for taking care of the dog no matter what.\n\nPeople who foster return dogs all the time.\n\nMany people will take care of a pet if they already bonded with it regardless of what medical or behavioral issues arise.\n\nIt is hard for a person to take care of a reactive dog they just met by immediately hiring trainers which may require lifelong work just to control the behavior.\n\nI rather adopt a dog which turns out to have medical problems (as suppose to serious behavioral), then I can at least bond with it.",
