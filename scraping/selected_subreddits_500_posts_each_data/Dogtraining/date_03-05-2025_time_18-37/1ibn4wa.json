    "selftext": "Not sure how to word it in the title, but essentially my dog and I do a lot of what I call \u201cplay-training\u201d where we train and instead of treats as the reward, its chasing a flirt pole or attacking a bite pillow. Ever since she was a tiny puppy she\u2019s valued \u201cplay\u201d much more than most foods, so it\u2019s just what we ended up using.\n\nWhat this often looks like in sequence is I\u2019ll give a couple of commands, then end it with a stay or heal, before giving the \u201cfree\u201d command which lets her know she can leave stay/heal and attack the bite pillow or ball or whatever. My concern is I\u2019ve noticed her getting pretty jumpy at the \u201cfree\u201d command even outside this context. I\u2019d like to switch out \u201cfree\u201d for another word that I only use when she\u2019s free to \u201cattack\u201d something, and the normal free the rest of the time. \n\nThe problem is I\u2019m not quite sure the best way to do it. She\u2019s a good girl and won\u2019t move until I say \u201cfree\u201d, so I\u2019ll have to continue using the command at least at first if I want her to move lol. Any recommendations? ",

Eventually you want to say the new word louder, so start slowly decreasing the volume on free, until it's barely a whisper, then leave it out completely. You can still use it in situations where she gets to go off leash/out of a crate, etc. But yes \"attacking\"/grabbing/getting something SHOULD be a different command. :) hope this helps!",

If you're rewarding with a toy she can then play with, you need a toy marker (Can be as simple as \"toy\") so that she is being released to the toy. If you want to break it down even more, you can have a command for taking a toy from you, vs a command for taking a toy from the ground.\n\n  \nIf you choose to change the word \"free\" you can encourage her to move either by moving yourself, or throwing a bit of food etc to encourage that movement. It won't take long for her to catch on.",

            "body": "As the dog levels up, it's seems like those kind of rewards are more for elevating arousal and keeping a connection to the dog. At some point, the training can be it's own reinforcer. Like what if you just cut way back on the R+ play... It could be that the dog just really wants to work and verbal queues and verbal reinforcers are more than enough.\n\nYou also need to think about what you even want with \"free\" and what is fair for the dog. I would much rather get many minutes worth of high arousal high focus work (even if it is sitting still), and then break and play. What would some alternative world look like? Like you want the dog to go from high arousal state with intense focus and then have them just calmly downshift lay down and ignore you on command? IDK, I think that's weird. I'd rather just have them sit there focused on me until they downshift on their own and lay down.\n\nI did some agility classes and I can't tell you how sick I got of people telling their dog break and constantly reinforcing. So weird and annoying. I tried to emulate and fit in and we were an overaroused mess. I switched to doing a quick play to start and build arousal, did minutes worth of training with a few verbal reinforcers and then play at the end of a long sequence. When done with the play, back to heel walk out of the ring, then command down, and let them downshift and stop staring at me on their own.\n\nThe break / free thing is just super weird especially when it is used too much. Like what if for a \"break\" the dog just wants to keep sitting there with intense focus on you. Is that \"wrong\" behavior? I think break / free means excited play.  If you want to end training, just stop.  While you do want to end on success, you don't need to end with a reward.",
