    "selftext": "My mom and I just had a 1yr old, in-tact, male husky rehomed to us a week ago. He was great the first few days but he's gotten increasingly more (for lack of a better term) aggressive towards me specifically \n\nMy period is due in the next few days so we think that's why as he keeps sniffing between my legs before he starts biting, but his neutering appointment isn't for a few more weeks and I'm the only one who can take care of him on week days. \n\nMy biggest issue is that the last few days he's started biting his leash and pulling/chewing it when we try to correct him with it or when he pulls against it, but it's way worse with me, I can't even walk him outside of our yard now when I was walking and running with him for blocks from our house comfortably. And we've resorted to taking him to the dog park so he can run without getting mad at us for not being able to keep up with him on actual runs, we were originally completely against dog parks but it does help his issues a lot\n\nHe's also been jumping on me, scratching me, and biting me if I tell him no and don't allow him into the main house where my cats are because I just need a break from him sometimes. If I try to get inside when he doesn't want me going in without him he blocks the door and jumps on me, he'll bite my hands, arms, legs, and feet, his behavior makes it seem like play biting but he's biting HARD, not enough to draw blood by any means but enough to be really uncomfortable, I have really bad eczema on my hands so his saliva getting on them and his teeth pushing on them hurts my skin a lot and I'm just tired of him acting like this. He also does it after smelling between my legs, if I push him away from my crotch he'll just bite the hand pushing him away, if I turn away he just gets really hyper about it\n\nI've tried clapping, yelling 'NO', yelping so he knows the biting hurts(this makes him do it harder), and turning away from him to ignore him, he stops for that but as soon as I turn back around he goes back to it. I'm home more often than my mom is(she works week days, I work weekends) and she doesn't have any of these problems with him, he's really nice to her but he honestly scares me at this point, I've been bitten by dogs that drew blood before and I cannot stand the thought of my own dog doing it, it's so hard for me not to react violently because I really feel threatened by him. \nAbout an hour ago I was trying to get him to stop and grabbed his collar to try to push him down and he yelped really loud, I might have pinched skin on his neck without noticing? Or maybe he was being dramatic? I'm just more scared of him now because if I did accidentally hurt him he might see me as a threat?\n\n\nI don't want to make him genuinely aggressive and I know that can easily happen in this situation if I'm not careful, but I just can't pay the thousands of dollars that trainers in my area want for stuff like this  \n\nHe does decently with my cats, he gets super hyper near them, play bows, he does yawn/pants lot around them but one of my cats intentionally harassed him(approaches him just to hiss then walks away, etc). The playful behavior is the same he shows towards other dogs of all sizes and he's never hurt them, he was also raised around cats, so I don't think he'd hurt mine, but we do keep him on a leash at all times when he's in the same room we them. But he fixates on them really bad when they're moving around, the only command he'll listen to is to sit and even then it depends on how close they are, so maybe he's just mad because he wants to get closer to them by going in the room? I have no idea\n\n\nDoes anyone have advice? He was fine when we first got him and he's not doing it to anyone else (sometimes with my mom but not nearly as bad and definitely not my grandpa or boyfriend, he listens to men better) so I do think there's a chance that he'll calm down once my period stuff is over but in the mean time I'm just terrified of being alone with him, he's not fully crate trained yet and can't handle being in the crate with nobody in the room so I only put him in it when I really can't handle him being close to me\n\nShould I just leave him alone more often until the neutering? But even then we were told it would take months for the hormones to go down after the surgery ",
