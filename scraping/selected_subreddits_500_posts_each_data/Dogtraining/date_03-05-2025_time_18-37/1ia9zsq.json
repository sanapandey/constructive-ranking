    "selftext": "This is weird. Our dog, a 5 year old male neutered golden doodle, has become fearful of a flight of stairs in our house. He doesn\u2019t want to walk down them. It started a couple of weeks ago and has gone from reluctance to refusal. He simply stands at the top wagging and yelping but afraid to walk down. \n\nI am not aware of any incident which might have traumatised him other than a very slight slip a few weeks ago which did not hurt him, nor immediately change his behaviour. There is another flight of stairs in our house which is he happy to come down. They are both wooden, no carpet, the only difference between them is the one he is afraid of has open treads - but he can\u2019t see that on the way down. \n\nBribing him down with treats doesn\u2019t work, and if this continues we\u2019ll end up having to block him from coming upstairs - carrying him isn\u2019t a great option because he\u2019s 37kg and it\u2019s not super-safe (not to mention not super-convenient)\n\nHe has had various medical issues, the most recent being a very major operation on his leg last May which caused him obvious mobility problems when he was recovering. However he has now fully recovered with a programme of managed increase in activity, physiotherapy and veterinary oversight and this issue has started since he has been much better (he wasn\u2019t allowed upstairs for most of his recovery though). He\u2019s otherwise fit, well and happy. \n\nAny suggestions why this might be happening and/or how to encourage him? It\u2019s really odd\u2026\n\nThanks\n\nDominic ",

We have done a lot of training using positive reinforcement and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying now but it doesn\u2019t seem to be working",

So maybe it neads a refresher course, or maybe its warning you about a health issue, or maybe its one of those wirey haired breeds that i dont understand why they do anything the way they do lol",
