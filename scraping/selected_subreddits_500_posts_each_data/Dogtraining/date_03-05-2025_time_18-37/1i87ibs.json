    "selftext": "Question: has anyone been successful in training their dog not to react to the crate door closing?\n\nBackground:We adopted a \\~3yo female lab/pit mix almost six months ago. We knew when we adopted her that she is a resource guarder And dog reactive.  She has a lot of anxiety so we are working with a behaviorist and a trainer.  Her meds include: clonidine 0.3mg 2 tabs 3x/day, fluoxetine 40mg/day, trazodone 100mg 2x/day. \n\nWhen crating her, she willingly goes into her crate but becomes aggressive (lunging, snarling) when we try to close the crate door.  We have come up with a system to distract her with cookies, feeding her from the side of the crate while closing the door but there are times we aren\u2019t as successful in distracting her.  We have tried working with our dog and the crate, feeding cookies, praising, etc but she gets worked-up and it seemed to be more negative than positive for her.  She is fine (non-reactive) when we let her out of the crate.\n\nWould love feedback on what you have tried and if anyone has been successful. Our girl has a lot of issues and some days are harder than others.  \ud83d\ude1e",

We try and close the door gently when distracting her with treats. \u00a0Unfortunately we don\u2019t know much of her history so it could be related to some past trauma. \u00a0She is a resource guarder so I suppose it could be somehow related to that behavior??",

She\u2019s anticipating the bad thing happening from the earliest possible signal she can find.\n \nHave you considered trying a soft mesh crate where you zip up the entrance instead of a swinging door? Or one that has the door lift up from the bottom to close it like a drawbridge instead of a sideways swing? (Even just turning your current crate 90 degrees so the bottom is on one side can be a temporary test for this.)",
