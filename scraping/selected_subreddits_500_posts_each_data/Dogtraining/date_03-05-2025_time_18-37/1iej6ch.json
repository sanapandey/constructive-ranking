    "selftext": "Hey guys! I have a 6mo girl puppy and a 5yo boy, both shih tzus. \n\nFor the longest time the oldest one hasn\u2019t gotten along with her but FINALLY he\u2019s starting to play with her. The only issue is that he is REALLY gentle. He does not do tug of war, he very lightly nips at toys. He is super happy to share his toys with her but she is not like this at all. If he\u2019s interested in a toy, she steals it and runs away. He\u2019s too gentle to steal it back. If I play fetch with them and she grabs it, he just lets her have it but you can tell he wants it and is just too gentle to steal it. Instead he just looks for another toy to play with but she just goes and steals that one. \n\nShe is not being aggressive or growling at all, she just thinks play time involves stealing whatever toy he\u2019s interested in. It ends up being very one sided. \n\nIs there a way to teach her to just let him win sometimes? I\u2019m trying to teach HIM to be a bit tougher and steal the toys back but he\u2019s just too sweet \ud83d\ude2d. She\u2019s like a little bully. ",

                    "body": "Hi, I have read the section on Dog play styles. My puppy definitely qualifies as a bully, and my adult dog as a timid dog, which per your guide, indicates they\u2019re a terrible match. This would be fine if this was just a play date but they live together.\n\nThey clearly show interest in playing with each other but are just not compatible. Is there no way they make the bully nicer, or the timid one more courageous?\n\nWhile your guide does describe play styles and good matches for play, it does not say what to do when these dogs live together and have no choice but to be each other\u2019s play partner.",
