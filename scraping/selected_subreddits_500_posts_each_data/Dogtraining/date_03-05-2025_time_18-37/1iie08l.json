    "selftext": "I have a six-month-old baby and a five-year-old terrier. Before we had the baby, my dog always seemed a bit wary around children, sometimes growling at them, but she has adapted surprisingly well to this new addition to our family. She\u2019s never growled or barked at our baby, but she does get a bit anxious if she thinks we play too \u201crough\u201d (for instance when the baby gets tickled and laughs).\n\nHowever, I have a question about some of her behavior. I can't quite tell if she's anxious, playful, or just curious. Whenever I put the baby on the floor, the dog approaches with a high, wagging tail\u2014a behavior I would typically interpret as joyful. She circles the baby and tries to sniff their face. While doing this, she whines and occasionally pauses to seek my attention, pressing her back against me asking to be petted. If I don\u2019t respond, she\u2019ll walk over to her toy basket, grab a squeaky toy, and attack it. Other times, she rubs her back against the sofa while growling.\n\nIs this just her way of being curious/playful around the baby? Or could it be a sign of stress? \n\n",
