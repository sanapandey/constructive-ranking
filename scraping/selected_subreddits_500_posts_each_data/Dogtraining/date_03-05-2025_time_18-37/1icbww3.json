    "selftext": "I have a 8mo intact male dog who is very much in his phase of marking everything. In the past month, he\u2019s marked in our house maybe 4x after being perfectly potty trained. Although, I can\u2019t really usually tell the difference between marking and peeing until the end of a walk and his bladder is empty (is there even a difference?). But as the post says, we were at a neighbors house letting our dogs run around in the fenced in yard. A neighbor who we haven\u2019t interacted with much/if ever, is walking her dogs and asks if they can join. Her and her dog come in, that\u2019s not important. What\u2019s important is that my dog after about 15 minutes of the neighbor being there out of nowhere LIFTS HIS LEG AND PEES ON HER. I immediately stop him and push him away. I apologize profusely and we let our dogs keep playing. But then he DOES IT AGAIN. TO HER OTHER LEG. What the heck is going on here? He\u2019s never done this. Was he uncomfortable with the situation? Like I\u2019m just so embarrassed and at a loss. And that point I leashed him up and took him home.",
