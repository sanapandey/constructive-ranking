    "selftext": "Hi all \u2013 basically at my wits end with this. I have a 19-month old male whippet (neutered), he started eating dog poop around 8 months ago (post-neutering). I\u2019ve tried several different complete foods with him since then in case it was a deficiency (currently on Naturaw \u2018Forage\u2019 range which is FEDIAF approved, plus extra raw veggies, pure meat treats and Purina fortiflora probiotic) \u2026 food has made no difference.  \n  \nHis leave-it is good on lead and we use a negative marker so whenever he goes to sniff / investigate poop he gets corrected, however, I can\u2019t see every poo in the woods so when he is on a longer line I don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s sniffing (and about to snaffle) poo or just sniffing stuff\u2026 and when he\u2019s off lead he basically turns into a sh\\*t seeking missile, won\u2019t leave/ drop. He does come back when called \u2013 begrudgingly - though not until snacks have been partaken of.  \n  \nI\u2019m so tired of spending every walk scanning the floor for poo and he is getting more and more frustrated at being on the lead (whippets will zoom \u2013 inside or out\u2026I\u2019d really rather it was outside, and off-lead given he\u2019s a solid 17kg!)  \nAny advice/ anyone managed to train this behaviour out??!??",

            "body": "Sounds super frustrating and a tough problem and you\u2019ve smartly tried many options and described it here thoroughly.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m not familiar with a negative marker. Does that include punishment? \u00a0(Punishment is not recommended.)\n\nIf each time he does this you call and reward for coming, \u00a0would that be rewarding eating poop?\n\nI\u2019m guessing a basket muzzle for walks would be ineffective. Just\u2026 messier.\u00a0\n\nI guess your choices are either keep him on a short lead, (as you\u2019ve said you prefer not to due to the breed\u2019s need for exercise), take him to a fenced area that is poop free zone, or teach a more consistent \u201cLeave it\u201d (which isn\u2019t perfect as you might need to watch all the time and say \u201cLeave it\u201d to any sniffing).\n\nThis was the process we followed to teach a solid \u00a0Leave It (but, unfair, we have a border collie mix, extremely easy to train and very obedient, might disqualify me from giving any dog training advice):\n\n\u00a0I would set up treats on a plastic lid in one room, then leash up my dog in another room, walk towards the treats but stop maybe 12 feet away, a place close enough that he notices the treats but far enough that he can control himself. Then say \u201cLeave it\u201d and give a treat. Back up, walk in another room, then approach again, say \u201cLeave it\u201d and reward. You want him to automatically look at you when you say \u201cLeave It\u201d expecting a treat from you if he doesn\u2019t get the treats on the lid. Then gradually closer, never grabbing the treats on the lid, always looking at you when you say \u201cLeave It\u201d and always rewarded for looking at you rather than the treats on the lid.\u00a0\n\nEventually, take it outdoors, same set up. Treats on lid, walking near it on leash. \u201cLeave It\u201d. Looks at you instead. Reward.\u00a0\n\nEventually you will be able to say \u201cLeave It\u201d anywhere, anytime whether he sees a dead frog or a tampon, or McDonald\u2019s trash or pee\u00a0\u00a0and 100% know your dog will look at you instead.\n\nThat\u2019s what worked for us but not a perfect solution as it requires you to be hyper vigilant.\u00a0\n\nI wish I had a better answer for you.\u00a0",

                    "body": "Thanks for the response! \u2026. I will definitely give your suggestion a go.  \n\u00a0  \nThe negative marker is just a noise (kinda \u201cah-ah\u201d) which I use when he is doing something undesirable (started off as a \u2018stop nipping\u2019 thing when he was a baby, so nip \u2013 ah-ah \u00a0\u2013 play stops, but found it generalised well to making him just stop and pause to give me chance to give a more constructive command). I guess the \u201cpunishment\u201d in this case is being recalled (or fetched when he\u2019s being stubborn) and put on a lead? I don\u2019t hit my dog (despite my Dad constantly haranguing me about it being the only way he\u2019ll learn).  \n  \nI\u2019m not rewarding him for the post-poop consumption recall, I just put him straight on the lead, keep it short and (mostly because I\u2019m annoyed and trying not to take it out on the dog) essentially give him the cold shoulder while we head straight home. \u00a0\u00a0  \n  \nAh! A poop-free field\u2026 my kingdom for a poop-free field!",

Zero response. \n\nPut all that energy into prevention. \n\nYou might want to bring great treats with you on outings. Feed great treats until the dog eats poop and immediately/calmly turn back home as soon as poop is eaten (even if it is a 2 min walk. Maybe the next day it would be a 3 min, then 4 min, etc. \n\nSo being outside becomes the reward for not eating poop.  \ud83e\udd37",
