    "selftext": "I adopted my Chi two years ago. He's 4 years old now, not castrated and well adjusted.\n\nMy first dog was a Labrador (technically he's my mother's dog) and when I went to dog school with him, he would just do anything for treats. We did struggle a bit with him through puberty, but with a little rigor, he turned out perfect.\n\nI adopted my Chi when he was 2 years old from a household that wasn't abusive, but they definitely didn't train him or take him on long walks. Initially, he couldn't even hold in his pee. \n\nI did train him at home (dog school had big dogs in the class, so I was scared) and he does do the basic commands now. He doesn't pee inside & he can do 'here, sit, place, give paw, wait'. He loves other dogs too. Most things I didn't even have to change about him, he just got more peaceful by spending more time outside. He doesn't bark as often anymore. Most times, he's complimented for being so calm.\n\nBecause he is my first dog and I adopted him, I was just scared to now be the second home that fails him. I wanted to do everything right.\n\nWhen I put on his jacket, he would sometimes let out a little sigh of annoyance, so I'd get a new jacket that's more comfortable. He'd get food and leave out the peas, so I got new food. I work from home, so anytime I'd hear him cry for cuddles, I'd interrupt my work to put him on my lap and give him some love. He sleeps in my bed and most times he looks too cute to even move him, even though he's taking up half the space.\n\nHe's terribly spoiled. He hates being alone. But I hate being alone too.\n\nI guess my main problem is that when we train outside, he doesn't even care for the treats. It's like being obedient is optional for him. I can see his little face considering his options, if he wants to listen to me or not. \n\nThis is 99% up to me, I suppose. I didn't put up boundaries. \n\nBut at the same time, the other 1% I do not remember my Labrador being this stubborn. I do know how to be strict! \n\nMy Chi does get scolded when he doesn't listen. I do try REALLY hard with him. \n\nBut without the treats, it's just really difficult to even give him a reason to try. It's like the only thing that would work at this point is punishment? \n\n'Words of encouragement' do work, but not when the stakes are high. When I tell him \"here!\" and he's just sitting comfortably, I can see him thinking \"well no\".\n\nIs this also a Chihuahua problem? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "body": "My late Chihuahua was incredibly well behaved by the definition of what behaved meant to us. When we were in public/eating at dog friendly restaurants he would stand or sit quietly under the table, when walking he was loose on the leash and positioned slightly behind me (my preference) or between my husband and myself if we were both there. If he was in his backpack he would quietly watch the world. When we were at the disc golf course he would stay between us (giving him more range as we walked away from each other)  off leash and would recall when asked. \n\nThat said, he didn't lay down outside and seldom sat and nothing would change that. We were fine as long as he stood in one place when told to stay. He was a bit snappy if people grabbed his ears - no contact but warning snaps. So ultimately we just didn't let people touch him (his preference.)\n\nBut he always got compliments for how good he was and for our life style he was excellent. \n\nSo the big question is what is your definition of a well behaved dog? What do you need your Chihuahua to do?",

If I tell her to stop yapping, she makes sure that she gets the last yap.   She can be somewhat aloof, gets attention on her terms only.  She is job driven. She is our security officer, herald of visitors; when they get up to leave the room, she thinks they must ask permission or they risk being reprimanded by a nip to the ankles.  Makes sure that I answer the phone. Tells me when the Chiweenie needs rescuing.   Will next be running for mayor. A Princess in all ways. Right now she\u2019s staring at me and wagging expectantly. I have to figure out what she wants.   She will live till she\u2019s 25 I believe. Acts and moves like a 2 year old.

            "body": "Labs are generally some of the most food motivated dogs you can get. So that is probably why you didn't have this problem with the lab - food would always be more interesting for your lab than anything else going on. \n\nClearly this isn't the case for the Chi. You need a reward that is higher value to your dog than anything else going on out there. There are a couple things you can try:\n\nOne option is try out other treats to see if there's certain treats that are more motivating. I like to take my dog to petco/petsmart, and let him sniff around different bags of treats (supervised! Don't let him take a bite out of any packages!). If there's a type of treats that he really hones in on, I get it. Cheese, hot dog, etc can be good, but for a small dog, you have to be super careful to give them tiny pieces.\n\nOr maybe your Chi just isn't that food motivated. So then you want to figure out what else motivates him. Does he enjoy playing with toys? Praise? Affection? If your dog likes squeaky toys, those are great b/c you can use it to get there attention (of course, use this cautiously b/c you'll likely get the attention of every other dog within hearing range). \n\nIf your Chi is ignoring you b/c he wants to go play with the other dogs or he really wants to go sniff something, or whatever, you can use the Premack Principle where you pair a behavior that the dog doesn't want to do with something they do want to do. So for my dog, he wanted to go play chase with his buddy. But I had to teach him that he couldn't just drag me over on the leash or run off. So I would make him sit and make eye contact with me first. Then I would release him to go have fun. Over time, the dog learns that if they do what you ask, then they can do the fun thing that they want to do (not always of course). \n\nAlso, get creative with reinforcement! My dog is not super food motivated. Also not super toy motivated. But you know what he does love? Stealing socks, gloves, any small article of clothing. So I bought a super cheap pack of cotton gloves and cheap athletic socks. Now I keep a glove or sock in my pocket, so when I really need his attention, I'll just be like, \"Sock!\" and we do a little tug with the sock, I let him \"win\", he gets to run off with his sock.",

Are you giving him treats every time? You should only give him treats some of the time, that way he has to think Hmm, I better be good just in case, rather than Pfft, I don't feel like a treat I know I'll get, I'll be good next time because this behaviour is more fun right now. Perhaps toys would be good instead if he is more toy driven?\n\n\nSide note, it's wonderful to see someone treat a Chi like a dog.

Try using more than one reward method, see what your pup prefers (toys/treats/affection/verbal motivation). Once your dog is consistent indoors, start moving closer to the front door, and eventually out the front door. Dogs dont generalize well, so itll take a long time before youre able yo pick up where you left off in a new area.",

Use positive reinforcement and try to find something he does enjoy about you ( belly rubs or a special treat) to get him motivated. When you go for walks give him stop and start commands so he learns to listen to you. It can be easy such as Wait!(stop)For every intersection then OK Go!

You can start inside where you normally train, then maybe have a noisy child's toy in the same room, or a second human doing a silly dance, etc. Build up on the distractions then start in a boring place outside like immediately outside your door.

So with him I think it was an age thing. \n\nHe was also highly anxious when I adopted him, found in the middle of a busy intersection, so he had a massive fear of traffic and loud noises. That's also much better, he still has his moments, but he is a confident enough little fella now.\n\nHe loves people but is wary of dogs that he doesn't know. He is the local neighbourhood watch from his window, so he knows everyone :) He is well behaved with dogs in general. All in all, with age, love, and persistence, he is a great boy! Very proud of him. \n\nJust to add I don't leave him off lead for long and only in an enclosed area we know well. Any sign of other dogs or people he is back on his lead",

            "body": "It's so great that you care so much about your dog and you're putting in all this work! Your dog is lucky to have you!\n\nFor me, step 0 would be to find out what your dog finds 1) motivating and 2) challenging. I've seen some trainers recommend to map out a treat/reward hierarchy (including even things like \\_how\\_ the treat is given, my dog will feel a lot happier about a treat I enthusiastically throw for her than a treat that I hand over with an expressionless face staring in the distance). That gives you \\_so much\\_ room to play. A similar scale makes sense for challenges/distractions. As others have also mentioned, working on generalizing each behavior to all environments sounds like a good idea in this case. It's important (but so hard!) to not skip steps, and having a good understanding of your dog's challenges and preferences goes a long way.\n\nA mentality I found helpful for dog training is to give my dog many opportunities to succeed and change the task or environment in a way where she doesn't have too many opportunities to make mistakes (examples where I asked them to do something, and nothing happened, for example). The right behavior has to feel to them like \"wow it wasn't that hard and I even got rewards!\" and you should do your best to make the undesired option impossible (at the beginning). And then as he gets better (and you get better!), you can gradually increase the difficulty of tasks (often without them noticing!) and give them more room to fail, while still keeping this in mind. Genuinely one of the cutest things is when even they get surprised by how snappily they came back for that recall and you two get to throw a little celebration for it! The real skill here is judging what is just the right level of difficulty where there is a bit of a challange but they're still likely to succeed.\n\nIn the same spirit, while working on generalizing, I would recommend to not ask for things you don't think you'll get :) For example, while I'm working on recall in a new kind of environment or trigger level, I make sure not to \"use up\" her actual recall cue, because there's a risk that what she learns is \"oh, the human called, I didn't do anything and the world just continued the same. it must not have meant what I thought it did\".\n\nSo for example, if I am at the dog park with my dog and I want to leave, but she's really deep in play I might do one of the following:  \n\\- First off, only say it if you're sure you mean/want it. Here's what I mean: if you think \"I'd rather have my dog come home with me now but I guess it's not the end of the world if he doesn't... ah I guess we can stay for five more minutes\", then I just wouldn't call my dog (or get in a headspace where you can really mean it or want it :) ). To be clear, I don't mean things like yanking a dog into a sit or anything, but recall is a great example. If you two are leaving, then you two are leaving. It doesn't have to be harsh, but you two gotta go. At the dog school I used to go to when I was a kid, when someone kept calling their dog, they used to say \"huh, your dog knows how to count!\" meaning that the dog knew that the first call didn't mean anything, the second meant they almost had to go, and the third one is the one they actually had to go back for, so that dog learned how to count to three.  \n\\- I might use different words like \"let's go home\" instead of \"come here\" or \"here\" because I'm only 60% sure she'll come. And \"come here\" is non-negotiable. I would use this sparingly too.  \n\\- Better yet, I make the task easier for her. I can do it by walking closer, or I wait for a few seconds for my opportunity. Dog play (or sniffing around or any dog movement) has a natural go-stop-go-stop pattern to it. So I make sure to time my recall for when it's easier for her to actually do it, so that our success rate is higher. Timing is a skill and it needs practice but I promise it's worth it! As you two improve, you will be able to use smaller and smaller openings to call him back.  \n\\- If your issue is recall, and you're not sure if he'll come back or you might have even tried calling once or twice and nothing happened, that might be your moment to go and get your dog (not aggressively, not harshly, but before you have a solid recall, you do still have to somehow collect your dog when you need to). You might also want to use a leash of some sort (even a long leash that you drop on the ground), so that you can make sure you can get him if you need to.",
