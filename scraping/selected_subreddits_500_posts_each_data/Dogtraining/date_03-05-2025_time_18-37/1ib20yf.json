    "selftext": "My small (~15lbs) dog has always liked rope and plush toys. However, he likes to slowly gnaw at them and eat whatever pieces, fabric, rope strands, or plastic he can pull off the toy. \n\nI noticed he doesn't really like hard toys like Kongs, maybe because he doesn't get the same satisfaction of pulling them apart and eating them. He also doesn't like the multi-part toys that are made to be pulled apart, he just tries to gnaw and eat them like the other toys.\n\nOpen to ideas of toys that are safe for him to play with!",
