    "selftext": "My terrier is a very smart well trained guy. Entirely food motivated. He gets so excited about mealtime he starts shaking about an hour before. I distract with play or hold him and say calming stuff but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m fuelling the drama of it all. Also often I have to work or do other stuff in the hour before a meal. But ignoring doesn\u2019t help either.\n\nIs there a good technique for me to help him feel more relaxed about mealtimes? I do wait till he\u2019s as calm as possible before actually giving the food.\n\nConsidering an auto feeder or being in a diff room for the pre meal hour so the focus is off of me.\nMany thanks. (Done research on anxiety generally, careful to reward calmness but he\u2019s normally a very confident happy dog, this feels specific to how smart and food oriented he is) ",
