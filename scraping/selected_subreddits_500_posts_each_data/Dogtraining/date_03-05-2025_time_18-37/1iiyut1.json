    "selftext": "My gran has decided to move to other accommodation and can no longer look after her dog. Since we were dogsitting while she was away, she asked us if we would keep the dog. \n\n  \nThe dog is a little over a year old. She is a mutt, not sure what is going on in those genes but my best guesses are jack russel, sausage dog and staffy. My gran did do much training besides basic house breaking. Anything else she knows was taught by me in the few times she's been here. \n\n  \nHere is my problem. She is naughty behind closed doors. She will act when no one is looking. My biggest issue is that she will pee *specifically* on the carpet or on my sister's bed at night when everyone is asleep. there are only 2 rooms in the house with carpets and the back door is always open for the dogs to do their business outside when necessary. During the day when I'm around she has no issue with this. It is only when everyone is asleep. \n\nAnother issue is that she will terrorise the cats. Nothing that hurts them, per se, but definitely not anything the cats enjoy. We have caught her twice pinning the cats down so they can't move then nipping at them. She also chases them. The dog is used to cats, grew up with a stray making itself at home in my gran's place. \n\nShe also has a tendency to dig in the trash ( I promise she is very well fed), but this issue only pops up if someone is negligent with the trash. \n\n  \nMy boyfriend isn't keep on keeping her around because of these issues, but I don't want to take her to the shelter. She was adopted there as a puppy and it would break my heart to have to send her back because of a problem that I feel can be fixed. She's a very loveable dog and I want her to be at home with us. She gets along very well with our Labby, and they've been friends since puppyhood so that's another reason I don't want to give her away. She is also pretty intelligent.\n\n  \nPlease, some advice or tips will be appreciated. ",

Thankfully, they let me know they need to go.

I'd set a routine up where you take her out last thing at night, make sure she pees, the contain her in an area without a rug or bed. If needs be set up an x-pen so she can be in a room with someone, but no access to soft furnishings.\n\nShe has 3 types of terrier in her and terriers like chasing and catching moving objects. A cat is irresistible, especially if they aren't getting enough exercise, mental and physical. This tendency is enhanced in puppies and again I'd be inclined to block access to them, or at the very least make sure the cats have exit routes. Everytime she chases she gets a shot of dopamine and the habit strengthens. Stop her for a few weeks and you can then do some desensitisation with them together and play the \"look at me game\".\n\nDogs are scavengers, it is how they evolved. You can teach leave it commands but when you aren't there to supervise move the bin or the dog",

Being well trained as a puppy and having lots of opportunities in the day for exercise and mental stimulation lowers the odds of unwanted behaviors when you're not around, but some dogs just by temperament (and especially with breeds like Jack Russells) are always going to pursue mischief when they're not being watched.  \n\nIt's especially important that she is kept in a separate area from the cats when you can't watch her - there's always risk when cats and dogs are left unsupervised together, even if there have been no incidents and the dog is a breed that usually gets on with cats. But leaving a dog with a history of chasing, pinning, and nipping cats and that has a breed mix that includes high prey drive is very dangerous. She may seriously injure them sometime, she might get herself scratched in the eye, etc. It's also extremely stressful for the cats and may cause them to develop behavior issues.\n\nYou should use an enzymatic cleaner designed for pet odors on anything she has peed on (smelling that she has marked a place before will make her want to mark it again), but again she should just be kept away from carpets when you can't watch her.",

            "body": "There's a lot of good advice here already -- crate training, keeping her out of trouble areas, etc -- but I want to address specifically her penchant for being naughty on purpose when no one is looking. \n\nI have a dog who just turned three, and she is much the same. She has made massive improvements over the 2.5 years I have had her, but she's a sassy, opinionated little beagle and she loves to try being sneaky (like trying to sneak the cat's food, for instance). \n\nThe number one thing that has helped her behavior, more than anything else, is consistent training every single day. Now that we've been training her for years, our dog typically just gets a few minutes a day where we'll train at one of her mealtimes, but if she has a hard day where she's extra distracted or can't seem to behave for some reason, she gets a good long training session with either myself or my spouse. We are both very active in training her as well.\n\nWhile training is time intensive and teaching her manners is helpful in a practical sense, I really think the reason it works so well is that it fosters a strong relationship between us, respect for us, and it gives her much needed mental stimulation. It has taken a lot of hard work, but we can now leave her alone without worrying about what she will get into -- both because we learned how to set up our home in a way that some temptations are no longer accessible to her, and because she actually has more respect for (most) of our rules of the house.\n\nIt sounds like you have a very smart little dog on your hands, and dogs like that CAN be a lot of hard work, but the results of that hard work, in my opinion, are so worth it. We have an incredibly strong, special bond with our little stinker, and she still gets better all the time. If you are willing to put in the work and dedication to your pup, I can't imagine it will be less rewarding for you.",

            "body": "This sounds like a tough situation, but adjustment periods can be so hard for everyone involved! Not living with your grandma any more has likely been very stressful, so it makes sense that you would see all these regressions. \n\nPeeing: I would restart potty training with a strict schedule (every x hours plus after every nap, play session or feeding time). You will likely need an alarm overnight too for a few weeks :/ Take him to the same place on a leash and then big reward with high value treats once he pees/poops. I would not leave the back door open, letting him go out on his own, because then you're essentially missing the opportunity to praise him. If he has an accident, clean up, don't scold or punish him, that likely just makes it worse. For the carpet, you should use an enzyme cleaner. It gets rid of the part of the scent we humans don't smell but they 100% do and go back for it because they recognize their smell on it. I don't know of a similar product for the mattress and bedding, unfortunately. If he's good in a crate, it's a good idea to keep him in there when you can't watch him. If not,  it's not a bad idea to get him comfortable with one (not locking him in there until he has a genuinely positive association with it!). You might solve this issue before that happens, but it never hurts tbh. He might not go out in the middle of the night because he doesn't feel safe/comfortable.\n\nCats: I would set up baby gates to give the cats some space(s) that the dog can't access. Vertical spaces are great for this too but baby gates make sense for the kitchen/trash situation.\n\nTrash: I would set up baby gates honestly (and/or trashcans he can't open), until you have the brain space for proper food refusal training. In these situation management techniques like that make a ton of sense.\n\nGood luck, I hope this helps!",

No shame, but she's not wrong. \n\nWhen she has peed on beds like that it's because I did something to seriously upset her. \n\nYou need to kennel train her and keep her in a kennel or enclosed area when you can't watch her m. The only way to deal with it is to make it so she is not able to do the things. \n\nMy dog would poop upstairs in my son's room if I went out with him and didn't bring her, so she got gated downstairs and was not allowed upstairs until it was bedtime and she was going to her kennel. I don't leave food where she can get it. I got a trashcan that she can't physically open or knock over. \n\nThe problem with smart, independent dogs is that they DGAF and will do what they want, so if you don't want their bad habits to continue you need to make it so they can't physically do them. \n\nAlso I don't have to gate her downstairs now. She learned she loses access to the upstairs when she potties up there so she no longer does it. It took a while though.",

My puppy was in a crate at night until he was able to sleep through the night with no accidents and now he has the privilege of sleeping outside of his crate and he's able to make it the whole night. If you don't want to crate, close the doors to the rooms with the carpet so she cannot get in overnight. For the cats, they definitely need a dog proof area where the dog cannot reach them. My dog still chases my cat but she jumps up to her cat tree or goes into a secured room that he cant get in and then he will leave her alone. Either a tall cat tree or a gated area or room so they can escape her. Crate training can help with this too. Maybe she is acting out when overstimulated or overtired and taking it out on the cats. Going in the crate for some downtime or structured nap (not as a punishment) may help. As for the trash, everyone in the household needs to be extra diligent with the trash. Dogs will stop doing something if it is not accessible and you mentioned it only happens when someone is negligent. Hopefully some of this information will help :)",

Crating at night, or at the very least closing the doors of the rooms the dog pees in at night, and crating while you're gone to curve the cat issue. Jack Russells have a pretty high prey drive and wiener dogs are kind of known for being stubborn with house breaking. I would reward the dog for ignoring the cats when they are in the same room together, and rewarding for pottying outside. Jack Russells are also pretty high energy so I would also recommend tiring him out before you leave so he doesn't feel the need to play with the cats when youre gone.",

If she is not kind with the cats, crate training will also help. It allows safe and contained interactions with the cats. Her behavior with the cats can also be trained away with commands such as \u201cleave it\u201d and \u201cplace\u201d to prevent her from getting too excited about the kitties.",
