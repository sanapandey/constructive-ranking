I'll also add a link in the comments in case it doesn't work\n\nTLDR; dog growls when someone enters my room- tonight she was more aggressive than normal, I thought she would bite. How can I finally fix this lifelong issue?\n\nHi there! I have read the guide and the \"aggression\" and \"reactivity\" page did not help much so I'm posting here. This will be a bit of a long one but I really need some advice as my situation seems unique/hard to answer online and I'm not really in the place right now financially to hire a trainer.\n\nI have an 8yr Goldendoodle who has never bit a person before. I've had her since she was 4 months old and she has always been the *sweetest* dog. I'm careful about her boundaries, making sure she wants to be pet, letting her have a safe space, and letting her growl as a warning instead of shutting her down when she makes noise. She has never been outwardly aggressive to people and is very rarely aggressive to other dogs. There have only been a couple incidents:\n\n1. she was around 1 yr and our other dog (since passed) tried to take her ball. Bear (the dog in question) snarled and then snapped at the other dog. She bit her ear and drew blood and nothing more came from it\u2014stern reprimanding of course but also, it's dog law. Bear was defending a toy from another dog and she had never and still has never treated a human like this so we didn't worry much. Again, she has never growled at a human for toys or food and is not normally a resource guarder.\n2. maybe around 4yr old now- she and I are walking and she's off-leash (she's usually very good at recall and stays right beside me) and a small yorkie appears around the corner. Without warning, she sees it and flies over there. I sprint after her, calling and grabbing her collar when she's just reached the yorkie. Everything was fine and the owner thought it was cute and insisted she was just playing but I know how my dog runs and she was certainly running like she was hunting. She's had many other interactions with larger dogs and is always fine.\n\nThe issue at hand here- she always sleeps in my room in an open crate that she loves and occasionally on the floor. She has also always been very territorial of my room when I'm in it. From the beginning, she would growl if anyone tried to walk in while I was with her but nothing we did stopped it and it never was really a problem because she always retreated to her kennel while growling so it wasn't outwardly dangerous. When I was 12 (got her at 10 so she was 2) I had a bad argument with my dad and ever since then, she's been more aggressive when he even walks by the stairs to come up to my room (growling more aggressively, still retreating, barking). Recently though (within the last year) she's been doing this to everybody. My dad, mom, sister, etc (never me) and I think it has to do with protection and not territory because she never does it when she's alone in my room.\n\nThe issue that happened tonight- my mom got another goldendoodle a year ago and they've had a bumpy ride adjusting to each other. The younger one, Honey, is annoying towards Bear (nipping her ears, never giving her a second alone, incessant barking at her etc) and Bear has been good at establishing boundaries. She's never bitten Honey but she'll snarl and be clear that she doesn't want to play. But Honey doesn't even act like a dog- she sees Bear growling and crouching and starts barking louder and doing another play bow. So, Bear has taken to growling at Honey too when she comes upstairs. Tonight, I was sitting in my room with Bear when I heard the normal growl that signaled Honey coming up. My dad was walking up with her so, double whammy. Bear started being a lot more aggressive and I looked up to see my dad try to put his hand on her mouth (big no-no, he should know this) and she exploded in a growl that made me really concerned she would bite him. Honey, ever the idiot, didn't get the \"I'm going to kill you\" memo and still was trying to get past Bear so I yelled at both (different commands that got them out of each other's space) and took both downstairs to go to their kennels, where they'll stay for the night.\n\nThe issue has gotten out of hand. I have a well-behaved dog that snarls like a bear when someone walks into my room and now I'm worried that after 8 years, it will escalate. What can I do?\n\nvideo",
