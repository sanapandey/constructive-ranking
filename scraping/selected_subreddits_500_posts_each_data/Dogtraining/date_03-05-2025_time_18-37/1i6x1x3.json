    "selftext": "Okay this is a super weird thing to ask. Before a lot of judgement is posed, my cat\u2019s eye keeps getting infected due to the dogs licking his eye, else I would not be in their business. I know it\u2019s just them playing and being friendly but it\u2019s dangerous for my cat and the bill is fairly pricey every time this occurs. The dogs and my cat have a good relationship. We had the cat since he was 3 months old. Dogs are 4 and 8 years old, cat is less than a year old. They play together, sleep together, eat together, everything else is fine behavior wise (pretty sure the cat thinks he\u2019s a dog). Cat doesn\u2019t really care, but I don\u2019t think he realizes his eye keeps getting all gross because they keep licking his eyes. We tell them no licking which they understand and cease in the moment. However it\u2019s rather difficult to keep track of it constantly. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I have also looked at none of the above as well.\n\nMy goal is just to get him to stop licking his eyes. Any other places is not off limits. The cat can easily set boundaries for other body parts. Both dogs know and listen to the command \u201cno licking\u201d when given. I get licking is like socialization and in this aspect it\u2019s a positive, however it\u2019s a negative as I rather not have my cat harmed from frequent infections. \n\nOther info: both dogs are chihuahuas, they are big lickers true to their breed. There\u2019s no training them out of never licking. It\u2019s their way of showing affection and I\u2019ve grown to accept it. \n\nPls help.",
