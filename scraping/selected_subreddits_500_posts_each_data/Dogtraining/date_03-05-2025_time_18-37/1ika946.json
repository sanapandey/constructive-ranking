    "selftext": "Sorry for the lengthy post, there are a lot of details that should be mentioned here.\n\nSo husband and I bought his mother a jack russell puppy for Christmas. We all live together out of necessity. She's wanted another dog forever since the passing of her golden retriever 7 years ago. I knew to expect lots of bad behaviour from having had kittens, and that's fine, but we went into it assuming the dog would be consistently trained between the three of us i.e. the bad behaviors would be temporary. The problem is MIL isn't training, or trying as hard, to train her as we are. Or we're trying in different ways. I try to explain the best approaches to things based on posts here but she usually forgets and so nothing is consistent for the dog.\n\nThe puppy is so hyperactive it's insane. She was the timid/omega of the pack when we got her and now she's like a different dog. The two main problems are her hyperactivity and her toileting everywhere. I WAS regularly taking her out to the same spot and treating as soon as she went, but eventually gave up since MIL doesn't bother to treat her or use the same location. She just lets her disappear into the yard and go who knows where. Also I've let her out before, she seems not interested in going so we go back inside, only for her to immediately pee/poop still. Other days she does really well like the system is starting to click, then she randomly goes back to square one and I'm worried that's because of the inconsistent training again. She also LOVES to go in our bedroom but will hold it in whilst in MILs room. A few seconds in our room is all she needs and being a tiny dog she goes constantly.\n\nAs for her hyperactivity, she has plenty of toys and I give her a long walk in the morning. I would do more but have a 1 year old to care for as well and am exhausted by the evening. But it's something right? Yet she still destroys and eats everything in sight. We try to keep her in the back yard or in MILs room since it's the only room she won't pee. But if we have to go into that room or outside? It is impossible to do without her shooting through the door. It's a constant battle keeping her in one place.\n\nWe have just today bought her a crate but MIL has already done a no-no I think. I read to let them get accustomed to the crate in their own time so it isn't seen as a place of punishment/confinement. I told her this but she still closed the crate door the first time she went in. She of course started whining after that and now I can see MIL not even trying with the crate now.\n\nI really regret getting this dog for her now and yet I know she wouldn't even consider rehoming, so we're stuck with a dog that isn't being trained properly and making daily life very stressful.\n\nTraining wise I can see where we're going wrong with most things. The problem is that training isn't being enforced consistently and that part is out of my control. I'm always fighting an uphill battle.\n\nAre we doomed here? Is there any silver lining at all? Will the dog at least calm down energy wise as she comes into adulthood?\n\nAlso before the obvious is suggested, we can't afford to live separately and I've spoken with MIL countless times about the issues here. The problem is her memory is horrendous and she generally is just very low effort with everything outside of her job. That's my fault, I should have seen it coming really.",

It is a shared commitment. It sounds like you are isolating a young puppy because it's too much for you to deal with. Imagine putting your 1-year-old child in isolation because they have an accident. \n\nJust like your child the puppy has no control over their body functions yet. They have to be taught to let you know that they need to go outside. This takes some dogs  longer than others. \n\nIt's concerning that you got a Jack Russell and then you're worried about the activity level. Jack russells are notoriously active and opinionated. You really need to develop a bond with them. \n\nPersonally, I would recommend an in-house training session for the whole family with a certified trainer. Get on a plan so that you have a great dog for your child to grow up with",

And the son and daughter-in-law clearly did not think 100% of the care and training was going to be their responsibility. \n\n The dog should never be the one to suffer because the owners are not capable of providing what it needs. The dog should go back to the breeder for rehoming into an appropriate home.",

I'm not a dog person whereas husband and MIL have had many dogs over the years, so when they said jack russells are great to have I didn't put much thought into it beyond that. They never mentioned that they are an especially energetic breed, in fact they kinda implied the opposite as we were saying how we need a calm dog with a baby in the house. In retrospect I think they were confusing friendly temperament with low energy. \n\nFrom my perspective I just wanted to gift her something she's wanted for a long time. Her golden retriever was her best friend and she never quite got over her loss. The pup wasn't a mystery type present dumped in her lap either. She came to see her at the breeders house and we let her decide if she wanted her.\n\nAnd yeah, I knew a lot of the training would be down to me just because she works and I'm a SAHM. And again I'm okay with that. But it's like my system just goes completely out the window once she gets home and it's so disheartening.\n\nAs our baby hopefully gets easier with age I'll try and give her a second walk in the evenings, but right now I'm just too shot by that time. I feel bad about that every day as she obviously has a tonne of energy that needs to be burned.",

I would really really recommend going onto the Facebook group \u2018dog training advise and support\u2019 DTAS for short. Make sure you find the one with self study guides and using only positive reinforcement to train your puppy. You can also read the information directly on their website. It\u2019s set up by dog trainers and behaviourists. They have so much great advise. \n\nKeep going with the regularly taking to puppy out to go to the toilet. Try and negate accidents by watching closely and if you take her out to the toilet and she doesn\u2019t go outside, you could carry her while you\u2019re inside and then go back out a few minutes later. It does sound like she\u2019s learning. Don\u2019t loose heart. \n\nSomethings that might help calm her. Enrichment feeding. Stuff her food into cardboard for her to rip apart to find her food, wrap it ina towel so she snuffles for it. Try a Lickimat with paste or peanut butter or other things as a calming activity for her. long lasting chews like antlers and hooves as chewing is calming for dogs. If you\u2019re able, more frequent but shorter walks may help her enjoy the outside world and sniff and explore tiring her out mentally. \n\nShe\u2019s young so all you\u2019re describing isn\u2019t that surprising for a dog of her breed and age. If you and your partner are consistent she should\nContinue to learn from you",

I did my best at the time but end of the day we live in an imperfect world. Redditors seem to ignore this and live in a black and white world where everything is ideal and if anyone falls short you get lectured to death which is pathetic and helps nobody.\n\nAnd you know what, I used to 'do my research' on everything until I realised that everyone has a conflicting answer to everything in life. Research is helping me less and less as time goes by. It just eats time more than anything else, which I don't have much of to spare these days.\n\nSecond, what this person didn't ask questions about was the fact the dog wasn't a surprise type Christmas gift which they seem to have assumed with the comment about who's to blame. I wouldn't do that when it comes to a living being. MIL came to see her at the breeders house and got to decide for herself what she wanted or if she wanted the breed at all. We only paid. They could have asked into this before assuming and lecturing about who is/isn't to blame. I don't even give a damn about who's to blame, that isn't helpful to anybody is it? How about appreciating that I'm trying my best for the dog in spite of the errors made and even though she isn't, technically speaking, my dog? Do I get any internet points for that at all? Yeah I doubt it lol.\n\nIf you guys truly care about animals maybe you should encourage their caregivers, not tear them down. How do you think that negative energy is going to pass on to the animal? But ya'll know best of course.",

Not all of them toilet train badly, but when they do, it's just what it is and you have to either live with it or you have to live with it.\n\nDo not put her in a crate unless you're walking walking walking her. She could up psychotic and even more destructive when the energy boils over. They're such a high energy dog, it destroys thier soul. You can try it, give it a shot, but don't be surprised if her energy gets crazier and turns into hostility and aggression. I can't imagine a good outcome.\n\nShe seems to not have had the field & pack work dog bred out of her. They're meant for farms and fields and the hunt, that's what they're born to do. Can't change breeding tendancies. \n\nThe pup may not be the best fit for your family without time and patience --yours. Talk to the breeder and see what they have to say about possible options and solutions. Hopefully they're responsible breeders and not backyard 'aficionados'.\n\nI wish you the best of luck, seriously.

You purchased a gift animal. Animals are not gifts. They are a commitment, an obligation. \n\n2.   You purchased a breed that is known for high intelligence, high activity, and completely different drive than a golden retriever. If you thought somehow that this small package was going to be a piece of cake to live with because it was a fraction of the size of a golden retriever, you were sadly mistaken.  This is a mini malligator. This is what happens when a Chihuahua stops taking crack and get some book learning and some street smarts at the same time.  \n\n3.  Your mother-in-law has memory issues \ud83d\ude32\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.   \nLet's set this straight right now. You did not purchase your mother-in-law dog. You purchased a dog. This dog is your responsibility. It was never going to be your mother-in-law's responsibility. She's not capable.  And if she has memory problems does that mean she's elderly enough so that she may not live to see a Jack Russell puppy get to 15 years of age? Which means you inherit the dog.  SMH \n\n4  Training is an obligation of everyone in the household, not just MIL.  And because she is incapable, it falls to her son and daughter-in-law.   The first and most essential part of every and any training is management. That means the dog needs to be crated whenever it is not tethered to a person or actively being supervised.  If your mother-in-law is not capable of doing any of this, then it's very possible the puppy should just go back to the breeder.  Hopefully it was purchased from an ethical breeder that has a contract that if ever you cannot keep the dog it can be returned.  \n\nYou have acknowledged the mistake. The dog should not suffer. Unfortunately that means mother-in-law is going to be the one to suffer when the dog is taken back. It is the right thing to do, it's just not the easy thing to do.",

The dog doesn't enter your bedroom.\nDon't want to clean up after the dog in the house? The dog is confined to a room like the kitchen with an easily cleanable floor and to outside. Until the dog can hold it the dog is not permitted in other parts of the house except on the way to outside.\n\n\nImpossible to stop the dog from darting? It's called a harness and a leash. It doesn't come off until the dog either stops their destructive behaviour by growing out of it or training it.\nGet a 10 foot leash that you either tether the dog to some thing or hold while you are with it so it can't run off.\n\n\nIf there are unwanted behaviours then you remove to the best of your ability the environment or triggers that lead to that behaviour.\u00a0\n\n\nPuppy destroying stuff? Remove the stuff.\nTemporarily replace things that you don't want chewed, or always be watching. Also manage yourself, it's a puppy, its going to chew or bite things that's normal and you have to accept that.\n\n\nMy puppy needed enforced nap times so she wasn't overstimulated biting all the time.\nMy dog also never liked the crate, but it wasn't an option to not sleep in there, for her safety from biting cords or chewing or eating something she wasn't supposed to.\nWe were lucky where even at 8 weeks old she came basically potty trained.\nTurns out she would not pee in her crate, she would wake up and bark to be let out.\nI think generally dogs aren't a fan of lying in their own urine/feces so that should also help your dog get the message that they are to go outside.\n\n\nAlternatively you can try adopting a dog that's already trained. That might reduce the issues but it honestly sounds like you already know what the real issue is: you have different standards than your MIL. And that is way harder to change than you just continuing to try training the puppy.\n\n\nSo yeah, maybe the training environment isn't ideal.

If you can, create a united front with your wife, especially if your MIL has medical issues with her memory.
