    "selftext": "My dog has severe fear aggression with two things. \n1. Going to the vet \n2. Having her nails clipped or wax put on her paws (she\u2019s fine with wiping her paws)\n\nMy rescue was 4 months old when I adopted her. I met my boyfriend when she was a year and a half old. \n\nShe has a terrible experience with her rabies vaccine (anaphylactic attack) that triggered a fear aggression response whenever we go to the vet. \n\nNow we have moved to another country and are trying to do better by her with vets especially. If we can\u2019t make it enjoyable. We want to at least help her to not feel so traumatized. \n\nOur first step we have medication for her which we give her leading up to her vet appointment (first attempt at this) on Monday. \n\nWe\u2019ve started some exposure-therapy in our very ignorant view of what we think she needs (I\u2019m also going to contact a behaviorist so we can enact a specific plan). \n\nBut we started with her paws. \nFor some reason she hates the wax. I\u2019ve tried many different brands and currently we use Mushers. She growls and bites - hard but not hard enough to break skin etc. this is definitely not a pleasant experience for any of us but after 2 days we\u2019ve gotten to the point where with some of her high-value treats she\u2019s able to growl but then ignore the fact that we have her paws in our hand. \n\nI don\u2019t seem to understand why my boyfriend gets so annoyed with our dog so easily without being able to put himself in her shoes. I try to explain to him the circumstance in hopes he can understand and empathize with her because after this kind of training she feels very embarrassed that she was growling etc. so I end it with a very positive moment for her. But he just stomps around being upset that his hands are now sore (so are mine) and I tell him she can feel his emotions. Which will reinforce the embarrassment she\u2019s feeling. \n\nI am in desperate need of resources to read myself, or show him of how to kind of understand a dogs mind and behavior and what they perceive from us as humans. I\u2019d love to give him some perspective and me telling him doesn\u2019t seem to work. ",

It sounds like he\u2019s trying to be supportive and help train her, but he\u2019s valid in feeling frustrated by being physically harmed and put in what sounds like a stressful situation for everybody. \n\nYou\u2019re asking him to empathize with your dog but you aren\u2019t empathizing with him. Maybe you could ask him what about the situation upsets him and brainstorm together what steps you could take that would make it easier for him. For one you should probably put a muzzle on her when you\u2019re handling her paws, there\u2019s no reason either of you have to just take that. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not sure dogs can feel embarrassment, and especially in this situation I think that would require a level of self-awareness from her I don\u2019t think dogs are capable of. If she seems \u201cembarrassed\u201d she\u2019s probably just stressed. \n\nI love my dog so I understand wanting to do what\u2019s best for her, but your partner deserves to feel heard and validated.

For reasons unknown, the dog seems to keep its behavior a little more on lock around me. He\u2019ll jump on my wife\u2019s back if she turns away, chew at her ankles, bite her hands, etc.\n\nI didn\u2019t do anything \u201cright\u201d and she didn\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong,\u201d the dog is just being weird. She still has tooth marks all up and down her arms where pup has broken skin, and I don\u2019t.\n\nShe complains about the pup often to me. And I try to help out and empathize, because it sucks. Saying \u201cohh he\u2019s just a puppy you can\u2019t blame him\u201d won\u2019t make the bites feel any better.\n\nA couple of questions to ask yourself that might help:\n\n* are you also annoyed by the dog situation, but maybe you\u2019re trying to just work past it and your boyfriend\u2019s complaints are making that hard? (because now multiple people are mad) If so, this is worth talking through. It\u2019s just a hard test of your relationship to figure out how you deal with shared stress.\n* has your boyfriend displayed any actual negative behavior toward the dog? If he\u2019s frustrated but still trying to show up and help out, that\u2019s a positive sign. If he\u2019s disengaging, that\u2019s a negative sign that he\u2019s not willing to share this problem.\n* you\u2019re in a new country and that carries its own stress. Is it possible some of that is boiling over?\n\nI don\u2019t want to project how you all have been handling this. You\u2019re somewhat early in your relationship and maybe this is the first shared stress. (My wife and I argued pretty consistently when we first moved in together.) It may be worth an honest conversation to say \u201chey, this is hard, and it\u2019s not fun, and your attitude is really making it harder. How can we get through this together?\u201d",

If you stay calm, it helps them stay calm. You're going to feel a lot calmer when you know that you're safe. \n\nIt shows your boyfriend and the vet that you take this situation seriously and are willing to do everything you can to protect them and their safety. \n\nMuzzles can double as a treat dispenser. Smear a little bit of peanut butter around the inside. \n\nMuzzles can reduce or eliminate the need for restraints.\n\nYou can condition your dog to associate the muzzle with positive experiences like attention and high value treats. It can be a step in reconditioning the way your dog views this entire experience. \n\nCooperative care, desensitization, and training your dog to do the movements that they'll need at the vet's office can also go a really long way to reduce anxiety. Everyone should train their dog to stand up, offer their paws, allow you to inspect their body, move where directed, turn around, etc. You don't want to just do these things at the vet, you want to do it as often as possible and teach your dog what to do so that no one has to use force at the vet's office. \n\nIt's not an instant fix, but overtime it helps and a muzzle can be an important part of that.",

            "body": "Just wanted to chime in to say dogs don't feel embarrassment, shame, or guilt. Those are human emotions that we ascribe to them. Rather it's just general anxiety and/or fear your pup is feeling. The stress hormone cortisol spikes in the body after an intense or upsetting experience, and it can take anywhere from 1-30 days for cortisol spikes to fully go back to normal. Think of how it feels when you come very close to being struck by another car in traffic. Your chest gets tight, your heart pounds, you feel shaky and uneasy. That's generally what your pup is feeling each time you do the wax sessions, so when you're done, she's still dealing with the after effects of the cortisol spike and will be for a while. Any negative emotions your boyfriend is outwardly showing are definitely only going to add to her fear and anxiety in the moment. Continually spiking cortisol levels means she doesn't have time to recover in between and will become increasingly unstable and unpredictable. Not saying that your boyfriend is going to cause her to become a monster or anything, but he's actually actively hindering and hurting her progress by being unable to control his emotions until he leaves the room. This needs to be addressed, or he needs to not be part of those sessions at all.\n\nIt's also important to make sure you're not pushing her so hard during these sessions that she feels she has to bite. If she's biting, you're going too fast. Learn her signals, stop before she bites. Don't allow her to rehearse the behavior over and over and build the habit. Cooperative care training would probably be a very good idea for you guys, it's consent-based training for medical and health procedures and it works wonders for fearful dogs. I highly recommend the book by Deb Jones. I would also be getting a board-certified veterinary behaviorist on board as well. Basket muzzle training would also be a good idea, to keep everyone safe. A well fitted muzzle should still allow them to drink, pant, yawn, and take treats. Make sure you condition her to it well, you want her to love wearing it, and you don't want her to just shut down because the muzzle is on and she finds it scary and uncomfortable. She should act as normal while wearing it, just be unable to land bites.",

Since then I had very much tried to do vet visits (only positive ones) and help her develop a trusting relationship with the vet. \n\nBut you\u2019re right. I could\u2019ve helped her with her fear-aggression earlier. Because at the time it was only vet-based I didn\u2019t experience anything outside of the vet. And in that year it was more submissive fear (peeing, pooping and shaking when at the vet). She would let me hold her when the vet cut her nails. She Would try to flail but there wasn\u2019t growing or nipping.",

            "body": "So firstly setting aside the bf situation, it can take a while to build up a positive experience with a vet after one bad experience. My vet is actually amazing, and they always dote on him, treat him, show him around the garden and surgeries and meet the team. \n\nOne of the vets threw a wild statistic at me. She said it takes (a very specific number I can't remember, like 23 probably based off an average) positive experiences with an environment in a row before the dog will get over the trauma of the bad experience. I live close so they encourage me to walk him in randomly whenever I can and they will all fuss over him, he will get treats in the vet offices, and he meets everyone, then we leave. What I'm trying to say is the vast majority of vet experiences for pets are scary. But if you routinely visit for a positive experience, and only 1 out of 25 or so visits is scary, that is the way to work on helping the fear of the vet.\n\nAs for the bf. I think the best way to make him understand that it's not her fault, is frame it in human terms. She has PTSD. She's traumatised and certain things trigger her. She can't help it, and getting frustrated and angry with her will only make the experience even worse.",
