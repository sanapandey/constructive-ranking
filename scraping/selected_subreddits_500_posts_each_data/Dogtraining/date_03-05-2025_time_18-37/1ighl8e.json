    "selftext": "So I got my puppy (GSD mix) at about 2 months and he LOVES our kitten, who was about 4-5 months when we brought the dog home. They love each other and played lots, which I personally wasn't happy about because as he got older I didn't want him to smush the cat, but since I was the only one out of the five of us in the house that was going to do anything to stop him from the behavior, I gave up so it wasn't inconsistent signals from different people.\n\n  \nFast forward to now when he is 5 months old, and WAY too big to be playing with the cat, who is unusually small for his age. Most of the time he is actually pretty gentle with the cat, but there's sometimes where he gets mad after the cat gets him with a claw and will get too rough, or the cat is playing in a tunnel and he will full on jump on the tunnel and terrify me that he's going to break the cat.  \nOn top of this, he will CONSTANTLY follow the cat around and chase him through the house expecting the cat to ALWAYS play. Unless one of them is sleeping, he has the cat cornered in its safe spots and will not leave until the cat needs something and decides to leave. Harley, the cat, is a very tolerant cat and gives no hissing, growling, or anything like that, he just simply tries to run away and can't run fast enough before he's pounced on.  \n3/5 of us play with the dog as much as our schedules allow to try and wear him out (inside and outside), take him on walks, and do daily training (sometimes we miss a day.. oops....) but he still will wait for the cat and corner him into play.\n\nI started this thing along with one other person that is every time the dog goes after the cat he gets put in time out and has to be in his area by himself for a few minutes to calm down. Now he's picked up that he's not supposed to play with the cat because he will stare from a distance and look over at me to see if I'm watching before running after him, and he won't respond to his name or \"leave it\" until he hears me get up and start walking towards him to put him in his time out, in which case he will run as fast as possible to try and get around me and run far away from me or any room he's placed in. Sometimes even when I am watching, the cat will just play by himself and it's like the dog can't contain himself anymore and just runs after him to shove the cat's head in his mouth. \n\nI've also started giving him treats every time he chooses to stay at a distance and watch rather than run after the cat, but even after all this it's still not showing much improvement, if any at all. Especially because not everyone in the house is following along and I feel like I'm just teaching him inconsistency. If I'm at my computer doing stuff or in the shower, I can hear him barreling upstairs after the cat, and as soon as I walk up the stairs to come check it out, I hear him run away and jump on his bed to act natural.\n\nThis is super frustrating and makes me genuinely concerned for the cat's safety. I know Fondue, the dog, wouldn't try to hurt Harley on purpose, but he's just so big and clumsy that I fear it will happen on accident if this continues. When Fondue is taken over to other houses, he plays super nice with their cats and dogs and while he will sometimes exhibit this behavior, he also is typically okay ignoring them.\n\n  \nTLDR; dog chases cat even though he knows he gets in trouble when it happens and watches to see if we are watching before chasing after cat. current training doesn't seem to be helping at all.",

For when you are in the shower I would recommend kenneling him. If the other people in the home can't be consistent then they don't get to have unsupervised by you time w the dog. I might even suggest keeping a shoe string or something on his collar for when he is playing appropriately if he goes to far, he gets put in a down stay next to you and he gets rewarded for looking at you. If he is smart like a GSD he will start to get this. Especially if he is younger. They are sponges. Don't wait to do something about this. Depending on the age of the others in the house, turn it into a game. Something fun. You get to play w the dog 1:1 if you can follow these rules. If the cat initiates play then that's where the string comes in. Something to allow you to grab and redirect the dog. Noticing the problem is the first battle, so  great job!

Also, teach the dog what you want him to do instead of what punishment (yes time outs are punishments, just very mild ones) he should expect. Punishments just teach him to avoid being caught.

I have a high drive working GSD and she had zero impluse control when she was young.  Within a year of starting to work on impulse control, she became a very neutral dog to the point where she could be in the center of a chaotic situation and will lie there and quietly watch what is going on.  There are many ways to teach implulse control and neutral behavior, but you have to know your dog pretty well and what will work for your dog.  And if you have multiple people in the house, everyone has to enforce the rules.  I suggest you engage with a professional trainer if you want to do this type of training as it's advanced stuff.  It took me about a year to get my dog rock solid with her impulse control and that was with building that training into everything we did as well as specific exercises to reinforce it.  Dogs and cats can learn to get along, play appropriately, and even become besties if you make a little effort.

            "body": "I agree with other comments about giving the cat areas to get away from the dog, baby gates are very good for this. It is not safe for them to be in the same area without direct supervision.\n\nAnother thing that I have found helpful is teaching a \"steady\" (or \"slow\") and \"gentle\" commands so that when they are in the same space you can guide him towards appropriate ways to interact with the cat. Never being allowed to approach the cat makes it seem much more forbidden and fun, and since he knows he is in trouble for pursuing the cat at all it makes sense to try to do it at top speed before you can stop him. This way he knows that as long as he goes slowly he is allowed to try to go near the cat, and as long as he is gentle he is allowed to sniff the cat, and it is going too fast or being too rough that ruins the fun. The easiest way to teach these commands is with a leash or long line, not allowing them to get closer unless they follow the steady command and pulling them back when they do not follow the gentle command, and giving heavy praise for progress. I don't suggest using treats in these interactions because if there's any resource guarding tendency, especially if the cat shows interest in the treat, it can make things more tense rather than less.\n\nThis is especially effective for dogs who have herding drive (which is what GSDs were originally bred for). For some dogs having to go slow makes the activity pointless and they would still be desperate to chase down the cat if they could and want it to try to run away, but dogs with a herding instinct generally enjoy the game created of trying to creep up slowly enough that the cat won't bolt and figuring out how to maneuver to get the cat to go where they want it, and they will figure out that the slow and gentle approach is actually a better way to get what they want than charging in and having the cat run in a random direction.\n\nI still would never leave them without direct supervision in the same area, but this makes it *so* much less stressful to keep an eye on them, reduces the chance of situations you have trouble controlling, and makes it so that if they accidentally end up unsupervised together the odds are much better that everyone will be ok.",

I got 2 malamute puppies who were smacked in the face by the ginger tabbies on day 1, thus establishing their place. The void was a big hippy and loved everything. The pups gave the gingers a wide berth as they grew up. The void was a huge curiosity to them and they got very excited with her.  In a few months they got up to about 25-30kgs and the void was around 4kgs. They were never left unsupervised as it\u2019s really not worth the chance with high-prey drive dogs (malamutes, huskies, GSDs etc) but one of the pups managed to jump on the couch on top of Jasmine (void). Fortunately the couch took a lot of the weight but she was physically hurt and had to have pain killers for a week or so. The pup didn\u2019t mean to hurt her but she still did. Please setup a tall baby gate so the cat can be safe.  This is a tragedy waiting to happen. Now my dogs are 18 mths and I do not trust them with the cats at all. Even the gingers now who will hiss and scratch them. They get far too overexcited to be able to make good decisions (they still have puppy brain). \n\nAll it takes is one excited nip and the result could be a massacre for your cat. Please separate them, especially when you are not there.",

Right now, your dog is getting most value out of chasing your puppy, part of this is prey drive kicking in. I\u2019d recommend fulfilling your dog\u2019s prey instinct in other ways; structured play through flirt pole, fetch, etc. I say structured in that you introduce obedience into the play, overtime. It\u2019ll take some maturity for your dog to really grasp it, but if you start now, your dog should learn to listen to you at times when it really wants something. More value comes from you. Pair this with working on recall, especially around the cat, and the dog\u2019s value of the cat overtime should go down.\nI\u2019d also put up baby gate to give your cat some space from the dog when it needs it. \n\nAbove is what I did with my GSD, took probably until the dog was close to 2 before she fully disengaged from the cat.
