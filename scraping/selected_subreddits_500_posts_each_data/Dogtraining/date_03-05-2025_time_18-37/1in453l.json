    "selftext": "My 6 year old lab is obsessed with fetch. When I rescued him at 4.5 years old, he didn\u2019t play with anything\u2014I had to teach him what toys were and how to fetch. Now, he loves chasing balls and sticks, but we\u2019re still working on the bringing it back part. He\u2019ll drop the ball just out of reach, and I\u2019m trying to teach him \u201ccloser,\u201d but he dosent he just barks and barks and BARKS. \n\nI try to praise him on the rare occasion he does bring it close enough, but consistency is\u2026 a work in progress. Treats don\u2019t really help because the second he sees them, he forgets about the ball entirely and just cycles through all the tricks he knows. I also try to turn away/ignore him when he barks, but he will not stop unless we change activities or I give in (I know) \n\nWould love any advice on how to reinforce actually bringing the ball back without getting stuck in the endless bark-loop!\n",
