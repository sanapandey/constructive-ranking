    "selftext": "Hi all! I\u2019ve got a few training questions - I think they\u2019re kinda nuanced so I\u2019m providing as much information as I can to give context. I think I have a grasp on the basics of training but I feel like I\u2019m not as grounded when things aren\u2019t black and white. Maybe it\u2019s time to work with a trainer, but maybe this is something I\u2019d be able to sort out with some guidance from some strangers on the internet. \n\nI currently have a 4 month old Bernedoodle, Maverick, and a 16 year old Malshi, Charley. my questions pertain to Maverick, but some include Charley so I figured I\u2019d give background on both: \n\n Charley has always been fairly well behaved. He just exists in the house - he knows how to ask for certain things (more food, going out etc..), if he wants to be left alone he goes to the other room - basically he\u2019s just an old man living his best life. He\u2019s now mostly deaf and can\u2019t see very well - but other than that he\u2019s in great health, especially for his age. When I do need Charley to do something I whistle to get his attention and then he figures out what it is that I\u2019m telling him on his own (being its time to go upstairs for bed or I have your food over here etc). But being so old he doesn\u2019t want to play. He has no problem being near Maverick when Maverick isn\u2019t trying to play with him. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m doing really well with Maverick\u2018s training. I\u2019ve had him for just over a month at this point. He knows his basic commands (come, sit, stay, lay). He\u2019s not chewing on things that he\u2019s not supposed to, he knows I have to \u2018release\u2019 him when his food is put out. He\u2019s doing great with crate training - he sleeps through the night in his crate with no accidents, when I have to go out he takes a few minutes to calm down when I put him in his crate. He\u2019s doing great potty training (one accidental dribble in the last 2 weeks, knows the bells on the door are to go out for potty, knows \u201cgo potty\u201d). But he is a puppy so biting is something we\u2019re working through.\n\n 1)  My first situational question is about distractions in training: in a controlled environment he knows his name, the commands and responds great! Generally on walks he\u2019s great. He doesn\u2019t really tug on the leash except when he sees someone / or a dog / or whatever it may be that causes this, he starts tugging on the leash and is laser focused. it\u2019s like his ears turn off. What I\u2019m currently doing is I stop walking, I keep the leash tight (it\u2019s a 5ft leash if that) and work my way towards him till I\u2019m on top of him, able to get his attention and redirect telling him to sit and stay. He usually listens at this point. We wait until the distraction has passed and then we continue with our walk. Should I be doing something different? \n\nBut then same thing in my (small) yard and in other circumstances. Usually he listens well but occasionally he doesn\u2019t. For example he gets a wood chip (or anything else he isn\u2019t supposed to chew/eat) and I cannot get him to listen to any commands/ let me get near him to take the wood chip away. Even with treats, he\u2019d rather have the thing he\u2019s not supposed to have. This usually only happens in the side yard - so should I still keep him on a leash in the yard right now? Or is this something I should keep working on in the way I\u2019m doing it? This leads into the next question \n\n 2)  My next question is about behaviors that are a no go: one example is we have ferns and some other little green plants in the yard and he loves to tear them out (not dig them out, bite into the foliage and pull). \nThe other example is his rough play with Charley: Charley is good at trying to remove himself from the room, or come to me for help when Maverick is too much for him. Though Charley almost never does anything to correct this behavior himself. I\u2019m really struggling on getting Maverick to understand that certain behaviors with Charley are not acceptable. At first, I tried to let them sort it out but Maverick had only gotten rougher (not aggressive, just rough housing) but with Charley being 16 I\u2019m afraid Maverick is going to hurt him. Charley has a separate room where Maverick is not allowed. When Maverick is  going into that room I say \u201cMaverick no\u201d and he understands not to go there.\n\nI was doing some reading on teaching a dog \u201cno\u201d because Charley (as long as I can remember) just understood \u201cno\u201d means whatever he\u2019s doing, I don\u2019t want him to do. But upon my reading a lot of people were asking \u201cwhat do you mean by no? Do you mean stop what you\u2019re doing, look at me\u201d etc. So should I be using different word for different behaviors / situations? I understand the concept of rewarding behaviors that you want, but I guess I\u2019m struggling with behaviors you don\u2019t want. We\u2019ve been working on \u201cleave it\u201d when he\u2019s trying to go for a shoe (there\u2019s only one pair of shoes he wants to go for) and he understands. I\u2019ve been generalizing \u201cleave it\u201d to start encompassing anything that\u2019s in his mouth such as the plants or my sleeve - but is that too general? Like when he takes the shoe I cant just let him have at it, wait for him to stop chewing on it, then reward him for that? So in this instance I\u2019ve gotta train for the behavior of leaving something alone (like, the shoe, or whatever it might be)? Or should I just redirect him every single time with \u201ccome\u201d or \u201csit\u201d? But then that leads me to the issue of when he\u2019s hyper fixated on something he struggles to listen. \n\n 3) My last question is much more simple: when he jumps up on someone/ puts paws on the counter we\u2019ve been  trying to figure out whether using a specific command like \u201cdown\u201d or if we should instead tell him \u201csit\u201d? \n\nIf it should be \u201cdown\u201d - then when he jumps on the couch (we only want him to be on the couch when invited - so as of right now the couch is just off limits) can that also be down, or should that be a different command?\n\nIs this all normal stuff and it sounds like I\u2019m doing a good job? Are there resources that you can point me to that might help me better understand training in more fluid situations? Or maybe it\u2019s just time to bite the bullet on a trainer? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m at the point of feeling like I need a trainer, especially since they start at $300+ in my area. But any an all advice / criticism/ guidance is greatly appreciated ",

                    "body": "So I\u2019ve read the wiki - the sections that apply under \u201cI want to post about\u201d - and while they are helpful I\u2019m struggling to utilize those guides in my situation and which I think a post might be helpful. \n\nFor example one of the things is as I want to post about misbehaves -> multi dog household -> playing too rough. I have already been following what the guides suggest before I even read through them. It suggests not letting rough play last too long. Making sure the elderly dog has somewhere to go etc. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing that - my elderly dog has its own room where it feels safe and happy. We have gates set up so the puppy cannot get to the elderly dog. And any time they interact is when I\u2019m present. I reward the puppy when he plays appropriately, yet it always escalates to playing too rough. Though maybe the playing too rough is more subjective and I\u2019m overreacting - as I\u2019m worried that my older dog may be hurt. I\u2019m hoping that there are perspectives that I\u2019m missing / aren\u2019t in the guide. I have a fairly good grasp on my older dogs personality/temperament. And maybe the consensus is that I need to hire a trainer - but I\u2019d like to exhaust my options before I spend $300+ on a trainer. \n\nOn my dog listening / not listening - I\u2019m struggling to find information of when my dog has situational deafness - such as he knows all his commands really well with no distractions but when he has something he wants (or specifically something I don\u2019t want him to have) he doesn\u2019t listen at all. And maybe I\u2019m missing something or there\u2019s a question I\u2019m not thinking to answer to be able to solve this. I try. \n\nI can keep going through each example and question I\u2019ve posed with the same double checking of the dog training wiki and compare to my descriptions if need be but I hope that 1) the post alone is detailed enough to support that I\u2019m aware of my shortcomings to the point of realizing I need help outside of what I\u2019ve been able to find directly online, or biting the bullet and hiring a trainer. Today was a very frustrating day with the puppy, which is expected but it has me second guessing what I\u2019m doing and asking people on the internet to critique me, maybe reframe how I view situations etc would be very helpful for me. \n\nAt the very least if this post doesn\u2019t get approved the post itself was cathartic to write, and going through the wiki reinforced that most of what I understand is accurate - but the parts that I don\u2019t understand I don\u2019t seem to be able to answer. But at the very least - it would be helpful if someone with an outside perspective sees this and says \u201cyep it\u2019s time for you to get a trainer\u201d",

            "body": "I don\u2019t have experience training puppies, but it sounds like you\u2019re expecting a lot of self control for such a young dog and might be better off controlling the environment to reduce temptations. For example, the shoes he\u2019s obsessed with should be shut in a closet or high up on a shoe rack he can\u2019t reach. The plants should be fenced off, leash him in the side yard, etc. \n\nFor behaviors you don\u2019t want, think about training an incompatible acceptable behavior instead of saying \u201cno\u201d to stop the unacceptable behavior. So sit or sticky paws are incompatible with jumping, place is incompatible with begging, and fetching a toy is incompatible with barking. The earlier you can interrupt the bad behavior the better, and ideally you preempt it before it starts so the dog doesn\u2019t rehearse and reinforce the bad behavior pattern. For simplicity\u2019s sake I would keep the verbal cues separate- if down means get off the couch I would use a different word to mean get off the counter. \n\nI think you\u2019re off to a great start and could probably read to learn more instead of hiring a trainer. How to Behave So Your Dog Behaves and The Other End of the Leash might be good books to start with.",

            "body": "So I'm not a professional, but I am currently enrolled in a basic training group class with my 7.5 month old lab mix because I reached a similar point as you, so I will try to impart what I've learned from that class so far in addition to prior experience working with dogs.\n\n1) My dog turns his ears off when there's something that's really caught his attention. We used the example of bunnies in the neighborhood on walks when asking the trainer for suggestions, and she suggested finding a super high value treat that is ONLY used to maintain his focus through distractions (she's a fan of recommending smelly treats such as hot dogs, or frozen Kong cheese on a stick, etc). From my own experience, working very slowly to increase the distractions as he's able to maintain focus helps to set him up for success. Also, if possible, preemptively asking for his focus if you can see a trigger coming before he does, and treating through the distraction, helps teach them to focus on you when they see triggers. Although my methods from experience haven't been super helpful with my current guy and I generally have to do the same as you, sit and stay until whatever distracted him has passed, or dragging him past houses he's previously seen bunnies while he desperately searches for them. So now we're working on shorter focus walks where he only walks if he focuses on me and listens. If he starts failing too much, we turn around and go home.\n\nWhen it comes to wood chips or other things you don't want him to have, try working on \"bring it here\" and \"drop it\" with toys, treat him when he comes to you and/or exchange the toy for a treat, and gradually work up to random things he finds on the ground. I use a super excited voice: \"oh my goodness, what did you find? Oh wow, let me see! Bring it here!\" I then trade a treat for the item and then give the item back if it's a toy or acceptible nature-made thing he found. You can also work on \"leave it\" in a similar manner, by holding a big treat or toy in one hand, saying \"leave it\" and as soon as he settles and his focus is on you, he gets a treat from the other hand. That can progress to the treat/toy/etc on the ground all the way up to the ferns he likes to tear up, but I would recommend leashing him to aid in regaining control/focus if he fails. Although I would recommend fencing your plants off as some could be toxic to him and it's easier to just prevent access in the first place.\n\n2) I use \"no\" as a quick stand in cue and it generally is successful at breaking their focus long enough for the true command, \"come\"/\"leave it\"/\"stop\"/\"off\"/etc. Something I've learned from class is the \"yes\" cue so there's no confusion as to the desired vs undesired behaviors, because understandably no one wants to hear \"no\" and nothing else. Don't forget the reward for listening to \"no\"/\"leave it\" with his favorite pair of shoes!\n\n3) I personally use \"off\" as the command for not jumping, not counter surfing, not mounting, etc. (basically 4-paws on the ground) as \"down\" is the same as your \"lay.\" Unfortunately I found out today during a \"Get a Handle on Jumping\" class that jumping on people and counter surfing are two COMPLETELY different behaviors and require different approaches. Jumping on people means disengaging when he jumps and only approaching for pets/giving attention when he's calm and/or sitting. Make sure whoever is greeting him approaches in a calm and neutral way as that will help him stay calm and neutral. You can also drop treats on the ground with a \"find it\" command any time he meets a new person to keep all 4 paws on the ground, or asking him to get a toy. As for counter surfing, the only suggestion I got was to clear all surfaces of things he might want for a while until he stops trying to search.\n\nFrom past experience and reassurance from my trainer, this is all normal puppy behavior and (with work) will ease with time and maturity. But boy has consistent training helped with the possible working breed mix I have now! I wish you good luck and remember consistency through all people he meets will be key!",

That's normal.  Your using the down command is very good in this situation.   They aren't doing right in situation 1 then down to stop that.  A good down stay is very important almost more important than a good recall.  It really is normal for them to be perfect at home then act up out in public.  Just keep at it.  It gets better.",

Something that may help with the excitement interest in other dogs is ensuring he has some appropriate exposure/ experience with dogs you know. Are you able to take him for a walk worth a friend with a dog so that he can meet some new safe dogs that aren\u2019t part of his household? Combine this with the method you\u2019re using now to get his attention, walking up the line and rewarding sooner, then move him away for something else fun with you like a treat scatter. By making the move back towards you fun and rewarding when he sees something he\u2019s interested in, you make it easier for him to make that choice instead of \u2018I\u2019m interested in that thing but I just have to move away from it and then sit\u2019 to \u2018oh there\u2019s that exciting thing, but if I turn back to my human we\u2019re going to play a fun game / sniff out some treats from the floor which is nearly as fun as the fun thing I just saw\u2019",
