    "selftext": "So recently I've been living with my mother for 2-3 months and she decided to adopt a puppy for my little brother. However, I have a 2 year old female cat. She is really chill and curious, mostly friendly with other animals. She is a low energetic Scottish Fold. The puppy is the exact opposite. An extremely energetic puppy who mostly runs around the house and wants to bite everything. I have never trained a puppy and my mother/little brother are not good at doing so. Its completely different than training a cat, to my surprise. You can redirect a cat. You cant really redirect this little fella.\n\n  \nAt first I had them on separate rooms and traded shirts/stuff with each other's smell. The puppy of course is young and doesnt really pay attention but my cat is interested and kept smelling them. She would then sit near the door of the puppy and stay there. Then I decided to slowly introduce them and holy hell puppy goes crazy when she sees my cat. Starts running extremely close to her and freaks her out. She hisses and tries to scratch her with her claws (in a defensive way though) and then runs away. Im afraid she might scratch her eye or something. Puppy also goes inside my cat's house and bites it. I know she wants to play of course and sniff lol but my cat obviously doesnt like this. Now, I will leave in like 1-2 months so this problem will no longer exist but I dont want to keep them separate until then because the house isnt too big and I want them to be able to enjoy all the spaces that they like. \n\n  \nAlso Im kinda afraid that if this keeps happening my cat will hate me at the end or get jealous, thinking that the puppy is taking all her space. Any tips please? Thank you!",

And it's why puppy Gates exist.   \nOf course puppies can be redirected, but you have to redirect them into something puppies are interested in. Right now the existence of something else close to its size that is living, like the littermates it was separated from, are far more interesting than the two-legged things.  \n\nMom should be engaging a trainer ASAP.  If no one has ever had a dog before, this could be a tremendous challenge.   The worst dog owners I've met had no real life experience in boundaries limitations, appropriate ways of disciplining and teaching a dog.",

            "body": "Hey! My brother used to have a Scottish fold who sadly passed away this past year (pretty sure he was 16). Anyways we were roommates when I adopted my husky. I kept my husky (Genghis) and the cat (Casper) separated by a baby gate for what ended up being a couple months. The gate allowed them to see each other and interact without Casper getting overstimulated (he was born with a heart murmur so we were mostly concerned Genghis was going to give him a heart attack or something) a few times a day I would sit on one side of the gate or the other, and I would give them both cat treats. I had lots of training to do with Genghis so Casper just ended up being a very supportive audience. Neither of them had to be next to the gate, there was plenty of house on either side to retreat to, but they learned the positive association and soon they were plotting against the world together, and cuddling too! \n\nI will say, I worked ALOT on Genghis\u2019s impulse control. Teaching him to lay down anytime he was being a little too much was really important. I would make him wait to eat treats as I laid them out one by one, he caught on that the longer he waited, the more treats he got. This made it so I could eventually give both him and Casper treats when they were sitting inches from each other, the rule was that Casper always got to have treats first, if there was an obvious \u201cfirst\u201d. \n\nThe baby gate/treat game combo/basic obedience training, you can\u2019t skimp on any of it, but I\u2019ve done it now with 3 dogs and 3 cats. They all have different personalities and hurdles (literally, Casper couldn\u2019t really jump, but Lucy and Levon could). Not to be alarmist, but i worked at the humane society for a few years and there are a lot of dogs who get surrendered because they killed the family\u2019s cat, your cat probably knows that. Your cat needs to be allowed to set boundaries, learn to recognize when your cat is setting those boundaries and help her! Otherwise your dog is going to be her biggest enemy and no one will win. #1 rule has to be CATS RULE and dogs do indeed drool but we know they\u2019re so much more than that \ud83d\ude07",
