    "selftext": "Wiki says to reward every time after you mark, even once the marker is \"loaded\". Even says that if you don't, Fido may become a pessimist and be slower in learning new things. What are you supposed to do when you want to reinforce something that you can't practically immediately reward in a traditional way? Say I want to reward Fido for going to a location remote to me. I thought those situations were what a marker word/sound is for. ",

You can also have different markers which act as cues for different behaviours in terms of reinforcer *delivery*. For example, marker A can mean \u201cgood job, come back to me for a reinforcer\u201d and marker B can mean \u201cgood job, stay where you are, I\u2019m coming to you with a reinforcer\u201d. So if you use marker B, as long as he sees you *start* to approach, that anticipation will itself help him understand the reinforcer is on its way despite the delay.",

            "body": "There are other forms of rewards such as environmental, play and even releasing to another behavior. When a dog is becoming fluent in a behavior we can utilize delayed rewards or even string behaviors together and then reward after. \n\nI love markers but as my dog has become fluent in behavior I am less likely to mark with an intentional physical reward cue (YES/click) and instead mark with a you are on the right track (good job, very nice) you did the thing now enjoy the environmental reward (access to a new space, access to sniff new stuff). \n\nI still use markers but they are very intentional to the point that I may use a yes marker as a preemptive interrupter before my dog gets the opportunity to make a bad decision and instead come to me and get a reward. There are also location specific markers. I have ones that mean you always be rewarded on my side in heel. Even if that means you are a hundred yards away. There are access to environmental stimuli like freeing to go sniff after a few behaviors or freeing to go play or say hello to a social dog in the environment after doing a number of behaviors (go sniff, go say hi). The mark becomes the reward. \n\nSometimes very quickly the marker becomes the reward placement. Like I do agility and a back foot target on an object is heavily reinforced. My dog gets verbally marked even when we have transitioned off of food. Because the mark to hold a stay before release off an obstacle becomes the behavior necessary to get the reward of running the rest of the course. \n\nLatency can happen so it\u2019s important to diversify and randomize rewards. Again rewards don\u2019t always have to be food. The other thing is making sure the dog is fluent in the behavior and the criteria isn\u2019t too high in the moment. For example, a dog might do a beautiful sit, down stand sequence at home, committed and focused to get a reward but once outdoors around smells and distractions much more sloppy and slow. This is because the criteria is likely to high. The dog is too distracted and the behaviors asked are too difficult in the environment. Breaking the behavior back down especially if it can be made into very short, dynamic games and building the fluency up will strengthen the dog\u2019s ability to do the behavior well and promptly when asked.",

It's not more effective at *teaching* a new behaviour, nor is it the right choice for maintaining the majority of common behaviours. \n\nIn any case, even in an intermittent reward system, you still want to withhold both the marker *and* the followup reinforcer in a non-reinforced trial. You don't want to unlink the marker from the reinforcer.",

The clicker is used because it\u2019s faster and more dynamic to let the dogs know they will get a treat. Once they understand the behavior you want then you can reward with praise. To me, once they understand they shouldn\u2019t always get a good reward. Praise or play should be good enough. Does that answer your question?",

It's also important to consider how important is the particular behavior you're reinforcing.\n\nSo to me, recall, drop it/leave it, and wait (i.e. stop immediately and do not take another step forward) are the 3 behaviors where I care the most that my dog responds immediately every single time. Therefore, I reward with treats + praise almost every single time. For a particularly fast leave it or if my dog drops something of very high value, he gets a bonus (3 small pieces of a treat in a row). \n\nBut for all cues, I'll still use intermittent reinforcement with food, even with a simple \"trick\" like spin.",

(Because I've worked on training both hearing and non-hearing, I use both visual verbal and auditory markers: clicker or\"YES\" and a thumbs up )  \n\n These markers are to let the dog know that they have earned the reward and it is forthcoming. It is desirable once they understand the marker leads to a reward that the reward be gradually delayed a little bit to teach the dogs Patience and impulse control.    \n\nThen when I say gradual, the first step is just simply moving my hand more and more slowly toward their mouth to deliver the treat.  \n\nAnd of course if you're working on a stay or a place cue and you started to back up or add distraction there will naturally be some delay between the marker, and you returning to the dog to deliver the actual reward.",
