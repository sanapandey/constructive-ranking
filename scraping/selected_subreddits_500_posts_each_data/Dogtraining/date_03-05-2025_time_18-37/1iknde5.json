    "selftext": "My neighbours dog has had barking issues and I believe anxiety issues and usually barks through the wall at me when I'm in my room making noise. (we share a wall on one side of the house) this is like daily. I understand they probably can't afford to train the dog as they were redoing the house and had a baby, I'm not asking to be told to tell them to train it.\nMy question is would meeting the dog, maybe agreeing with the neighbours maybe I can say her name through the wall after so she recognises it's just me the neighbour? would allowing her to come to my room to like make sense of it being a solution? I know these a bizzare solution but I wanna try and do my part as I am kind of the reason for the problem. any suggestions would help x\n\n(sorry if my post doesn't fit the guide I did read it)\n\n\nOkay, updated information below \ud83d\udc47 \n\nI live in a connected houses rather than an apartment (vv British thing I believe) so we share an entire side of the house plus the garden with them, so my room, bathroom, dining room, kitchen garden.\nIf you make noise in any part of the house that is closest and if she's not either in the active company of someone else (petting playing I think), doing something or eating sleeping, maybe playing not sure, she will run to the closest wall and bark, and bark at any noise. \nI do think the neighbours did try to train her or maybe she was on meds or smth because there was a like good half a year(?) where she was not barking like much at all.\nI understand having a dog like this is very stressful and angering and they do often take out their anger by shouting at the dog, which gets her to stop for like 5 minutes and then if you make a noise again she barks again non stop.\nusually she stops by saying her name and stop and like shush but it's usually only for a minute or 2\nThis has been happening for like 4/5 years, \ud83d\ude2d usually I can drown it out but like because I've quit my job I'm home all the time so she's like always barking and I feel awful because my neighbour it on maternity leave and is focusing on the baby and is home alot and the dog is always barking.\n\nI am going to ask my neighbour if they would be willing to try this and I'm sure they would be down as we have always been on good neighbourly terms and helping them out sometimes x\nI'll probably do it some time this week so I'll probably make an update post? or edit it I'm not quite sure yet \n\nThank you for all the suggestions, I'll ping some comments just to notify about the update x",

I have gotten all 5 people in the household to spend a little time greeting him and saying hello and being really kind every time they come in the house and he now does not bark at any of those people where as before he was just wigging out when he heard them. So anything that works toward familiarizing yourself with this dog will be helpful. Also I was told in a training class to try to give or say a special word in a special way (like hello in a falsetto)so that the dog recognizes that specifically to you. I do believe these things help. So glad and impressed that you are approaching this issue with the \u201chow can we make this work\u201d momentum. Let us know how it goes.",

They bark at scary unknowns but are also pretty good at learning what's normal. So my thought is just help them learn what the normal noises are.\n\nSo you could tell your neighbors about this idea and let them know that you are willing to help if they want to bring the dog over to investigate what you are up to that is currently scaring them.",

Ultimately, your neighbor can open your door and let go of the lead. The dog will find you giving treats and praise. \n\nThe only potential problem is if the dog falls in love with you. It\u2019ll hear you and want you. The bark will likely be a whimper, which is more easily \u201cun\u201d trained if the owner understands training.  \n\nYour neighbor should love this suggestion. If they don\u2019t you\u2019ll have to contact management. The dog can be trained now, frankly.",

            "body": "If they scold the dog, the dog is probably afraid of them. That means she either doesn't bark in their presence or barks much less. Not out of good behavior, but out of fear.\n\nIf the dog is not flat-out suffering from isolation disorder (panic when left alone while the owner goes out), she is being reactive to sounds on your side of the wall and then barking because of barrier frustration, much like a dog barks at the window after seeing another dog passing by. In any case, it's unlikely they will be able to effectively train her out of this behavior on their own if they have been scolding her; she is too afraid of them to be able to effectively focus on any training they provide. Sure she might respond for treats, but then immediately revert as soon as the treats stop, or even just reduce in value, because she's doing it for the treats, but still has the underlying fear of her owners.\n\nI would honestly recommend they engage a veterinary behaviorist for help with the anxiety and/or reactivity. Yes, they are expensive; they're doggy psychologists, and most pet insurance policies do not cover them. But if they claim they don't have the money for it, then I would advise them to consider rehoming the dog to someone who does have the resources to meet her needs, and perhaps avoid getting another dog until they have their finances in enough order to meet any special needs that may arise, such as this. Frankly, mental health concerns are not just for people, but our pets as well.\n\nOf course, if they're not cooperative - which I suspect they probably won't be - then I would go to management complaining, repeatedly. It's not fair to you or the dog to be left barking like this all the time, especially in connected housing with shared walls.\n\nGood luck!",

If it's me, I just call to him to let him know it's only me and he quiets instantly and comes to greet.\n\n So this sounds like a great thing to try out!",

Catching the behavior before she has the chance to bark, and redirect, is how to get rid of it - but they can at least not reinforce the unwanted behavior by joining in, and controlling the environment to make it less likely to happen.
