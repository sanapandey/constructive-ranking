    "selftext": "Hi, \n\nI have a 2 year old field golden retriever. He is great but we are having problem with recall. \n\nHe has good recall, it is the speed he approaches us that is the problem. He runs full speed at us, we have to move out the way fast, I\u2019m worried we will fall and cause an injury as he\u2019s a big dog. \n\nHow do I get him to slow down on approach? Without compromising the good recall? \n\nThanks ",

So if you reward with food, throw it a little bit in front of you, or if it's a ball, you can bounce it in front of you.\n\nAlternatively, you could see if you can teach him the reward ends in a certain other behavior, like a sit or a nose touch, whatever you'd like for that. I'd practice by having him pretty close to you, recalling and them immediately giving him the cue for the other behavior. In time he will probably start offering that other behavior without the second cue. \n\nOr if quickly offering the second cue doesn't work you can combine it with the first approach. So reward in front of you, then give the second cue and reward for that. Over time start fading that first reward.",

As a result, the dog would return to my side (as opposed to directly at me). The idea behind holding the treat in this specific position was that coming to your side makes it easier to clip him quickly when you need to put him on a shorter leash, but yeah I guess it also helps to not get run over when your dog comes in hot.\n\nNever had to try it, but I like the idea of putting your arms and legs out as he gets closer to make yourself look bigger. That will not just slow the dog down, but any animal approaching you. LOL. Hopefully the dog picks up on the pattern quickly and you won't have to do jumping jacks all the time to get your dog to pump the brakes.\n\nGood luck!",
