    "selftext": "Just took my pup for a walk and sat down on a bench for a while do some people watching. This woman with a tiny dog started walking directly towards us. I repeated \u2018can you give us space\u2019 about 10 times and she just kept saying \u2018huh?\u2019 while walking closer. She brought her dog all the way up to us and my then got excited and lunged at hers (in a friendly way, but still not okay and what I\u2019m trying to train him not to do). It really annoyed me but I also feel a bit defeated because I did really try to keep her away and feel like I failed. My pup will probably be fine but I really don\u2019t want to expose him to too many situations like that because one time it might not be fine.\n\nI struggle to speak up in general, but I try my best to advocate for my dog. I\u2019m apparently not very good at it though so I\u2019m looking for some advice on \n1) a script to say that people will understand, as apparently \u2018can you give us space\u2019 is not clear? \nAnd 2) a phrase I can put on my dog to help get the message across without having to interact with other people. I\u2019ve considered one of those yellow \u2018give me space\u2019 leads or a blue \u2018in training\u2019 one but not sure how effective they are. \n\nI\u2019ve tried \u2018in training\u2019 and \u2018do not pet\u2019 patches on his harness. Highly ineffective \ud83d\ude02 people would stroke him while asking while they couldn\u2019t..???? If they even noticed the patches. They\u2019re lucky he\u2019s really friendly, but he\u2019s a big dog and he\u2019s still learning manners and I really need space to be able to allow him to learn to be less amped up around dogs/people. I am working with my pup on disengaging from distractions but at the moment, he often stares and really wants to go and say hello, which people think is cute \ud83d\ude44 So like today, it\u2019s not always possible for me to be the one to walk away from a situation to get space unless I forcefully drag him which I\u2019d rather not do unless it\u2019s a safety issue as I think that\u2019s just adding tension to a situation. Pls help, I\u2019m starting to hate the general public and becoming a bit bitter \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The pony's less likely to be spooked (safer for us) and the dog won't get hurt. \n\nI remember when I was about 11 and riding my mum's Welsh Cob (ifkyk!) on the Common, while she was walking. This GSD came charging up to us, owner yells \"He's friendly!\" He's all up in her business, so she kicks him (prey animal, predator attacking. He seemed OK, it was a glancing blow). He starts yelling at me. Mum steps out and *rips* into him, I've rarely heard her so mad.\n\nAll that to say, *your* dog might be friendly. You dont know about the other dog/horse/person. And defense can be aggressive, too.",

The definition I found is that they are a small group led by a charismatic leader who isolates their followers from family and friends. Most also require turning over personal possessions to the group. None of that fits JWs. As any other mainstream Christian religion, we are worldwide with over 8 million baptized members and follow the teachings in the Bible - not that of any one man. One of which is the command by Jesus in Mat 28:19, 20, which tells us to \"Go therefore and make disciples of people of all nations, ... teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.\" We do not isolate ourselves. You will find us in several different walks of life. Even a few celebrities (such as Prince, George Benson, Damon Wayans). We view family as important (even if they don't accept our beliefs). We have no tithing and are only to give what we are willing and what would not take away from what is needed to care for our families. If it's just that you view all religions as cults. Then I all I can say is you are entitled to your opinion. Either way, no hard feelings.",

And all the rest can stay away :D\n\nAlso, worst worst case:\n\nShake a can of pepper spray or something that looks like it towards them/their dog. They won't like it, but it'll keep them away for sure (carrying actual pepper spray is ideal for emergencies - I've seen people without it try to separate their bite locked dogs in exactly the wrong ways and I can never unsee it, so I have some with me now)",

            "body": "Some people just have mental tunnel vision and can't see anything but themselves. For example, if you have a small dog and see a giant terrier up ahead, why would you go anywhere near it? For all the training in the world, terriers have been bred for hundreds if not thousands of years specifically to chase down and tear apart anything significantly smaller than them. \n\nFortunately, these cases are few and far between, but in such cases, you may have to withdraw your dog instead - meaning, in this example, if the other person with the dog isn't heeding your requests to stay away, you may have to move away with your dog instead, to create the necessary space to keep the peace.\n\nFair, unfair, or indifferent, we need to manage our dogs' reactivity triggers while we are training them to redirect to more appropriate behaviors, such as sitting patiently and waiting for some kind of acknowledgment (reward) from us. \n\nIt also sounds like your dog pulls the leash a lot since you mention that is difficult for you to actively withdraw from these situations without actually dragging the dog. If this is the case, you have to work on loose leash walking first. Search for how to do that, and do those training sessions for 30 minutes per session, maybe a couple of times a day, in your backyard or driveway or other nearby areas safely away from sidewalks and roads instead of walking along streets/roads with dangerous vehicular traffic. Sure you might not get far, and you might spend the whole half hour just walking back and forth on the same 20' of ground, but your dog will be exhausted. He should not be taken anywhere near vehicular traffic until he masters that. Struggling with a pulling dog, especially larger breeds, can be dangerous not only to you and your dog (what happens if you can't hold him back from bolting at something across the street through heavy traffic?) but also to other people around you and/or their dogs.\n\nOnce he's able to walk on a loose leash in a calm neighborhood setting (no other people/dogs around within his trigger range), then you can start introducing him to such things - first maybe at a distance across and down the street, then maybe directly across the street, then same side of the street, but passing wide of each other. Then closer and saying hi. It must be gradual so the dog isn't overwhelmed.",

It's not acceptable to let your dog lunge at other dogs even if people are being rude and coming too close. I know that's frustrating, but you're the only one who's responsible for your dog and other people have the right to use the public sidewalk. You can't count on other people's cooperation, especially when they have a legal right to be there. \n\nI would recommend shortening the leash, using a traffic handle, grabbing your dog's harness or collar, etc and physically stepping in front of your dog. If you can, turn around and walk the other way. \n\nIf you aren't comfortable doing that then I would recommend using a muzzle, not just as a signal to others, but also as an essential safety tool. \n\nAgain, I know it really sucks. I wish that people were more aware of reactivity and I wish that people minded their own business and gave everyone else space, but they don't. We have to be responsible for our dogs and advocate for our dogs because nobody else will. You need to be able to ensure safety no matter what. If you can't do that then it's an incident waiting to happen.",

I work at a dog friendly place and often get people that come in not understanding that you shouldn't distract a working dog. The least stressful way to handle this I've found is taking an exaggerated step back or two. Sometimes, loudly saying \"leave it\" not that my dog needs the cue, but a lot of people seem to get that as my dog isn't friendly, which works for what I want. To get space.\n\nWhen my guy is not working, say at a park or something and someone tries to approach the \"HE BITES\" works like a charm almost every time.",

We eventually trained her out of that and she stopped, but better to start much earlier. \n\nAnyways, if you see them approaching, you can turn and cross the street. Do a turn, because that makes your dog face away from them. If that isn't an option and you have a puppy that just won't move, bribe them with a treat to move, with a command que of course, like \"let's go\" or \"leave it.\" I like using leave it for when they want to grab an object though, then take your treat up to their nose and guide their line of sight and smell off the other dog or owner. Eventually you won't need the treat anymore. Ours was stubborn and when she wanted to say hi to a dog or person, she would fully prone to the ground and not move, which made it much more harder for us to move away. If your dog does this, you need to catch them before they prone, when they're on all four legs still. This is obviously the less abrasive sort of approach I'd say and it will also at the same time train your dog to take their attention off of things back onto you. \n\nThe other approach is to simply just firmly say \"Sorry, we're training right now.\" Simple and straight to the point. 99% of people and dog owners will understand. You don't need to say \"NOT friendly,\" I think that's just unnecessary and if you do want to make some dog friends in the neighborhood one day with your pup, it might make things difficult as they think your dog isn't friendly.",

Coming closer to hear what it is would be a sensible response in that case, though obviously it's the opposite of what you want. \n\nI think \"Not Friendly, stay back!\" Is clearer. Especially with clear body language, like someone else suggested - arm extended, palm out. It's not a question, and even if you miss some of the words it's clearly a \"stay back\" vibe. Resist the urge to smile while you say it! \n\nIf you are concerned your dog may snap at someone or something, a muzzle is a sensible choice. It will also reduce the chances of people spontaneously approaching. \n\nI think it's also really important though to remember that all training in public spaces is unpredictable. That's part of it, after all - we can train away in private, but it's the unpredictable nature of other people and pets that make doing it \"in the wild\" so different. It's why it's important, and it's also why it's hard. So I'd say expecting occasions like this where you simply cannot teach the lesson you want to teach, and not stressing too much about them, is important.",

I doubt he will ever actually need a muzzle at any point in time but I've realized that muzzles are a great deterrent for dense people who just walk up to other dogs with their dogs, or even approach/pet without asking first. I use it when training out in public because he's a very nervous dog and people think since he's cute and small they all need to say hi. The muzzle gives him confidence because he gets really nervous when people suddenly run up into his space (especially kids) but with the muzzle they don't do that. Different situation than yours but it is almost like putting a \"do not disturb\" sign on you and your dog. Great training tool for keeping other people away \ud83d\ude02. I also put a lot of effort into properly muzzle conditioning first so this isn't something you can do by just slapping and unfamiliar object on your dogs face out of nowhere and taking them out to train it won't work the way you've intended.",

The humans, however ... He has a yellow give me space sign on the leash, we have walked in our neighborhood for years, and there are still a few dog walkers that come up like they've never seen his display before. I've never heard a dog scream like him. We walk on off hours to reduce encounters, and I can't take them hiking anymore bc trails are full of off leash dogs and their \"he's friendly\" humans. If it's a human without dogs, he's fine. His vision is impaired also bc he had turned in lids and scarring from his wire like lashes, so that makes it worse for him. Small white fluffy dogs are especially terrifying. Maybe he can see them better. He's fine with people and very loving. He is super weird and unpredictable at times (he has suddenly run straight at me from a dead stop and jumped over me....I'm 5'6\") but in a fun way. We all freeze when he gets bouncy pouncy bc the only time he runs into you is when you move.  He is the funniest rescue dog we've had, and sings like a husky mixed with a dump truck at times.",

Who then has the \"right\" to their training? \n\nIt is different if your dog is a service dog in training, and even then, nobody *has* to listen to you. That's part of being a service dog, you don't get phased by distractions and that is done first and foremost in a private setting to ensure success in public. \n\nThat being said, if you want to achieve your training you will need to be a bit direct and frankly, rude. Loudly announce that your dog is NOT FRIENDLY, and if they continue to approach, turn around and walk away. Then go back and sit down when it's clear. It's pretty simple to be honest. You don't want people to pet your dog or approach? Leave when they don't listen to you. But again, realize nobody owes you this. It's your dog, your training program, and your problem. Whenever I walk my reactive dog I avoid people if I need to, I never expect others to make way for me.",
