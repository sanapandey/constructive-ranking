    "selftext": "Hello everyone!\n\nTo give some background, my boyfriend and I adopted a 2 year old Bernedoodle about 2 months ago. He previously lived with my boyfriend\u2019s family who had another dog in the house too (7 yr old golden doodle). We were asked to take him because they did not have enough time for him due to busy schedules, and they didn\u2019t want to continue leaving him in his crate for 6-8 hours a day as they had been previously. They lived in a suburban area in a house with a backyard where the dogs were able to run around together, but because of this, he was never (and I mean never) taken on walks or socialized really at all. They had him from when he was a puppy until we got him. \n\nMy boyfriend and I live in an apartment in a big city where there are lots of people and other dogs. We were under the impression that he was great with people but iffy with other dogs, and all he needed was some training and socialization. Keep in mind, we had not met the dog before and we were pressured into it a bit (we were told that if we don\u2019t take the dog he would be sent back to the breeder which in hindsight should have given us some clues lol\u2026). \n\nAfter getting him, we realized the amount of work it was going to take and have been making every effort to do everything right. We have upgraded his food to top-quality human grade stuff, gotten him a million toys and various enrichment activities, take him on 4-5 long walks a day, gotten him into professional training, etc etc. Despite being in an apartment, we use the app sniffspot regularly and rent a few acres of land so he can run around and play without having to stress about other dogs. Also, I work from home so he is very rarely left alone. With the amount of research and reading I have done on dog training, I feel like I could just about start my own company \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. \n\nIn the beginning, he was barking at every person we saw on our walks, and if he saw a dog, it was a full blows melt down. He would growl at people, lunge at people, the whole 9 yards. Very quickly, he adapted and has come such a long way.\n\nHe can now, sit in the elevator with 8-9 other people at a time, walk past people on the sidewalk, perform commands (sit, down, etc) outside the house / in stressful environments, not bark at other dogs when he sees them even if they bark at him (he will still try to do a stare-off), not bark every time he hears someone in the hallway (still working on this one though). He is good with other dogs at boarding (passed the temperament testing at 2 different places), and he is good at the groomer. Essentially, a 180 from when we first got him.\n\nHowever, here is my question. Do you think this dog will ever be ok with strangers petting him while he is on-leash? He is ok with strangers petting him at the dog park, and clearly ok with the groomer touching him (we haven\u2019t heard anything negative), but if we are on a walk or something and somebody tries to pet him, he will come unglued. He has never bit anyone, but he will growl and lunge or try to snap at them. I am worried that one day someone will touch him and I won\u2019t reach quick enough, and he will bite them out of fear.\n\nAny time somebody asks to pet him, we always say no. But, since he is so fluffy and always looks so happy, sometimes people just assume he is friendly. Also, I would love for him to enjoy people petting him because he is a major lover and wants physical attention from us 24/7, and I have people asking to pet him at least 5 times a day. I know some dogs just don\u2019t like strangers to touch them, but he loves when people pet him at the dog park and he will go up and try to sit in a strangers lap. Also at boarding, I watch on the cameras and see the team members petting him and he is loving every second. \n\nSomething else to note\u2026 when my boyfriend and I first met him (2 days before we took him home) he was on leash with his previous owner and walked right up to us and let us pet him and was totally fine. Then when we took him, he was stuck in a car with us for 2 days (had to drive cross-country to bring him home) and he was good with us. He snapped at us a bit if we touched somewhere he didn\u2019t like, but he was pretty much fine.\n\nSo all in all\u2026 do you think that he will ever be comfortable with people petting him on leash? Do you think that as we have him for longer he will get more used to us and his surroundings and be ok with it? Although I would love to tell people they can pet him, I obviously would rather him be comfortable so I will continue to tell them no, I am just so worried that someone will do it unexpectedly and he will freak, which is mainly why I want him to be ok with it or at the very least, desensitized to it.\n\nThank you so much, any information / feedback is welcome. Happy to answer any clarifying questions too\u2026 this whole process has been a whirlwind but we want to do what is best for him!",

            "body": "I just wanted to say you guys have done so much work and had an amazing result! He has also adjusted really quickly so his anxiety might be more learnt from not being socialized as much rather than being naturally inclined towards anxiety. This might mean that it is something he gets better with\n\nI have had many dogs and breeds and our 3 year old one now is the first one that has anxiety, its not bad, he has got a lot better, but he is just a bit more on edge and my vet has just said he is just a bit more that way as it's his biology. \n\nHowever, our process was much, much longer than yours. Yours might have been shorter because you're awesome ( I am super impressed with the dedication + SO happy he found you) but it could also be impacted by him at heart being a more chilled dog. AND if you two have chilled energy, that could also be making him feel safe and thats helping him too. \n\n  \nI do notice that when our dog is on the lead and then he is also overwhelmed by people/off lead dogs in his space, this is when he will get more stressed as he cant control the environment and leave. If he is off lead at the park or beach he doesn't care. \n\nHe is also quite sensitive to people's emotions, so if a person has high chaotic energy, he also mirrors this, if a person is calm, he is calm, so your dog might be reacting differently depending on the person?\n\nThis is just my personal experience, Im not an expert in this, just the differences I have found from dogs I have had or family members have. \n\nIf you want to stop people trying to pat him for now until he chills out, it might be worthwhile using a harness that has wording so that people dont rush him. We had one that had In Training on it. This one has [Vest-I'm Nervous 'Give Me Space!'](https://www.blackdog.net.au/vest-im-nervous-give-me-space).  Here are some other wordings [Collections \u2013 Friendly Dog Collars](https://www.friendlydogcollars.com.au/collections). \n\nI havent used either of these companies, I just have added them here so you can see the types of wording you can add. I found even just have the \"training\" written on it meant that we werent approached or crowded in so it was effective. \n\nEven though he is wonderfully fluffy, people should know not to touch a dog without asking or expect that they can touch them, they are animals and even the best ones can have a bad day. So don't feel bad about saying no, it will give him the space to ease into life and its much better than something much more horrible happening because he was frightened.",
