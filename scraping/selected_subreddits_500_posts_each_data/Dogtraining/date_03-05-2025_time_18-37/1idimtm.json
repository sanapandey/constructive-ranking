    "selftext": "My boy was attacked twice (by different dogs months apart) between 1 and 1.5 years old. He was always on a leash and walking with me while in our neighborhood. The first attack was a dog on a retractable lease that the owner seemed to forget how to use and the second was by 2 dogs that were off leash. Since the last attack which cause his leg to become infected and needed a vet visit he has shown great aggression toward other dogs. Even if they are 20 yards away, he will lunge and bark the whole 9 yards. \n\nI have tried treats, I have tried praising him when he sees dogs at a distance and hasn\u2019t reached. My best luck is covering his eyes as we walk past which keeps him externally calm but I know he panicked inside. But my answer is how do we move on??? He is a greyhound and I would love for him to be able to go to a dog park and play or simply make neighborhood friends. Is that possible? Or is it too far gone? ",

He gave the analogy that if I walked down a tunnel and got attacked in that tunnel, I would forever be afraid of walking down the tunnel and that is why my dog is always afraid of other dogs and act aggressively in an effort to scare them away.",
