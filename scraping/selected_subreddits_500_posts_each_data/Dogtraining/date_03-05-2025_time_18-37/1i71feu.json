    "selftext": "I'm looking for some objective perspectives on this situation and maybe some help because it's very emotional for all of us directly involved.\u00a0\n\n  \nTL;DR - Very sweet dog has bitten a few kids - I think its always reactivity. What are the reasonable expectations for the dog? What are the reasonable expectations for children? How can we reconcile the two so that everyone is safe?\n\nContext:\n\nMy parents have a 7 year old medium Labradoodle whom we all adore. 99.99999% of the time he is an extremely gentle, smart, kind, and affectionate dog. My mom got the dog after my dad was diagnosed with cancer. Obviously the dog is part of the family. There have been hard days for my dad with his cancer where the dog is clearly aware of the situation, will sit next to him and rest his head on his lap and be a great emotional support. A few people who train support animals have informally meet the dog and suggested he should be trained to be a story animal at the hospital or at schools etc because he seems to be so well behaved whenever he goes anywhere (malls, schools to pick up grandkids etc.) Kids have never been his favorite, but there are a few children that he clearly likes to be with. The remainder, he generally just avoids if he can and tolerates if he must. He knows my son (3 years old) and they play together very often. My son knows some of the commands and will test/command the dog and give treats when the dog obeys. They will play fetch and tug of war together. We're staying at my parents' house for a few months so they've had lots of time together.\n\nThere have been a few biting incidents in the last several years. To my recollection, there have been 3 or 4 incidents. They almost all involve a large number of guests being at his house, a lot of noise and strangers. What usually happens next, is a teenaged boy accidentally surprises the dog trying to pet him near the face, and there is a reflexive bite. Twice this has required the kids to get a few stitches. Once someone was bitten on the face. Everyone is very upset about these incidents, but  most of all my mom. I know this because I've talked to her after each of these incidents. She feels absolutely sick and says things like \"we'll have to put him down.\" My response in the past has been to point out the pattern and predictability of the situations - many guests at the house, lots of noise, a young boy spooks the dog and a defensive reflex kicks in. We've just planned to have him stay in my parents room when guests come over in the future to remove him from these stressful situations and prevent anymore bites.\n\n\n\nThe Incident:\n\nJust tonight, the dog was licking some dirty dishes and my son wanted to pet the dog. My son knows to approach from the front, not pet the face, pay attention to the dog's behavior etc, but I think he just wasn't thinking about any of that because, well, he's 3 and he sees the dog as a close friend. He surprised the dog, and the dog reflexively snapped. \n\nWe're not 100% sure what happened, but the dog growled and lunged back at my son towards his neck. There are no marks, blood, scratches etc on his neck, but my son started crying and was obviously upset.\u00a0My mom immediately reacted and scolded the dog. In the moment he lunged, she slapped the dog on the back (she knows she shouldn't do that but it was probably just as reflexive as the dog's lunge), and now the dog is in timeout for the evening. We're not trainers, but she has generally trained the dog very well and I think it's hard for her to know what to do in these situations where she is so emotional about protecting kids. My son was shaken up but he's completely okay and will want to play with the dog by the morning I'm sure.\u00a0\n\nMy immediate thought was that this was just a lunge and a growl, and it was probably the human reactions that scared my son as much as anything the dog did. But my son is pretty insistent that he wasn't scared about the dog or his grandma's reaction, but he was crying because of the pain on his neck where the dog bit him. If he was bitten, it was obviously very light because there is maybe a single pink dot on his neck if I'm really looking, but no other marks whatsoever. My mom doesn't know there was an alleged bite. If she hears my son say that his neck was bit, she will get rid of the dog and never get another (unless I can talk her out of it.) \n\nThis incident with my son was different than the previous bites. No guests/strangers for the dog, no excessive noise or overstimulation. It was just dinner. There was a treat (the dishes) which I'm sure the dog was very protective of, but little kids can't always see those situations like an adult can. I'm not sure it's reasonable to teach a 3 year old every situation in which the dog might be triggered to act that way, and then expect a 3 year old to perfectly apply that knowledge every time. I'm equally unsure at this point if its reasonable to expect a dog to spare a child from a reflex like that.I'm obviously very sick at the idea of the dog's teeth on my son's neck. On the flip side, I understand why a dog would act how he did, and I love that dog to pieces. I don't think putting him down is actually reasonable, but I'm starting to wonder if he needs to be re-homed without kids or something like that. This would be pretty devastating for everyone, including my son, but if it needs to be done for the safety of children, my mom would do this in a heartbeat. I think she might have already done it if my siblings and I hadn't been talked her down after the last incident. \n\n\n\nMy question:\n\nWhat are the reasonable expectations for the dog? What are the reasonable expectations for children? What are some options if the dog isn't living up to those expectations? I'm encouraging my mom to visit a vet and make sure there's no underlying medical issues, but are there any other professionals we should seek out to help with the reactivity? It doesn't seem to be leash related at all.\n\nAny objective insight would really be appreciated, because my judgment feels so clouded in this situation.\u00a0Thanks in advance\n\n\n\n - UPDATE - \n\nThank you everyone for your responses, this is tremendously helpful. Some of you seem ready to call either child protective services or animal protective services and I've read each of your comments - thank you. I didn't communicate EVERYTHING we've done to try and fix the situation. We have taken action at every step of the way, but evidently not the right actions. We've tried to educate ourselves along the way, but we are not professionals. Please rest assured we're not being willfully negligent. I recognize that we are ignorant in many ways though, which is again why I appreciate your help and why I am here.\n\n Neither my mom nor myself got much sleep last night because we've been ruminating on this. After work today I spoke with her and found she had already set up an appointment with her vet, and will be asking for referrals to a local behavior specialist. In the meantime we all agree that there should be absolutely no unsupervised interactions between the dog and children, and no interactions at all if the dog does not show interest in the interaction. My son knows this rule now. Previously there was no unsupervised play, but now he knows that he cannot even pet the dog without asking us first.\nHopefully the behavioral specialist can help us find a safe solution (muzzle training, crate training etc) otherwise we will be exploring more drastic options for everyone's safety. Safety is, of course, our first priority. \n\nThanks again for sharing your opinions and expertise. We are not dog trainers, but we are dog people. I grew up with an exceptionally docile black lab who loved children. We've never experienced this before so it was really hard to recognize the patterns for what they were and act appropriately because it was hard to imagine a pattern actually existing. \n\n\n - FINAL UPDATE -\n\nThank you again for all of your help and kindness. The situation is resolved. After consultation with vets and behavioral experts who know the dog well, their recommendation was to euthanize the dog. He was put down yesterday morning. We're all heart broken, but we're glad that his story can end this way. Better he is missed as a beloved member of the family than as a menace who seriously hurt someone - we are lucky we didn't get there already. \n\nI am not the dog's owner, so there are a lot of things I've learned since writing the post. My mom has seen a behavioral specialist several times since the biting started. Many of you were appropriately outraged that we weren't doing anything. Apparently we were doing more than I knew. Hopefully that fills in some blanks for you. There have been several levels of appropriate interventions. Still, we failed and this is the outcome.",

The reactivity one mostly applies to leash reactivity, so I am not sure how to apply that in this specific case - I am hoping for some advice on that.

After that, am really not sure what is the most appropriate next step here. Because of the highly emotional situation, I feel I need some outside advice on this specific situation to help me understand how serious it is or isn't, and how seriously we should be responding.

Please know that I am saying this in the spirit of sisterhood and motherhood, woman to woman, without any judgment whatsoever: you're under-reacting. \n\nYou absolutely cannot allow any further situations where the dog is loose in the presence of your 3-year-old. Use a crate, use a leash, use a muzzle, whatever. But this is a 3-year-old child who absolutely does not have the maturity to know when or how to act around a dog, and you shouldn't expect it of him. This isn't because of malice or misbehavior, it's because he's three. \n\nThis isn't because of malice or misbehavior in the dog, either, for what it's worth. He's a dog. \n\nPersonally -- and again, I'm speaking as a mom -- I would not allow the play between the dog and your baby to continue. I have a friend whose grandchild was mauled to death by the family dog in a split-second incident just like the one you describe. It was tragic and heartbreaking and the family is still haunted by it years later. In a dog with a confirmed bite history like yours, this should be a no-brainer. \n\nI don't know that the dog needs to be rehomed, however. If he's generally well-behaved around adults, the simple solution is to keep him under strict control when he's around children. No exceptions, no \"he loves the dog so much,\" no \"okay, just this once.\" I tell my kids all the time that dogs don't understand \"sometimes.\" There is \"always\" and \"never.\" \n\nSo if your dog bit once when provoked, you have to assume that he will always bite. Your kiddo comes first.",

I have trained her extensively to respect my kids space (and taught my kids to respect her space) so she is comfortable with them, knowing she doesn't have to worry and I've got her back. Kids outside? If they get in her space or make her nervous, her first strategy is to bark. If they approach (she looks cute, so this can happen and has happened in an off leash dog park that some kids were treating like a petting zoo) she will bark while backing up. Then she will run and hide. One time she hid under a park table and a kid tried to go pet her. Thankfully another dog owner (that was closer as I was trying to get over to my dog) grabbed my dog and told the kid off. I say thankfully, because being uncomfortable and nervous and backed into a hiding spot in a corner, her next response would have been to bite. Once she bites someone, she would realize that it is a very effective method of getting people to leave her alone when she is uncomfortable. \n\nAll dogs can be pushed to bite. Once they do, it becomes the go to method. Surprised dogs don't immediately bite. Nervous dogs who know that biting works will bite. It sounds like OPs dog is more sensitive and has learned the best way to get kids to go away is to use teeth. The 3 year old approaching the dog is inexcusable. My 3 year old was a bit wild and stubborn, but I made absolutely sure he knew to leave the dog alone and give her space (especially if food or treats were involved).",

The fact that you have a well trained dog means that you might be successful managing him. I would have a crate on every floor and crate him when anyone you don\u2019t completely trust is around. I would crate him during meals and not allow him to possess nice treats like dirty plates, bones, etc unless he\u2019s crated. Think carefully about whether he has guarded any other items or people, if he has, you\u2019ll need to figure out how to manage and/or train those too.\u00a0\n\nCrating him is about defending his personal space so that nobody can bother him. I think you can be successful, but you just can\u2019t trust anyone, not teens, certainly not your 3yo, so you have to defend his space yourself.\u00a0",

He should be put up in a crate in a bedroom rather than allowed to be loose. If no one has made a complaint about any of the bites. So far, you have been extremely lucky. It would not be unusual for a dog whose bite is reported to be forced to go through a 10-day quarantine, which in some cases can be at your residence, but those quarantine restrictions are lined out for you and during that quarantine the dog has no contact with anyone other than the immediate family, no kids.  It depends on your particular animal control officer and jurisdiction. If you cannot produce proof of rabies vaccine, the dog would be quarantined at a facility for 10 days to verify it does not have rabies and vaccinations would have to be brought up to date afterwards. \nYou are risking a potential lawsuit. And depending again on where you live, you are risking having the dog taken away and put down. \n\nSo simply put, for the sake of the dog, you need to stop putting the dog into situations in which it is not comfortable. Absolutely no kids including your 3-year-old. Situations where your 3-year-old can surprise the dog or get between the dog and something it desires, like licking off dinner dishes, they should not be in the same space. It seems to me I remember about 75% of the bites on very young children are to the face. I'm glad to know that was not the case for your child this time. But you are  in very dangerous Territory - statistically. \n\nFor perspective, my dog savvy oldest child was bit by the neighbor's dog when he was seven. Golden retriever. The dog was obedience trained, but was never really allowed to be a dog. The neighbor girls who used to babysit for their family, and lived with three dogs. A collie and two Australian shepherds refused to babysit because the dog was a menace. \nA year after it bit my son, after going through more advanced training and a 10-day quarantine because it was not vaccinated, it pinned a small child to the floor and nearly chewed the ear off the side of his head.  The owners were selling their house and they left the Golden loose in the house while it was being shown to a family with a three and a 4-year-old boy.  Not only did they get a great deal on buying the house but they sued because little boy needed cosmetic surgery.  \n\nDon't be these people.  Just because a dog is well trained does not mean it is friendly with everyone. So far your experience is bites with children. All of them as you describe sound like what I would call a corrective bite. The sort of snap that is perfectly acceptable between dogs, but never acceptable from dog to human.  \n\nSo if you're asking if you should euthanize, absolutely not. But you all need to be better dog owners and Don't put the dog in situations that it cannot handle. And please please please reduce the interactions with a 3-year-old.  It would devastate your parents and you if he actually connects with your child's face and leaves a permanent mark.",

This article, from the wiki, might be helpful: [Good Dogs Bite, Too: Why You Need to Understand the Bite Threshold Model](https://reactivechampion.blogspot.com/2011/09/good-dogs-bite-too-why-you-need-to.html)\n\n* The severity of the bites is troubling - according to the Ian Dunbar bite scale, it sounds like the more severe bites are around a level 3. At this point, the recommendation is that the behavior *can likely* be addressed with diligent management, but not every caretaker is able to follow through. And not to be harsh, but it sounds like your parents have not been effectively managing the behavior (thus the multiple bites of guests). They likely have not been offered advice on effective management. \n* The fact a small child is involved (are they living in the same home?) is critical; small children can create a lot of triggers unintentionally, and a small child can be permanently injured by a small, low-level bite.\n\nGoing forward: \n\n* Keeping the dog should only be an option if your parents can commit 100% to safe management. That would likely mean never letting the dog have access to guests/strangers, muzzle-training the dog, never letting the dog around kids unless its muzzled, following best practices for kid/dog interactions (there are trainers who specialize in this, and some offer free resources online). \n* If your parents have the funds, they should definitely get help from a certified professional - there is [info on the sidebar about finding a good trainer. ](https://old.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/findingatrainer)An experienced trainer can absolutely help with this; they can offer advice on management, work with your vet to explore medical causes of behavior, and work on desensitization. \n* Rehoming a dog like this may be very difficult, and honestly may not be an option. You would need to fully disclose past behaviors, and make sure the adopter is truly qualified to handle them. You'd also need to vet the adopter thoroughly. There are often significant liability issues to rehoming a dog with a bite rescue. You could try to find a rescue to help, but many rescues cannot take on a dog with this level of bite history. \n* If your parents cannot safely manage the dog's behavior, and cannot confidently find a good home for him, then behavioral euthanasia may be a humane and reasonable decision. That's something a good vet and behaviorist should be able to help you discuss and consider.",

Thank you for pointing out what needs to be done if they choose to re-home and how difficult it is to re-home a dog with a bite history. You don't want to re-home a dog and have it bite/attack another child or person. Re-homing this dog could be extremely stressful for the dog and could likely trigger additional defensive or reactive bites, especially if the new owners don't completely understand or disregard the severity or the triggers. The safest, most humane option might be behavioral euthanasia. I understand how difficult that is to hear, the right decision isn't always the easiest.",

Provocation involves a person ignoring warning signs about discomfort and then getting bitten. \n\nSimply existing in the same space isn't provocation; your child wasn't harassing the dog and didn't do anything to harm it, from the sounds of it. An unprovoked bite is always a problem, and simply being \"spooked\" isn't a sufficient provocation to jump to biting.\n\nIt doesn't help anyone involved for you to conceal things like \"The dog bit my child's neck\" for the sake of protecting the dog.

Ideally one who has experience with aggressive/reactive dogs. Be it training or management, a trainer who can assess the situation in person should be the first thing on your list.\n\n2. As someone who has helped rehome dogs with a shelter, it is always emphasised not to leave kids alone in the presence of a dog when there are no eyes on their interaction. This includes you being present in the same space but not *actively* monitoring them together. So many dog bites happen because there are no proper boundaries in place. Children will be children, and dogs will be dogs. It's not fair to expect either of them to have complete control over their emotions/actions. If, for whatever reason, the dog and baby have to share the same space, I would have a leash on the dog at all times and within grabbing distance. Would definitely muzzle the dog as a precaution too.\n\n3. Given that the dog has a history of biting and a dislike of young kids (and potential resource guarding), I would keep both toddler and dog separate. Either rotate them being in the living space or crate train the dog so it has a safe space to retreat to while being in the same space. Set up baby gates in the house or an x pen to create separate spaces. This said, it is important that you teach your child that the dog is not to be disturbed when in the crate/pen.\n\n4. You can consider looking up dogmeets_baby on instagram. It provides some wonderful resources and insights on managing a dog and a baby. However, it does not replace getting a trainer in and guiding you. Lastly, if things don't work out, it's always okay to rehome your dog to a family without kids. Better to rehome than to have another similar incident occur.\n\nHope this helps and all the best!",

            "body": "Dogs communicate a lot to us about their mood, among other things, through their body language. Learn their stress signals - there are plenty of milder ones before the dog gets to snapping and biting - such as lip licks, yawns, ears back, whale-eye (the dog is looking at you sideways so you can see the \"whites\" of his eyes), shake-offs, etc. When you notice any of these, try to identify the source of stress and remove it or reduce it as much as possible. If you can't identify one, then just give the dog some space; the source may be you (but that doesn't necessarily mean the dog is afraid of you). Teach your kids the same, mostly if they see the dog doing any of those things, especially if approaching or trying to touch him, just back off and give him space. The dog will come looking for attention when he wants it.\n\nThe most important thing is to never punish the dog for this behavior. He won't know what he's being punished for, and that will make him even more fearful and reactive. Instead, you need to identify what's making him uncomfortable, and at first, at least, remove it. If the source is something the dog will need to learn to live with - like your children's behavior, for example - then you will need to work little by little to desensitize him to whatever is making him feel uncomfortable about it, alongside teaching the kids to respect the dog's mood and individual space. How long that takes depends on how deeply-rooted the dog's fear is, and can certainly be exacerbated by past trauma, etc., which especially with rescues, can often be both probable and unknown.\n\nIf at any time you feel like you are making insufficient progress, or the dog completely stops progressing, you should engage a veterinary behaviorist (not to be confused with an obedience trainer) for both individualized coaching and support and also potential drug therapies if the dog's desensitization limits turn out to not be adequate for your needs.\n\nGood luck!",

He bit three times: once when a random kid wandered up and pulled his ear, once when my friend (a kid) tried to take his bone, and once when I hugged him out of nowhere when he was sleeping.\n\nHe wasn't a bad dog, but he had a trigger. We had to be really careful with him as a result. We learned not to let strangers wander up to him and pet him, and not to let anyone touch his food. We also made sure he was awake before we randomly hugged him. We probably should've worked more on resource guarding but again, this was back-when and dog training just wasn't that sophisticated. We also had no idea dogs didn't like to be hugged. Anyway, long story short, he lived a long full life of 13 years, 7 months, 20 days and those were the only three incidents ever. They stopped after we learned how to manage him/ourselves.\n\nI think people freaking out and telling you to rehome or put down the dog might be being a little too precious about it. This dog has clearly shown you 1) he gets overwhelmed by kids/a lot of guests, and 2) he resource guards. You probably have to put him somewhere quiet when you have guests over. You probably cannot let children interact with him unsupervised. You probably need to work on his resource guarding. But does he need drastic measures? I don't think so. Labs are mouthy, poodles are high strung. That's where the bites are coming from, but I think it's manageable.",

With all going on in the family, has the dog been groomed regularly? If his coat is overgrown around the eyes, this can cause him to become startled. Keeping up with grooming can solve lunging and biting behavior problems like this if the cause is impaired vision.\n\nI agree that it's a good idea not to have a 3-year-old around the dog without adult supervision until this problem, whatever it ends up being, is solved. A 3-year-old can't be expected to leave the dog alone 100% of the time on their own. It is not developmentally appropriate.\n\nAdults can carefully train a dog that is food-aggressive by adding food to the dog's bowl at every meal. Once the dog is comfortable with that, add touching the dog during meals and immediately provide a treat. This will, over time, condition the dog to expect to receive more food instead of expecting to have food taken away when someone approaches during feeding time.\n\nWishing you and your family the best in this difficult time.",

It sounds like a combo of anxious/nervous feelings around high stimulation and maybe a bit of resource guarding. my last girl became a biter. Loved her to pieces and gave her the best life until she passed at 15, but in her later years (i.e. at age 8 to 9 and beyond) we did a lot of management. I will say that I did a lot to try to reverse the behavior but at that age, it was fairly ingrained. Once they've had success with biting to make someone or something go away, it's a tool in their toolbox, and unless they're a puppy/young dog, it may be hard to eliminate the risk. You could get a behaviorist involved but I think management will need to be a large part of how it's handled. For instance, we let absolutely no one but me or my husband pet the dog. That worked wonders. My girl could hang with the family and walk around freely and she would never actively try to bite unless someone tried to pet or reach for her.   \n  \nI didn't have small children around and that was a blessing, but if I did, I would probably have erred on the side of extreme caution and kept them separate if there was even a hint that the dog would react to the child. I know that may not be what you want to hear but next time that minor grazing could turn into a full bite. You can never be sure a young child, or any child will 100% follow your instructions. I even had a few adults who didn't follow my instructions and got minor bites on hands when they thought they knew better. Unfortunately, in my experience, bites tend to get more severe as the dog gets older and less patient/more protective of themselves and any resources. \n\nIf you can combine some techniques around resource guarding with some really good management, you may be able to ensure no more incidents occur.",

Now he is likely to bite again because that is the behavior that works for him. \n\nDog needs to be separated from kids immediately, of course.

She cried and bled and we put the dog outside, then she cried harder because even though she was still bleeding she still wanted to pet the dog. Listen to your son. Disbelieving him now will lay a foundation for him that you discount his experiences. He has no reason to be anything other than honest with you if he knows that you will believe him if he is.\nWith my next kid, we had a reactive destructive dog. We tried multiple trainers and worked with our vet who put him on various medications trying to help him better be able to control his behavior.  Finally he suggested a highly specialized research center for analysis which was beyond our means (over $7k for initial appointment, no definitive diagnosis guaranteed, no treatment included). We continued to work with our dog for a few years as he was a part of our family. My breaking point was when he lunged for my nephew. We knew he had a hard time with children other than our own but this was a different level and completely unacceptable. An animal that goes for the neck is following a base level instinct to kill.\nContact, breaking the skin, instilling fear... whether he did those or not are irrelevant to me. The dog tried to attack a human without provocation (i was sitting with them at the time). He needed to be removed and removed, placed with a senior citizen or other adult who did not have exposure to children. \nI have witnessed a pit bull attack in front of my house.

It's not fair to your mom or dad to get rid of their support animal for the chance it may bite on the occasions u do visit.  But u cann9t expect the child (at 3) to play any role in prevention.  Lock the dog up in a bedroom when thr child is there or when anyone is there if that is a trigger. And never, ever allow anyone around a dog that resource guards, when it's eating. Like ever.  There is no need to assimilate the dog and guests.  Now if the dog tries to nip your parents,  its time to go. And depends on the size of the dog as well",

            "body": "You've gotten enough criticism already and it sounds like you've taken everything to heart. I just want to share what worked for me and my lessons learned. Hope this helps.\n\nOne of my dogs was a feisty Chihuahua/Cocker Spaniel mix. She had some resource guarding issues and bite history with me. She passed at 15 due to cancer and had her ups and downs, but she became the best friend I'll ever have.\n\n----------------\n--Consistent Crating: \n\nDon't act or think of it as a punishment. It's their \"room\", their comfortable safe space. They can go there freely when they want or are overwhelmed. Feed them in there, give them treats and bones in there. And always crate with guests. If they're anxious, they're probably going to have a better time in their safe place anyway.\n\n\n--Respecting personal space:\n\nLike us, dogs like their own space and each have a differing sense of where/what their personal boundaries are. Most of us wouldn't go up and touch a stranger, hover over them when eating, or bother someone when they're sleeping. \n\nAsk permission to touch/interact and respect when they say no. I had to buckle down with kids on walks. They would see her and think oh she's so pretty and small, she won't hurt me. Most were able to understand that she likes her space. You may offer her your palm to sniff. If she chooses to sniff or lick your hand, great job! But that's it.\n\n\n--Get better attuned to their body language/communication style:\n\nThey tell us a lot, we just have to pay attention to their tells. Is that a play growl or a warning? Is that a I'm so excited to see you tail wag or a I am SO annoyed with you tail wag? Oh her pupils are completely dilated, she's on edge leave her alone...\n\n\n--All qualifiers aside. Come to terms with the fact that they have teeth and can bite:\n\nNo matter who we are to the dog or how much training one does with their dog, self preservation kicks in. They are able to bite/lunge and do damage if they feel the need. We have to keep that in mind and train ourselves to act as if that can/will happen. \n\n\nCompounding factors:\n\n-- Age: \nShe got grouchier as she aged. Things that didn't bother her before now did. We all kind of do too though. \n\n\n--Medical Issues: \nShe had IVDD with chronic and acute episodes . We ended up having 2 spinal surgeries. She knew I loved her, made the pain go away and would take care of her. But she still had pain and would react at times. Dogs are SO resilient and press on no matter what. It can be hard to tell how much pain they're just tolerating until it's too much.\n\n\nBest of luck!",

            "body": "I have a dog like this. He is a small well trained Jack Russell terrier. However, he is nervous around crowds and strangers. He's not a fan of kids. This is just his personality, similar to people who don't like crowds or kids. I have managed to desensitize him to some extent, but when there are large groups of people in the house, I put him in a different room. It's less stressful for him and people are not tempted to try and pet him. If we are walking down the street and someone asks to pet him I say he is not friendly and he bites. Why tempt fate after all?\n\nHe has bitten one person in his 14 years about 7 years ago. It was similar to what happened to your son, except that the boy was a teen. We stopped bringing him to kid sporting events after that. \n\nYour dog's behavior is telling you something and you need to listen to it. You need to train your son as much as you need to train your dog. Your toddler should not play with the dog at all. Period. He is not a kid's dog. We stopped letting our son play with our dog,  until my son was older, like 10 years old.\n\nYou also need to teach your son to never, ever approach a dog when there is food present. This is hard to explain to a child so young, so you might just want to make a blanket statement that he's not to come near a dog when in the kitchen, dining room, etc. anywhere people are likely to eat. This includes to stay away from the dog's food supply as well as dog dishes and water. Some dogs are also protective of their toys so you might want to take that into consideration. \n\nWe have not had a problem with our dog other than that one incident and other than with some growling. I tend to watch my dog's body language more than the rest of my family members, so I'm very aware when he's starting to get irritated even more than my husband who often does not notice the body language that proceeds growling that proceeds snapping. In spite of me telling him that our dog does not like his feet being touched or his ears being touched, my husband still subconsciously will touch those parts of his body and gets our dog upset and then wonders why. \n\nReactive dogs often give you a lot of warning if you are not in a situation where you've just surprised them. \n\nI would keep in mind when you meet with the behavioralist, that they're really going to be training you, not the dog. Good luck.",

The expectation is not solely the pup's to be met - what is the expectation for the adults tending to the dog? Seek help from your vet - I strongly believe in medication like Prozac if needed and for Pete's sake, put the dog in another room and respect her space.

            "body": "OP, I\u2019ve read your update but I can\u2019t help but be worried. If I may, here are some concrete rules you may want to employ:\n\n\u2022 If there are ANY AMOUNT of people over, the dog is crated \n\n\u2022 When there are people over, the dog is crated in a separate, quiet room where he cannot and will not be disturbed\n\n\u2022 No one (other than you or your parents) is allowed to touch the dog \n\n\u2022 The dog should not be given things he will be protective/possessive of (such as food or toys) unless he\u2019s going to be alone until he\u2019s finished with it\n\n**I realize that you\u2019re staying with your parents for a few months, which means that, in the dog\u2019s POV, he is in an uncomfortable situation indefinitely.** He\u2019s not used to people being in his space, and he doesn\u2019t like it. If the dog has been \u201ctolerating\u201d uncomfortable situations and people thus far, it sounds like he\u2019s tired of it, and he\u2019s fed up with you and your kiddo staying there. I realize that this may sound like I\u2019m \u201ctaking the dog\u2019s side\u201d to some, but this is just the reality of the situation: the dog is used to life being a certain way, and OP & their kiddo are intruding upon it. In light of that, if you love the dog as much as you say, your choices are essentially, in order of easiest to hardest:\n\n1) remove the dog from your home\n2) adjust your lives to work around the dog\u2019s boundaries/issues\n3) adjust your lives & work *on* the dog\u2019s issues with uncomfortable situations/people\n\nSince this is a temporary situation and option 1 does not work for you, I would probably go for option 2. It means that your child should never be able to *see* the dog, because if the baby can *see* the dog, that means the dog is too close. **The dog does not like strangers, especially not children, so the dog should be secluded.** Obviously, you can\u2019t keep the dog locked up all day till the kid goes to sleep, though, so that means that **the dog and your kid should have access to the house on a schedule.** One hour, the dog gets free rein of the house; the next hour, your kid does \u2014 something like that. Don\u2019t assume you can drop your guard just because one or the other is put away, however, you MUST stay vigilant for your baby\u2019s sake. \n\nDuring this time you are staying with your parents, the dog should be getting more exercise or doing more stimulating activities in general so he doesn\u2019t get antsy when he is secluded, the same way you would give a kid an activity to do if you wanted them to stay put in one room. \u201cPutting the dog away\u201d for an hour should not be constructed as a punishment; rather, it is a break for the dog as well as the family, and should be treated as such. \n\nAll that being said, I rather doubt that the dog nearly exclusively has a problem with children; I would imagine it\u2019s the things that kids *do* that bothers him, like being loud or handsy or moving too fast. Adults don\u2019t notice how we monitor our own behavior to be \u201cpolite\u201d or \u201cmannerly,\u201d which is why we might think that animals have a problem with little people specifically. I mention this not to chastise you for the assumption that the dog simply \u201cdoesn\u2019t like\u201d children, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that there\u2019s more to the issue than simply disliking people under the age of 18 \u2014 rather, I mention it because it might be good to keep in mind what makes *you* and other adults tolerable to the dog so you can communicate/teach these skills to the people he may or may not come in contact with. If you\u2019re consciously aware of the dog\u2019s triggers and how to avoid them, then you can be vigilant and hopefully, avoid situations where the dog may bite before they even have the chance to occur. \n\nPlease consider your own behavior and think about how you handle/treat the dog. For example, can you tell when he\u2019s in a bad mood? Do you subconsciously decide not to bother him if he\u2019s lying in a certain place or doing a certain thing? These are the kinds of things that kids (and some adults) don\u2019t notice and don\u2019t think about, and it\u2019s what leads them to get bit. You, as an adult with experience with the dog, subconsciously understand the dog\u2019s boundaries and you behave accordingly. If you can name those boundaries and what you do to avoid overstepping them, then you can spread the information and help everyone learn how to behave around the dog.",

The children, no matter whose children they are, need to know that provoking animals isn't tolerated either, and the dog also needs to know his owners have his back they need to protect him from these situations. Some retraining for reactivity and, in general wouldn't hurt, possibly crate training to when kids are around so the dog has a safe place to rest without anyone being able to get to him. Good luck. Hopefully, there will be no more biting incidents as it always leads to a horrible outcome.",
