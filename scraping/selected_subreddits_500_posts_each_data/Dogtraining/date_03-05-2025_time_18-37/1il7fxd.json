    "selftext": "Hello! \n\nI have a 6 year old lab and shes really the sweetest girl I have ever had, but her overall anxiety is terrible. I have tried to train her to get her more comfortable and able to calm down but she just doesn\u2019t stop moving around whenever shes anxious. I really want to be able to train her to be calm in my car because I will be moving soon and every time she goes into my car she starts barking and whining like crazy ESPECIALLY if we are stopped. Same with walks she tends to bark and whine no matter what. Is there any tips on how I can possibly help her with her anxiety or for her to get more comfortable with doing these things without all the stress and anxiety? Thank you so much I would greatly appreciate it. ",
