    "selftext": "To keep this as vague as possible, I've just entered the pet service industry with my first job so I'll admit I'm very inexperienced as I've only owned my own dogs and I have a work history of less than a year. I've gleamed through the wiki index on here, but I notice a majority of these are for dogs we are already owning. Maybe I haven't reached the sections where it talks about working with dogs in a professional sense, but I've noticed that my coworkers are personally more combative with the dogs to get them to basically behave. While working with a pack that has some 'dominant' (in my fellow coworker's words, I'm all for dogs having their own personalities, but I don't really subscribe to the whole dominant and submissive side very strongly) personalities that refuse to listen, I just want to make sure these dogs can see me as a figure to listen to and trust in rather than appease me out of fear as they do with my other coworkers.\n\nSorry for the vagueness, I'm a bit nervous on how to ask for advice without doxxing myself. I can only say that I've seen several of my coworkers use pain to intimidate these dogs over and over again so that they are being listened to with no actual real positive progress being made. I'd rather not go down that same route and I appreciate any and all advice on how to move forward with this.",

They have paid courses/material of course, but just signing up to their email newsletters and rifling their old blog posts should give you some good starting points for free.",

Or even if I have to use it, I want to at least be able to use it less, even with dogs considered stubborn and prideful.",
