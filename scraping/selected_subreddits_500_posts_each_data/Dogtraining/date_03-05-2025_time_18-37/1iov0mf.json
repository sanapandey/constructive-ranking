    "selftext": "I have a 5 year old lab mix that used to be a stray and she won\u2019t stop eating dropped food and other hazards on walks. We live in a big city, so I don\u2019t have the option of exercising her in a yard, and she absolutely loves going for walks and getting in her sniffs. Unfortunately, we encounter a lot of food that can be harmful or deadly for her to ingest, chiefly chicken bones. \n\nI\u2019m at a breaking point with her habit of picking up food. I always pay attention to where her nose is, and she is 100% on point when I can use leave it before she\u2019s on top of a piece of food. However, if she\u2019s already picked up something high value, like a chicken bone, she does not respond to drop it at all. She has been trained on drop it and does tend to drop some high value things (like dead rats), but for some reason, human food is not among them. I\u2019ve continued to train her on it, but her training inside and her activity outside are not connected for this.\n\nI have muzzle trained her for a while as this habit has worsened, but she is still uncomfortable in one. She currently has a box one that allows her to pant and eat treats from my hand, but it inhibits her ability to pick things off of the ground without me noticing. It does seem to be helping with the food issue, but she\u2019s been so sad about wearing it that she loses her enthusiasm to explore with it on.\n\nAre there any other alternatives to keep her safe? I feel like I\u2019ve trained her as much as I can, but some things are just too appealing no matter what. I\u2019m just scared of her getting sick or dying because I couldn\u2019t wrestle the wrong piece of food out of her mouth, but I also don\u2019t want to take the joy of walks away from her.",
