    "selftext": "I will start off by saying, this is not my first large powerful dog breed and have lots of experience with guardian and working dogs. However, this behavior I have not dealt with. \nMy dog is a very sweet boy, he gets along with everyone. Aside from dealing with some minor dog reactivity (to be expected from this breed). However, there now have been a few instances where he was just a straight up jerk. Two of the times, I was separating him from humping our senior male dog which led to the Rottweiler getting in my face and growling. Stiff body, hard eye contact and low growls. To which I responded by quickly putting him in his crate to chill out. We took him to get a bath at a pet store, which he\u2019s always wonderful in, and as we were leaving a lady was walking in, my fianc\u00e9 held the door and i stepped back in the store with my dog to allow the lady through. The rottie then let out a good deep quick barks which is incredibly out of character for him. Today, my fianc\u00e9 was playing tug of war with him which we have always done, he has wonderful leave it, wait and drop it commands and a good off switch. But today, he did the same stiffening, hard stare and low growls. Playtime was ended abruptly and in his crate he went to chill out. \n\nI was looking into trainers but i\u2019m not sure how far we\u2019d get because there isn\u2019t a set trigger, and it\u2019s not very often. So i\u2019m not even sure where a trainer could provide assistance. \nWe\u2019ve started going back to the basics, he\u2019s not allowed on the furniture anymore, he has to wait to exit and enter door ways, wait to eat, have any of his food in his crate (even though he is not food aggressive). We allow the elder dog to do everything first now, in and out , eat etc. \n\nMy question is, what can i do to curb this? Is this something i can just expect as he\u2019s a slow maturing breed coming into his adolescences and testing boundaries? We will neuter him before 2 if we have to, but prefer to wait for health reasons. He has a vet appointment in exactly 5 weeks. ",

See if they have some in a park or area near you.   I train service dogs and can tell you that I still bring my dog to group training to work on reactivity. It\u2019s the best!",

I\u2019m eager to start joining them so we can get to work! I will also look for somewhere that offers an indoor group training program for days where it\u2019s not so great out. I appreciate the comment, thank you!!",
