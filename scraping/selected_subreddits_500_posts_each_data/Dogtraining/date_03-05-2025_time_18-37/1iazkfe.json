    "selftext": "Looking to buy a dogPACER treadmill for my sister. She has two golden retrievers and a GSD but she lives in NYC with limited running space and long work hours tired her out by the end of the day. She walks them 2\u20133 times a week and takes longer walks on weekends, but it\u2019s not enough for her dogs.\n\nI thought a dog treadmill could be the perfect birthday gift since dogs seem to love them, at least from YouTube. Does it take a lot of time to train them? How often do you actually use yours? Want to be sure it\u2019s practical and not just another thing taking up space in her apartment. Thanks in advance!\n\n  \nTLDR: how often do you use your dog treadmill and how long does it take to train them? Thanks!\n\n",

I got myself a normal treadmill and put cardboard on one side and put it against a wall. :) Though, I can see how giving your sister a treadmill and some card board might not be exactly the beautiful thing for her apartment.\n\nPacers are designed for slow walking, they shouldn't run on them because of injury risk. \n\nIf she has huskies and wants them to just burn some energy what she really wants is a slat mill. You can look on youtube for SlatMills and watch some shorts / videos with dogs on them. They can go as fast as they want to go and they can stop when they are ready to.\n\nI was looking up a slatmill service in New York because they have them in smaller areas and I would assume a dense place like NYC would have a service but I didn't find one on a quick Google but they have services with vans with these in the back of them. It might be good to get her a subscription to one of these to see how well her dog takes to it before going all in. \n\nThere are brands that charge like $1500-2000+ for them but they are actually the same as the $800-1000 ones with just their logo on them they all buy them from the same couple factories in China except a few who hand make them in America and charge 3x",
