    "selftext": "I have a 10 month old puppy, we\u2019ve had him since he was 8 weeks, he\u2019s enormous (100lbs already!) and a very good boy, we\u2019ve taught him sit touch stay, etc etc he\u2019s eager to please, very food oriented so using treats for training works great.  Other than chewing things he shouldn\u2019t when he gets bored (expected for a puppy) the one issue we have is that it\u2019s a huge battle to get him to come back inside from the back yard, no matter how long or short he\u2019s been out there, it\u2019s the only situation where \u201ctouch\u201d and treats don\u2019t work. He just stands half way in and out and stares at you, if try to get close he goes back outside, to get him to come in you have to pretend like you aren\u2019t paying attention and give him like 15 minutes to decide to come all the way through the door.     How do I get him to just come through the open sliding door when we do \u201ctouch\u201d\u2026. Once he\u2019s inside he does touch like 95% of the time, but from the backyard into the house he does it 0%.    How do I address this?\n\nIf you care about breed, his wisdom panel has 11 breeds, the highest percentage being 28% Great Pyrenees.",

We even hired a trainer when he was younger (when we realized that we was going to be enormous) but this behavior only started a few months ago.",
