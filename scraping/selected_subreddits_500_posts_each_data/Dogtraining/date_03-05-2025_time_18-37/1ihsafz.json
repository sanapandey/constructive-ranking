    "selftext": "My dog and I are new to free shaping, she learned almost everything through luring so far. In free shaping situations, she has a tendency to lie down and stare, she maybe goes through the few things she knows (sits, lies down, lies on her side, crosses her paws in a down, touches my hand with her nose, rests her chin on my leg) but once she \"determines\" it's not one of those, she just defaults to the down-stare. With prop-based behaviors, I had a relatively easy time getting her \"unstuck\", a reset treat usually did the trick and then the first thing she did after is investigate the object, but how do I get started on shaping propless behaviors? Is there a good one to start with, given what she already knows (so maybe not one of those)? How do I get her unstuck? She can hold out her down-stare for minutes without flinching, after which I worry that she might get bored or frustrated if I keep waiting any longer for something to capture or that she would learn that lying down and staring long enough gets me to throw a treat.\n\nI have also heard that it's a good idea to set dogs up with some very basic body awareness skills before starting shaping, because it will make things go easier (I mean very basic things like \"an awareness that they have four paws, all of which can be used in behaviors\", which are often missing for my dog). I know that shaping itself raises this kind of awareness, but does anyone have recommendations on what exercises to do or maybe even what lured tricks to teach as a \"prerequisite\" to shaping?",

The whole point of the exercise is to teach the dog that she can \"choose her own destiny\", so to speak.\n\nGo in with the sole goal to reward every single new behavior your dog presents. \n\nAnd these behaviors are tiny. A head tilt, lifting a leg, moving ears, etc. That's what you wanna reward in the beginning. From there it's likely the behavior will present itself, since we know that reinforcement causes behaviors to increase. \n\nIf your dog presents a behavior that you would like to strengthen, you can then start rewarding only behaviors related to the original one. \n\nFor example: your dog is lifting her right leg. That's interesting to you and you wanna see where it goes. So you start rewarding her lifting her leg just a bit higher each time. You don't reward anything else.\n\nI would recommend not doing that in the first few times you do this exercise, cause it can get frustrating. We first wanna teach the dog that trying new things is fun.\n\nI hope this helps and have fun :)",

I always have a plan and an increasing set of criteria in mind before we get started. In any given session, I know what I will and won't mark. Otherwise, I agree that would require more experience from me to be able to \"wing it\" and develop that goal mid-session. What I am asking for here is what behaviors might be good to start propless free shaping with, because at this point, it doesn't really matter to me if her next trick is backing off, spnning, standing on hind legs, bowing or hiding her nose. From my perspective, none of these tricks have practical use for our day-to-day life (she knows the ones I found useful or important),, we learn and practice new things because they are fun, they deepen our relationship and we learn about each other. So I might as well pick something easy and fun (for her) as an introduction :) \n\nWe are actively working through her reactivity with management exercises and (re)socialization (exposing her to various sounds, sights, dogs, humans, objects, textures, surfaces, spaces, etc.) and we do free work too, where she's a bit more in control of the stimuli. So free shaping really is just one piece of the puzzle for us. I wanted to try it because I know many examples where it had a more general impact and even if it doesn't for us, it's not like it can hurt, it's time spent together.",

It seems like such an immediate and already entrenched behavior (we did train similarly in the past few years), so now I'm struggling to prove her wrong.

Also depends on the breed, age and more.  \nIt can also be difficult for owners used to luring to think more creatively ;)\n\nI've found that often it really depends on the exact behaviour you're trying to teach and then figuring out a way that will very likely make your dog do (or start doing) what you want them to. I don't think there's a one size fits all.  \nThe example you mention here perfectly illustrates this. You sitting on the floor will almost certainly make your dog lie down so she's at your level, since she knows how you'll deliver the treats. What exactly were you hoping she'd do in this example? It's hard to give feedback without these details.\n\nI know you say there's no props but you yourself can be similar to a prop and how you stand or move will heavily influence your dog's behaviour.  \nAnd I guess I'm also wondering why you're not using any props? Is it because you can't use them in those behaviours or you don't want to?",

I didn't actually try propless shaping yet, I was too concerned that I won't be able to get her unstuck (because what seemed to have helped before was the prop itself). Based on all these comments, I'm starting to think maybe a bow would be a good start, since she almost goes through it on her way to her default lie-down, so whenever I reset, she would likely do something that can serve as our first approximation.\n\nI am not against props per se, but that's a good question. We've tried a few proppy things already and they're fun and we'll keep going for sure. Here's my thinking: Since I want to encourage her to problem-solve and see multiple solutions, and think about problems \"irl\" in general, I need to somehow help her to generalize from cardboard boxes, candle holders, etc to Life. And just like how I would teach her to generalize any behavior. With a touch-cue, yes, you should do it when it's in our home, in-between a string of other cues, but also do it in the street, do it when I'm wearing gloves or a bulky coat that hangs loose on my wrist, please also do it when you'd rather run in the opposite direction because there's something very cool over there. I guess what I am trying to do with making sure we practice propless free shaping as well is to make sure I'm not \"skipping steps\" and I am splitting the task (this meta-behavior) into small enough pieces. Similarly, I am trying to make sure we try a wide variety of behaviors. And I view propless free shaping as a link in that chain, something that adds variety -- certainly not the only component but I don't want to completely omit it. And since I am new to free shaping, I want to make sure that I set her up for success with something relatively easy and that I do my homework and know what to do when things go subideal. Does that make sense?",

            "body": "\"Free shaping\" is an advanced method of \"capturing\".  If you're trying to capture a simple behavior, like getting the dog to lie down when the dog is unwilling to be lured into the down position. You just wait until that natural behavior happens. Mark and reward.  Easy.  \n\nFree shaping is more complicated because you're trying to create a more complicated behavior by capturing parts of the behavior when they happen naturally.  \n\n So if your dog were to initiate a behavior, you progressively rewarding small steps that get closer to the desired final behavior, essentially letting the dog \"figure out\" the trick on their own by marking and reinforcing any actions that move them towards the goal, without any prompting or lure.   This encourages problem-solving in the dog.\u00a0\n\nThe catch is that the dog has to initiate parts of the desired behavior * naturally *.  For example if you want to teach your dog to spin around in circles, you would wait until the dog were trying to lie down on its bed and it does the typical turnaround thing before it lies down and you would immediately mark and reward. Dogs are always puzzled the first time. But the next time they start circling in order to lie down, you mark and reward again. Eventually they figure out that that circling behavior is worth something.  \n\nIt might help us to know what sort of behavior you're trying to shape?  That way we might be able to suggest when you would be most likely to capture portions of that initiated behavior.",

Wonderful dog but had been starved and that affected his eyesight and possibly his cognition. Didn't keep him from learning, but he just learned a little slower than dogs I had from puppies that had had healthy diets all of their lives.  \n\nThe younger two... Female rescued at 8 to 10 weeks. She was very clever, capturing was a cinch for her, chaining and back chaining behaviors worked extremely well.  \n\nYoungest, male, picked up as a stray, his first adoptive home he wasn't absolute maniac and a pretty crappy house guest so he was returned to rescue. Came into my house like the Tasmanian devil.  But the first few weeks just in management and exercise because he was completely mistrustful and had no training.  Because of this almost everything was capturing and patience. \n\n   So here's where capturing one behavior eventually free shaped what was eventually labeled \"possum\":\n\n One of the first issues was him putting his feet up on the kitchen counter. (Not acceptable in my house)     The behavior was ignored. When he got tired and put his feet on the floor, food was thrown in his direction and praise given.  Well this was going on there was some formal lure training teaching him to sit to lie down etc.   So that it was all about raising the bar. Instead of just 4 feet on the floor, I waited for a more desirable behavior - a sit. \n\nOnce that was consistent, and rewarded, I held out for more. Then he offered a sit and then a down...  then he offered a full on his side... Then he offered his belly up.  \nTo really finish the behavior, he had to lie on his back completely still his head stretched up his ears and tail fully flat on the floor.  Like a possum, playing possum.  From start to finish I would say this was probably about a year of bit by bit.  \nAfter about a year I could ask for \" possum\" And he would immediately go into that position.  \n\n\nI can't say all of this happened entirely organically because in between waiting for  captured behaviors, there was active training going on because without it he was a nightmare.  \ud83d\ude06\n\nHe was with us for 12 years before passing from cancer in November of 2021. Of these three, he turned out to be the most obedient little rule follower. Going so far as to rat out his siblings when they were doing something they shouldn't.  And during his lifetime continued to offer behaviors that worked for attention.",

Then clicking for everything that indicates the dog is \"thinking backwards\". Ear moving back, eyes flickering, weight shifting. And RAPID FIRE marking+reinforcing those tiny behaviours. Reinforcement rate needs to be high enough so the dog does not get frustrated and starts guessing completely different behaviours that are incompatible with what you're trying to shape.\n\nAdditionally the way you deliver reinforcement will make or break the process, so make sure you do it in a way that sets the dog up for succeeding the next repetition.\n\nEither way I really suggest you start your dog getting comfortable with the game \"101 things to do with a box\", if you didn't already, to get her more comfy with taking initiative.",

My big issue is that she doesn't just lie down when frustrated or bored already, she seems to be convinced that me sitting on the floor with treats (without an interesting focal object in the middle) means that she has to come up to me, lie down immediately and wait patiently until I tell her what to do. It seems like such an immediate and already so entrenched behavior (which makes sense, we did train similarly in the past few years), so now I'm struggling to prove her wrong... And I'm starting to suspect that maybe me being settled might be cuing her to do the same too. Do you have any other ideas about how to generalize from \"when they sit on the ground with a new/focal object, I should try things\" to \"when they just sit there, it's worth trying things\"?",

It started with standing with him with some treats nearby and he would wait expectedly on the mat knowing he needed to do something. I waited it out while he sat and did a couple other things and eventually got bored and laid down and then treated. Then from there it was like, every time he chose to chill on the mat he got a random reward. Are those the same thing? \n\nThe end goal was to teach the dog to relax on his own on the mat. It wasn't to teach him to lay down as he already knew this command. Was all of the above free training, or capture training, or both?",
