    "selftext": "We rescued a dog about a month ago who was dumped in our neighborhood. She seemed SO well trained, we were shocked that someone could just dump her. \nThe first week she didn\u2019t have any accidents inside, would use the bathroom outside like we assumed she was trained. After the first week she started to have accidents in one particular room in the house, so we tried to keep that room closed off. Then the accidents moved to another bedroom and the living room. Even right after letting her out to potty. I noticed when we would let her out she would just stand at the door staring at us. Like will absolutely not go to the bathroom if someone isn\u2019t out there with her. So I started going out there with her and she would usually then walk around the yard and go. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because she is getting so distracted by balls in the yard (even if we refuse to touch them until she goes to the bathroom, or just don\u2019t throw them all together while we are out there at that time) that she refuses to go to the bathroom. [She LOVES playing fetch] Or she may pee, but won\u2019t poop. Then we let her inside and within a few minutes she uses the bathroom in the house. \nBut I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m at my wits end. I\u2019m already standing out there with her for a while to go potty, then praising her once she goes. Sometimes throwing the ball a few times once she goes as a form of positive reinforcement. But I don\u2019t understand why she keeps going in the house \ud83d\ude2d",
