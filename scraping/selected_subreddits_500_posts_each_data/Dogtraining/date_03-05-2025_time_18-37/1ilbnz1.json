    "selftext": "Hi all, i have a 14 month old, 60 lb boxer-pit-shepherd mix. She is very sweet but has tons of energy and can get out of control if other dogs are around or even people. She loves everyone a lot. \n\nWe usually play fetch at an area of a park that\u2019s not too crowded, and she will bring back the toy and eventually drop it without me saying anything. However, she almost never lets go of a toy if its in my hand. \n\nShe is too strong to just hold it limp, and has accidentally chomped me a few times when I\u2019ve tried. \n\nI\u2019ve been advised against trading for food, and if she\u2019s really in play mode, she won\u2019t even let go for really good treats. \n\nShould i try to trade for another toy? Is there another technique I\u2019m missing?\n\nThanks for your help!\n",
