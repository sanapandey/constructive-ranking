            "body": "> A review of Rodong Sinmun and Minju Joson shows that there is an inverse correlation between the number of articles mentioning \u201cregional industry\u201d or \u201cregional economy\u201d and \u201cmunitions industry (\uad70\uc218\uacf5\uc5c5)\u201d or \u201cdefense industry (\uad6d\ubc29\uacf5\uc5c5).\u201d This interpretation is also supported by a rise from 2012 to 2017 in the number of articles containing \u201cdefense science (\uad6d\ubc29\uacfc\ud559),\u201d which is often associated with nuclear weapons (Figure 3). This trend peaked in 2017 when North Korea\u2019s byungjin policy culminated in test firings of the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). There was another uptick in the volume of articles mentioning \u201cregional industry\u201d or \u201cregional economy\u201d in 2018 when North Korea declared a shift from byungjin to a policy of \u201cconcentrating all efforts on the socialist economic construction.\u201d\n\n> This would seem to indicate that military expenditure is a direct obstacle to economic development, particularly regional economic development. In other words, North Korea could only fully commit itself to regional development when military spending was deprioritized. The policy of regional economic development, which North Korea has emphasized since approximately 2010, was pushed aside for some time as military tensions increased, resulting in Pyongyang\u2019s prioritization of national defense. In that light, we may say the 20x10 Policy began as early as 2010 but only started gaining traction in 2021.\n\n> Based on the inverse correlation discussed above, North Korea\u2019s increased focus on weapons development since the party congress in 2021 has been a stumbling block to the implementation of its regional development policy. This may explain what may have been a disagreement between Kim Jong Un and the rest of the leadership over the 20x10 Policy. It is possible that Kim announced this major policy for the new year not at the year-end party plenary meeting in 2023 but two weeks afterward because he and the top leadership were not aligned on the feasibility of the 20x10 Policy. Most North Korean officials may have assessed they would not be able to suddenly expedite regional development due to ongoing defense spending, while Kim may have believed regional development should not be slowed down.",

                    "body": "This reminded me of the post-war line struggle in the USSR (taken from Socialism Betrayed by Keeran) where light-industry and heavy-industry was a topic of debate between the \u201cStalin\u201d line and what became the \u201cKhruschev\u201d line. At first, Stalin, Malenkov, etc. wanted to develop light-industry, but Marshall Plan compelled USSR to continue industrializing. This line with bare minimum material incentive would\u2019ve allowed for the more revolutionary masses after the war to place the emphasis on moral incentives and relations of productions, simultaneously keeping the spirit of class struggle alive. The other line of Khruschev was to develop the light-industry to \u201coutproduce US in 15 years\u201d and \u201creach communism\u201d; the line was a most certainly rightist but given the exhaustion of the war (and the Korean War), it was the atmosphere of a decent section of the population at the time, including the reactionary ones. Unfortunately the latter line won out and USSR drifted backwards from socialism.\n\nAlbeit at the time, post-war USSR was not yet revisionist, whereas DPRK had already brought back market mechanisms in some sectors, which would make the military spendings look like that of the Brezhnev era rather than the 30s in USSR. I\u2019m not sure if the WPK can actively engage the masses in debating the future in relations of production and emphasize class struggle, given that the market concessions of the past decade exposed the faltering presence of a mass line. Perhaps they can renew the socialist industrialization drive when another capitalist crisis hits in the next decade or two.",

Unfortunately the latter line won out and USSR drifted backwards from socialism.\n\nWhile Stalin certainly was aware of the need to address light industry, it is amazing how this compares to the three clear preconditions he outlines in Economic Problems:\n\n>In order to pave the way for a real, and not declaratory transition to communism, at least three main preliminary conditions have to be satisfied.\n\n> 1. It is necessary, in the first place, to ensure, not a mythical \u201crational organization\u201d of the productive forces, but a continuous expansion of all social production, with a relatively higher rate of expansion of the production of means of production. The relatively higher rate of expansion of production of means of production is necessary not only because it has to provide the equipment both for its own plants and for all the other branches of the national economy, but also because reproduction on an extended scale becomes altogether impossible without it.\n\n> 2. . It is necessary, in the second place, by means of gradual transitions carried out to the advantage of the collective farms, and, hence, of all society, to raise collective-farm property to the level of public property, and, also by means of gradual transitions, to replace commodity circulation by asystem of products-exchange, under which the central government, or some other social-economic centre, might control the whole product of social production in the interests of society.\n\n\u2026\n\n>The task, therefore, is to eliminate these contradictions by gradually converting collective-farm property into public property, and by introducing - also gradually - products-exchange in place of commodity circulation.\n\n> 3. It is necessary, in the third place, to ensure such a cultural advancement of society as will secure for all members of society the all-round development of their physical and mental abilities, so that the members of society may be in a position to receive an education sufficient to enable them to be active agents of social development, and in a position freely to choose their occupations and not be tied all their lives, owing to the existing division of labour, to some one occupation.\n\n> What is required for this?\n\n> It would be wrong to think that such a substantial advance in the cultural standard of the members of society can be brought about without substantial changes in the present status of labour. **For this, it is necessary, first of all, to shorten the working day at least to six, and subsequently to five hours. This is needed in order that the members of society might have the necessary free time to receive an all-round education**. It is necessary, further, to introduce universal compulsory polytechnical education, which is requiredin order that the members of society might be able freely to choose their occupations and not be tied to some one occupation all their lives. It is likewise necessary that housing conditions should be radically improved, and that **real wages of workers and employees should be at least doubled, if not more, both by means of direct increases of wages and salaries, and, more especially, by further systematic reductions of prices for consumer goods**.\n\n> These are the basic conditions required to pave the way for the transition to communism.\n\nStalin clearly sees productivity gains as being tied to decreased working hours, diffusion of polytechnic education and increased purchasing power, but there is barely a mention of the expansion of consumer goods to match western consumption levels. Khrushchev somewhat attempts to address the collective farm issue with further expansion of state farms, but this was not a campaign that had the necessary involvement of the masses required. Instead, the terms of competition with the imperialist bloc were set almost entirely on consumerist terms. This is laughable considering that even the most ardent defenders of Soviet planning in the Stalin period will tell you this was impossible without imperialist super-exploitation.",
