    "selftext": "Papua New Guinea is the most important country for a socialist revolution in Oceania. \nAustralia & New Zealand are quite obviously separate from the rest of Oceania politically & socially.\n\n\nThe position of Papua New Guinea in Oceania is comparable to the position of Cuba in the Caribbean. \nBoth are the largest countries in their respective region with fairly large population. \nBoth have a big imperialist country nearby (Australia & USA).\nBoth have smaller neighbouring countries to spread revolution to (Solomon Islands & Haiti, etc.).\nAt the same time, they both have resources to build socialism on their own.\n\n\nUnification with West Papua is possible, I think, only after a socialist revolution in Indonesia proper.\nThat country still has a tight grip over West Papua to exploit its rich resources.\nBougainville, despite being an important mining region, should be ceded to Solomon Islands.\nIt would greatly increase popularity of socialism in that region & help spread the revolution to Solomon Islands & other countries of Oceania.\n\n\nAustralian capital has penetrated many industries in Papua New Guinea, especially the mining one. \nNationalization of these industries would be an obvious excuse for a counter-revolutionary aggression from Australia (& possibly from Indonesia).\nThat would be a hard challenge to repel such an invasion.\n\n\nThere is also a problem to unite numerous ethnic groups (speaking hundreds of languages & living in difficult mountainous terrain) under \na single revolutionary movement, & at the same time, to allow these cultures & languages to flourish.\n\n\nP. S. These are just my random thoughts on the issue. I do not claim that these statements are factually correct. Feel free to point out errors.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

'a revolution in indonesia proper' is not possible, no matter how much we would like that to happen. communism is not happening on that country any time soon. over a million communists and even barely leftist people were slaughtered. do you think the decades-long work of suharto propaganda and bourgeois organization on that country did not take a toll on humanist aspirations?\n\n\nwe have to be realistic. a communist revolution is not happening, but a national movement probably will soon. people are already discontent with the almost half-century rule of the devil suharto's family. so it's no surprise if there were more protests soon: months ago we saw that with the protestors in jakarta.\n\n\nwe just have to wait for the next one and hope it boils down into deeper civil unrest so that people can start questioning suharto, and hopefully start questioning the decades-old communists, leftists, and civilians genocide that suharto did.",
