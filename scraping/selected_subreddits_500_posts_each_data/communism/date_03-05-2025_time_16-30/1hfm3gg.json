Meanwhile, reformist left-wing parties have failed to offer real solutions, losing the trust of their voters and leaving a political void.\n\nIn this context, the far right is gaining ground, capitalizing on popular discontent and presenting itself as an alternative that exploits the fear and despair of the masses.\n\nAt the final rally held in the Casino de la Reina, various CJS spokespersons emphasized the importance of organizing youth to channel the prevailing discontent of the current moment and emerge from defeat.\n\n[https://x.com/CJSocialista](https://x.com/CJSocialista)",

Communists are always being persecuted, even the most famous Communist used to be known by their nicknames: Lenin, Stalin and Trotsky 4 example. Also, we' re terrorists, terrorists against the old Borgouise State and we might always put that in mind. Saving ur identity is nothing more than letting yourself and your family safe, the capitalism won't be fair against the revolutionary workers.",
