You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

The perspectives of the Frankfurt School can also be brought up and even outside this conversation I would reccomend you research their works.",

Elitists would say that it is brilliant cause it displays the painter's mastery of mixing paint to the point that the art is seamless. But before we reached that point, dada artists were already critiquing such take on art, the bourgeoisie-ness of it all. How art is slowly becoming for the elite and absent from the masses. \n\nDada artists looked at art. And realized how nonsense it was. How lacking of emotions it was. How it's only for the bourgeoisie to understand. So they made a satire out of it. They pushed the bounds of nothingness, absurdity, in a spontaneous manner that elicits a delighted but awkward response within the masses. \n\nThe most relatable comparison nowadays is The Onion. Their articles are absurd, and they critique the ideas in their articles by pushing the bounds of these ideas to the point of absurdity. And us, the masses, find ourselves delighted that we aren't part of that clownery, immediately followed by the uncomfortable feeling that we aren't that far off from what is being portrayed in the articles. \n\nThat is how Dada artists critiqued the idea of \"art for art's sake\". They took that idea, pushed it to the point of absurdity. They took a urinal and said, \"behold: art!\" or strung words that sound good together but means nothing and cried out, \"dada is anti-dada\" and people started to question: what IS art? And the most direct art form that they were experiencing at that time was art made for those who weren't bombed by the world wars. Dada artists wanted people to ask, is THIS art? In the middle of war?",
