You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The country's leader was the Dalai Lama and a class of buddhist monks, the rest of the population (like 90%+) were slaves of the leading class. After the Chinese Civil War reached a halt the PRC invaded Tibet and liberated the slave population, but they also granted some level of autonomy to the Buddhist state.\n\nThe standard of living in Tibet skyrocketed under the PRC. The west often uses Tibet to show china as a boogeyman. This pro-Tibet propaganda convinced a lot of people without too much understanding on the topic. Some proof to show that the conflict over Tibet is fueled by the west is that most independent tibet movements are majority white buddhists and brainwashed people from Europe and North America, and it was proven several times that the Dalai Lama receives money from the CIA",

For example, there were several kingdoms and princely states during the reign of British India which had 'suzerainty' status or relationship with the British.",

I've heard that China wants to arrest the Dalai Lama. But the same people say the Uyghurs are genocided, which I know is not true, so idk.",

                            "body": "When you say that they were annexed ''against their will'', you have to ask yourself, against the will of whom? Tibet, just like the rest of China itself, was a contradictory society composed of antagonistic classes. The former feudalistic caste whom the Dalai Lama is descendant from certainly did not wish to become a part of Socialist China as that meant the liquidation of their oppressive class, but that is not to say that the oppressed classes of Tibet which was composed of the peasantry and the nascent proletariat didn't welcome the People's Republic of China. Indeed, they saw liberation to an extent that they had never seen before with the abolition of serfdom in 1959; it was the Tibetan masses themselves who spearheaded the destruction of what you'd associate as the ''Tibetan identity'' and the Buddhist clergy. You might find this display of mass mobilisation in Tibet interesting https://foreignpolicy.com/slideshow/when-tibet-loved-china/\n\n\nIt has become a different question today however as the People's Republic of China has lost its revolutionary character after Deng's counter-revolution and the arrest of the Gang of Four which has lead the revival of Han chauvinism, oppressive class relations and the formation of new national divisions. Under these new conditions, the separation of Tibet from the rest of China as an independent socialist nation would be a progressive move, but the revolutionary masses of Tibet will never look up to the Dalai Lama and the rest of the former aristocratic caste, who have coalesced into a reactionary ''government-in-exile'', as their leaders. The Dalai Lama and his exiled government are foreign impositions who are funded by the CIA and could not exist without its support.",

If it were colonialism, the Chinese would\u2019ve easily taken the resources without changing the social situation, be it with force and total disregard for human life or with overly favourable trade deals. Which is exactly what happened in Africa and the Americas.",
