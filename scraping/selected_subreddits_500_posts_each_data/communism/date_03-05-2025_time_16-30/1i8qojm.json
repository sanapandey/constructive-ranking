    "selftext": "In Vietnam, the Communist Party is the ruling party, directly governing the country and encompassing all professions and sectors. At the primary school level, there is the \"Young Pioneer Team,\" and in secondary school, activities are organized under the \"Communist Youth Union.\" In the workplace, companies often establish Party branches and labor unions for people to participate in. So, in countries like the U.S., Germany, Brazil, and others, what do communist parties do to persuade and attract people?",

            "body": "In Germany, communist parties are very weak atm so they are not really very visible in every day life. The first big \u201cclassic\u201d one was KPD, which was forbidden in West Germany in 1956. Deriving from the KPD we have the DKP which is very small though (and mainly old people) and in East Germany there used to be the ruling party SED, also deriving from the KPD. The SED was severely restructured in the 1990s, now named \u201cDie Linke\u201d, and eventually became more and more social democratic while also in danger of losing the few parliamentary seats they still have. Other minor parties include MLPD, RKP or SGP.\nDie Linke is big enough to appear on TV shows, posters and other mass media. They also have a youth organisation which is fairly big. The other parties are too small to really appear in a broad public.\nWhile a lot of people do see (at least some of) the downsides of our capitalist system, they usually do not see communism as an answer. This will probably have to do with East Germany\u2019s communist past and capitalist propaganda in the west. This opens up the way for conservative and fascist parties to rise, which is happening right now. February 23rd could see a terrible outcome of votes but nonetheless communists, socialists and other people fighting for a new world are standing together.",

            "body": "In Brazil we have many parties, including three communist parties, [Partido Comunista Brasileiro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Communist_Party) PCB, [Partido Comunista do Brasil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Brazil) PCdoB, and [Unidade Popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Unity_(Brazil)) UP. Each of these have different strategies, that sometimes converge and other times conflict.\n\nPCdoB for example has been base of the reformist Workers Party ([Partido dos Trabalhadores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers%27_Party_(Brazil)) PT), the one of our president Lula. The other two parties have profound disagreement with PT, and only really team-up during the second term of the elections to avoid the far-right.\n\nBrazil is a country of extremes, so at the same time we have an organised bourgeois class who [owns everything](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294715/distribution-wealth-by-percentile-brazil/) (the land, the few factories our country have, the banks, schools, media, etc.), the majority of population is disorganized and dispersed, with only a couple of popular movements with expression - such as the [Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landless_Workers%27_Movement) and the [Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeless_Workers%27_Movement) to cite a few - which of course are treated as criminals by the bourgeois apparatus.\n\nOne of the reasons for that is the coup d'etat of 1964, where the bourgeois class aligned with the military to exterminate the communists, with the external help of the Imperialism ([Operation Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_Condor)). Torture and murder were the order of the day during this dark period in our bloody history, which was quite similar to what happened to our fellow South American countries (especially Argentina and Chile). This cut-off our possibility to interact with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.\n\nAfter that, with the Germany reunification in 1989 and the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the communist movement suffered yet another attack via the reformism, and the word \"communist\" was slowly becoming farther and farther associated with the workers movement, due to the decreasing in size and influence of the parties and also because of the neoliberal ideology.\n\nBrazil has a very long way until we can free our people from the exploitation of humans by humans. The communist movement in the country remains fragmented and pursuing different strategies in a world full of challenges for the workers class. Despite these challenges, the fight continues.",

During the late 80s, some [considerable people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Freire_(politician)) of PCB also decided to take the path of reformism. This almost destroyed the party, in a process named \"liquidation\" of the party. With that I just want to show that despite PCdoB being dominated by the reformist wing, this can change internally, since there are still revolutionary militants.\n\nConcordo contigo se olharmos para o momento hist\u00f3rico atual, mas eu quis analisar de forma mais ampla. Durante o final dos anos 1980, pessoas importantes do PCB tamb\u00e9m tomaram o caminho do reformismo. Como todos sabemos, isso quase destruiu o mesmo, no processo chamado \"[liquidacionismo](https://contrapoder.net/colunas/uma-farsa-em-movimento-o-liquidacionismo-querendo-tutelar-os-cem-anos-do-pcb/)\" do partid\u00e3o.

In my view the problem with oligarchs is not that they being tyrants grab the power by faking elections, but instead they have so much wealth and resources that they can just buy the elections. \n\nIdk about Belarus, but that's what happened in Russia in 1996. They bought the media and were able to make people vote for them even though the administration was dogwater. \n\nThat's what happens in the US currently too..\n\nI think in some time maybe if we stop the foset of propaganda and let it wear off on people, only then maybe we could see what's the people actually think",

            "body": "Brazilian communism is almost irrelevant in most of the country. There's a long list of criticism available to brazilian communist parties here in this sub and all you need is to search for the given criticism.\n\nI see that you got 2 answers where both (and there's a good reason for it) never even mention PCB and UP's own revisionism and reformism. Since you are not brazilian I can't tell you to struggle with them and come back after a given time where their reformist line and revisionism have put you near a state of shock with their complete lack of reality.\n\nNot sure if that's the best metric but [numbers show that brazilian youth have not being really that interested in joining a party](https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/noticia/2024/04/29/filiacao-de-jovens-a-partidos-politicos-segue-caindo-mas-polarizacao-reverte-quedas-de-pt-e-pl.ghtml) and numbers have been decreasing for a few years over the last decade. That PSOL (not a communist party and a very ecletic 'socialist' one) is becoming the most numerous force among the youth on the left give you a glimpse of the poor work that is being done and that there's not a very dedicated theoretical work in practice here. Anyway, somehow UP [think they are \"growing\"](https://www.unidadepopular.org.br/blog/resolucao-politica-do-diretorio-nacional-da-up) as their electoral apparatus is really growing but that only shows UP's own commitment to Social-Democracy and the complete abandonment of marxism that is in course inside the party.\n\nI would also add that is very visible in places where PCB have presidency in a Union or any other bureaucratic position of relative importance that their reformist line is so clear that most people in an Union have to struggle against PCB's reformism (Which is a consequence of struggling against opportunism in the age of imperialism, but most have to do it without a revolutionary party) and therefore their attachment to PT as a minor ally (just as the mentioned PCdoB) and the bourgeois state apparatus than engage into any discussion about a revolution to begin with.\n\nIt's sad to see that so many fellow brazilians are so naive and fantasious about PCB and UP when it's very clear in theory that both are counterrevolutionaries, but that's a consequence of their dogmatism.\n\nWhether communism (and even more with maoism nowadays) in Brazil have always been a minoritary tendency among leftist circles, that those parties insist that their failing is only due to prosecution shows you how they are not even interested in self-criticism and their own revisionism (which causes failure) never comes into question.",

            "body": "The communist party in Brazil that isn\u2019t trotskist, actively working with the bourgeoisie and playing liberal politics, is the Unidade Popular (UP). We\u2019re a Marxist-Leninist organization and the youngest legal political party in the country, there\u2019s no officials elected from us but we do a lot of baseline work. A lot of it comes from doing ideological courses, political occupations, and we also sell our newspaper, A Verdade, as a way to denounce bourgeos media and recruit. \n\nBecause we don\u2019t take any private funding, we are very poor, but I\u2019m from a state where our party has been very active (Bahia. We\u2019ve been behind most protests here nowadays) and even though we have no actual building (we organize in an occupied abandoned house) our student movements have been growing and we have been getting some foot in a few districts. It\u2019s all very baseline and simple work and our country is very far from a true revolution but, talking with people in the streets and doing the organizing work brings me a lot of hope. Things are less worse than I thought they were before organizing. \n\nThat being said the liberal organizations that call themselves socialist here are a huge obstacle. Not only it is hard to get the trust of the population because they see a \u201cleftist\u201d party and they immediately associate it with PT, the awful liberal party that continuously sells out to bourgeois interests while selling itself as a proletariat party, but also the people from PT, PSOL, PCdoB, and specially their youth group, UJS, tend to sabotage us. Either through student election fraud or rumors or other petty shit. They also just usually tend to be cowards in all the leftist assemblies, if it were up to them we would never protest anywhere. Recently there was an issue when we were scheduling the protest again the 6x1 work week where we wanted to occupy a big shopping (disrupting work and also bringing the protest to the workers that are involved with it) while they wanted to go to the beach and talk to the people out there during the holidays. Obviously their protest was a failure, disorganized, they couldn\u2019t actually organize their voices to disrupt anything and the two groups kept shouting different things, while we successfully took over the shopping. They\u2019re just annoying, it makes me angry that they\u2019re what people think when they think of socialist parties here.",
