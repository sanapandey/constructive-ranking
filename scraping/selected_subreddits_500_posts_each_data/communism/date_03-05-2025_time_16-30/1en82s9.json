    "selftext": "Hello Comrades,\n\nI am currently writing a scientific paper on Socialist Solidarity during the Cold War. I was planning to look at the support the DPRK, Cuba and Vietnam received from the Warsaw Pact countries and wanted to provide some context for each liberation struggle. As I also wanted to take a look at the opposing side and knew what the Americans did in the South, I took a short look at Wikipedia (to get a feel about how bad the narrative is). I was pleasantly surprised on how even Wikipedia kinda agreed that the american occupation handled things worse than the \"evil commies\". So I wanted to know if you have some good books (preferably scientific and \"neutral\" as per boring western scientific standards) that I can use to provide the appropriate context to the illegal occupation and the dissolution of the popular Peoples committees and the persecution of Socialists. I'll research myself of course, but some of you will probably be deeper in the literature than I am, so any recommendations are welcome.",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

And about Japan, guess which side actually incorporated many Japanese collaborators in their Korean administration, they even kept Japanese administrators as advisors. The war was started by both sides, there had been skirmishes for months, then it escalated into full blown war as both Koreas claimed to be the only real one (the split was horrible, Korea was a pretty unitary country so no wonder things escalated into war). The americans also killed thousands of protesters because as it turns out empowering landowners and Japanese collaborators is not all too popular. The Soviets weren't perfect, they still pushed the Councils on their side more towards Communism, but they cooperated with the local, largely popular Korean movement while the americans created a right wing government made up of landowners that hunted communists for decades and only became a western \"democracy\" after 3 decades of military dictatorship.\n\nThe narrative you mentioned here is exactly what I want to work against in my paper, because the western narrative on the Korea war and the DPRK is complete bullshit, something even western historians kinda agree with.",

Massive exploitation of their own population and later with high tech industry of the global South, all while the North was under constant economic blockade. High Suicide rates, depression and a massive wealth gap in South Korea are a product of this economic developement. GDP doesn't say shit about how the people are doing. Modern South Korea is part of the imperial core, contributing to untold suffering of the global South, keeping billions poor, including their own bretheren in the North with economic embargoes. The north has many flaws, as every country does but South Korea is no success story, atleast not for the poor that live side by side with billionairs that keep them poor.",

Murdering communists, union members, any and all protestors and dissidents. So if you want to start about political repression, maybe start with the side that dismissed any and all local attempts at nation building and crushed dissent with South Korean Landowners as their only allies.\nNot to mention the genocide the americans comitted during the war, throwing more bombs at korean villages then during the entirety of World war 2 globally. They dropped fucking plague infected fleas to test if they could just bioweapon the war to an end. North Korea got economically annihilated by a genocidal bombing campaign and strangled by economic blockades ever since, and you wonder about poverty.",
