You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

            "body": "I've been very frustrated with *Going Against the Tide*, but I have found the manuals presented by the OCR leadership to be really thoughtful. \n\nFirstly, the distinction between agitation, propaganda and theory has been really clarifying. I'm sure that maybe it's a distinction made else well, and I'd love if a comrade here could share that. \n\nBut I think the value of this brief manual is that there is an important method to writing propaganda. Specifically, they state that:\n\n*\"Whatever the topic of the particular propaganda, the important thing is that our propaganda gives the masses a compelling explanation that answers the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d questions. To accomplish this, our propaganda must center the contradiction(s) at the core of the topic, not just present lots of exposure and then tack on \u201cand that\u2019s why we need revolution\u201d at the end. The audience for our propaganda should be brought to our intended conclusion through gaining an understanding of the contradiction(s) in question, which will require us to provide sufficient factual information and analyze that information with materialist dialectics.\"*\n\nIt's a shame about the drop in quality of kites before it's liquidation, but this type of article reminds me what I appreciated about them.",
