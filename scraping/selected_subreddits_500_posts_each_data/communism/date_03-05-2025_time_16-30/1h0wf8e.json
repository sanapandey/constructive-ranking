            "body": "I wish I could say this was interesting to watch and there are parts that are wild, like when they argue the Soviet Union should have integrated Marxism and orthodox Christianity (and whatever else the culture of Russia is supposed to be - that the USSR was not Russia is the least insane thing about this idea), but overall it's pretty bad even on those terms. The meaning of Marxism is so specific in the CCP's bloated terminology that these videos are nearly incomprehensible. Like what is the \"second track\" supposed to be? The implication is traditional culture but where does this term come from? Not Marx. Actually there is no a single quote from Marx or any reference to any of his work or ideas. That's on purpose, they show in the background many of his writings on China so they're not ignorant. Rather any hint of Marx's actual words are dangerous. All that's left is this vacuous jargon and random bizarre claims, like Marx was a critic of capitalism but his real value is as a theorist of humanity like Plato and Confucius and repeating the same thing over and over again without any content.\n\nThe only pleasure I get from this is there are so many \"Western\" Dengists who wish the Chinese government would pay them to make content and they absolutely would do a better job speaking the language of their audience than this video. But China doesn't care about them at all, it would rather get some random Russian guy who speaks Chinese because he says exactly what you're supposed to say and appeals to whoever made this video as respectable. They're Brezhnevites, they're not going to associate with that guy with a spanking fetish and a whiny voice. Actually that's the one thing in China's favor, at least its bourgeoisie has the self respect of a rising class unlike the fascists on RT who cynically exploit the worst aspects of American internet decadence.",
