The statement contained the names of 35 cadres reportedly killed during the skirmish. The Chhattisgarh state police had said 31 Maoists were killed in the firefight. Most of the deceased Maoists were said to belong to the sixth company of the PLGA (the armed wing of the CPI (Maoist)).\n\n>It is alleged in the statement released by the Maoist party\u2019s EBDC that while doing roll call at 6 am, the sound of firing was heard from all sides.
