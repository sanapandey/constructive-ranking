If it doesn\u2019t have to be about him specifically and it can be fictional, I went on a Vietnamese film binge last year and my favorite was the 1974 film The little girl of Hanoi. It doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the destruction America brought to the Vietnamese people but there\u2019s a line of hope throughout in the compassion between the Vietnamese people themselves. \n\nI realize this was supposed to be for the weekend and it may be too late but I just saw this so I thought I\u2019d answer anyway.",
