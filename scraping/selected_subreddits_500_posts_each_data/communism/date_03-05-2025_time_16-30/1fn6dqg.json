            "body": "Here are some quotes from *Postmodernism*:\n\n>This allows me to express my thesis in its strongest form, which is that the rhetoric of the market\nhas been a fundamental and central component of this ideological struggle, this struggle for the\nlegitimation or delegitimation of left discourse. The surrender to the various forms of market\nideology -- on the left, I mean, not to mention everybody else -- has been imperceptible but\nalarmingly universal. Everyone is now willing to mumble, as though it were an inconsequential\nconcession in passing to public opinion and current received wisdom (or shared\ncommunicational presuppositions) that no society can function efficiently without the market and\nthat planning is obviously impossible. This is the second shoe of the destiny of that older piece\nof discourse, \"nationalization,\" which it follows some twenty years later, just as, in general, full\nPostmodernism (particularly in the political field) has turned out to be the sequel, continuation,\nand fulfillment of the old fifties \"end ideology\" episode. At any rate, we were then willing to\nmurmur agreement to the increasingly widespread proposition that socialism had nothing to do\nwith nationalization; the consequence is that today we find ourselves having to agree to the\nproposition that socialism really has nothing to do with socialism itself any longer. \"The market\nis in human nature\" is the proposition that cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged; in my\nopinion, it is the most crucial terrain of ideological struggle in our time. If you let it pass because it seems an inconsequential admission or, worse yet, because\nyou've really come to believe in it yourself, in your \"heart of hearts,\" then socialism and\nMarxism alike will have effectively become delegitimated, at least for a time. Sweezy reminds\nus that capitalism failed to catch on in a number of places before it finally arrived in England;\nand that if the actually existing socialisms go down the drain, there will be other, better, ones\nlater on. I believe this also, but we don't have to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. In the same\nspirit I want to add to the formulations and tactics of Stuart Hall's \"discourse analysis\" the same\nkind of historical qualifier: the fundamental level on which political struggle is waged is that of\nthe legitimacy of concepts like planning or the market -- at least right now and in our current\nsituation. At future times, politics will take more activist forms from that, just as it has done in\nthe past.\n\n...\n\n>Market ideology assures us that human\nbeings make a mess of it when they try to control their destinies (\"socialism is impossible\") and\nthat we are fortunate in possessing an interpersonal mechanism -- the market -- which can\nsubstitute for human hubris and planning and replace human decisions altogether. We only need\nto keep it clean and well oiled, and it now -- like the monarch so many centuries ago -- will see\nto us and keep us in line.\nWhy this consoling replacement for the divinity should be so universally attractive at the present\ntime, however, is a different kind of historical question. The attribution of the newfound embrace\nof market freedom to the fear of Stalinism and Stalin is touching but just slightly misplaced in\ntime, although certainly the current Gulag Industry has\nbeen a crucial component in the \"legitimation\" of these ideological representations (along with\nthe Holocaust Industry, whose peculiar relations to the rhetoric of the Gulag demand closer\ncultural and ideological study).\n\n...\n\n>The most intelligent criticism ever offered me on a long analysis of the sixties I once published\nI owe to Wlad Godzich, who expressed Socratic amazement at the absence, from my global\nmodel, of the Second World, and in particular the Soviet Union. Our experience of perestroika\nhas revealed dimensions of Soviet history that powerfully reinforce Godzich's point and make\nmy own lapse all the more deplorable; so I will here make amends by exaggerating in the other\ndirection. My feeling has, in fact, come to be that the failure of the Khrushchev experiment was\nnot disastrous merely for the Soviet Union, but somehow fundamentally crucial for the rest of\nglobal history, and not least the future of socialism itself. In the Soviet Union, indeed, we are\ngiven to understand that the Khrushchev generation was the last to believe in the possibility of a\nrenewal of Marxism, let alone socialism; or rather, the other way around, that it was their failure\nwhich now determines the utter indifference to Marxism and socialism of several generations of\nyounger intellectuals. But I think this failure was also determinant of the most basic\ndevelopments in other countries as well, and while one does not want the Russian comrades to\nbear all the responsibility for global history, there does seem to me to be some similarity between\nwhat the Soviet revolution meant for the rest of the world positively and the negative effects of\nthis last, missed, opportunity to restore that revolution and to transform the party in the process.\nBoth the anarchism of the sixties in the West and the Cultural Revolution in China are to be\nattributed to that failure, whose prolongation, long after the end of both, explains the universal\ntriumph of what Sloterdijk calls \"cynical reason\" in the omnipresent consumerism of the\npostmodern today. It is therefore no wonder that such profound disillusionment with political\npraxis should result in the popularity of the rhetoric of market abnegation and the surrender of\nhuman freedom to a now lavish invisible hand. \n\n...\n\n>What is wanted is a great collective project in which an active majority of the\npopulation participates, as something belonging to it and constructed by its own energies. The\nsetting of social priorities -- also known in the socialist literature as planning -- would have to be\na part of such a collective project. It should be clear, however, that virtually by definition the\nmarket cannot be a project at all. \n\nWho is left to say such things, let alone a brilliant intellectual? Put aside the work on culture for a second, we are losing the last generation for whom:\n\n>\"Utopia\" in that period was also a code word\nthat simply meant \"socialism\" or any revolutionary attempt to create a radically different society,\nwhich the ex-radicals of that time identified almost exclusively with Stalin and Soviet\ncommunism.\n\nJameson was one of the few who retained something essential from it through the great utopian rebirth of the \"new left.\" Academia today, and politics in general, has made reflections on socialism like this impossible and only the market unifies the discordant and weak voices of a postmodern society. It's simply a matter of whose market: the Chinese or the US. I'll let this reactionary summarize Jameson's value:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1fmzqal/fredric_jameson_has_passed_away_rip_to_one_of_the/loehm33/\n\n>the original tankie\n\nindeed",

                    "body": "I was rereading the Walmart essay this morning\n> What is important to grasp, however, is that these diagnoses of \u201cmodernity\u201d are not specific to Heidegger; they are part and parcel of a whole conservative and anti-modernist ideology embraced by non-leftist intellectuals across the board in the 1920s, from T. S. Eliot to Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gassett, by traditionalists from China to America. This ideology expresses a horror of the new industrial city with its new working and white-collar classes, its mass culture and its public sphere, its standardization and its parliamentary systems; and it often implies a nostalgia for the older agriculturalist ways of life, as in the American \u201cFugitives,\u201d in the idealization of English yeoman farmers, or in the Heideggerian Feldweg. It is unnecessary to add that this ideology is informed by an abiding fear of socialism or communism, and that the corporatisms that dominate the political life of the 1930s, from Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal to Stalin\u2019s Five-Year Plans, from Nazism and Italian fascism to Fabian social democracy, are from this perspective to be seen as so many compromises with such traditionalism as it resists the so-called modernities of the age of so-called mass man.\n\n> Those compromises have, to be sure, now for the most part entered history (leaving contemporary social democracy in some disarray, it may be added, in a situation in which free-market fundamentalism is so far really the only serviceable new practical-political ideology); but *iI want to argue that the general social attitudes of the older conservative ideology I have just outlined (and of which Heidegger is only the most extraordinary philosophical theorist) are still largely with us and still intellectually and ideologically operative.**\n\n> I will do so by returning to the issue of representational Utopias I raised earlier. Indeed, the standard way of dealing with the social anxieties that inform the old anti-modernist ideology has been to accept it while assuring us that in whatever future \u201cmore perfect society\u201d all of the negative features it enumerates will have been corrected. Thus, in these pastorals, there will be no social insecurity to generate anxiety (and even death will be postponed), idle gossip will presumably be replaced by a purified language and by genuine human relationships, morbid curiosity by a certain healthy distance from others as well as an enlightened awareness of our position in the social totality, \u201cambiguity\u201d (by which Heidegger means the lies and propaganda of mass culture and the public sphere) will be cured by our more authentic relationships to the project and to work and action in general, and Verfallenheit (our loss of self in the public dimension of the man, or the inauthenticity of \u201cmass man\u201d) will be replaced by some more genuine individualism and a more authentic isolation of the self in its own existential concerns and commitments. Now these are all no doubt excellent and desirable developments; but it is not hard to see that they are also essentially reactive: that is to say, they constitute so many obedient replacements of the reigning negative terms by their positive opposites. But this very reactivity of the Heideggerian response tends to confirm the priority of the negative diagnosis in the first place.\n\nhttps://www.versobooks.com/services/currency/update?currency=GBP&country=AU&return_to=%2Fen-gb%2Fblogs%2Fnews%2F2774-fredric-jameson-wal-mart-as-utopia%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoraZ_HnA4_w5S1o_J0QN9nrWSeoVb5vA1hQJ_U_xFabBqzKKg_T\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to see as much of today\u2019s \u201cleft\u201d as the right in the last paragraph. Be it in anti-trust or pro-China form. It is a shame his age kept him from being able to fully grasp the internet, just about all from *Postmodernism* came to pass on it.",
