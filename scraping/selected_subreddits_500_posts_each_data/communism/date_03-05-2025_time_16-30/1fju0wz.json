You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The closest African country to what you're looking for might be Eritrea where they're still in the midst of their own democratic revolution that hasn't been reversed and is governed by former socialist guerillas who had fought for independance; they don't have a planned economy but they haven't allowed themselves to pilfered by imperialists, like what's happened in Somalia, and have been sanctioned by them in return, maintaining a relatively stable nation-state that has kept the economy organised on a rational basis.",

Other Chinese diplomats tell us Isaias dislikes Deng Xiaoping because Deng attempted to undermine Mao\u00b4s legacy. Isaias avidly consumes biographies of Mao and has refused offers of books on Deng and modern China. On a monthly basis the Chinese ambassador\u00b4s chef gets a request from Isaias to send over a Chinese meal. Ambassador Li reported that Isaias watches Chinese news on television.\u201d\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20231003025050/https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/8mepr/20102009-isaias-zedong",

I remember seeing a photo and a few articles detailing visits from Che Guevara to President Nkrumah. The opposition party at the time wanted to capture the country for themselves and aligned with imperial powers to oust Dr Nkrumah (apparently the CIA were involved in his subsequent death). Since then, our country has run a strange, bastardised mix of capitalism combined with numerous the socialist interventions put in place by Dr Nkrumah during his time as president.\n\nAnother example I can give is Thomas Sankara and Burkina Faso. But again, imperialists and their meddling ensured that the country didn't develop past ever needing them.\n\nAfrica is in a particularly difficult position to implement communism because unfortunately, our leaders are more interested in enriching themselves and aligning with white supremacist ideals than actually leading us away from needing external aide.",

            "body": "A New Democratic revolution established through a people's war has not been attempted in Africa yet, this might explain the failures of past attempts of implementing socialism in African countries, considering most, if not all of them are semi-colonial and semi-feudal in nature. The exception might be Eritrea, as has been mentioned. The Simba rebellion was an attempt at revolution in the DRC and Che Guevara went there to assist the revolutionaries but it failed because a people's war strategy was not implemented. Che was a proponent of focoism which has not been successful anywhere but in Cuba due to extraordinary conditions that existed during the Batista regime. I believe there were African Maoists fighting in the Simba revolution but I don't think a communist party existed, so this general disorganization couple with attempts to implement foco theory of guerrilla war may have caused the failure of this revolution.\n\nConsidering the importance the DRC has in the value-chains of many of the most important modern commodities a successful revolution there would have been devastating for imperialism and probably would have triggered a revolutionary wave throughout the whole of Africa.",

Sankara was a great person and patriot for Burkina Faso but he wasn't able to accomplish much as he presided over a fragile and isolated government without a party apparatus to organise the Burkinabe masses, leaving him vulnerable to a coup that quickly undid every gain that he achieved. Even if he wasn't assassinated, Burkina Faso likely would've capitulated to neoliberalism in the 90s like Ghana or the Rep Congo\n\n\nThe Soviet Union under Stalin, and China under Mao saw greater liberatory heights than Burkina Faso, even Socialist Albania lead by Hoxha accomplished much more, it isn't Sankara's fault but I don't see what would make him a greater leader than the three I mentioned",
