If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking.

And rightfully alienated they are; who in their right mind actually believes that a small, \"secret\" cult of white campus radicals can (or should) \"lead\" the masses of non-white people to their/our freedom? Whatever those people are smoking, I don't want any! I do have to say, however, that MIM is indeed the least dogma addicted of the entire white left millieu that I've encountered; but dogma addicted nonetheless.\n\n[https://archive.iww.org/history/library/Jackson/copinyourhead/](https://archive.iww.org/history/library/Jackson/copinyourhead/)\n\nThere\u2019s [this post here from 7 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/7p5pbh/what_happened_to_mim/), where u/smokeuptheweed9 kind of dismisses the original party out of hand.\n\nThis is all important because I\u2019d say most of the posters here and myself agree with the basic points MIM put forward, and have been greatly influenced by their work. But there is almost no post-mortem of what happened to the original party, except by its successor MIM(Prisons).\\* \n\nWhat I\u2019m thinking is that basically the MIM wasn\u2019t really a revolutionary organization in it\u2019s time, it\u2019s only noteworthy because it was able to summarize the lessons of the revolutionary movement in Amerika up until that time (or perhaps just one important lesson - the national contradiction & labor aristocracy). It was the New Afrikan revolutionary organizations where Sakai\u2019s work emerged from, and MIM played a role in disseminating these ideas in Euro-Amerika among students. But something happens when we take these lessons from the past as ossified, without continually re-examining and re-inventing that theory. \n\n\\*MIM(P) claims that a centralized party only becomes necessary when vying for state power, and now the central task is ideological - which is why they focus on distributing these ideas among prisoners. Which in some ways corresponds to the prevailing mood here, that places importance on theoretical practice - beginning to study our concrete conditions and apply general theoretical concepts. \n\nIf anyone has any further resources, or can help me understand the history here I\u2019d greatly appreciate it.",

I hereby retract them. Having been committed to the toxic Marxist perspective for more than half my life, it ultimately\u00a0proved impossible for me not to perceive the consistent and century-old pattern of far-left apologetics for every conceivable atrocity committed by avowed enemies of the West (including war crimes and genocide), these typically starting with denial, moving to excuse, and ending in justification (Glazov,\u00a02009, p. 208). This was starkly highlighted in the leftist response to the bestial violence unleashed by Hamas terrorists in Israel on October 7, 2023 (Berkovits,\u00a02024). Laboring\u00a0under Marxian\u00a0fantasies for so long, following the shock of recognition in witnessing such moral and intellectual decrepitude\u00a0its dissolution in my mind was precipitate. Undoubtedly, as Polish philosopher and historian Leszek Kolakowski (1927\u20132009) wrote, \u201cthe extinction of myths requires certain conditions. But,\u201d he continues, \u201cit will be a mass extinction: once one myth is exposed, the rest will follow, hurtling down like an avalanche. [. . .] And its collapse had to be as total as its rule had been: a chain of divinities, collapsing like a pack of cards. What folly to imagine it was possible to extract just one!\u201d (Kolakowski,\u00a02012).\"",

Today, proponents of \u2018multipolarity\u2019 deny the appalling repression conducted by the Chinese government against the Uyghur people of Xinjiang/East Turkestan, and China\u2019s record of human rights violations, extreme labour exploitation, widespread environmental despoliation, and unequal relations with weaker economic partners. Contemporary \u2018anti-imperialists\u2019 have justified, denied, or simply ignored crimes against humanity on the part of Syria\u2019s (neo)patrimonial billionaire dictatorship and its Russian and Iranian patrons. They have defended or minimized the deadly Russian invasion and occupation of Ukraine, and they have disregarded Russian economic imperialism in the former Soviet Republics.

It makes alot more sense (or less?) in the context of a long screed against Leninist \"totalitarian\" violence. He's not making an argument about Dengist revisionism - explaining how class struggle continues under socialism, how the revolutionary line was defeated, how capitalism was restored, and why Chinese capitalism has brought back national oppression, labour exploitation, etc. That's crucial. He has no real explanation for any of these things. He can only see it as \"crimes\" being either denied or acknowledged. If you think he's right just about  China, how will you face the facts when it comes to the USSR during it's socialist period? Workers under Stalin demonstrated in strikes, they were paid wages, national struggles continued - all these things are seized upon by Left-Communists to say the USSR wasn't socialist. Point is -  whether you see capitalism as just and socialism as criminal or flip the script and say capitalism is criminal and socialism is just - it's the same logic because if you find evidence of crimes or injustices that can no longer be socialism. We have to break with this way of thinking because it doesn't help us explain why anything happens.",

Any country that was not part of the empire or was its periphery (those conquered after 1937) had no chance. The only thing to understand is the particular nature of Japanese imperialism which developed outsourcing of manufacturing before anyone else.\n\nI then skimmed it and my conclusion prior to reading this essay isn't very far from Cumings; the only difference is that I originally thought that Thailand was too late to Japanese outsourcing as opposed to Cumings's idea that the \"Asian Tigers\" were really just the Japanese Empire returned and Thailand had no chance. Also Cumings spoke positively about North Korea had its industrial growth rate the highest in the \"socialist world\". Loads of academic bullshit in it but that's not very surprising. \n\nAnyway I wouldn't mind smoke joining in this little discussion since I admit I wasn't really satisfied by reading that essay, but it help.",

Talked with him and it turns out Liberia is just a classic settler colony, based on everything he told me, despite Libero-Americans (or \"Congo\" as he said they call them) being \"black\". I of course suspected so but looking through Wikipedia about politics in Liberia a few weeks back I didn't find anything about it. Every single thing he told me was consistent with settler colonialism in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Algeria, Palestine. From (minority) settler rule and apartheid (not sure if it was de jure apartheid in Liberia or just de facto but it was still obviously apartheid), to settlers fleeing to a western country (in this case Amerika) en masse after the overthrow of settler rule in 1980, to staging multiple coups and a civil war to keep their settler privileges, and so on. I suppose this makes it very easy to predict, in general terms, what will happen once settler rule is overthrown in Palestine too. On a side note it was nice to finally meet someone just out and about (i.e. outside of political action) in my town who isn't a raging fascist. He actually seemed pretty radical. He was really interested when I told him about the struggles faced and waged by other migrants in Cyprus. I need to speak to migrants more.",

But I'll answer for me though unfortunately I currently don't have anything beyond the trial and error and personal experiences of me and my closest comrades.\n\n\nWith this specific person, I've seen him about and greeted him a few times before and today I struck up a convo with him. Just usual stuff: how are you; what do you do; how long you been in Cyprus; eventually asked him where he's from and about the racism situation in Cyprus and the convo went from there. I think in the beginning he was more reserved and trying to be liberal out of politeness since I'm a local middle class Cypriot. When I asked him about the racism here he initially said \"well you know these people just haven't traveled enough\". But then I told him how angry recent racist incidents made me, how upsetting it was and so on, and he seemed to be more radical after that; I guess he felt more comfortable after he understood I really hate fascist Cypriot assholes. So it seems it's also important to establish trust with migrants, proles, etc. before they'll feel comfortable opening up and being more radical. I had to do it on an interpersonal level because I'm just a random \"white\" (in the context of Cyprus) person who lives in the area but of course this would normally be done on an organizational level, i.e. the organization earns the trust of migrants, proles, etc. through dedicated work. But I guess that's kinda communist \"common sense\" anyway. Eventually I had to go but he seemed really glad about the chat we had and I proposed to meet up again for coffee sometime, which he was really keen on because he said I gave him some interesting ideas.\n\n\nSome of my other comrades have met migrants in similar ways, just striking up convos with them. Or hanging out in areas with many migrants (for example in an area where there was an anti migrant pogrom last year in Cyprus) and striking up convos there. Maybe also at the pub or something, idk.\n\n\nMe and said comrades would like to start talking to a lot of migrants. We thought about going to the refugee camp here for example and hanging out in areas with many migrant workers as I described and striking up convos there. Or maybe we can try to find a migrant dominated workplace; afterall I found aforementioned migrant at his workplace (my neighborhood). Or there was a migrant food delivery driver protest this morning (where a South Asian driver ended up being beaten by fascists\u2014behold the beautiful island of love known as Cyprus), we could've gone there, but we didn't know it was happening. There are also NGOs that work with migrants and there's the revisionist trade union PEO and the Cypriot IWW chapter which do organising work with aforementioned food delivery drivers who we could go through / tag along with as you said.\u00a0\n\n\nAs you see the biggest hurdle for me and my comrades right now is establishing contact with migrants. Beyond that I think the obvious first biggest hurdle we'll face is establishing enough trust so they'll actually open up to us about what they think, want and need instead of giving us platitudes or \"moderating\" their line. Beyond that I imagine proving ourselves as capable servants of their interests so they trust us with whatever actions we propose (I mean, they could literally be putting their entire lives at risk by trusting us so they need to know we're not self serving, adventurists, straight up idiots, or whatever) will be an even bigger hurdle.",

In my personal experience (in the US), though, the language barrier can be a real problem.\n\nIn my city there has recently been a lot of Latin American and African migrants, most visibly involved in food delivery; groups of them hang out in the park where I usually read, waiting for delivery notifications. There are also many South American migrants (I know that many of them are from Ecuador), almost entirely women and children, selling cups of fruit on the street. These people would be really interesting to converse with, no less for information on their home countries than of that about their current conditions, but the issue is that probably very few of them speak English (looking it up, most of the African migrants seem to be from Guinea or elsewhere in Francophone West Africa), and I don't really know Spanish or French, not to mention the other languages they might speak.\n\nRecently, I entered into a conversation with a Mexican guy who I've seen a few times listening to music near where I read; since my Spanish is beginner level at best, and he seemed to know only a few basic words of English, it didn't really go anywhere. I learned that he was from Guerrero; I tried to ask him what he worked in, but got no clear response. It's possible that my Spanish is just atrocious, that he did give an answer but I just didn't hear or understand it, or that he doesn't have a job currently. If I was better able to communicate with him I definitely could have gained a lot more from this conversation, but my lack of Spanish speaking ability proved to be a definitive limit in this regard. Really, given the importance of the national struggle of Aztlan and other Spanish-speaking oppressed nations in the United $tates, improving my Spanish, maybe even to fluency, may prove to be a necessity for serious involvement in communist practice in this country. Obtaining some Spanish speaking comrades could also help; I don't really personally know other communists, so getting some comrades in general is also important personally.\n\nInvestigating the conditions of homeless people in my area might also be fruitful: they're almost entirely New Afrikan, so language isn't an issue. I already frequently give money to some around where I live; I can't imagine it would be too hard to strike up a conversation with them, if I was really determined to do so. I'm not entirely sure of the degree of revolutionary potential that this strata has, nor am I sure whether they strictly classify as lumpen or not; I suppose investigation might clear up some of these issues.",

When I asked the question, I guess I meant within the imperial core in general, but the situation varies across these states.\n\nI clearly haven't done enough in this regard, and there are some good pointers here to take note of. Perhaps having other comrades also helps (which has been a challenge in this extremely bourgeois society that I live in), but I don't mean that as an excuse.",

            "body": "Related to u/MajesticTree954's questions about MIM, but not related enough to reply to their comment.\n\nI recently found myself very intrigued by one currently salient position taken by MIM (and not just in passing, but strongly enough to devote an entire column in MIM Theory 13 to refuting the counterargument) - specifically, that the Jewish people currently form a \"nation\" by Stalin's definition of \"nation\". (I won't copy-paste the whole thing here, as it's long! But see pages 5-7 of MT13, and do use a TOR browser, please.) To preempt any misrepresentations, MC5 isn't arguing that the Jewish nation deserves the right to self-determination; rather, he seems to be saying that Amerikan \"Jews\" are not in fact Jewish, and only Israeli Jews are members of the \"Jewish Nation\". Jewish identity, at least as analyzed in MIM Theory 13, is inseparable from Israeli identity, and the \"Jewish Nation\" is the oppressor Israeli nation.\n\n(This article also goes interestingly in-depth about Stalin's support for Israel, which is interesting to me since several issues previously MIM made the bold claim that Stalin's *greatest* issue in practice was the prosecution of sodomy. But here I'm just being annoying, as I have great respect for MIM and don't think that that was a deliberate omission.)\n\nI feel like this column, in addition to raising interesting questions that become all the more salient with the anti-Israel movement in other oppressor nations, correlates in some way to the discussion that you (MajesticTree) and u/cyberwtchtechnobtch were having regarding metaphysical, postcolonialist, argubaly fascist ideas of \"nation\". There's also an interesting part halfway through about how members of an oppressed nation can have a false national identity, using Ethiopia and Eritrea as an example. Unfortunately I don't have the time nor the theoretical background at this point to give MIM's thirty-year-old reprisal of \"On the Jewish Question\" the examination it deserves.\n\n(Ugh, I wish that the MIM(Prisons) Reddit account was still active. I fear that both here and in my recent post regarding Peking Review, comradely criticism and digging into theoretical issues comes off as unprincipled because neither MC5 nor the editors of the Peking Review can respond to my comments and set me straight.)",

He references Dick in many of his other writings, I've noticed. \n\nIt's not a surprise, he was a brilliant writer, and half the reason I decided to read *Archeologies* was because Dick would be covered so extensively. But I also find it funny after discovering Jameson was reported to the FBI, together with a bunch of other academics, by Dick as a Soviet spy of some sort (this was after he fried his brain on hallucinogens). I haven't seen Jameson discuss it anywhere, either.",
