You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think Critical Theory remains relevant and useful for that reason. And as much as he\u2019s a meme, \u017di\u017eek has done good work in making Lacan more accessible and his book The Sublime Object of Ideology might be worth reading if you\u2019re interested in this.",

I would say that Freud and Lacan are worth studying insofar as they represent an historical development in their fields, so it depends on how much you expect to be engaging with them in your life. Personally I think there are more useful things to read in general but if it's your area of interest or something then go for it. You'd just have to read a materialist perspective into what they're writing.",

They are quite interresting, though he was rather sexist and that is definetly noticible, the works are clearly from the time they are from. \n\nMost modern Therapists and Psychiatrists hold, to my knowlege, a critical view towards him. While he definitly contributed heavily, many of his works have been disproven, disregarded or changed. It is still a good way to learn none the less, but you can compare it to using Grays anatomy from the 1860s to study anatomy today. You can learn the subject, but your stand of knowlege will reflect that of the time, both in factuallity aswell as in the material and social conditions that work was written and published under. \n\nId recomend to, if you want to accually learn it from a modern point of view, look into academic textbooks from publishers like pearson.",
