            "body": "I only know of a section of the Third Worldist current who uphold Lin Biao. To my knowledge, the question really is a historical one, whether Lin Biao was a traitor or not. I read a book on the topic by a person named Qiu Jin (who admits freely to having a personal stake in this, as her father was one of those caught up in the Lin Biao conspiracy).\n\nTo sum it up, Lin Biao (or, as Qiu Jin contends, Lin Biao's nepotic son, Lin Liguo) planned to use the military to coup Chairman Mao. They hastily wrote a Manifesto (Project 571), but was unable to carry out this plan, being, from the very start, extremely ill concieved. Seeing this, Lin Biao, Lin Liguo, Lin Biao's wife, Ye Qun, and a group of other people hastily boarded a plane bound for the USSR, but crashed over Mongolia (though some contend that it was shot down). When the authorities raided Lin Biao's house, they found, written in his hand, a quote from Confucius, \"\u514b\u5df1\u590d\u793c\u201c \uff08To subdue one's self and return to propriety- Legge Translation)\n\nThe full quote from the Analects is:\n\n\u989c\u6e0a\u95ee\u4ec1\uff0c\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u201c**\u514b\u5df1\u590d\u793c**\u4e3a\u4ec1\u3002\u4e00\u65e5\u514b\u5df1\u590d\u793c\uff0c\u5929\u4e0b\u5f52\u4ec1\u7109\u3002\u4e3a\u4ec1\u7531\u5df1\uff0c\u800c\u7531\u4eba\u4e4e\u54c9\uff1f\u201d\u989c\u6e0a\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u8bf7\u95ee\u5176\u76ee\uff1f\u201d\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u975e\u793c\u52ff\u89c6\uff0c\u975e\u793c\u52ff\u542c\uff0c\u975e\u793c\u52ff\u8a00\uff0c\u975e\u793c\u52ff\u52a8\u3002\u201d\u989c\u6e0a\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u56de\u867d\u4e0d\u654f\uff0c\u8bf7\u4e8b\u65af\u8bed\u77e3\u3002\u201d\n\nYan Yuan asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"**To subdue one's self and return to propriety**, is perfect virtue. If a man can for one day subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe perfect virtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or is it from others?\" Yan Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Master replied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what is contrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make no movement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yan Yuan then said, \"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practice this lesson.\" (Legge Translation again)\n\n  \nAs one can see, this shows that Lin Biao was, this whole time, a hidden Confucianist and reactionary.",

I\u2019ve seen something like this said on this subreddit a couple times, but never could find exactly what section this referred to. Is it the (now magacom) LLCO? That\u2019s the only explicitly TWist group I can think of that doesn\u2019t uphold Maoism (other than LOOP but I can\u2019t imagine that anarchists would be particularly sympathetic towards Lin Biao).",

I don't bother with it because it seems to me to be a very, very minor current within the Marxist movement, and I don't see why anyone in particular would uphold Lin Biao, given that he was very publicly a traitor to the proletarian revolution.",
