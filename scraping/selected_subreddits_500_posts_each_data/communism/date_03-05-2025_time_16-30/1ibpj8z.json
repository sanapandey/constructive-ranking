            "body": "Watching this, it's unlikely the RCP survives the death of Avakian. Not that the party matters at all even while he's alive which is sort of the point. I approved this because, other than the rhetorical commitment to actually existing socialisms of the past (which comes in a media-friendly sound bite - presumably their real opinion on Stalin is buried in Avakian's collected works and isn't for us) and the name of Bob, there's no difference between what is said in this video and any other revisionist organization. The party members come off well enough and at worst they appear overly eager and slightly scripted which is expected of being in camera and having to articulate yourself quickly and live. They are clearly not cult fanatics which makes sense since there is no substance to the cult of Bob and he seems to have modest pretensions of being worshipped by his small group as a smart person (rather than any serious efforts toward revolution or legitimation in the heavens).\n\nI almost feel a bit of affection towards the party, since they are right that Avakian is old and stayed committed in some form. It's hard not to feel that way when one's critics are mutual-aid liberals, at least these people are out here talking about socialist China. Of course I would never advocate joining the party but that's no different than any other party treated as part of the acceptable \"left.\"",

It was a rather long article, and took some time to finish, but it really provided a lot of insight and explanation for the RCP and the history of Avakian.  I realize that I missed and underestimated his historic role and importance for Maoism, and it was really eye opening to see why so many people have such an appreciation for him, since he really was a great revolutionary thinker at one point (and the degradation to full blown revisionism turned out to be far more recent a development than I had thought).  There's also a lot of real lessons on party building and party activity from this article.  I still have questions about Avakian's position versus MIM and the labour aristocracy thesis, and I would still be interested to understand what the internal response to that was from the RCP as to why they rejected or didn't engage with that (all I could ever find were a couple off-hand dismissals or one paragraph acknowledgements, and a few scathing critiques of Avakian and the RCP from MIM(Prisons)), but I suppose it was all part of the worsening ideological atrophy from their increasingly eclectic and petty bourgeois oriented political activity (and increasing disconnect from the proletariat), as well as the problems coming from their 'conjuncturalism.'",

Nevertheless, it is written clearly and the fundamental political questions are relevant, and the RCP really did do some cool stuff like send people to study the Nepalese people's war in depth and stand up to Dengism in a spectacular manner. And it does answer why the RCP was able to sabotage the RIM given it was otherwise a small party. Worship of the USA by third world peoples is an insufficient explanation, the important role it played in founding it mattered far more (and even today A World To Win articles are classics).\n\nIt's long like you said so I only read it once and don't remember all the specifics. Though I do remember the broad front with artists like Keith Haring, if you were ever convinced that the RCP was unable to keep up with the sexual revolution or the arts that should put it to rest, the complaints of the (now forgotten) Kasama project are unproductive (it is difficult to distinguish your own abuse, which is very real, from objective politics. But that is what is required of communists, all the complains about the Red Guards as a cult have come to nothing more than grifting and fringe anti-communism for \"true crime\" Internet obsessives).",
