You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I just don't encourage them to desperately search for hope in order to alleviate their problems, because hope is conditional and can turn into cynicism when it isn't reinforced and all you can perceive is bleakness; admittedly, we don't live in a hopeful time, we have just been hit by a pandemic that has killed millions of peoples and still hasn't been ended, climate change is threatening the extinction of our species while showing no signs of slowing down, and we are moving towards an inevitable third world war which will be more destructive than all previous wars. There isn't much to be hopeful of, but the contradictions immanent to capitalism will always present choices that will further its revolutionary negation and bring communism; you do not need to be delusionally optimistic to make the right choices. Though, of course, it's not easy to be able to even recognise the choices available for you to make, but to be able to do so will require more than hope.",

However despite being sent to death camps they had hope. They sang songs and laughed, one thing they did was keep a collection box that they would put their earnings in to help the community, When money stopped coming in they put Cigarettes.

We have to look at the countries and movements that are struggling for a better world and take hope from them.  Also I think it\u2019s super important to remind yourself why it\u2019s important. The world is a beautiful place with beautiful people and cultures. It deserves a society that allows these things to flourish.",

She is an inspiration to me and I hope her words can give you some solace. \n\nON THE FUTILITY OF PASSIVE OPTIMISM AND THE THREAT OF PESSIMISM\n\nThere is no greater disservice to the revolutionary cause than optimism without action. Passive optimism, that liberal illusion of hope divorced from struggle, has seduced many, convincing them that merely believing in change is enough to dismantle the very structures of oppression. But belief alone will not destroy capitalism, it will not free the oppressed, and it will not nourish the hungry. Passive optimism, by lulling us into comfort, only ensures the survival of the oppressor\u2019s chains.\nOptimism, without the will to act, eventually turns inward. When hope meets the hard reality of entrenched systems, when ideals meet the cold brutality of repression, despair is born. This despair is not accidental; it is a weapon. The oppressor feeds on our disappointment, turning it against us, hoping we will surrender to pessimism and accept defeat as inevitable. They want our despair because it paralyzes us, weakening our resolve, convincing us that we are too few, too scattered, and too weak to challenge their rule.\nBut to surrender to despair is to insult those who resist, who suffer, and who persist in their fight under conditions far more brutal than our own. We must reject pessimism as we reject the enemy\u2019s lies. Pessimism is their tool; it breeds inaction, and inaction sustains oppression.\nTrue revolutionary optimism lives in action. It is the courage to confront power, the resilience to persist despite losses, and the understanding that liberation is born not from hope alone, but from struggle.",
