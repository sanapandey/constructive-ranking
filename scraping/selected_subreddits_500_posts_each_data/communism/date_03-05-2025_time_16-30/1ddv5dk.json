Materials will be more acsessible and a focus can be put torwards science and collective gain instead of the current private companies that want to destroy not only our planet but the solar system if they could in order to make more profit. \n\nI genuinely think this is one of the greatest benefits of communism that is t directly linked to aiding the proletariat so I wanted to start a conversation about it.",

The history of rocketry is incredibly interesting, things like Project Orion which would be a nuclear bomb propelled ship the size of a skyscraper capable of hosting thousands of people. When people would say \"we landed on the moon\", referencing all of humanity with \"we\", I thought that meant that we were already socialist, even though I didn't know what that was then and wouldn't for another decade or two, I thought we already collectively owned the means of production. Come to find out we don't and that the biggest society that tried it died before I was born was quite a shock.",

                            "body": "Counterpoint, both the general population and the Soviet state considered space development to be too costly, but pursued it anyway as space-based warfare was quickly becoming a battlefront that the capitalist nations would use against socialism, particularly with ICBMs and later the STAR WARS program, which is also why the Soviets continuously called for disarmament of nukes, telling the USA not to build such and such system or they would have to as well. There were plans for industrialization of space with solar energy through the 60s-90s, but those fell apart with the whole union. The cost aspect is why the USSR abandoned the plans for landing a man on the moon once the Americans did it and went to focusing on orbital science and unmanned probes instead, as manned flight is costly and robots can do pretty much anything a person can do, which is also why space development stagnates in the west. The focus after the massive losses incurred after world war 2 was on shifting focus from war to peace, but the cold war tensions with the USA made that impossible as they refused to disarm nukes, so the Soviets had to build their own. The space industry wouldn't have existed without the need for the military industry and ICBMs. They did use the space race for propaganda value, the Sputnik scare for example, but if you know the history of Sputnik, the USA was actually planning on launching their first satellite explorer 1, the Soviets were already planning to launch their satellite which would later be launched as Sputnik 3, but they hastily designed a simple satellite that they could launch before the Americans for propaganda value, shelving the larger probe they designed with much more scientific value because their booster rockets weren't up to par yet. While state industry is fundamentally more able to develop space-based industry than the market, it doesn't mean space-based industry is something rational to pursue in all circumstances. The USSR was dealing with shortages and the expenses spent on the military and space were resources and time and labour that could have gone to improving the general welfare and technologies for industry and farming for example.",

Therefore, a lot more people could study STEM, causing an enormous increase in space interest.

            "body": "I've thought about the future of humanity quite a lot know, and so far the general conclusion I've come to had been that due to post scarcity effectively allowing near limitless resource production, as well as even more effective forms of manufacturing, we are likely going to see a huge resurgence in socialism. The cost of materials themselves would be next to nothing. The only real cost would be paying for the extraction of those materials, meaning that it would become extremely easy for a small group of corporations and/or countries to gain a complete monopoly. Since we would naturally see the bourgeoisie gain control over these resources and become exponentially more powerful, the proletariat becomes completely reliant to hope that the state and the bourgeoisie will be merciful to the people. The problem is, this likely won't happen, and we end up with wealth inequality on a scale we've never seen before, a cyberpunk dystopia. If severe wealth equality is permitted, we are likely to start seeing many strikes, which would eventually evolve to become more extreme, and if our problems are still not fixed, them revolution would likely occur. The revolutions would naturally be extremely violent, and would have massive power voids. The states that form after this would likely be socialist, but it's possible for the other end of the spectrum, being more fascist states to form. Either way the states would struggle and the people would start tearing themselves apart from the inside, since a revolution is made up of a loose coalition of people with many ideals. In order for the new states to survive they must be oppressive dictatorships. From this point on we must trust that these dictatorships would eventually begin to transfer the means of production from the state to the people, or else face another revolution. This could either see a long period of time of humanity under dictatorships until true communism and/or anarchism is eventually achieved, or an endless cycle of oppression and revolution that leads no where.",
