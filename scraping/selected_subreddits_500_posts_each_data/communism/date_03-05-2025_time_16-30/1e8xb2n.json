    "selftext": "Hello comrades. Recently I stumbled upon this alleged Lenin quote about Mussolini:\n\"What a waste that we lost mussolini. He is a first-rate man who would have led our party to power in italy\"\nI'm inclined to think that's it's fake, given that the only source I could find was the book Third World Ideology and Western Reality by Carlos Rangel, a known liberal and anticommunist author but i'm not that good at tracing the sources. Maybe someone here could help me. Thank you \n\nEDIT: The source cited by Rangel is \"Mussolini and Lenin: A conversation with Domenico Settembrini\" by George R. Urban. Urban was a hungarian liberal anticommunist who worked with radio free europe. As for Settembrini he was an anticommunist personality who thought that \"Communism is an extremist form of fascism; fascism is a moderate form of communism\". As i dig more my suspects become more certain. Tomorrow I'll go to the library hoping to find the book in question to check its sources ",

It is uncomfortable to admit that not a small number of interwar fascists came from a background in the orbit of their respective social democratic parties, but it is in facts like these where we can reveal the essence of social democracy as social fascism. Before the First World War, the revisionist socialist parties were places where future fascists, communists, and liberals coexisted and their political trajectories are not at all straight forward. What made the difference between a Mussolini, a Bordiga, a Gramsci, or a Togliatti? We are not just talking about individuals.",

Mussolini became somewhat famous in the Italian Socialist Party only in 1912 when he lead the Radical Wing of the party at the Congress of Reggio Emilia. He was expelled from the Party in 1914 because of his pro War stance, a position that Lenin would have condamned. Lenin in 1912 wasn\u2019t too much known worldwide apart from some circles in Germany and Austria, and according to an Italian newspaper https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/un-mussolini-po-russo-AEj4PbAB Mussolini didn\u2019t know Lenin until 1917 when he started writing articles about the two Russian Revolutions (Mussolini praised the russian revolutionary movement and even declared Russia to be a country of honor and intellectual and moral strenght, until Russia Made peace with Germany, which Mussolini saw as madness). However you have to take in consideration that Mussolini was always the most radical in the Italian Socialist Party and if the Bolsheviks continued to fight for the Entente, probably Mussolini would have supported them. Mussolini was actually a comrade, before greed and ambition corroded many of his youth period ideas.",
