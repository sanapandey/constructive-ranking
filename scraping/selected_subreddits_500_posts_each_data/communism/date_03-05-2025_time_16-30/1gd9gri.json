    "selftext": "The feudal mode of production followed upon the ancient mode of production because large empires collapsed and the people of Europe were forced back into subsistence farming by the new material conditions. In the Americas and Africa, the development of modes of production beyond primitive communism and ancient slave economy couldn't naturally occur because European colonizers forcibly established the capitalist mode of production there. So the question remains, were ancient empires always doomed to collapse under their own contradictions before developing the material base for capitalism or could there have been a case where the capitalist mode of production develops directly out of the ancient slave economy?

            "body": "Since Marx's very early work on the \"Asiatic mode of production\" were abandoned, Marxists believe that feudalism developed everywhere. Colonialism prevented the development of capitalism and continued to use feudalism in a state of \"semi-feudal\" dependency. \n\nWhether you accept these terms is not really important. The point is their explanatory power and how you use them. Mao's use of the term to describe something which was both particularly Chinese and universally true allowed the Chinese revolution to become a model for places with otherwise very different histories. I think it's very easy to complain about the term feudalism or really any attempt to generate a positive model of history. But we have to remember that everyone posits a model which implies a politics, they just aren't always honest about it. We are well past the point of worrying about the comintern erasing local histories or whatever, that's not a real fear, whereas postmodern relativism hiding behind it is quite real.",

It is no coincidence \"postcolonialism\" came from wealthy (and upper caste) Indian expatriate academics (Spivak, Bhabha, Chakrabarty, Guha), they are basically marketing a very real debate in India between a living communist revolutionary movement and fascist oppression in a neat little anti-communist bow for international consumption (the innovation being recasting it in terms comprehensible to American liberalism). But the debate in India over semi-feudalism as a term, the nature of British colonialism and resistance, and modernity as-such is very much alive. Indian fascism is postmodern and explicitly rejects \"western discourses\" for local hybridity, provincial knowledges, and historical contingencies whereas Indian Maoists may be the last people in the world who still insist on stages of history and Marxism 's essentially progressive, universal and scientific nature. Indian \"Marxists\" do to but they are growing weak and will soon capitulate entirely to Chinese postmodernism if they haven't already.",

            "body": "I don't know the \"official\" theory view of it, but in my view:  \nFeudalism is a class division between the aristocracy and everyone else, where as a non-aristocrat you are either a serf/slave to the aristocracy or you are a free person but pay tax to them in some way. Feudalism allows for a small merchant class who mainly make money by trade of commodities over long distances, in Europe this was importing pepper, spices and tea from asia and cotton, coffee etc. from the Americas. Eventually this class develops primitive forms of banking and finance, and eventually the joint-stock company which is the primary pre-requisite to capitalism, which emerges from class struggle between the aristocracy and bourgeoise.\n\nBasically primitive communism has none of the pre-requisites for capitalism to develop, such as property rights or a formal system of money, so the bourgeoise can't develop as a class. It's not guaranteed that capitalism will develop from feudalism either, for example at the time of the Russian revolution the aristocracy were still the dominant class, and the bolsheviks initially believed that their role was to support a bourgeoise revolution and not attempt to construct socialism from the get go. As it turned out, the bourgeoise were too weak to be a truly revolutionary class, and Lenin's view changed on this. Trotsky wrote about this later and argued that socialism could be constructed out of feudalism, and that it wasn't strictly necessary to go through capitalism first as classical marxist theory argued.",

I don't know much about it so I won't pretend to, but I think it's important to note that it seems up for debate as an outsider. \n\nWith that in mind, I think it's impossible to understand the emergence of capitalism without having a global framework. Those more backwards forms of production are doomed to collapse because, eventually, the capitalist mode of production will assert itself *somewhere* and once it asserts itself *somewhere* it will happen *everwhere*, since imperialism and monopoly global finance capital will grow out of wherever those releations are initially established. Those societies collapsed under the contradiction not of their own internal material dynamics, but in the global material dynamic of capital seeking new markets, greater profit, etc etc, you see where I'm going.",

They have no special insight into historical materialism and are not immune from generic liberal ideology when attempting to apply their labor as an intellectual commodity (in fact they are much more vulnerable because of the nature of the academic labor market). You do not need to capitulate to anyone's self-promotion on issues of real importance like the nature of feudalism.\n\nAs for your second point you're right but haven't said much. \"Global framework\" is a phrase like \" interdisciplinary\" or \"diversity\". Everyone considers themselves as using a global framework and everyone else as not, because that's what you have to say to get a job and a book contract and tenure. In fact, chatgpt will fill in all these words for you when asking to write a research grant or whatever. The OP's point is difficult to parse because they combine Marxist terminology with a postmodern sensibility but what they are trying to ask is the relationship between the \"tributary mode of production\" and capitalism. You're right about the actual progress of history but the abstract laws of motion are unclear, since by all accounts China was on the cusp of a market revolution multiple times (as were other empires). u/cyberwitchtechnobtch recently pmed me about this in the form of the \"sprouts of capitalism\" debate (which is a real debate if not always in that term) because it matters whether the Chinese mode of production was in decline or whether the Japanese were the key element (for the obvious reason that places like Peru have no immediate equivalent). Again, it's hard to disagree with you but there is more to be said, don't sell yourself short.\n\n>The liberal materialist Scheidel has an interesting book on this topic \"Escape from Rome\n\nThat book sounds pretty dire.",
