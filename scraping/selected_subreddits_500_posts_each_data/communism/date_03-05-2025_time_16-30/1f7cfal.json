    "selftext": "When reading the shanghai textbook I came across this statement, which reads like an axiom, it\u2019s on page 62 of the George C. Wang edition available on redstarpublishers. \n\n\u201cUnder the capitalist system the development of production will only lead to the impoverishment of the proletariat. This impoverishment is not only relative but also absolute.\u201d and then\n\n\u201cUnder capitalism, the share of wages received by the proletariat steadily declines, and the share of surplus value received by the bourgeoisie steadily increases.\u201d \n\nThis is used to explain the process where what we might call a \u2018wealth\u2019 or \u2018income\u2019 gap comes from. It is the \u201crelative impoverishment\u201d referred to in the first passage.\n\nFollowing this is the passage on absolute impoverishment. It lists a number of factors that can measure this.\n\n\u201cFirst, a large/increasing unemployment rate\u2026Second, the decline of real wages\u2026Third, poor living conditions\u2026Fourth excessive labor intensity and poor laboring conditions.\u201d \n\nThere are some sections of this passage that I find odd, where they basically refer to qualities that seem pretty widespread but still apply to the Amerikan Proletariat. A passage on having to save two months wages for appendicitis operation, and having a doctor\u2019s visit amount to 1/3rd of a daily wage particularly stuck out. \n\nThis relates to my overall question about this passage. Are there ways that the refugee/immigrant population benefits from the system of international value extraction? While doing SICA I\u2019ve seen workers living in absolutely squalid conditions. However, when I ask, much of that is driven by their need to send remittances back home. \n\nOn the one hand, these workers are undeniably forced into situations where they are just barely capable of reproducing their own labor power. On the other, they extract more value than just what they spend on themselves. \n\nIt seems like within the logic of the above passages though, any Amerikan Proletariat should be just scraping by, if not in a state of near state of starvation. They seem to be receiving more value than they produce. \n\nCould these workers be considered proletarian? Are they also Labor Aristocrats? Much of my analysis is premised on ideas of Copean Value Exchange, with the determining factor in LA relations being how much value a strata is producing. I feel like this is probably where the flaw in my reasoning lies, but I\u2019m not sure of the solution. If people could critique my reasoning I would appreciate it. ",

I\u2019m not entirely sure why you\u2019re connecting it to what you\u2019ve read in the Shanghai Textbook, though. I think it\u2019s been discussed on this sub, but attempting to mechanistically apply developments in Marxist theory from imperialized Communist countries to the imperial core, whether to prove or to disprove something about the labor aristocracy or whatever, is never as fruitful as one would expect, since theories regarding labor aristocracy and the changing of workers\u2019 alliegances in imperialist countries was developed *by* imperial-core communists *to* explain the failure of FW communism in the 80s. Why not investigate on your own, either through the process of a social investigation or by studying bourgeois sources regarding the economics of immigration, and tell us what conclusions you come to?",

                    "body": "I don\u2019t think the Shanghai Textbook has the answers to my question. The main reason I was using it was because I felt like it provided a good picture of what economic development looks like on a relatively abstract level, which would then allow us to particularize our analysis to more specific conditions. \n\nI find a lot of the analysis of these sorts of things lacking, they don\u2019t usually line up with my experience of social investigation. However I also don\u2019t really have the language or tools to take a more particularized analysis and then really elaborate on *why* I feel that it is wrong beyond just a gut feeling. \n\nMIM Notes #1, for example, seems to pretty squarely align with Cope\u2019s analysis of value transfers. However, also prioritize what they call \u201cthe bottom fifth of the population.\u201d Which in my reading seems to put forward the idea that Labor Aristocrats necessarily make higher wages than Non-Labor Aristocrats. I\u2019m not 100% about my conclusion here, so please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. \n\nKites\u2019 series \u201cThe Spectre that Still Haunts\u201d takes a different tact and explicitly rejects exploitation as a determining factor in who is Proletarian and who isn\u2019t. The OCR still upholds the idea of a labor aristocracy, but this sort of analysis seems to do a great deal to obscure the actual question of what makes a LA. \n\nBoth of these, at various points, seem to align with reality, but they leave a lot of questions unanswered. Are rideshare or taxi drivers Labor Aristocrats? Are demands for higher wages from these drivers progressive or reactionary? If they are Labor Aristocrats why is it that they seem to have a much higher level of revolutionary subjectivity than, say, a Restaurant Sever who might make the same in take home pay? \n\nObviously many of them are first generation migrants, and the process of displacement had some sort of radicalizing effect on them, but this doesn\u2019t feel satisfactory either.",

For example, the fact that MIM and other similar groups deny the existence of significant proletarian segments of the New Afrikan nation by analyzing wages and exploitation, and instead say that the only proletariat in the U$ is non-citizen immigrant labor, doesn't line up with what both I and other groups taking \"third-worldist\" lines have noticed about the relative revolutionary potential among these segments of society. \n\nI think you're asking the right questions here; sometimes I think this subreddit spends too much time reacting to reactionaries and fascists and not enough time putting together actual analyses of the contradictions in occupied Turtle Island today. This forum has taken a principled line regarding the labor aristocracy in the U$ for the last \\~5 years, it seems; why has so little theoretical development come out of it?",

Someone under another post relating to Cope's liberal turn pointed out that it was the New Afrikan population that rose up against police brutality, and basically this points to their revolutionary potential. However, as someone else basically pointed out, this doesn't really showcase their revolutionary potential\u2014the BLM movement as a whole really just tailed the Democratic party and seemed to just fight for a better place within the labor aristocracy (https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1esgloc/comment/li6a2rh/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button). Of course, we should definitely investigate if there is a black proletariat and not dismiss their existence without investigation. \n\nBut, as you say, it's important to lay out all of the contradictions within this country\u2014black workers definitely make earn superwages (as shown by Cope in DWDC), and have earned a place within the labor aristocracy (imo). But we shouldn't be deluded for a second into believing that they've thus earned a place within settler society. This means that all oppressed nations here (and other minorities such as Asians) only exist within the labor aristocracy to bolster the settler state itself. Thus, when they aren't needed\u2014the Republican voter base being more keen on casting away colored people from the labor aristocracy and emphasizing the national divide between the settler state and these oppressed nations\u2014or if imperialism suffers a catastrophic blow that reduces the amount of superprofits flowing from the Third World, the first to suffer would be these people of oppressed nations.",
