For those of you who follow the tech sphere, China just burst the bubble with an armor piercing round with an open-source model that outperforms OpenAI\u2019s latest model while being completely free. \n\nI tried it and its reasoning, accuracy, and non bias are impeccable. It lays out its \u201cthought process\u201d when it \u201cthinks\u201d. \n\nI know capitalists are freaking out right now without even researching it. I just want to know what\u2019s next for humanity as this the turning point. ",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But do you think that things like this and the emerging marvels coming out of China could shift class consciousness in America- to a degree? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s overwhelming at all, just that America is in a bit of an escalating Cold War with China and similar to the last one the two systems are competing to show what they are capable of to show the world. I think something like deepseek, while not a bombshell necessarily, can show capitalist incompetence when you see AI companies asking for hundreds of billions from the government to develop their inferior ai while China was able to create a superior algorithm that\u2019s faster, open source, free, and made for under 10 million dollars. \n\nI think if China can further embarrass the capitalist system with more activity like this, like their plans for a solar plant in orbit, the further development of drone tech, their impressive fusion reactor research, etc it might poke holes in not only capitalism but western homogeny. While America is so propagandized that it might not move the dial with the working class so much here, I can see other nations shifting gears and focus towards china.",

It's understood in this sub that China is a capitalist entity and has been for some time, other places on Reddit believe the nation is 'market socialist' or any variation of that. You can search around here to learn more about why\n\nedit: I'll also add that I understand why it may be alluring at this point for you (and many others) to believe there is a way out through Chinese capitalism, that President Xi will 'save' you. It is important to reject that thought and start to work backwards in the logic that leads to it.",
