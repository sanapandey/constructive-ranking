    "selftext": "In my country, there are no genuine socialist parties. The only one that exists is deeply corrupt and has tarnished the name of socialism by failing to deliver on its promises. As a result, many people have lost faith in socialism altogether.\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to find any better parties or organizations that align with my values\u2014or at least, they\u2019re not visible or accessible to me. \n\nI\u2019m considering starting a new movement or party, but I\u2019m not sure where to begin. Right now, I have a Discord server with around 30 Marxist-Leninists from my country, but I know that online discussions alone don\u2019t count as real praxis. \n\nHow would you recommend I take the first steps toward building something meaningful?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** - Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** - /r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Identify comrades, getting a handful of commited fellow communists, or at least individuals who are clearly and actively interested in communism or national liberation is a necessary first step. \n\n2. Identity the masses, the masses are the sea that the communists swim thought, if you have any intention of organization building, it must have a strong bass in the masses (aka progressive classes).",

My friend started up a new communist organization because of this and it has absolutely blossomed. I live in a city of roughly 120k people and in 6 months we are more active than the communist party in our region has been in loooong time. We have 1-3 events every week: like reading club where we read lenin and discuss/critique, we do food-aid, studying history, hangouts, studying socialist countries, and we learn to take theory into practise in our workplaces or how to raise class conciousness in closed peers for example.\n\nI believe in you! If we have achieved all of this, so can you.",

It is also a great way to build the sense of community in our organization as we eat together as comrades. We spend max 40 euros a month to food-aid and it is supposed to feed about 10-15 people, keeping it in our mind that our organization is still small. Some of the money goes to marketing etc too. We don't want to spend too much time cooking so we aim for pretty cheap and easy recepies like soup. I'm not too familiar with Black Panthers but I have to look into it in the future. If you have time, mind to share what you mean? Dw if it's too much work though",

I think it is a lot easier if you already are connected to people, than doing it alone. But sometimes that is the case. Soon enough they started to form groups within the  organization to share responsability evenly: a group that takes care of social media platforms and making flyers, a group that plans communal activities like hangouts, a group that critiques the activities of the organization, a group that takes care of all planning of monthly meetings and boring paperwork and contacting other organizations for collabs etc.",

If most of the grassroots members of the party are truly marxists then joining the party and trying to fix it from within might actually be a worthwhile endeavor. But if the entire thing is fucked, or worse, if there are no real grassroots sections in the party then radicalizing those you know personally, joining efforts with other local communist groups, and organizing protests might be the way to go imo",

Socdems have an 'enlightened centrist'-type pretentious egomania to them too so thats even more annoying.\n\nHere where I'm from (Kerala, India) we're easily the most communist state in the country and because of that our workers rights, HDI, literacy rate, infant mortality rate, life expectancy, and poverty rate are all literally the best in the country.\n\nOur ruling party rn, the CPI(M) (Communist Party of India Marxist) is kinda funny because the highest brass are all kinda socdem rn but the grassroots members are so fiercely and passionately marxist that the party can't do anything anti-worker or else they'll lose every drop of support they have and get lynched on the streets too lmao.\n\nUltimately looking at your situation I do think you might need to start a new org. Again I would recommend linking up with as many grassroots communist orgs as possible and doing campaigns to help the poor and the homeless, and protest workers rights violations as much as possible.\n\nGood Luck and Keep Fighting Comrade\n\nEdit: Previous comment got removed for using an emoji lmao",

I\u2019m a newbie on a mid level position in the biggest union in my state ,and for a while we were the biggest union in latin america, seeing how it works is amazing, even if they\u2019re trotskies (most don\u2019t even know it, or know what it is and we are teachers\u2026). But regardless of how corrupt the party is, going in it\u2019s events and trying to find likeminded people seems as a good start. If you have enough people to create meaningfull change in the party (but that\u2019s a lot of people), do it, if not at least you found some comrades to create a party. If you have some people who had high positions in any other political movement, it will be way easier than doing it from nothing. \n\nIf any of you is good in the camera and has read a lot of theory, and I mean really a lot, you can also try recruiting from social media. In my country there h\u00e1s been an explosion of communist content creators, teaching theory and debating high profile liberals into submission. They only debate if the fella already has influence, and a lot of it, otherwise it gives them a plataform. \n\nThere also is the diference between a vanguard party and a popular party, look it up, read some L\u00eanin.",
