Cyprus, as it stands, is complicit in Zionist terrorism, war crimes, and genocide. Anything that happens is our government's fault and the fault of anyone who supports its disgusting pro-Zionist policies.\n2. If we suddenly face consequences for our complicity, the warmongers and Zionist lovers, and all their western allies, will go into a hysteria, probably calling for Cyprus to join NATO and maybe even to more directly join in on the genocide against the Palestinian people or a war against Lebanon. \n3. In this case anyone who loves peace and hates imperialist war must call for Cyprus to a. not respond to any strikes in a retaliatory or escalatory manner, b. end its complicity in u.$. / NATO and Zionist wars and crimes in the region. The latter means permanently expelling the IDF out of Cyprus and cutting all collaborative ties with it, and opposing any further use of the island by the NATO imperialist countries (u.$, Britain, France) to help the Zionist entity or to conduct their own operations, maybe even closing down all British and other NATO facilities on the island in general (an optimal outcome in my mind, let's say a maximum demand). **Edit: point A should also directly apply to the EU, meaning there must be a call for the EU to not respond \"on behalf\" of Cyprus by invoking the mutual defense clause in a retaliatory or escalatory manner.**\n4. Perhaps a broader anti-imperialist, anti-war movement could be rallied around the above understandings and demands. This thought would need much more elaboration.",

Are you wondering what the EU response itself might be? I said what a certain faction (warmongers, or perhaps more accurately people aligned with the interests of the military industry) will most certainly do but perhaps that was obvious already. Given the EU's response to Ukraine and the initial response to 7 October though I personally don't see how the EU in general wouldn't go in a full on warmongering direction if Cyprus is hit and it would definitely give a push to the camp that's in favour of Cyprus joining NATO both within Cyprus and in the EU / NATO itself. Cyprus has itself been getting more close to other NATO countries; it was always close to Greece but obtained a lot of weapons from the USSR and Russia due to a Yankee embargo, but this embargo has started to be lifted (if not lifted completely recently, I'm not sure). IIRC Cyprus gave a lot of its Soviet and Russian equipment to Ukraine, and if I'm not mistaken has already started, or at the very least is certainly thinking to start, purchasing more Amerikan weapons. Apparently the FBI is also now operating in Cyprus with the permission of the Cypriot government to \"fight financial crime and sanctions dodging\" (crack down on Russian and Chinese capital). This all means that a future integration into NATO will be more smooth which I think is also the reason why many people in Cyprus and beyond have been pushing for this (lifting the embargo, getting rid of Soviet / Russian weapons, buying Yankee weapons, cracking down on Russian capital) although no one says it explicitly. Does this address your question?\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Edit: actually your comment made me realize I didn't address the EU at all in my post which I probably should have. I'll add something now\u00a0",

                            "body": "I want to stress further what is noted in the original comment here and hear some of your thoughts on it (I know you edited the OP, but I think there's more to discuss): This potential attack would pose another Palestinian test to the theatrical system of \"international law\" which supposedly undergirds the EU as US-backed renovation of Fortress Europe. The outbreak of a front of this war of national liberation in Cyprus could constitute only the second time a \"Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory\" (here I refer to [Article 42.7 of the 2007 EU treaty](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_V:_General_Provisions_on_the_Union%27s_External_Action_Service_and_Specific_Provisions_on_the_Common_Foreign_and_Security_Policy#Article_42), which is what I assume that /u/Fragrant_Village_443 meant by the \"mutual solidarity clause\") since the inception of the project. And more to the point, it would constitute the first time the article would be invoked during an active war on EU territory, given that the only time it has been used before was after the 2015 ISIL attacks in Paris. It should be noted here also that Article 5 has also only been invoked as a result of 9/11; a potential Cypriot invocation of 42.7, which only seems more likely when faced with the fact that the previous two were also invoked against Islamist insurgencies, during a prolonged offensive against it would thus be the first invocation of its kind since the inception of the modern imperialist defense pacts. \n\nTo me, this is more pressing than the prospect of the potential accession of Cyprus to NATO, especially given the opposition that Turkey would certainly pose to it (for both territorial reasons and because of its resumption of a hostile orientation to Israel). In particular, it does seem like it could reignite European\u2013\u2013particularly French and Italian\u2013\u2013passions for Zionism, which seemed to have been on the decline, at least outside of Germany. In the absence of such passions, non-adherence to 42.7 could become a flashpoint of imperialist struggle between warmongers and isolationists in the EU (one that would align quite well with the debate over the military budgets in France and Germany at the behest of the US), further accelerating Fortress Europe's eventual break-up, which the bourgeois press has recently been prophesying against in the wake of the new fascist warming-up to EU politics. \n\nAnyway, this is all to say that I do feel we may be wading into uncharted waters here.  I don't know enough about the Cypriot government or even Cyprus-EU relations to comment further than this, but I would appreciate your critique if anything here is off or missing.",

You know, that absolutely insane strike on the Iranian consulate which broke every conceivable norm of bourgeois international law? What do you call still making economic and military deals with the Zionist entity? What do you call Cyprus allowing its territory and airspace to he used by Britain and the u.$. to assist the Zionist entity? What do you call Cyprus raising no serious objections to the use of the British bases on the island to help the Zionist entity? What do you call Cyprus participating in \"humanitarian actions\" which turned out to me nothing more than a western ploy to further covertly help the Zionist entity? I call all of this complicity in Zionist terrorism. And this is without mentioning the potential that the IDF and Mossad are probably covertly operating in Cyprus as we speak.
