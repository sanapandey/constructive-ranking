Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

The party doesn't even believe in itself and instead offers useless advice to \"the movement\" about what it should do\n\n>The students and workers must trust only in their own power. The revolution has polarised Bangladesh into two irreconcilable camps: the revolutionary students and working masses on one side; and the Hasina clique, big business and the leading echelons of the state on the other. There is no independent third party. The workers and students must seize the power into their own hands!\n\n>The way forward has already been posed by the movement itself. Students and workers have shown enormous capacity for organisation. They have already begun to create struggle committees all over the country after the call went out from the coordinators.\n\n>Now, the general strike must continue, and the leadership must urge the masses to extend the committees to cover all workplaces, all communities and all education institutions. The rank and file of the army must be called upon to form their own committees, excluding the officers, in order that they can check the conspiracies of the army.\n\n>These committees would immediately begin displacing the rule of the bosses in the factories, and the courts and police locally, freeing those comrades that have been imprisoned without waiting for a writ from a local Awami League-appointed magistrate.\n\n>Once linked up on a city, district and nationwide level, it would be a small step to carry out an insurrection to transfer all power to these committees, displacing and dismantling the rotten state at which Hasina has stood at the head for 16 years. \n\nNowhere is the communist party mentioned or any causal agent, instead \"the leadership\" \"must\" do something. Why aren't you the leadership? Why must they do anything when they are not communists? Who cares about your blueprints when even you don't believe in your ability to implement them? What even is the purpose of this article and who is it for? Vaguely leftist news summaries already come out faster on Twitter, the effort of this article is wasted.\n\nSelf-importance can become delusion but at least there's a certain will to power that one can respect as a human. You won't always win even if you believe but you will always lose if you don't believe. This utter cynicism of a \"party\" born of a right-wing split to maintain a parasitic relationship with the Blairite labor party is repulsive at a human level and it's reduced me to inspirational cat posters.\n\nI let this article stand already started by the time I found it but I genuinely dislike the slimy sales tactics of the \"rebranded\" IMT and everything the party is, most of all because it goes out of its way to hide exactly that (presumably unless you've paid enough money and been beaten down enough to finally be given access to OT III knowledge).

The scene is just as pitiful as the existence of actually existing Trotskyist orgs.\n\nIt's this type of shi where, unless you know who the IMT was, you'll get suckers like me cheering for the vaguely leftist slogan throwing of the IMT because it covers up theirs and really if we're being honest here, your (read: mine) own political ineptitude.  \n\n**Edit:** This post seems like just outright dismissal of the entire show in Bangladesh as \"a big sham constructed by U.S. intelligence\" like what reddit poster u/arthoheen seems [to post](https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/313509/menon-us-wants-saint-martin%E2%80%99s-island) on about, that everyone should stfu about Bangladesh and move on with their lives but I don't want that cause it just seems, lazy? We're probably going to see later posts about the class character and empirical makeup of the leadership, how exactly did the Bangladesh students organize themselves politically, brief essays on Bangladesh and its relationship with world imperialism in the context of the student protest (admittedly shit that I can find on google myself)-like idk, those posts sound a bit more interesting.",

Yunus has been outside of the country for the entirety of the protests, and suddenly he was proposed as the chief advisor without any reason by the students? This is a massive eyewash to prepare the field to install another regime. \n\nAnd both the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami were called by the army chief for the meeting to figure out what\u2019s gonna be the way forward, it does not take a genius to know that the movement has been co-opted already.

I was not consulted on this pollution of my public space with anti-communists imagery and messaging, if I had been I would have warned against the inevitable result. It may be the campaign was worth it anyway but I doubt it, the IMT's sole goal is to gather as many people as quickly as possible in the hopes that the momentum will establish them as the party young people on the Internet join when they Google \"communist party\" or \"touching grass + socialism.\" They are right that the DSA is on the wane and the CPUSA is too attached to the Democrats (and PSL, for all its similarities, is too rigorous in vetting members) but there is no self-criticism of decades of being useless as the IMT. It's just rebranding, a totally cynical embrace of the most superficial image of social media as advertising by boomers accelerating the longstanding practice of Trot parties taking money from young people. It may be true that these young people lack confidence in their beliefs and have been raised by advertising but they are not suckers. They will reject this surface-level campaign because they have real problems that brought them to real communism.\n\nI'm not exaggerating, look at the party's rebranding announcement \n\nhttps://socialistrevolution.org/hundreds-of-millions-watch-launch-of-the-revolutionary-communists-of-america/\n\nWe clapped back at Jordan Peterson on Twitter! \n\nhttps://socialistrevolution.org/founding-congress-of-the-rca-the-future-of-american-communism-is-bright/\n\nWe were mentioned by Alex Jones and Elon Musk!

Conspiracy theory nonsense.\u00a0\n\n\nBut the fact this wasn't an organised revolution is the problem. The socialist parties in Bangladesh are a shadow of what they once were thanks to suppression by the Awami league. I'm unsurprised the people wanted Yunus, he's seen as a national hero at this point and a socialist leader just isn't in the public conscious. That said, I am wary of the fearmongering over Jamaat. Society may be conservative but Jamaat has a reputation amongst a lot of the people for betraying Bangladesh to the Pakistan army during its independence - it's not as though they have a lot of numbers either.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm anxious about what's going to end up happening. The protests and revolts were a true show of unison against unspeakable violence committed by Hasina, but it wasn't exactly led with a socialist consciousness in mind.\u00a0",

She made many disappear. That was enough for the people to want her out. Bengalis are very worried about the future, but they're happy with this victory. The people originally did not want her out even after she started her rampage early on a few weeks ago. They only demanded her out when she would ramp up the bloodletting to over 200 murders. The 1971 Bangladesh revolution was only possible because of students. The nazi-like Pakistani military slaughtered many of them. Hasina murdering 100s of students triggered a nation-wide PTSD amongst the people, which caused them to lash out and demand her resignation. The elderly and working class also joined in on the protests. No one in Bangladesh will accept 100s of student deaths, not after endless students sacrificed their lives in 1971 for independence.",

Islamic Iran genuinely made land reforms and redistributed their resources to the lower masses after the revolution and continued to have a line struggle over whether to liberalize the economy or keep a \u201cpopulist\u201d model, even after Iran-Iraq the populist faction won. It was not until Khamenei recently that marked a sharp turn towards economic liberalization.\n\nHow can a revolution be \u201chigh-jacked\u201d when there\u2019s no communist party intervening? It makes no sense to dismiss this as a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d a priori since there are progressive elements in the struggle and Bangladesh is the biggest garment factory in the world. You are not interested in analyzing the progressive elements and potential of the mass struggle, but just lazily waving your hand at it because the US is involved. The US will always be involved, planning to hijack everything; there are many \u201ccommunist\u201d elements also supporting resignation of Hasina. What does the struggle between them look like, that\u2019d be nice to have a description of.",

Communist and socialist worker parties are sadly fringe movements in Bangladesh, and at present are in no way, shape or form in a position to bolster support amongst the population. Hell, when Yunus is offered as the chief advisor for the interim government by the mass movement coordinators, there is no way to not see this as a liberal takeover of power. There's no \"communist\" element there that holds even a modicum of power, that's the sad reality.",
