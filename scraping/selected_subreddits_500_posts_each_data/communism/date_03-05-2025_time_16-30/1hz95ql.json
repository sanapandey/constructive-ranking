They are trying not to be isolated, but also not just vulgarly backing the right so the result is Enrique Marquez. Knowing when and how to break with Maduro before it\u2019s too late is difficult; Syria recently is an extreme example of just towing the \u2018progressive\u2019 regime until there\u2019s nothing left.\n\nFurthermore, here\u2019s a supposed interview with one of the members in the PCV politbureau, where he \u2018addressed\u2019 the question of what if the right-wing candidate Gonzalez won:\n\nhttps://links.org.au/venezuelan-communist-neirlay-andrade-authoritarian-regime-never-better-option",

You're correct that the former strategy was ultimately a failure in Syria but this is like if Syrian communists decided that the best way to oppose Assad's neoliberalism was by joining the \"moderate opposition\", which in reality was nothing more than a front for Al-Qaeda.",

I don\u2019t think they are \u201cattacking the government from the right;\u201d after all, Enrique Marquez is not Edmundo Gonzalez. They are part of a popular front with fairly left-sounding organizations, so they still haven\u2019t found a way out of electoralism. Ideally they will synthesize people\u2019s war in 21st century, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening until the global crises, they might fail before then if it\u2019s like what you said. Nonetheless, PCV is experimenting at a moment when \u201cprogressive\u201d regimes and the axis of resistance is breaking apart so it\u2019s something worthy to keep track of; the only \u201cprogressive\u201d non-communist movement left outside Palestine is arguably Yemeni Ansarallah. I think PCVs rhetoric is mostly correct and appropriate, but their tactics are just all over the place, mimeing the European spectacle.\n\nThey clearly state in the OP that they want no foreign intervention as part of the solution and oppose both Maduro and Gonzalez, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to categorize them with what happened in Syria. We saw how Assad\u2019s Syria was so decrepit that it fell without any defense (albeit last time it was saved by Russia and Hezbollah). Not like the PCV are basing their experience on Syria, but without on the ground info, I can\u2019t add much more and as always, the success of distancing themselves from the PSUV will be determined in the future. Much have already been discussed in that reddit thread I linked.",

From what I can tell, Enrique Marquez's politics seem very similar to that of Juan Guaido, who was nominally a social democrat and even a member of the Socialist International but nonetheless became the figurehead of a fascist coup attempt. We're all in agreement that backing Maduro for another 5 years is a dead end but again, this surely cannot be the best alternative.",

A rationale could be that PCV wish to show that any parliamentary alternative to Maduro is no better so the only way left is a communist revolution, but this is an extremely charitable guess. The party already took a split in 2023 with the pro-Maduro side becoming a minority according to wikipedia and orinocotribune, so it doesn\u2019t seem they\u2019ll be changing that principle, barring the possibly disastrous electoral maneuvers.",

Their analysis is predicated on the Maduro government collapsing due to a loss in popular support and hedging their survival as a party post-Maduro government. Their insistence on maintaining the current National Constitution is trying to signal that they want to keep all the social gains under the Bolivarian Revolution, but at this point, it can't hold. Chavismo as a movement is dead, and I don't think there will be any political will to try and re-establish it. \n\n>Russian investment and loans have been crucial to keep Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in power and continue to be so in the run-up to the 2024 presidential elections. Nonetheless, Venezuela\u2019s large debt with Russia, the default on its payments, instability and the deterioration of the political situation are negative factors for the status quo and could affect the allocation of resources. Despite this, for now, a slight improvement in relations with the United States and the war in Ukraine seem to have eased the tension in Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nhttps://latinoamerica21.com/en/why-does-russia-support-venezuela/\n\nWe may have consensus among the great powers that Maduro's government is unsustainable and bludgeon down the regime and force them to implement extreme austerity that serves Russia and China, with the US trying to get involved in this massive scramble of pillaging in this instability. This can only happen if the CPV strategy of an oppositional popular front succeeds.",
