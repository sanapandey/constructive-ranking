    "selftext": "It's that the Volume 5 of Selected Works of Mao Zedong is now banned in China. You can\u2019t buy it on shopping websites, and you can\u2019t even search for it on bilibili(only the first four volumes can be searched). As far as I know, this happened recently.\n\nVolume 5 of Selected Works of Mao Zedong contains Mao's writings from 1949 to 1957, including criticisms of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, as well as the now \"rehabilitated\" case of the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group.\n\nThese works of Mao were banned, on the one hand because they touched the sore spot of some of China's decadent bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and on the other hand, it also reflects that more and more people are reading these books. This is because there are more and more young people in China who support real Maoism and the Cultural Revolution now, and the number is still growing exponentially. Social existence determines social consciousness, and they will inevitably launch a revolution in the future. The revisionist bureaucrats of the CCP are afraid of them, so they banned these works of Mao.\n\nThe current Chinese government is under the banner of Mao Zedong, but is actually anti-Maoist. They are afraid that people especially youth will read Chairman Mao's works and learn the real Maoism. They are afraid that people will rise up in rebellion and continue the revolution as Mao said.",

Here's [a website](https://jiashigrsyt1.github.io/Workers-in-Epidmic1/) operated by them by the way, if you want to read directly from Maoists in China involved in active struggle against the state.\n\nThe growth of Maoism in China in recent decades does make me wonder whether (and please do criticize me if this is an idealist formulation) revisionist bourgeois dictatorships have an enhanced natural tendency to produce revolutionary movements tending to the restoration of the socialist road. The logic of the capitalist road, after all, necessarily produces a revisionist \"Marxism\" as its ruling ideology after (and even before) it takes state power, which has the contradictory aspects of both being revisionist (and therefore functioning as bourgeois ideology) and yet also impossible to fully  isolate from its revolutionary origins due to its very quality of purporting to be \"Marxism\". The terminology, and even some of the ideas, of Marxism are thus neutered and weaponized to serve the bourgeoisie, but in doing so, they have simultaneously also been made hegemonic, and thus especially accessible to revolutionaries. Capitalist road revisionism also has a structural need to co-opt actual revolutionary leaders (Lenin in the Soviet Union, Mao in China) while completely negating their actual thought and practice, producing a similar contradiction: Chairman Mao will always be revolutionary, and the revisionists will always be playing with fire as long as they try (and fail miserably) to turn him into a \"harmless icon\" for the consolation of the Chinese proletariat. Obviously oppressed people everywhere will inevitably come to embrace revolutionary Marxism as a means for their liberation, but the modern revisionist Chinese state itself seems to be expediting the process immensely in the Chinese context. Perhaps the development of the modern Maoist movement in China should be seen as being a product of these contradictions (in addition, of course, to the contradictions of capitalism in China, principally that between the bourgeosie and the proletariat).",

Confucius is now praised as a saint in Chinese middle school textbooks, but with the Internet, Chinese youth no longer learn history through textbooks. The higher the praise of Confucius in textbooks, the more ruthless Chinese youth are towards him. On the Internet, Chinese youth do not hide their hatred for Confucius. They contemptuously call Confucius \"Kong Lao Er\", just like the Red Guards in the campaign to criticize Lin Biao and Confucius.",

Since then, the 1991 edition omitted the fifth volume. Wikipedia provides related explanations, including Mao Zedong's own reluctance to publish the fifth volume. [Wikipedia link](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AF%9B%E6%B3%BD%E4%B8%9C%E9%80%89%E9%9B%86%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%94%E5%8D%B7#cite_note-8), [Baidu link](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1725285659135665336).\n3. **Most importantly, this is a selection**, and the articles within it can all be found elsewhere, including the critique of Liu Shaoqi. This content can even be found on platforms like [Bilibili](https://b23.tv/VfPkI2J).\n\n  \nSo I still choose to trust the official account, which states that the fifth volume was published after Mao Zedong\u2019s death, according to Hua Guofeng\u2019s preferences, and contains numerous omissions and distortions of Mao\u2019s original intentions.",

It asserts the necessity of People's War as the strategy of taking power in semi-colonial, semi-feudal countries (the specificity of which, of course, still depending on the specific conditions of any one country), and synthesizes the role of the mass line and the two-line struggle as necessary motors in furthering the struggle. The principal contribution of Maoism, though, is not only the recognition that class struggle continues within socialism (this was something that Stalin also recognized, if to a limited extent), but that a *new* class contradiction is developed between the proletariat and hostile elements in the party taking the capitalist road. The solution for this is to have the masses themselves rise up and destroy the capitalist roaders, a course of action that was taken in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.",
