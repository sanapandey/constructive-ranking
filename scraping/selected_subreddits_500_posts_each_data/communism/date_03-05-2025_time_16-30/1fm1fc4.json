    "selftext": "Gorbachev was born in the 1930s right after socialism had been constructed as a concrete mode of production and even by the strict anti-revisionist definition, the correct proletarian line and socialism lasted to 1956 when Gorbachev was already an adult. He was born and raised to adulthood in what we would consider the golden age of socialism, so why did he betray everything he grew up with to side with the west? I'm aware that he traveled to western countries a few times, but would he really fall for the illusion of western supremacy so easily? He must have been educated on imperialism and super-exploitation of the global south that allows the western upper class to live in such luxury.\nI know it's a complicated question, but I hope someone has some ideas because it's just baffling from a materialist point of view.

That is simply true and denying it for a vulgar, anti-landlord populism, is the same revisionism that justified Gorbachev's move towards marketization and western consumer goods.\n\nI'm not trying to single you out, rather the opposite: Khrushchevite revisionism, which turns socialism into a matter of material incentive, is widespread and will remain widespread until a real crisis in the living conditions of the imperialist core opens the possibility for moral incentive as the motive for organizing society. Even the socialist period in the USSR vacillated on this question, a fact seized upon by defenders of Chinese revisionism and capitalism today, though Stalin ultimately fell on the side of moral incentive in periods of great class struggle. It's not hard to imagine socialists regressing into worship of the wealth of imperialism; the overwhelming majority of first world socialists have already done so. They merely flip Gorbachev on his head: rather than envy from the second world, they take their first world wealth for granted and call polemical criticism of its lack of immediate benefits in their life \"socialism.\" But both want the same thing: socialism as material abundance without thinking too hard about its origin.",

In the 80s, you didn't see any of those anymore.\n\n\n\nI mostly blame the breakup of the USSR on the failure or lack of will to merge ethnicities and cultures and religions together, to create a truly communist culture.",

It happened that those who where most engaged with maintaining and improving the revolution died in this battle.\n\nWhen Stalin died the new Premier suffered a coup and ended up killed and a counter revolutionary took over office, Nikita Sergu\u00eaievitch Khrushchov, the beginning of the capitalist retake of the USSR.\n\nThe USA took in as many nazis it could under it's wings, gave them high office and created the CIA to act as an counter revolutionary force and propaganda force in the world molding our current view on why socialism \"Failed\".\n\nTo crudely sum it up, that's it.

The bureaucratic scale of 1950s planning made it increasingly expensive as the economy grew, short-term cost cutting saw calculation increasingly aggregated and abstracted from reality. By Gorbachev's day, even this had been abandoned for a golden mean of profit as their measurement tool, with planning heavily decentralized. \n\nStagnation and decline were addressed by methods that brought immediate short-term relief by saving money, but only furthered the stagnation and decline overall. This same logic is what, at least I would say, led the USSR towards an ever worsening reliance on oil exports to pay for cheap imports. In effect, it had already been operating on the same logic as capitalist, imperialist countries. If we copy the west, then surely, we'll see the same success and wealth, right?\n\nBy then, it was essentially a death spiral, Gorbachev's was really just the final capitulation after decades of creeping towards capitalism, the last in a long line of economic and political retreats for fear of a return to a siege that in reality had never lifted.",
