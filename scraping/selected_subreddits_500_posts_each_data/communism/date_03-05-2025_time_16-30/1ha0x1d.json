You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even to liberal and postmodernist sensibilities, many people - especially many youth - are expressing that what's happening in Palestine is intolerable, and though obviously Amerikan \"anti-war\" movements aren't making any significant progress towards ending the genocide nor does it pose a potential threat to the government, I can't imagine that the State Department and various three-letter agencies *enjoy* the constant protests and \"autonomous actions\". Perhaps this poses a potential stumbling block to U.$. plans to exert military dominance over Cuba or to intervene violently in South Korea's favor against the DPRK should tension on the Korean peninsula continue to intensify.\n\nShould questions about \"human rights\" and violence against \"civilians\" (and potentially, in blue states, identity politics along the lines of \"the USSR was a settler-colony\" or postmodernist sexpol about abortion and gay rights) be pre-emptively wielded against communism (not that it isn't already), that could serve to deradicalize (or de\"radicalize\") the next generation of student protestors.\n\nOr maybe I'm tilting at windmills here, overestimating how much the U.$. government cares about youth protest movements. Ahh I should just stop wasting time and read FNFI, shouldn't I.",

You need to explain this historical connection explicitly with evidence rather than just stating there is one. \n\nI do have a bit of an issue with the word \"clearly\" in your sentence though. Who is this clear to, of this situation where fascism and liberalism are holding hands? \n\nIgnoring the fact that every American Political Question proposed by Euro-American Internet Leftists is fake (i.e. On Trumpo-Fascism, On Affordable Healthcare, On Education and Advocation and Pontification and Celebration of the Working Class, etc), this \"American fascism set loose by liberalism\" or just settler-violence has always been obvious to the proletariat of the Black/Chicano Nation.",
