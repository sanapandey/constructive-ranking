You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But that's a fantasy, liberals have no more control than you do and they are equally miserable. You can't make yourself stupid, you are a living, thinking being. The only difference between you and a liberal is that liberals are doomed to be frustrated and helpless by the fundamental contradictions of their ideology whereas you have a chance to understand how reality actually works through the science of Marxism. \"Damage control\" is not one of the concepts that explains reality.",

Of all the talks of boycotting or protesting the elections, why is the result always some form of \"personal choice\" or somber pity for those still trying to \"vote blue.\"\n\nFascism is the ballot box, it is one of the means to legitimate the bond between the imperial core states and their citizens against the rest of the world. Clearly that legitimacy is faltering but instead of Communists recognizing this and striking while it stumbles, it's left to a free for all. Since the decisions made within the imperial core effect the world at large, yet the rest of the world has no say in them, why even entertain the illusion that bourgeois politics has anything to do with democracy, especially since that illusion was definitively shattered with the neoliberal assault on the Third World. This obviously nods to social fascism as an answer but it's apparent that even Dengists will cast their own orientalist stones at that illusion, upholding the \"superior\" social democracy of China. The reactionary hearth of their glass house becomes more apparent daily, and it's just a matter of time before one breaks a window and feels the chilling breeze of reality that they will retreat back to the fireplace for warmth.\n\nJust within the past month you were promoting the idea of voting for Claudia de la Cruz in multiple subreddits but now you appear to have changed your mind.

That is almost a cartoonish satire of Amerikan Communism but reality is often more ridiculous than people would give it credit for; I'd laugh but knowing you're serious is genuinely frightening.\n\n>Even if she didn\u2019t win, more socialist votes would certainly send a message!

Italy was the closest given even its fascism was more of a joke to the imperialist core than a threat but in this regard Mussolini was just unlucky (or delusional). With different timing Italy could have been like the rest of Southern Europe (Spain, Portugal and Greece) where an unambitious, anti-communist fascism was easily incorporated into the American world order rather than being dragged down by Germany's imperialist desires.\n\nJapan and Germany were, as Lenin pointed out, the younger and more rapidly developing imperialist powers. They were and are core powers. The remarkable thing about Lenin's prediction about imperialism as the end stage of capitalism is that even the losers of the inter-imperialist wars of the 20th century still remained in the club of imperialists and achieved the regional Empire they wanted, whereas those peripheral nations on the winning side were rewarded with normative neocolonial fascism. Not that this made the wars irrational (except the inherent irrationality of market anarchy and crisis resolution), rather that they unleashed the much greater threat of communism and third world liberation.\n\nWhat characterized them was late national development, an incomplete bourgeois revolution, and lateness to colonialism. All of these things led to what you're talking about. So I think you're looking in the wrong place. Crisis is always cyclical, that is a fundamental of Marxism. The question is why bribery of the German and Japanese labor aristocracy took the form that it did when responding to crisis. This, I think, lies in the particular historical features I mentioned.\n\n>imperialist crisis can no longer renew accumulation because the stagnate economy can only be resolved by war for a new division of markets. State policy only restricts the productive base and maintains the relations of production.\n\nI'm not really sure what this means. War for new division of markets is a feature of imperialism which precedes fascism. I don't think capitalism today is any more stagnant than in the 20th century, imperialism is a highly competitive system which depends on monopoly domination of production. The only way to justify a theory of stagnation is some kind of Luxemburg theory of imperialism where capitalism has run out of peripheries. Capitalism is a highly innovative system and no crisis is terminal, it does not need an external system to survive (whether pre-capitalist peripheries or military consumption).\n\nAs for the second part, that's not really true. Neoliberalism is a fiction which governments tell their people and themselves but in reality governments maintain the same function as always under monopoly capitalism. Only the form has changed because the American hegemonic system has realized institutions of the world market that British imperialism could only dream of. But if you really think this, Chinese state protectionism is incomprehensible except as socialism. China is acting like any other imperialist state, it just happens to be in a structural position where its accumulation increasingly threatens American national privilege within the American hegemonic system itself (which China is actually the biggest defender of). To defend its privilege, the American state is highly interventionist. So is the German or British state for that matter, the only confusion is a social democratic idea that \"national\" capitalism is good for the living standards of the people in that nation and therefore the fall in living standards and deindustrialization must be the result of being an American puppet or neoliberal ideology which doesn't even do capitalism right. I shouldn't have to point out that British and German imperialism are doing just fine, it is rather social democracy which has become superfluous as you point out (though complaints about living standards are highly suspect in the first place given the essential role of chinese commodities in living standards which simply didn't exist in the \"golden age\" of social democracy).",

It's good background noice while I eat lunch but is otherwise complete nonsense. \n\nYour OP started out with some awareness of the intersectional nature of imperialism if we can use that crude term. That's the only reason it was allowed at all. But you're now regressing into boring liberalism and repeating talking points from the DNC media apparatus. Please stop yourself and reevaluate how you went from your initial responsibility for the genocide in Palestine to \"project 2025.\"",
