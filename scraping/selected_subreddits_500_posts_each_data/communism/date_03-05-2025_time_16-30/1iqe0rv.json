    "selftext": "So I've heard a lot of times that Marx viewed religion as a coping mechanism for the proletariat to distract from their oppression by the bourgeoisie, and that I believe it may have been Lenin (or Marx) who said that destroying/targeting Churches or other religious institutions is not necessary, and that they would simply rather over time fall out of favour/popularity if Communist reforms were implemented successfully, so they would passively 'fizzle out'. What are people views on how a Communist state should (either in Theory deal with) or historically have dealt with religion?",

            "body": "Lenin or Marx do not argue that religion will passively fizzle out. (I am unaware of them using that term at all). Lenin talks about disestablishing the church, removing state subsidies, actively preaching a scientific outlook. During the Soviet revolution land was expropriated from the church, many bishops and priests were executed. Suppression of religion is an active part of the class struggle. Similarly during the GPCR many buddhist monestaries were destroyed, churches closed etc. None of these were passive measures.\n\nQuite often on the communist and socialist subs there are folks who come in speaking about how there religion (I've seen every one from buddhism to mormonism to catholicism) preaches some form of community values and can therefore lead people to communism and help establish a communist society. The response is often some kind of revisionist accommodating of that unfounded belief. Even in this thread 1/2 approved comments suggests that a communist state need not directly be \"dealt with\"\n\nWhy shouldn't churches, religious organizations, or other unscientific non-religious organizations be targeted directly? Communism is the real movement to abolish the present state of things is it not?\n\nWhere does the belief that religion and communism are compatible come from? Is this from the petty bourgeois kind of understanding of personal freedom?",

Is this from the petty bourgeois kind of understanding of personal freedom?\n\nReaders can find some of the usual petty bourgeois apologetics [in this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/1hw6pbl/can_i_be_both_a_christian_and_a_marxist/).\n\nThe common theme seems to be morality. The apologists observe that Marx rejected morality as a basis for his materialist understanding of history and political economy (unlike, say, the moralist philosophy of utopian socialists). They twist this as a deficiency in Marxism and an invitation to import their own system of morality. The argument goes like this: their own personal morals (not social forces! not material conditions!) are what apparently led them to Marxism, that using morality as a political guide to action is therefore acceptable, and that religious beliefs ([\"moral framework\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/1hw6pbl/can_i_be_both_a_christian_and_a_marxist/m5ztmj9/)) are therefore acceptable. If you recognize this pattern of thought as pure idealism, you are apparently a \"[baby Marxist](https://old.reddit.com/r/DebateCommunism/comments/1hw6pbl/can_i_be_both_a_christian_and_a_marxist/m5zs2bx/).\"\n\nOur morals -- our spontaneous value judgements informed by our social positions -- may, beneath a layer of falsehoods, conceal real economic truths (that capitalism is not an adequate economic basis for the social relations it has produced).

                            "body": "I selected the username because Maurice Bishop and the NJM are a topic of interest. I hope to circle back to and investigate more seriously once I build better foundations in Marxism and dialectical materialism. I don't know that I would endorse the politics of Maurice Bishop based upon what I know. Maybe once I investigate more thoroughly I will do a post.\n\nIt is my understanding that the revisionism of the New JEWEL Movement (and the Soviet Union and Cuba) is what ended up presenting the opening that allowed for the destruction of the People's Revolutionary Government via the coup and then invasion by the US military.\n\nThe NJM characterized themselves as a marxist-leninist movement though this would have been after revisionism had fully taken hold in the global communist movement both in China and in the USSR. \n\nMaurice Bishop seemed intent on retaining the british monarchy and financing domestic projects through foreign currency brought in via the tourism industry which while initially under largely foreign ownership they pushed to be brought under the ownership of domestic private interests or the Grenadian state. The several state owned banks set up to finance domestic publicly or privately owned businesses were generally financed through like foreign aid and private donations (and not necessarily from USSR/Cuba). \n\nOn the other hand if you read Bernard Coard interviews from the 80s and 90s he speaks about his admiration for and intent to institute a system similar to the PRC during the Deng period (should his administration have survived october of 1983. \n\nMost of the leadership of the PRG and NJM were petty-bourgeois academic types with degrees from the US, Canada, and UK. Maurice Bishop was a lawyer with a degree from LSE, Coard had degrees from Brandeis and U Sussex (and ties to the revisionist CPUSA). Unison Whiteman was an economist with degrees from Howard, Jacqueline Creft had advanced political science degrees from Carleton here in MN. The party itself suffered from insufficient development as the number of full members and members of the party militia significantly dwindled along with the organizations revisionist understanding of the way to move forward. I still have a lot of questions about the connection between the class outlook of NJM leadership and their political underdevelopment (and this is something that I need to work back towards examining more). \n\nThe many of the initial members of the Grenadian revolutionary army were rastafarians and in many ways unlike the Russian Orthodox Church, Rastafari was an attempt to break through the culture of white imperialism in the Caribbean. I am not sure there is a good parallel. The Caribbean Black Power movement was ultimately progressive. Though I really don't know if Afro American religions retain any progressive character today. Atleast anecdotally I have heard that the PRG tone towards rastafari shifted in 1980-81. \n\nThe New Jewel Movement did have a hostile relationship generally speaking with the Catholic, Anglican, and Pentecostal Churches (and smaller denominations as well). They surveilled the churches, required religious organizations to register, and propogandized against them. Opened many schools. Though Maurice Bishop seemed to also explore the idea of founding a \"progressive\" church.\n\nMaybe the nature of Rastafari is similar to that of African Socialism.\n\nWhile the NJM and PRG were ultimately progressive, Maurice Bishop I think is similar to Thomas Sankara in that they are lionized by people who hear that they are Marxist and don't do too much further exploration.",

            "body": "Your assessment is largely correct. Lenin states:\n\n>Religion\u00a0must be declared a private affair. In these words socialists usually express their attitude towards religion. But the meaning of these words should be accurately defined to prevent any misunderstanding. We demand that religion be held a private affair so far as the state is concerned. But by no means can we consider religion a private affair so far as our Party is concerned. Religion must be of no concern to the state, and religious societies must have no connection with governmental authority   \n...  \nThe\u00a0revolutionary proletariat will succeed in making religion a really private affair, so far as the state is concerned. And in this political system, cleansed of medieval mildew, the proletariat will wage a broad and open struggle for the elimination of economic slavery, the true source of the religious humbugging of mankind.\n\nThe traditional liberal line is freedom *of* religion while the Marxist position is better articulated as freedom *from* religion. Even in many nominally secular liberal societies religion is weaponized for political gain most often for reactionary purposes. The immediate concern is prevention of the use of religion as a means of obtaining political power and as tool for oppression for which it has been used countless times. The long-term goal of complete secularization of society will be accomplished by ending exploitation since religion as a superstructure is a product of that material condition.\n\n[Lenin: Socialism and Religion](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1905/dec/03.htm)",

A state need not address religion directly, because yes, once the alienation caused by capitalist organizing is dealt with, religion won't be necessary and will wither away and/or return to an objectivized, yet not fetishized, expression of man's condition.\n\nThis is my understanding, particularly after reading Against Dogmatism, Against Historical Fetishism by Omar Dekhili",
