    "selftext": "TLDR; I am looking to gain a better understanding of communist perspectives on the Great Leap Forward, particularly what were the key causes of the 1959-1961 famine?\n\nI am a university student currently taking a course on Chinese politics, which touched on the Great Leap Forward and the subsequent famine. This period of history was discussed through a suprising diversity of perspectives, though with little input from communists outside the CCP. Ultimately, the two main arguments that emerged were that the period represented a failure inherent to communist ideology or was an individualistic failure arising from Mao and the institutional strucutres that led to his largely unapposed power. I obviously oppose the first argument, but the latter argument I find somewhat convincing but ultimately incomplete. I am interested in the verious perspectives communists have on this period of history. While I am obviously interested in the perspectives of individual Chinese communists I already have a decent understanding of that of the CCP.",

            "body": "Unsurprisingly, your university, being a bourgeois university, do not actually discuss the actual, proximate cause of the great famine, not the policies of the Great Leap Forward per se, but the Three Years of Natural Disasters. Both Gao Mobo and Zhun Xu, from different angles, have excellent books on the misinformation around the Great Leap Forward (which is, erroneously, often conflated with the Great Famine), and defend the legacy of the Great Leap Forward which did achieve many of its goals, such as collectivization of agriculture (which led to greater productivity and welfare for the mostly rural population), the building of massive projects such as roads, irrigation, and dams, etc.\n\nThis is also shown by the way your university frame the supposed \"failure\" of the Great Leap Forward, either the usual liberal bromide about how Communism is good on paper but horrible in practice, or that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupt absolutely, and Communist \"dictators\" show how ultra-concentration of power in the hand of an individual lead to disaster and other such moralizing nonsense.\n\n  \nEdit: [https://rpb115.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/131/1131/img/2375/CCPS2(1)-Sun.pdf](https://rpb115.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/131/1131/img/2375/CCPS2(1)-Sun.pdf)\n\n# [https://zh.annas-archive.org/md5/1432bf98c35ad887297d966927f5dfe2](https://zh.annas-archive.org/md5/1432bf98c35ad887297d966927f5dfe2)\n\n  \n\n\n  \nTwo other studies which, while heavy in numbers and data, estimate the death to be, at the max, 4 million death in excess due to famine, and not the tens of millions that your bourgeois sources often claim.",

                    "body": "The Great Famine was not caused by natural disasters, it played major part but the real root cause is the failures in struggling against the rising bourgeois within China. Gao Mobo speaks about this extensively, with the First Five Year Plan prioritizing the cities over the countryside. Many CCP cadre who were meant to serve the countryside went to the cities, enjoying relative luxuries there, and pushed for this lopsided development. These kinds of rulers were known as \"dirt emperors\" by the peasantry, with many accounts by Gao Mobo which go into detail about their abuses. On a larger scale, this caused lopsided development and emergence of a bourgeois or the \"mismanagement\"(this includes Liu Shaoqi's influence especially). The Great Leap Forward itself had successes(especially in industrialization) and failures, but definitely advanced China past small scale production. The failures were addressed with the Cultural Revolution, with massive expansion of rural education, infrastructure, and mobilization against the bourgeois across China.\n\nAfter the Great Leap Forward there were no more famines and food self-sufficiency was achieved. Natural disasters are not inherent causes of widespread famine. The affects of the Great Famine(more accurately, multiple famines) could've been minimized further, the Great Leap Forward could've been more successful, and the rising bourgeois could've been combated. All of this is from hindsight, and it will never be perfect, but the revolutionary movement in our time need to seriously evaluate problems to be able to be more successful than the past. In addition, this is an even harsher criticism of the bourgeois attacks on socialist China because was their practice that were responsible for the failures during the Great Leap Forward. After reform, the development of the countryside stagnated and began to regress even further.\n\nTagging u/smokeuptheweed9 u/Thefishassassin",

I know that the bourgeois neglect these factors and apply them ONLY to countries that they don't like. However, in order to actually answer the key cause behind the Great Famine, we have to look at the development of the productive forces and productive relations. Context is important, a single year in India during the late 1980s had more deaths than conservative estimates of the 6 years of the of Great Famine.\n\n\"Finally, it is important to note that despite the gigantic size of excess mortality in the Chinese famine, the extra mortality in India from regular deprivation in normal times vastly overshadows the former. Comparing India's death rate of 12 per thousand with China's of 7 per thousand, and applying that difference to the Indian population of 781 million in 1986, we get an estimate of excess normal mortality in India of 3.9 million per year. This implies that every eight years or so more people die in India because of its higher regular death rate than died in China in the gigantic famine of 1958\u201361.37 India seems to manage to fill its cupboard with more skeletons every eight years than China put there in its years of shame.\" - Amaryta Sen, Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation\n\nEspecially after COVID-19, any mild achievements since the 80s by the bourgeois have been been fully reversed and furthered into crisis. So this is basically the case in India, and majority of Third World countries, that face severe and constant crises. Despite the neglect of the bourgeois to establish this context, the reason why I think it's important to emphasize class struggle is because it played the principal role. This is far less explored and it is necessary for revolutionaries, especially those in semi-feudal and semi-colonial conditions, to learn from it to understand how the rising bourgeois sabotages development and seizes power. It's almost a cop out to blame natural disasters, because that's basically the \"immediate\" cause of all famines. All famines are \"man-made\" in some way really.",

Also what you said is factually untrue. There was a very powerful and vital Maoist current in Asian Studies at that time, it was only much later that anti-communism became the hegemonic understanding of the Great leap forward in academia. It's fine to not know about this, I doubt your professor knows much about it given political science is a fake field.
