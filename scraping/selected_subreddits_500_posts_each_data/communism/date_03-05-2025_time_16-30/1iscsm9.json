No, I instead would like to find a resource that would critique and discuss Mao's work in office. Thanks",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

Schram is a Maoist sinologist, and the book includes many criticisms about the USSR\u2019s -arguably- na\u00efve understanding of the revolutionary current in pre-socialist China. It features excerpts of Mao\u2019s correspondence with Stalin via M.N. Roy, and also plenty about Mao\u2019s early life. \n\nThere is a specific part in the book about Mao\u2019s early life which has always stuck with me. It was about how Mao had to self-teach himself at the library in order to get a better understanding of the world. I feel like I\u2019m in a similar position at university where in order to get a better understanding of the world, I have to approach the library\u2019s Marxist texts as opposed to relying on the bullshit I get given in my lectures (which I have to pay extensive fees for).\n\nedit; Schram also does a very good job at timelining the evolution of the CCCP and the Kuomintang, presenting nuanced perspectives up \u2018til the revolution.",

I did ask you your understanding of theory:* I asked you to \"Give a specific example of a valid critique of Mao,\" because that would reveal everything to everyone and make the point clear.  There are several places you can point to and even just provide a copy and paste, and if you cannot find or think of a written example, then you ought to be able to produce one from your brain if you sufficiently understand the history of revolutionary China which would suffice.  The problem is you don't actually have one -- and your attempt to produce one will simply be something liberal or reactionary and, in essence, identical to their criticisms, which will prove the point: that your suggestion to OP isn't being made in good faith (you are in no position to suggest OP read the criticisms of Mao if you don't know what the criticisms are or where to find them or if they even exist -- because for you they dont exist yet because you haven't discovered them and your knowledge is not at a sufficient level to make these sorts of suggestions to OP -- you are misleading and harming them), you are speaking from ignorance and trying to hide behind the fascist tactic of \"what I was just asking questions\" to cover throwing the tar of liberalism onto the standard of communism.",

Why SHOULD it be read alongside the primary sources? With some qualifications that statement would be fine with me, but the problem is that you seem to think that what you said is obvious so I can intuit that you're probably not making a statement specifically about \"revolutionary figures\" but about knowledge acquisition in general, and that statement is liberal at its core. Your presumption is that all attempts at recording history have some \"biasedness\" weighting and that true and neutral knowledge can be uncovered by either finding a historical record with a bias weighting as close to zero as possible or eclectically compounding multiple sources such that the \"sum bias\" is as close to zero as possible, yes? I'm intentionally being accusatory here but if I'm incorrect then why is it the case that \"...a valid criticism of a revolutionary figure SHOULD be read along side all primary sources?\" I'm not being facetious here; after all, you would have to know why they're reading the primary sources in the first place to make a blanket statement like this.",

But I am more interested in your answer right now.\n\nEdit: /u/Yonv_Bear, to be fair, I think that I was speaking ahead of you so I'm not sure what response I expected (especially since I gave you a ready-made excuse to do what you would have done in a perhaps less self-righteous manner without the excuse), but if the accusation scares you then the main point of what I was saying was this: I don't take your point for granted. You assumed it was obvious, which is why you didn't bother elaborating on why this would even be true, and I'm just asking you to articulate what the logic behind that statement is. Again, you don't know what the OP was going to do with the book in question or what fundamental question they are looking to answer in their heads so assuming that they need to be reading a \"valid criticism\" book alongside all primary sources in this case means that you are assuming that this is true regardless of what their intent or goals are, regardless of the subject of discussion; that is, as a general principle of knowledge acquisition. This was where my accusation came from and I have explained why I came to that conclusion. Do you feel like answering?\n\nEdit 2: It seems they thought it better to start perusing \"socialist gaming\" subreddits in the middle of the conversation (and had actually been doing it throughout the thread's history, before I even commented) so I guess they were never serious after all.

Ultimately my point is that this\n\n>To discuss his actions, good and bad, from a leftist (why the change from Marxist? These terms are not synonymous) perspective is valuable\n\nSeems to me to be no different than the \"centrist\" idea that \"both sides have valid points so the truth must lie somewhere in the middle.\"\n\nOn top of this, where do you think Mao's theoretical work even comes from? Mao's theory on the Cultural Revolution (to use one of your examples) didn't just spring up from nowhere, but rather emerged out of the experience of actually constructing socialism (both the Chinese experience and lessons learned from the Soviet experience). Thus, Mao's \"theoretical\" work cannot be divorced from his practice as you are attempting to do, but rather both are necessarily intertwined. This is why I said that anything you need you can get from Mao (not to discount the actual revolutionary critiques of Mao which u/DashtheRed mentioned, but even these require a baseline of understanding Mao's work itself to be useful).\n\nEdit: Wording",
