    "selftext": "It is often said that fascism is capitalism in decay or last line of defence for capitalism. \n\nHistorically, from what I see, it arises to prevent capitalism's faults to cause socialist revolution. \n\nBut today, from the information I passively receive from media, it seems to me like there are fascist groups forming all over Europe and the US, but not against socialism, since there are too few of us. \n\nCould it be to prevent the system to fall into feudalism, with megacorprations renting office/business/factory space to smaller corporations for a fee.

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "While semi-feudal relations do still exist to some extent in certain imperialized countries, feudalism as a full-fledged mode of production and means of surplus appropriation has been entirely negated in every place it once existed. Feudalism does not currently exist and will never exist again, much as the Roman slave mode of production will never re-emerge; the process you're are describing, in any case, is not feudalism but an ancillary form of rent-seeking.\n\nReally, all this \"late-stage capitalism\" and \"neo-feudalism\" talk comes from the familiar class anxieties of the imperial-core petty-bourgeoisie amidst the deterioration of their class position; hence, like all the other garbage that anxiety inspires, it's utterly worthless, even detrimental, for understanding reality. You need to start from tabula rasa and actually apply yourself to studying scientific socialism, particularly the actual origins and character of feudalism and capitalism respectively (as actual scientific concepts, not just scary words). For this, I'd recommend a serious study of *Capital*, among other things.",

            "body": "The Bourgeoisie has two methods to maintain its control of the Proletariat. The first being the use of socal-democrat reformism as the \"carrot\", enticing the exploited class to remain complacent by offering moderate, temporary reforms that are easily revoked.\n\nThe second method is the use of fascism as the \"stick\", threatening the working class with all the autocracy of the Fascist regime. You are correct to say that both historically and today the fascists serve as an opposing force against the Left - it was a right-wing paramilitary which was responsible for the death of Rosa Luxembourg.\n\nFascism arises as the monopolization of force just as Late-stage Capitalism monopolizes capital. It is to the ruling class' benefit that this extremism runs, as the Bourgeoisie itself would rather not soil its own hands, and it serves their goals very well.",
