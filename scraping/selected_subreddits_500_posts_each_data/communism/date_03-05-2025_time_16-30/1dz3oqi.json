Dhoruba was released recently and is on Black Liberation Media\u2019s YouTube channel and a few others doing talks. He is incredibly knowledgeable and has the credentials to be taken seriously by all comrades.",

But the Imperial states were scared af of the only real socialist getting elected and succeeding. Also project Cybersyn was very ambitious with the recourses they had and quite successful, this approach is imo the only sensible way to go about a planned economy today.",

This is not an issue of mine exclusive to this book, but one I have with most more theoretic work.\nIf anybody has more digestible recommendations, I'd be very thankful :)\n\nEdit: I kinda confused reformist and revisionist in my original comment :]",
