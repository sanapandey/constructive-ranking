    "selftext": "I live in America and was wondering if there were any good news sites that tend to report on events in the global south since when news sites that are in the West(US, Western and Central Europe, Canada, and Japan) do report on things in the global south it ranges from unconscious racism to basically fascistic. I would love recommendations that are left leaning but I wouldn't mind centrist/right wing news sources.",
