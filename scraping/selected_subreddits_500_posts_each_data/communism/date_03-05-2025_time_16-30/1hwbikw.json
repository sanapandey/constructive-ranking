    "selftext": "I watched it yesterday, I rent my movies from my local library I never pay for them especially with the ongoing genocide knowing that most production studios support the Zionist entity. I thought that the black power movement was actually very negatively portrayed in the movie. I find that there is very few Hollywood movies than positively portray the struggle for black liberation and the black experience in Amerikkka. Most movies tend to place white people in the role of the white savior (The Help, The Blind Side, etc are good examples of this). I think Boots Riley\u2019s work is great and I really like The Color People. If any of you have watched Do the Right Thing let me know your thoughts. ",

If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

            "body": "Haven't watched the film, but I found *The Spook Who Sat by the Door* to be great in its characters as well as its portrayal of the black liberation movement. It's utopian in an adventurist way, but I think that's probably the best kind of perspective a film from the time could have taken since it doesn't capitulate to the civil rights movement. Conversely, *Uptight* was weighed down by taking the perspective of a snitch, who's the least interesting kind of person, ending up a boring melodrama that has to justify his actions and condemn revolution.",

A superb movie. \n\nPolitically, however, it's pretty sparse. There is a complication involved with it all, the black nationalism, patriarchy and the racism that goes with that, the reaction towards Asian immigrants in the black community........I suppose that complication is best portrayed in the scene where everyone gets their turn saying racist things about the group, until the DJ tells them to cool out. \n\nBut ultimately it's a pretty facile piece of work when it comes to exploring those dynamics. Pretty surface stuff. And nowhere close to introducing a Marxist analysis of racism. Don't even try it. \n\nGreat movie, pretty lame politics.",

So even the creator of this 'art' disagrees with your tepid thought. Of course, Spike Lee wanting 'debate' about race in the U.S. is evidence as well of his liberalism. You don't even have to have watched the film to determine that it is not good based on how he himself has talked about where it came from.",
