You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

            "body": "The pro Kyiv far right is very against Soviet symbolism, while some pro Moscow nationalists, \"patriots\", bourgeoisie, etc. try to appropriate it. I think the reasons are a few, mainly that these people don't actually have an issue with what in essence was Soviet capitalism in the revisionist era of the USSR, and perhaps it is also a populist \"trick\", if I may call it that, to try and amalgamate sentiment of the Russian masses (and decades long practice of Soviet society) against western imperialism with the anti west interests of Russian imperialism. Another thing I've seen is that some Russian nationalists take the reactionary claim that Soviet internationalism was just a fa\u00e7ade for national oppression and Russian chauvinism at face value but adopt that as a good thing and even engage in such fa\u00e7ades themselves (i.e. trying to claim Russian imperialism isn't actually imperialism but internationalism).\n\n\nEdit: I do think the first reason I gave is the main one and I think it could perfectly explain why pro Moscow reactionaries can use Soviet symbolism while anti Russia reactionaries don't. First of all, no reactionaries will feel inspired by communist era USSR symbolism, i.e. from the Lenin and Stalin eras. But then, if we see the revisionist era as basically restoring a Russian capitalism (and I mean Russian, with all that implies in terms of chauvinism and national oppression; some contemporary Maoists criticized it as such), of which the Russian Federation is a successor, then it's not so hard for people to make the jump from Putinism to Soviet revisionism as with Russian reactionaries, or on the contrary from pro Soviet revisionism to Putinism as I've seen with a lot of older AKEL revisionists here in Cyprus. However, anti Russia reactionaries will be inspired by neither Soviet communism nor Soviet revisionism, thus unlike with pro Moscow reactionaries they will see no use in any symbolism from 1917-1991, while the latter can see some use in using symbols which were also used from 1953-1991.",

And anyway writing the comment I wasn't as much concerned with old Soviet citizens who are nostalgic for the Brezhnevite USSR (their character is a whole different topic; I'd say it may sometimes be progressive in some ways but in the vast majority it's not revolutionary considering it's, you know, the Brezhnevite USSR) but specifically with reactionaries of younger generations who didn't live much if at all in the USSR but retroactively adopt a sympathy for the latter half of the USSR's existence and its symbolism.",
