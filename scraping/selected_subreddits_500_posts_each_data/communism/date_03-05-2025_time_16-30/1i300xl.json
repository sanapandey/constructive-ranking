    "selftext": "Throughout my (admittedly short) time as an actual communist in Amerika, I have spent a lot of time researching many of the organizations calling themselves Maoist in the U$. While some groups are simply reactionaries in a red coat of paint, many others seem to me to have at least as many redeeming qualities and strengths as they do major weaknesses and critical errors in their political line. By far the most common and concerning error I have seen is the tendency to discard/misunderstand the detention of the labor aristocracy and present the settler \"nation\" of the U$ as a ligentement nation, leading to a misidentification of who the masses within the U$ actually are.\n\nMy question is, at what point does it become worth it to associate with, work with or join a movement that makes certain errors and at what point does this become problematic. I think the extremes of this question are fairly obvious, a few tactical error, or an incorrect line on RIM should not write off an otherwise perfectly good organization, on the other hand organizations that are communist in name only and are evidently reactionary should clearly not be supported, for example orgs which uphold Trotskyism, khrushchevism/dengism or who ignore entirely questions of imperialism, national oppression or parichay. Clearly there isa qualitative difference between comrades with an incomplete understanding and outright reactionaries and it's extremes are easy to identify, but it's a lot harder to place that dividing.\n\nObviously it is a foolish task to try and set out a point of departure between friend and foe when it comes to political lines which is always consistent, doing so would be a metaphysical error. In order to make a comprehensive judgment on the question \"is this organization to wrong\" you would have to investigate organizations on a case by case basis. As such the purpose of this question is not to find some universal standard, but to ascertain certain guidelines and principles on the general level for the task of carrying out these kinds investigations in the particular. I should note that this question is aimed at the U$ context in particular, and while I welcome contribution from comrades from every corner of the globe (especially countries like Kanada and Australia which have very similar conditions) the unique conditions of all countries should be kept in mind.",

But you already arrived at the most important dividing line for Imperial Core and Settler nations.\n\n>By far the most common and concerning error I have seen is the tendency to discard/misunderstand the detention of the labor aristocracy and present the settler \"nation\" of the U$ as a ligentement nation, leading to a misidentification of who the masses within the U$ actually are.\n\nIs it possible to work with organizations that dont uphold a LA or Settler Thesis? In some situations, probably. But you have limited time in your human life.\n\nCan you join an organization and with like minded individuals  steer the party into an anti-revisionist line, and wage intra party struggle. Its possible, but the effort and time is probably better spent working with an anti revisionist organization to begin with.\n\nThe key issue in Settler nations is finding a revolutionary mass base. The size of an initial vanguard party is pretty inconsequential compared to its correct political line and eventual ability to work with and lead the masses.\n\nNot sure what answer you expect to hear",

I do have a question though.\n\n>Is it possible to work with organizations that don't uphold a LA or Settler Thesis? In some situations, probably. But you have limited time in your human life.\n\nWhile it is true that I have very limited options around me. There is to my knowledge no orgs anywhere near me that uphold a correct line on the LA or Settlers, and I definitely do not have the knologae, skills, resources, connection, experience or anything else needed to start anything more than an online book club from scratch (even then I had two other people helping me). That being said it may be possible for me to get into contact and work with some Maoist groups who make serious errors with their understanding of LA and Settlers. Since, at least for the moment my options seem to be rot in bed or try and work with these orgs, might it be at least marginally more productive to work with these orgs? If not for the work they do, than to possibly link up with likeminded comrades and/or to gain some practical experience? I comrade of mine is considering doing that with the PSL, however the PSL is for me way to far.",

I have only found a few groups myself, and I have a little bit of time before I get seriously involved. But there are multiple organizations which dont need you to travel. MIM Prisons for example can be contacted online by email, and I imagine many other organizations can too.\n\nI also think you need to reevaluate how you consider a reading group to not be a good use of your time. Think of how useful (this sub) things would be if we had 5 more dedicated members working on analysis and work. \n\nAt a certain point every self proclaimed Communist needs to genuinely reckon how much personal sacrifice they wil put into organizing, whether that means moving or finding a new job or dedicating lots of your time.\n\nThe principal contradiction in the US is the National Oppression of various occupied nations within US borders. But even these nations aren't guaranteed (to out it lightly) to be won over because of the presence of a large Labor Aristocrat population in the entirety of the US Empire (whether White or occupied nations). Organizations that dont even understand this are quite frankly useless. \n\nA party cannot be established until a mass base is found in the US, whether its the Prison Lumpen or through social investigation we locate a proletariat in New Afrika or Aztlan etc. \n\nA Revolution can only be won 2 things: A party and a mass base.",
