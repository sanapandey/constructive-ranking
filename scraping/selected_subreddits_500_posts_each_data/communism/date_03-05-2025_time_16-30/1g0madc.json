            "body": "Besides what was said about the politics already, the analysis is mediocre. It may appear impressive if you haven't read Arrighi but it's actually just a book report. The author doesn't seem to be aware of the Marxist criticism of Arrighi (he explicitly defines profit in a non-Marxist way) or any of the Marxist literature on the transition to capitalism (Dobb, Sweezy, Brenner, Anderson, Wallerstein, etc). He is simply combining Arrighi and some elaboration from EM Wood, again not showing any familiarity with Wood's anti-Marxism (she is explicitly against dialectical materialism and overall quite poor - it's also worth pointing out that Arrighi and Wood disagree on many fundamental issues). The analysis in Marx and Engels is entirely absent and there is a general inability to grasp that different arguments are incompatible and that merely asserting one side is \"dumb\" only proves one's own stupidity. The author doesn't even seem to grasp the problem, which is why capitalism began in the English countryside out of a process that was seemingly universal. The explanation, which is that the British Empire was more developed than the Dutch, is insufficient and lacks a basic casual variable. It is not present on any side of the debate (rather, defenders of the global history of capitalism deny the specificity of England entirely and, increasingly, the capitalist mode of production). I won't even get into the arrogance of the article on *stageism\" after asserting with no engagement with Marx and Engles that feudalism is a particularly Western European system that derives from the Roman Empire. What of semi-feudalism? What of Japanese feudalism and more generally the Prussian path of capitalism? Not only does Arrighi's analysis of \"state capitalism\" make these incomprehensible, the author is again not even aware of the problem. It's fine to not know everything, though I'm not sure why we needed this amateurish effort, but again the arrogance of the piece makes me feel forced to point this out.\n\nAfter that section I started skimming. The author fundamentally doesn't understand Lenin, which makes sense because Arrighi is anti-Lenin, and this is crudely reproduced by the author when he calls the Dutch East India Company \"monopoly capitalism.\" But Arrighi at least respects Lenin, whereas this so-called Marxist basically calls Lenin's work completely useless outside of its political value at the time.\n\nAs for the rant about postmodern, again the author is too ignorant to understand the problem. The author thinks that \n\n>A necessary corrective that serious communists must make, not to Marx but to the ill effects of mechanical \u201cMarxism,\u201d is to imbue our historical and contemporary analysis with attention to the role of decisions\u2014by individuals, governments, classes, etc.\u2014in addition to and in interaction with the more impersonal motions of capital, as I have tried to do in the preceding pages.\n\nSomehow counters postmodernism. In fact, as the author points out just before, that is the postmodern critique itself. But that is only a crude reduction, the real issue is again causality and the dialectal materialist method. You cannot just say that choices are \"added to\" and \"in interaction with,\" the entire problem is the nature of that interaction in a base/superstructure model. \n\nWhatever discipline the author originally had at Kites, whether because the subject was something they actually knew because of practice or because of accountability to an editor and communist organization of some kind, is long gone. Everything I've read from this journal is either an embarrassing polemic or a low quality school essay. This one in particular is far too long considering its value and unless the author is willing to come here and defend their work, this will be the last time an article from that site is posted.",

But as you point out, it is incompatible with Marxism and is fundamentally parasitic on Marxist science. By adding \"complexity\" to so called \"vulgar\" Marxism, the origin of capitalism goes further and further back until capitalism itself makes no sense as a concept. Andre Gunder Frank starts the world system in 4th millennium BC. Starting at the Crusades is equally arbitrary once capitalism has been reduced to profit through exchange. Then, without Marxism, the obvious differences between the world we live in today and the world of the 15th century can be obfuscated by postmodernism and rhetorical trickery since we were never trying to make new \"metanarratives\" or impose \"concepts\" on people's lives or whatever. \n\nThose assertions are easy to understand. If settler colonialism is the settling of populations in new territory through violence then most of history is settler colonialism. Colonialism in this schema is simply conquest. Unfortunately, such ideas are no longer acceptable in 2024, where the centrality of Palestine has made a materialist understanding of settler colonialism necessary for Marxists and even liberals who are forced to confront the complete indifference to Palestine among the anti-Netanyahu \"left\" in Israel. That is why everyone has focused on the obvious political implications of statements like this\n\n>Once they have succeeded in those endeavors, they become settled, and where dominant, they have established new nation-states in their image.\n\n>Those new nation-states are certainly stamped with the genocidal history of settler-colonialism, and have constituted the remaining Indigenous populations as oppressed nations and/or nationalities.104 But with the consolidation of new nation-states out of settler-colonies, new arrivals to those nation-states are no longer settlers in any materialist class analysis sense. They are slotted into various positions within the class structure of those nation-states, from proletarian to bourgeois. \n\nI want \"Kenny Lake\" to openly say that the Israeli proletariat are the main force \"when it comes to the strategic question of how to make revolution, what matters is the class position they come to occupy in the nation-state they become a part of.\" \n\nThe alternative is to simply read Marx, Engels, Lenin, and whatever Marxist works on specific subjects come out of real revolutionary, proletarian struggle instead of junk academic work and blog posts. *Settlers* is that, the history of the work is as important as the work itself.\n\n>Do you not see any value in reading Wood or Arrighi for someone who wishes to better grasp the transition from feudalism to capitalism?\n\nRead whatever you want. But reality insists upon thought, whether you will actually better grasp these phenomena will be determined by objective reality. I think the OP article doesn't grasp them at all.\n\n>Do you have any reading recommendations on this particular subject? \n\nI don't really do reading recommendations because the gap between theory and practice always imprints itself on analysis (including my own of course). What you need is the courage to say that a book sucks without becoming delusional and narcissistic like the OP article because you read a decent book. Arrighi's book is decent because the flaws are so clear as are the ambitions. Wood's work is simply a crude defense of Brenner. Just read him instead.",

Despite this journal's erroneous and chauvinistic line on national liberation and colonialism, discussion of this in-depth historical and theoretical work (the type of which are sorely lacking in the OTI Maoist movement) has the potential to be deeply productive, and downvoting this post just ensures that people see it and think \"well, I don't need to engage with this\".

                                    "body": "I think the OCR was always interesting, at least to me, because there was this clear contradiction between the party\u2019s line against \u201cpostmodernism\u201d (as they would describe it\u2014 I\u2019d say settler-colonialism) and their chauvinism. Outside of the MIM, they produced the most cogent overview of the limitations of standard \u201ccommunist\u201d \u201cpraxis\u201d but I thought it was clear that the implementation of these ideas would require a confrontation with their vulgar line on the BLA. \n\nThey would simply either have to acknowledge the real structure of Euro-Amerika\u2019s political economy (something revisionist orgs can ignore since they\u2019re not really intervening anyway) or abolish the party through trying to synthesize the antagonistic. The latter is what occurred, but I still find this less tragic than the alternative where parties last in some zombie role as careerist fronts. This doesn\u2019t occur with most Maoist groups (and the attempts like the former CRCPUSA are all embarrassing failures) but this is more a function of both the structure of a Maoist party and the relation revolutionary communism has more broadly to the Amerikan \u201cleft\u201d than any real consistent anti-revisionist tradition. \n\nThe trade-off to this is that we\u2019re left to rebuild from the ground up constantly, but at a certain point I think there\u2019s a question of how productive it is to just keep beating our heads against the wall. Every working mass org with a presence has a reactionary line on the prison-house. Is this because the BLA\u2019s line on settler-colonialism is anathema to the construction of a party? Obviously not\u2014 unless you buy whatever pablum about how we\u2019re *so different* from the Bolsheviks or the PCP. But I do think this points to some issues in how we construct and formalize the vanguard party in the present day. The OCR\u2019s most compelling works have always been the ones about the need for a new type of revolutionary party as a rupture from either the Old or New Left. \n\nI loathe just presenting an issue without a way forward but I thought I\u2019d open the question here since we likely won\u2019t be getting more opportunities to discuss this group. Obviously I think there\u2019s something to learn from this subreddit, not as a celebration of a community of \u201cgood communists\u201d but as a particular formation that seems to produce novel and revolutionary insights missing from more \u201creal\u201d parties that can\u2019t seem to make a single new thought. Ultimately everything else feels like a recreation of the old MIM, whose dissolution and critique from it (leading to the revolutionary intervention of a cell organization) was perhaps too incisive to be internalized and is thus will continue to be ignored.\n\nBut it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nhttps://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/wim/cong/cells2005.html\n\nAs well as MIM (Prisons).\n\nhttps://www.prisoncensorship.info/article/social-networking-smartphones-and-reliance-on-the-masses/\n\nEdit: to clarify I support the MIM\u2019s line when it comes to dissolving their party and the contradictions in their previous formation. The MIM as it existed prior to this was maybe the best a Maoist \u201cparty\u201d could exist in the present, everything after doomed to be a cargo cult, but it was still untenable as the first piece lays out beautifully.",

I've only ever met one person who's studied the history of New Afrikan struggle and attempt to apply that understanding today, but they learned part of that history in a more direct way from elders of that period.\n\nSo that brings thing back to this subreddit, or really the internet itself as a metaphorical library of babel where information is not immediately comprehensible so one relies on the existence of others who have spent time there to have some hope of grasping it all. Colorful metaphor aside, I feel it can't *just* be coincidence that this subreddit/the internet is where new revolutionary thought is being produced or least displayed (as in the case of early kites or MIM/(P)). The cell structure that MIM talks about is most visible here, as just by a function of the (potential) anonymity, many Communists, at the international level importantly, are able to share thoughts/work/ideas gathered from struggle in their geographical context, and expose those to criticism and discussion. MIM is able to accomplish a limited publicized version of this in their newspaper, but discussion there is even more slow than here and is limited to a more old fashioned version of editors notes and replies to previous articles.\n\nIn essence, this subreddit is the modern form of the Communist newspaper, but seemingly without a central organ behind it. Though that hasn't prevented the coalescence around line struggles and the convergence towards a common ideology (the most frequent users here are all Maoists or at least capable of discussing questions posed by Maoism). But then where is there to go from here and additionally where is the natural development of this form of intercourse heading to? My thoughts are that by virtue of core users presenting a history of their line struggle, it's likely through DMs people will meet and unite in person if they learn they are from a similar region. Perhaps this has already happened and that's the next stage in the existence of the sub and we will just have to be keen to make the most productive use of this new development. \n\nThe question of security MIM poses in those articles seems to apply more to MIM/MIM(P) itself than the cell structure found here in this sub. As stated above, the limitation of them having to be so secure is that the site is less accessible to the public (assuming you use their suggestion of tor), only those they're already in contact with can write articles (posts), and just a general lack of publicity. The vast swath of internet users aren't going to know what MIM(P) is on appearance alone nor prisoncensorhip(dot)info, but nearly anyone can immediately see something like r/Communism and have an immediate idea of how they want to interact with it. Granted, there's rather important structural considerations to think about, like reddit's home page algorithm or r/all slipping a post here into the larger pool of users. There's also a different question of security for the sub given the potentially precarious nature of being hosted by an institution that's not under our control, but perhaps that's to the benefit of all the things I mentioned that limit MIM(P)'s reach. \n\nIn all, as I've mentioned in previous comments, the internet is where ideological development is taking place for parts of the world with highly developed capitalist relations (the postmodern conditions as some would say) and is breaking beyond the traditional petty bourgeois class bounds that originally bolstered it. It's just a matter of Communists truly grasping the potential of this situation, incorporating it into their regional praxis, and knowing its limits or pitfalls.",

I think the fact that this subreddit has coalesced around a line when the traditional baggage of organization is removed (chauvinism, reformism, defeatism, tailism, etc.) without a guiding party is an interesting phenomenon. Certainly there are users here which drive these discussions, but just as many have been moved past or have themselves moved on.\n\nObviously there are flaws in taking this subreddit as the be-all end-all, even if I think it\u2019s a critical step forward. Deciding to search communism on reddit is already a class filter, not to mention the language barrier, the existence of government censorship, the structure of Reddit itself, but the fact that interesting developments can emerge regardless is testament to the central thesis, as you lay out, that this is the framework for a modern communist newspaper. After all, while geographic constraints were faced by communists in the past, there is no reason to pretend these are still so primary in a world where you don\u2019t actually have to hand out printed sheets to carriers. \n\n*Under Lock and Key* is also great, but I was thinking recently how part of what made it so effective is that it synthesized a line out of several interest groups not only in the prison system but other online forums including this one. It made me think back to both the concept of a mass line, where both this subreddit and ULK isolate the most reactionary, advance the most revolutionary, and seek to win over the moderate lines in a given space. It also calls to mind the very concept of a base area as the crucible by which such lines are forged.\n\nIn terms of discussing the PPW, we think of base areas as distinct geographical entities that communists physically build to continue to advance the mass line. I\u2019d contend that, while this is the form the PPW takes in semi-feudalism, this doesn\u2019t really need to be the case. Commodity identities have turned the question of geography on its head\u2014 most first worlders know more about their fellow members of the fandom than they do their own neighbors while the masses are moved in great number by the tides of capital. There are of course security concerns with only using a resource that\u2019s largely funded by imperialist grants and closely monitored by intelligence agencies, but the notion that a party has to be a bunch of people in a room feel antiquated and pointless in the world we find ourselves in. Not that this should be ignored, but treating it as the only \u201creal\u201d way to produce correct ideas is laughable.\n\nIt\u2019s like how Trots read that a party must have a newspaper and have been doing nothing but printing newspapers ever since. We might as well all learn Russian or walk around with M1891\u2019s if the point is to just cosplay as the CPSU. Lenin didn\u2019t write about electrification because electricity is intrinsically communist.\n\nEdit: there\u2019s a parallel to this idea found in Islamist tactics performed during the 2000s-2010s in the first world which, while mostly used for reactionary violence, do point to the fact that an effective means of organizing people is to reconstitute a disparate population around a centralizing identity.",

No doubt this forum has allowed really great in-depth theoretical developments, but it also engenders a certain inverted form of ideology-through-meme where people are simply repeating what they see said on here without doing any thinking of their own (I\u2019m talking both about phenomena where users who dismiss new commentors\u2019 concerns with \u201cread (Capital/Settlers)\u201d admit they\u2019ve never read the text in question themselves, and also instances where the most popular users have to walk other frequent users through the point that, no, (kitchens/weed/rock music/nuclear families) aren\u2019t inherently reactionary brands of the labor aristocracy that should be shunned).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAlso, maybe for like, someone living in suburbia or in a small Western European country this site could be the true only place for them to interact with revolutionary elements of society, but for anyone who lives in a city with lots of migrants or somewhere with a history of radical revolutionary nationalism for example, or even a school with an encampment, the idea that organizational forms relying primarily on on-the-ground action are moribund lends to a particular kind of academic defeatism relatively prevalent on here.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWith regards to PPW, the idea that the internet could ever serve as a substitute for revolutionary base areas completely rejects the critical idea that the very people who should be mobilized for PPW are precisely those who spend the most time interfacing with *the real world*. Sure, the internet is nowadays a completely globalized phenomenon, but it\u2019s not like migrant proletarians or imprisoned lumpen have stable internet access or a ton of free time to spend in online \u201cbase areas\u201d.\n\nAnd since this thread brought up ULK, I\u2019ll say \u2014 the thing to me that differentiates ULK from the vast majority of e-communist publications is the fact that it actively (a) shaped itself for the interest of, and (b) solicits the contributions of, a class / social group *other than* online communists.",

The question is, in spite of this, this forum has been successful at producing original, revolutionary thought that many \u201con-the-ground\u201d orgs simply have not. That\u2019s not because the average user here is inherently smarter or more disciplined or cares more. Overall it\u2019s probably the opposite. What\u2019s interesting is why that doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIf you\u2019ve had success advancing the Sakai line in your community then I\u2019m heartened by this, but my experience has been of tepid communists tailing revisionist ideas that arose as fetishes of past revolutionary groups or being outright chauvinist tourists, all easily swallowed into NGOs. In either case, it doesn\u2019t really benefit them to take a line that sees broad swathes of their \u201cbase\u201d as reactionary. In fact the only major groups I know of that really took *Settlers* into social practice fractured under the contradictions it produced. If one has a reason to reject the theory of settler-colonialism as a mass and present phenomenon undergirding Euro-Amerikan bourgeoisification, then it\u2019s easy to see this as proof that *Settlers* is toxic to party building.\n\nI\u2019d contend, however, that the MIM\u2019s continued relevance, and this subreddit\u2019s own capacity for theoretical development, points to another possibility: cell based organizations *are* a step in the process of reconstituting the Communist Party.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that the party needs to be a forum. Rather, I think the party should be ambivalent to the false dualism of \u201conline\u201d and \u201creal life\u201d where one is social practice and the other is at best a means to indirectly supplement the \u201clegitimate\u201d one. This is just a more pseudo-intellectual divide of \u201ctheory\u201d and \u201cpractice\u201d as separate functions of a party. The Party Newspaper or the Big-Character Poster were not just rhetorical tools or things to check off. They were examples of a communist party using endemic systems of communication to engage the masses and advance proletarian revolution. Can we really say that the internet has been utilized to its fullest in the service of these goals?\n\nEdit:\n\nTo give a current example, much of the protest surrounding the genocide and revolution in Gaza was dictated by an online diffusion of ideas. These were not protests born out of local populations of revolutionaries alone, but moved through the current of millions on social media that revolutionaries could then seize on. One might also think of the George Floyd protests, disseminated by the internet and used as an inflection point for New Afrikan self-determination (or Rodney King Riots through the television prior) Many of the resultant protests were reformist by design but do represent a real movement against a contradiction in the Amerika prison-house and are often underlooked in pursuit of mutual aid.",

Could the internet be transformed in such a way that renders it productive for proletarian organizing? Maybe. But by virtue of self-selection on the basis of language and free time, it would take quite a lot of work to establish such things, which is why I think referring to the internet (especially Reddit) as \u201cendemic forms of communication\u201d in the same way party newspapers and big character posters were misses the mark.

I will say that unlike the RMC and the RMS, the OCR in *Kites* (in its long four-part article *Spectre* and also in various other places) does not make the same mistake of referring to well-paid (or even \"low-paid\" compared to amerikan standards but nevertheless comfortably-living) workers as \"proletarian\", and at least pays lip service to the labor aristocracy thesis, also claiming the proletariat to be \"in the tens of millions\" and \"a minority\" of the population. They seem to be the only group other than MIM to even acknowledge this, even though their overall analysis of what is progressive and what isn't in the US and their strategy for revolution doesn't always take that into account. The summations of their mass work also indicate that they don't place any real meaning behind \"workplace organizing\" and see it as a dead end, preferring to instead organize in places like public housing and homeless camps/slums.\n\nAlso, with regards to terminology, OCR is quite explicitly not a \"mass org\" either in the Leninist sense or the Maoist sense.\n\nE: I also wouldn't call *Settlers's* labor-aristocracy thesis \"BLA line\"; I've read quite a few works from the BLA, and in addition to them having very little that could be referred to as \"line\" (due to being a conglomerate of Maoists, focoist-communists, and anarchists), they didn't place high emphasis on the economic aspect of the parasitism and reactionaryism of the white nation the same way Sakai did.",

It would probably be better to say \u201cthe Sakai line of the BLA\u201d but regardless the point is to remove it from the confines of book discussions or irony-laden appropriation for memes into the broader role this idea had in the history of the Amerikan left. In a perfect world, the history of the BLA is enough to make *Settlers* a central text in party building in Amerika alongside *What is to Be Done* or *On Practice*. That it was left to a dedicated minority of communists to rescue the work from obscurity is because nobody really wants to think about how the New Left failed.

To understand those political differences, interested readers can study the (N)CPC\u2019s Program and the OCR\u2019s Manifesto.\n\n\nEdit: for future reference the RMC is linked the *The Masses* publication; started as a split from the PSL. There's also the MCU (Maoist Communist Union) which is linked to RMS. The RSG (in fact it seems there are multiple RSGs) is the one that arose in the aftermath of the CR-CPUSA collapse that PH mentioned above. The CR-CPUSA was the Red Guards or a continuation of it. *New Labor Press* (NLP) and *New Day* are publications started by another splinter from the CR-CPUSA.

One particular expression of this capitulation is the small, cultish following around J Sakai\u2019s 1983 book Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat from Mayflower to Modern. Sakai\u2019s book presents a litany of real examples of how white workers have betrayed oppressed nations to make his case for their reactionary nature. The trouble with his method is that you can also find counter-examples where white workers joined with proletarians of oppressed nations and nationalities in class struggle against the bourgeoisie and in support of the liberation struggles of oppressed nations and nationalities. On balance, the former examples will be greater in number than the latter examples unless a revolutionary movement gains enough strength to challenge bourgeois rule, including the dominance of oppressor nations in multinational nation-states. Whatever Sakai\u2019s intent, the people who embrace the analysis of his book have adamantly rejected taking responsibility for building such a revolutionary movement.\n\n>Beyond just Sakai\u2019s readers, postmodernist Leftists in general have embraced the concept of \u201csettlers\u201d as an original sin narrative, treating the descendants of settlers like Christian fundamentalists treat humanity as irredeemably corrupted by Eve\u2019s eating of the apple. Whereas Christian fundamentalists offer corrupted humanity salvation in the afterlife so long as they repent for their sins, postmodernist Leftists offer themselves salvation with land acknowledgments, checking their privilege, and railing against settlers in the present-tense **(even if, by their internal logic, they themselves are settlers)**. They offer no salvation for the masses, including the Indigenous oppressed nations, because they insist, objectively but often also subjectively, that revolution is impossible given the scourge of settlers.\n\namerikan communists are never beating the chauvinist and social-fascist allegations.\n\ninterestingly, they can acknowledge the existence of white supremacy in Afrika, but I guess there's no white supremacy in *their* settler empire, oops, not a \"settler\" empire because:\n>after expelling the Indigenous population and establishing themselves on their land, especially over generations, they are no longer functionally settlers, but settled members of a new nation\n\nPathetic.",
