Do you know any good books that look at Mao\u2019s rule more objectively, focusing on the positives as well as the negatives, and the impact he had on China today?",

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this.

                    "body": "> A friend of this website who located the above volumes notes that the geographical scope of the work is from Ottoman Turkey to the Far East. And he adds: \u201cThere is no doubt that this book represents to a great extent many views at the end of the Stalinist era. I think that in addition to the historical value of this book, what is more valuable is how the Soviet Union viewed Tsarist Russia\u2019s role in history at that time. After careful study and comparison, I found that the book does contain a large number of passages that try to downplay or even beautify Tsarist Russia\u2019s aggression when it comes to Persia, Ottoman, Qing China, Mongolia, etc. The book even states that although Tsarist Russia\u2019s aggression in some areas was subjectively bad, it objectively promoted historical progress, etc. In addition, approaching Lenin\u2019s era, the book had to condemn and point out a large number of aggressive activities by Tsarist Russia. Despite this, the book repeatedly implies that Tsarist Russia\u2019s activities are \u2018more popular with locals\u2019 and \u2018less harmful\u2019... In addition, the concept of \u2018China\u2019 is simply equated with \u2018the dynasty established by the Han people and ruling the main part of China\u2019, which is also a major problem in the book. In this case, it is easy to draw a conclusion close to Han chauvinism - \u2018Only Han-oriented nations and things are Chinese.\u2019 In this way, the unique characteristics of China\u2019s ethnic minorities are obliterated. In any case, there are still too few works that reflect the systematic discussion of history during the Stalin era. Although this book has many problems (objectively reflecting the expansion of Great Russian nationalism during the Stalin era), it is still of good reference value.\u201d\n\nThis isn't the first time I've seen this website do anti-Stalinism. Where does this anti-Stalinist strand of \"Maoism\" come from?",
