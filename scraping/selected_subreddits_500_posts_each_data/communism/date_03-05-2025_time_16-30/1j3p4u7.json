    "selftext": "Since Engels published Family, Private Property and the State, the theory of \"man the hunter\" has been disproven. The basic idea that Engles relied on was that males hunted (providing most of the food), and women foraged and cared for the home (providing reproduction and supplemental food), and the tools for each belonged to each. As agriculture and herding evolved, they became the domain of the man and produced surplus, this lead to slaves, which where used in the mans line of work and became his. \n\nThe issue with this is that the idea that men were hunters, and women gathers, is not historically true, and often that foraging provided most of the food. If this is the case, what is the explanation for this system resulting in patrachy? ",

We know it is to pass down surplus property produced by agriculture and herding, but I don't see any basis for those being the domain of males exclusively, or domently. We know that in pre-class society males and females generally did not separate work by gender, so why would this surplus be the property mainly of men, why would it need mothertight to be overthrown to pass it on?",

He therefore also owned the instruments of labor, and in the event of husband and wife separating, he took them with him, just as she retained her household goods. Therefore, according to the social custom of the time, the man was also the owner of the new source of subsistence, the cattle, and later of the new instruments of labor, the slaves. **But according to the custom of the same society, his children could not inherit from him.**\n\n...\n\n>Thus, on the one hand, in proportion as wealth increased, it made the man\u2019s position in the family more important than the woman\u2019s, and on the other hand created an impulse to exploit this strengthened position in order to overthrow, in favor of his children, the traditional order of inheritance.\n\nI don't believe your last sentence is entirely accurate to what Engels wrote in Origins of the Family, is that not idealist?",

Your post claims it is religion. We are talking about patriarchy; there were separate familial groupings under mother-right/maternal law. Separate familial groupings are not exclusive to patriarchy. Engels goes over this in the first several chapters of origins.",
