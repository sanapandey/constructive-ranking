You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most (American) teachers only know the barest anti-communism, so once you begin speaking on the details they don't really know how to respond, which other students usually found amusing.",

But that depends on circumstances (for example are you doing clandestine work as a communist and have to outwardly hide your views as an individual? Then it's stupid and dangerous. Are you tasked by a communist organisation to recruit among the youth in your school? Then it's great. Are you just doing it just cos, without putting anyone at risk? Then why not.) But I don't think there's anything to regret. At the end of the day I really meant it's funny, not silly. Mostly because I'm imagining the looks on people's faces.

You know your friend better so perhaps it's a worthwhile endeavour to try to educate them, but I also wonder why you specifically want to focus on Hoxha? Are you a Hoxhaist? That's fine if you are, it's just not obvious to me why Hoxha over say Lenin, Stalin or Mao.",

So when you read about Hoxha read about him in the context of his steadfast rejection of Titoite revisionism, his prescient rejection of Khrushchev (coming round to the view earlier than Mao), his ultimate coalition with Mao, and later his incorrect rejection of Mao and the lessons the Chinese revolution after Mao's death. Hoxha was overall a great socialist leader, one of the best, but veered in the wrong direction and made errors (the extent of which is debated among Maoists) in the last ten years of his life or so. Despite this Albanian socialism achieved many and impressive things.",
