That being said them doing this interview and pissing off a bunch of Dengites is pretty cool.\n\n\nWhat made me curious was that in the comments I found a Cypriot \"geopolitics expert\" who recently spoke at an anti Zionist / pro Palestine action. She calls herself an \"anti imperialist Marxist\" in her bio. Her profile shows she's a typical, filthy \"multipolarity\" reactionary. Her top level comment:\n\n\n> @elina.xenophontos This is a very poorly formulated analysis by the so-called communist party of India. First of all, it fails to analyse China's policy via the lens of actual imperialist theory, one that is rooted in the TRPF. The very cause of imperialism is to counter capitalism TRPF by expanding outward, and creating global inequalities for the purpose of exploitation. One example of said inequality is the requisite to sustain the global south underdeveloped, and presentation of industrialisation for the purpose of monopolising capital. This is intact what we are seeing play out in Africa. China on the other is promoting industrialisation, that is a pre-requisite for socialism and the elimination of the sort of global inequality that facilitates imperialism. This is typical ostentatious level politics by parties that have a surface level understanding of imperialism. Very sad.\n\n\nAnd she wrote a bunch more crap in the thread below her comment. It's unfortunate we have these kind of people given a platform at anti Zionist rallies and this probably says something about the anti Zionist movement here.",

These two great Marxist teachers conducted a class analysis of Indian society and laid down the political strategy for the Indian New Democratic Revolution.\n\nThere is some implicit historical revisionism here. The MCC was formed in opposition to the erstwhile CPI ML. Kanhai Chatterjee had correctly recognized CM's left adventurist line (which itself emerged as a reaction to the CPI/CPM's revisionism) and had advocated for a mass line from the beginning. However, the MCC initially did not have as much of a historical impact as the CPI ML. \n\nComrade Amrut admits as much here:\n\n>You have brought up the past practices of our party which upheld the left adventurist line of annihilation of the class enemy as the only path to success in the Indian agrarian revolution. We have already rectified that wrong practice. \n\nThis historical revisionism is not only understandable but also necessary I believe from the perspective of the merger of the parties in 2004. \n\nI am also disappointed that there were no talks of the urban situation as the party's influence seems to be non-existent there.",

The idea that Naxalites do not have an urban presence has always been a revisionist argument to push the idea that they are \"cut from the masses.\" From films to news articles, this is the propaganda. But the Indian state, unlike so-called Marxists who quickly buy into all this, is no fool and has actively released research work highlighting the potential urban work of the Maoists. Since Naxalbari, the Maoists have had a good connection between urban and rural, lest we forget that it was Presidency College in Kolkata where every day CPI-ML declarations were found plastered across the walls of the college prior to the urban guerrilla squads that roamed that city until 1975. Or the Jehanabad jail break in 2005 where the entire city was taken over by the Maoists to hunt down the fascist landlord militia Ranvir Sena and release political prisoners, with cooperation from the local population, to the point that the police officially said that all the people of the city were \"terrorists.\" Somehow, it is lost on people that when they go to Hyderabad of all places, in the middle of a regularized slum, there is a huge martyr's memorial for killed Maoists which is maintained by the locals, who, like everyone else from the area, can tell people that the entire slum was set up by the Maoists after grabbing land from landlords as part of a movement to provide living space to workers in the city. All of this does not happen in a situation of \"non-existence.\"",

            "body": "I especially liked the short summary on how the Indian State has gone out of its way to commit atrocities against the CPI (M) and the territories the CPI (M) has subsumed in its protracted people's struggle, not the atrocities part obviously-the empirical information presented I mean. The CPI (M) also explain how they have organized their committees in the regions they have secured from security forces like for example:\n\n>As per the above-mentioned strategy followed by our party for making revolution, we start from the interior tribal areas, extend to the plain areas forming organs of people\u2019s state power, and finally seize power in cities of the enemy\u2019s stronghold. The tribal society is feudal, where the head of the village has the say. With the changes brought through the revolutionary movement, the village heads no longer have power. The local party committee, comprised of poor and middle-class peasants, leads the village. In the plain areas, the society is mainly Brahmanic Hindutva with a minority of other religions.\n\n>The ruling exploitive government speaks a lot about people\u2019s welfare but does nothing. The peasants lack minimum requirements for farming such as irrigation, seeds, and agricultural implements. The revolutionary people\u2019s committees look after the needs of the peasants and focus on raising the yield. The exploitive government is not in the least bothered to run schools and hospitals for tribal people. The revolutionary people\u2019s committees are running local schools. Every local government has a medical department and a doctor. The concerned party committee has a budget for schools run by the revolutionary people\u2019s committees. The doctors from PLGA impart training to the revolutionary people\u2019s committee doctors. The cottage industry department is yet to become active so as to help the people in selling the forest produce and purchasing daily needs in the market.\n\n>We are working against a semi-colonial, semi-feudal, strong state that is backed by imperialists. As per our strategy, we build revolutionary people\u2019s committees wherever we succeed in bringing down the exploitive government. We thus build area-wide organs of state power, gradually extending and strengthening them. The guerrilla bases are enduring even amidst a lot of massacres, killings of leaders and activists of party committees, militias, revolutionary people\u2019s committees, and sexual atrocities on women. We now hold power on a very small level. So, there are limitations to the development activities that we take up.\n\nPretty cool! \n\nThere is one thing Amrut mentions and it's the question of China being Social Imperialist, that is to say Amrut and in turn the CPI (M) as a whole sees China in this respect. Amrut himself goes out of his way to state:\n\n>I want to emphasize that US imperialism remains the primary enemy of the oppressed people and nations. But that in no way means that social-imperialist China and other imperialist countries should not be fully opposed. The ruling class of China has kept busy with the propaganda of \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d which is nothing but imperialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nWhen pressed for more information on why China is Social Imperialist, Amrut refers to the [2017 paper written by the Central Committee of the CPI (M)](https://www.bannedthought.net/India/CPI-Maoist-Docs/Books/China-Social-Imperialism-CPI-Maoist-2021-Eng-view.pdf) alongside his following assessment:\n\n>China is therefore neither a socialist nor communist country. It is a social-imperialist country. The facts that shows this are that monopoly capitalism and financial oligarchy are on the rise. Capital is accumulated in a big way. Finance capital rules. China is investing capital in almost all parts of the world. It is contending with the US for world hegemony. It is leading alliances such as the Shanghai Cooperation and BRICS, together with Russia, in its attempt to redivide the world to exploit raw materials and markets.\n\nPersonally on my end, I feel a bit angsty whenever any self-described Communist here in the U.S. calls China social imperialist because when pressed on their end, they end up forming criticisms where the basis of such falls back to vomiting CIA propaganda or just general news outrage against the latest social crime China has reportedly committed (think back to how quickly the media freaks focused on the Palestinian Genocide waxxing poetics about Isr\\*eli restraint versus them lambasting China over the very real, [totally not exaggerated Ughyur 'Genocide'](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/lsaet8/a_masterpost_of_sources_for_debunking_xinjiang/)). So when the CPI (Maoists) talk about China's Social Imperialism, you bet your ass that hundreds of revisionist freaks are going to quote the CPI (M) for their China is social imperialist statement. \n\nThen again, the CPI (M) are not in the same position as western communists to practice the same revisionism (dengism honestly), partly because-hey, we're not actively fighting a protracted people's war against Indian state fascists with iphones and drones. What does that tell you about the CPI (M)'s entire existence, idk.\n\nBut this personal note is a lazy assessment of my own, so I welcome verbal lashings of a thousand-fold. Also, someone already did make a criticism of the 2017 document six years ago in:\n\n*continue...*",

The former being that as a result of its anecdotal evidence-it argues that there are over 50 million foreign, private companies operating in China but by the time of Rong's post in 2016-it was only a little over 800k foreign, private companies according to the official PRC's Ministry of Commerce. The latter being that the main crux of the 2017 document for the claim that China is Social Imperialist is, according to u/Comrade_Zou_Rong:\n\n>The idea here is clear: if you call yourself a socialist country, and participate in international trade, you are in league with the \"imperialist world market\" and are just another inseparable cog in the imperialist machine.\n\n>This sort of \"analysis\" is common amongst Western communist groups. Apparently, it is forbidden by some unquestionable doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, but yet this doctrine is never substantiated in any form, nor is there ever any appeal to authority in the form of Marx or Lenin.\n\nRong then quotes Lenin from *Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks (1920)* \\[[2](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/nov/21.htm)\\] to criticize the CPI (M) as having almost exactly the same position an imperialist labor aristocrat held against the existence of the USSR years ago-then Rong ends their post with this section that since it was six years ago, I want people to look over on this section to see if it still holds up:\n\n>One has to question exactly what it is the CPI-Maoist has actually done in their 'relentless striving' against imperialism. The formation of the CPI-Maoist has its roots in a rebellion in the Naxalbari region of West Bengal. Hence why they are often labeled Naxalites. Shortly after their formation, they had a real test for how they would choose to 'relentlessly' deal with imperialism, one experienced by the people who speak their same language, against the state of Pakistan. I'm of course referring to the Bangladesh Liberation War, something the ideological fathers of the CPI-Maoist denounced as \"Soviet Social-Imperialism.\"\u00a0*And it was their own people dying in the hundreds of thousands to the murderous Pakistani state, supported by American weapons.*\n\n>Beyond this, there is a confessional tone running throughout the document. Maoism in India, it seems, is just as much a religion as it is in the West, and hence there can be no question of certain assumptions. For instance, it is obvious to many observers that Marxism-Leninism in the oppressed nations of the world is an expression of nationalism. The nationalists of the oppressed nations are by default anti-imperialists, and gravitate to the most anti-imperialist ideas they can find. This has been (up to the last few decades) Marxism-Leninism. Before Mao called himself a communist, he was a young man that signed up for the army during the 1911 Xinhai anti-Qing revolution. Could national chauvinism have played any part in China's war against India in 1962? This is a fair question to consider for people who are not dogmatists, but those with a confessional faith about Mao's China could never let themselves entertain that possibility. Nehru also saw himself as 'relentlessly striving' against imperialism, but that didn't stop the CCP from embarrassing his government in front the world.\n\nRong then gets into a mini polemic with the reddit account for MIM Prisons u/mimprisons, and that is that.",

I've also spoken to many former and/or present \"members\" of their \"collective\" (I won't clarify said members' status so as not to expose anyone). I know for a fact accusations of alt accounts were levied against them quite often but it was actually often not true. There _were_ alt accounts since subs or Reddit itself kept banning them but not as many as accused. I'll tell you this, in all my years I've been familiar with AB's posting his English has never been that good, he makes very distinctive spelling mistakes at minimum. So I'm 100% sure it's not an AB account. But idk if it's a u/some_random_commie alt (I'm actually not familiar with this person at all).\n\n\nEdit: my point u/supercooper25 is that it's not an \"insidious plot\" by only a couple nazis with alt accounts, it's a broader phenomenon \u2014 there really are that many revisionists who have gone full nazi.",
