    "selftext": "Disclaimer: After typing the description below, I think I would come to the conclusion that it really doesn't matter what the internal state of the individual is. The \"kill or be killed\" aspect of Capitalism will simply filter out or train the capitalist to do what has to be done. But I would be very much interested by what others have in mind. \n\nSome clarifications: by sociopaths I mean a type of individual who is comfortable with laying off thousands of workers and starving their families in order to save the bottom line. The type of individual who is comfortable with hording billions in Capital which can be used to save the lives of many and blocking the access of the masses of people to the means of production or finished commodities which he/she owns, which can certainly be consumed by the masses to live their lives.\n\nBy corrupt I mean: force the \"decent person\" to become a typical capitalist; to act in a way that maximizes the absolute or relative surplus-value produced by the worker at all costs in order to stay competitive amongst other firms. \n\nBy corrupt I also am hinting at the appropriation of the humanity of the capitalist by Capitalism. In other words, no matter what good intentions the Capitalist has for setting up production, he/she will be forced in a cycle of exploitation of labour and appropriation of the fruits of that labour to no apparent end. I am talking here about the person who thinks making millions of dollars as a capitalist will then allow them to use that money to help others be it by building a library, hospital, infrastructure, schools, eradication of diseases, and etc without expecting any monetary return or recovery from said \"charitable\" acts.

Practically, it needs to be understood that the material reproduction of the class position of a bourgeois produces, in their mind, a contradiction between the necessity of grasping their material conditions of existence and their inability to understand them in a scientific manner. This contradiction is resolved through the generation of a world-outlook (including class ideology, which entails class morality) whose features are particularly molded by their social being, and which functions to reproduce that social being: bourgeois ideology, including that which serves to justify extreme exploitation and genocide, is not a \"sociopathic\" abberation, but an inevitable mental product of the bourgeoisie's material existence as personification of capital.\n\nThis contradiction is actually the driving force for the generation of all class ideology (before the socialist mode of production, in which the proletariat and revolutionary classes begin to consciously develop a scientific world-outlook), with their qualitative (with regards to difference in the class-being it expresses), and quantitative (with regards to the local social contradictions of its emergence, which alters its form) differences among humans being a product of the individual consciousness existing in differing material conditions. There is no such thing as a \"normal\" world-outlook or \"normal\" morality; these things are always the products of one's social being/class position and historically situated, not \"innate\".",

Far from a denguist position.\n\n\"What is \"world-systems political economy\" and how does it prevent the sudden end of any kind of state? Was the overthrow of the tsarist state in Russia by the Bolsheviks not a sudden end of the former state?\"\n\nYes it was. what i mean by \"world-systems\" is what people would label vaguely authors like cope. Production is entangled together and issues arise from idealist breaks like libertarians suggest. A proletarian state centralized planned economy is possible, as USSR and China shown, but, to consider you can just go stateless worldwide in a series of revolutions (or as some anarchists suggest, insurrections starting in the first-world and spreading around the whole planet) without developing socialist relations and mode of production and a socialist state first is a misconception.\n\nThese kinds of proposals would never collapse capitalist relations of production worldwide and it would never even collapse existing internal capitalist relations, due to never fundamentally breaking away from them and the external impositions of labour exploitation in the first place, if we consider the third-world as the place where these revolution emerge. What they would likely make emerge is small petty-bourgeois micro-states locally, and, in settler societies, a form of petty-bourgeois race tyranny, which would have potential to be worse than what we have today.\n\n\"Is the commodity form itself not a part of the relations of production? The product of labor is not inherently a commodity after all, but rather it is the specific social relations under which production takes place that turns the product of labor into a commodity.

The relations of production were not capitalist in a whole view, but socialist, and there was no exploitation of labour, two factors that are central to capitalism. \n\n\"The reason Marx starts Capital with an investigation of the commodity form is precisely because commodity production and exchange is the basis of \u2013 and reproduces \u2013 bourgeois society\"\n\nWhat i mean is that the commodity exchange and circulation do not manifest mechanistically the entirety of what constitutes the capitalist mode of production, and that they may, as in the case of the USSR, be a remaint of capitalism that do not constitute capitalism. The scale of how many \"goods\" circulated outside of commodity-form and were interacted by subjects in use-value is always radically underestimated by these libertarians. If we think about trotskysts, even being trotskysts, usualy, do not dare to say USSR before kruschev was capitalist.\n\n\"As written, your comment (particularly the second paragraph) reads to me as, ultimately, a defence of commodity production, which ironically would be the same kind of petty-bourgeois \"socialism\" which Marx criticized Proudhon for.\"\n\nI do not endorse such views. Commodity production and circulation must eventually end. Proudhon even argued for credit systems and for dialectics of class conciliation and of non-contradiction instead of contradictions. That only can reemerge and reproduce markets.\n\nSorry for misunderstandings.",
