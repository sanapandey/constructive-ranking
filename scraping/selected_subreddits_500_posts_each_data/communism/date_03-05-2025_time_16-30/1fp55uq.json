Unfortunately, I don't have friends to talk to about this and it's a little difficult for me to get informed, I would really like to change things and feel that I have knowledge and ideas to defend. I already have quite a few but I would like a thought that could materialize in reality, I am reading Marx's Communist Manifesto (yes I am really at the beginning) and I was wondering, democracy, in our historical period, how could it change? And how could we create a truly functional system that gives respect to workers? My question is different from \"how could communism be applied\" my question is more like, how could we find a meeting point between communism and the current \"democracy\" which seems more like an oligarchy.

You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Except in some countries.\u00a0\n\n\nThere is no \"meeting point\" or \"compromise\" between current Bourgeois Democracy and Proletarian Democracy. One is built by and for to the exploiting class of Capitalist society to continue exploitation and the other is built by the Exploited class for it's own liberation and destruction of class society all together.\n\n\nThe examples of Proletarian Democracy mainly come from the USSR and the PRC, before their respective Counter Revolutions. i don't know much of anything about Proletarian Democracy in China so i cannot comment on it but I can give recourses on the form of Proletarian Democracy in the USSR(called Soviet Democracy).\n\n\nThe Soviets and ourselves Two Commonwealths By K. E. Holme This is a short but interesting pamphlet by an Idealistic liberal from Britain before the end of WW2 https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.247783/mode/1up\n\n\nSoviet Democracy by Pat Sloan https://mltheory.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/pat-sloan-soviet-democracy-victor-gollancz-1937.pdf\n\n\nUSSR 1936 constitution https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1936/12/05.htm\n\n\n> I already have quite a few but I would like a thought that could materialize in reality, I am reading Marx's Communist Manifesto (yes I am really at the beginning) and I was wondering, democracy, in our historical period, how could it change?\n\n\nHonestly I think that read some more Theory Such as Lenins \"State and Revolution\" might be a bit better as it teaches you more about Communism and the State which better teaches you about democracy as a function of the State and tied to class society.",

Instead of the representative democracy, China preferred a direct democracy through the direct action and publications by the mass, within the mass line created by Mao.\nOne of the millstone for Chinese Proletarian democracy is the Shanghai People's Commune founded in 1967 in the domestic wave for rebellion. Mao later introduced a revised version of it known as the Revolutionary Committee insitution, propped by three components of the masses, the Party and the militia, as a compromise with bureaucrats and army leaders in support for the struggle against revisionism.\n\nChina has its achievement also in industrial democracy, known as Angang Constitution\uff08\u978d\u94a2\u5baa\u6cd5\uff09, following the principle of the collaboration between forefront workers, technical managers and Party members, where the decision is made with joint democratic agreement and managers go to the front posts of workers in case for the born of new bourgeois.(There's a wiki page for detailed illustration for it https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angang_Constitution)\n\nAnd of course, such proletarian democracy is based on the secure proletarian dictatorship.That's why in the new constitution of China in 1978 when revisionists seized the power those gains all faded away.",

My favorite phrase that composes the whole meaning of the book is \"Democracy in capitalism is the same as democracy in ancient Greece, democracy for the slave owners\".

Hope that helped, but still, the book is very interesting and solves a lot of questions about Marxism and it's practise, just like every Lenin book, article or brochure.",

Certainly not in the US, where true democracy breaks down the minute 'representative democracy' is introduced. If the 'one man one vote' method is negated, you're on to something other than democracy. \n\nThe real problem lies not in implementing 1M1V, but how to make it the 'law of the land'. For this, the Party in question needs a solid governmental majority- enough to push through the change and get it approved- and stay in power long enough to see it through. In terms of the US, we're probably looking at the prospect of having to repeal/replace certain Constitutional Amendments. \n\nOf course, the issue of implementing democratic change is considerably easier if the present governmental system is moved aside as a whole and replaced with a fully-functioning 'government-in-waiting'. As an example of this, in pre-war Germany the NSDAP was organized to mirror the civil government structure; the NS had its own city councils, water works commissioners, mass transit managers, etc all the way up the line who mirrored the functions of their civil counterparts. When the NS took power, they simply moved the civil managers aside and took their places. In this way the 'new bosses' were able to take over without a noticeable break in services. If the NSDAP can do this, we can too.\n\nWhat you're asking can and should be done- for our part, it is our task to make our plans and work those plans until we reach our goals. ***The world is ours- but only if we have the will to take it.***",

So even if a given country has mass participation in the political system on a level unheard of in liberal democracy, if the bourgeoisie is not given free reign to dominate the system and bend it to their own interests, then that system will be labeled undemocratic, authoritarian, etc. That propaganda campaign has been going on at least since the late 1940s and forms the basis of US imperial ideology, which rationalizes interventions that serve the interests of capital in the imperial core, including the overthrow of democratically elected governments, as in service to an abstract concept of \"freedom.\" The trick is that as long as \"freedom\" remains an abstract ideal, nobody stops to ask *whose* freedom we're actually talking about.\n\nThe bitter truth, for those coming from a liberal perspective, is that values-neutral governance is a fantasy. \"Freedom\" and \"democracy\" aren't abstractions that you can apply equally to the working and the capitalist classes, since the capitalist classes already enjoy enormous power over the system. Communists pretty much all agree that universal suffrage and participation are good in theory and worth working towards, but (and here's where communist ideas rub liberals the wrong way) the rights of the capitalists will need to be strictly limited until they no longer exist as a force able to distort the political system to their advantage. The other thing that rankles from a liberal perspective is that, if you want to succeed in any revolutionary aims, you can't just allow people to vote for an end to the revolution and a reversal of its accomplishments, since remnants of the old power structure will be well positioned to do just that.\n\nSo in fact there's nothing inherently undemocratic about a communist state doing its best to develop socialism/communism, but such a state will have to approach the building of democratic institutions differently from the values-neutral governance that liberalism insists is the most fair and democratic, but which actually obscures the domination of capital. It's rather like how people will say affirmative action is unfair because they choose not to see the biases and distortions inherent in the system that the affirmative action is trying to correct for.",
