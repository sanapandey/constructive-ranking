    "selftext": "The Lebanese Communist Party condemns in the strongest terms the brutal and cowardly crime committed by the Zionist enemy in assassinating the Secretary-General of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. He was a prominent figure who played a significant role in political life and resistance against the Zionist enemy, supporting the Palestinian cause, whether in liberating Lebanon from Zionist occupation, the July War, or in the battle of support for Gaza and Palestine and its resistance fighters.\n\nThe Lebanese Communist Party expresses its great solidarity and sympathy with Hezbollah, its leadership, cadres, fighters, and all its supporters. It affirms that the blood of the martyr fighters will not be wasted, as it will rebound on the Zionist fascists, liberating Lebanon and Palestine and toppling the normalization regimes and their protectors, the United States of America, which supervised this crime.\n\nThe Lebanese Communist Party extends its sincerest and warmest condolences to the leadership of Hezbollah, his family, and his supporters. Victory has been and will remain the ally of the oppressed peoples.\n\nBeirut, 28-9-2024\n\nThe Lebanese Communist Party\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/share/p/8SFCaDSSr3eYZyZA/?mibextid=oFDknk",

Its worth bringing up and criticizing regardless. On the other hand the LCP isn't CPGB-ML, their is a real history of armed struggle against both Phalangist paramilitary terrorist groups as well as direct conflict with the Zionist entity during the July War.\u00a0",

Hence my questions. Sounds like it would be worth for people not familiar with the old and recent history to investigate further because fighting the Phalangists and IOF is good but there are some bad signs too, namely the signing of the WAP document as we have agreed and the fact I haven't seen or heard anything about anti revisionism with regards to the party.",

Beyond that I dont know what you mean by \"support\", the communist party\u00a0doesn't\u00a0subordinate itself to Hizbullah's command structure or share in its underlying postmodern ideology.",

Perhaps this displays an inability on my part to determine Hezbollah\u2019s ideology from their history and statements, or perhaps I don\u2019t have a good grasp on postmodernism itself, but this is an interesting description that doesn\u2019t immediately make sense to me.",
