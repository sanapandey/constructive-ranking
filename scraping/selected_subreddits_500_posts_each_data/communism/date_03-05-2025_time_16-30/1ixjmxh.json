You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-Marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to Marxism. Try /r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or Marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them.

            "body": ">The suspension of funds coincides with the widespread layoffs and civil bureaucracy reorganization, reflecting the worsening crisis in US politics. The Trump regime has been pushing this suspension with the aim of giving his clique control over the entire bureaucracy and reorganizing the budget to serve its own oligarchic interests and ultra-conservative agenda.\n\nIs this meant to explain why USAID was shut down? I don't understand it. The article already goes into detail about how USAID was simply a method of U.$. imperialism, but if it was already such an effective tool of the U.$. state, why would Trump shut it down just to save a measly $30 billion (at least compared to the defense budget)? How is it not serving the purpose he wants it to? Why didn't he shut it down during his previous presidency?",

                            "body": "The important thing to note about Amerikan imperialism is that the quantity and size of its internal colonies means that shifts in surplus value extraction or national oppression can sometimes be observed more easily internally.\n\nThe neoliberal order subsisted off of a powerful and select group of compradors which Euro-Amerika rose out of their oppressed nations to promote a \u201cmulticultural\u201d white supremacy based around integration and assimilation rather than segregation. While this obviously wasn\u2019t accomplished, it did produce a certain syncretic petty-bourgeois settler ideology that presents national struggle as an issue of disharmony to be solved with placation and rhetorical (though not material) concessions. This is why the argument for the continued existence of New Afrika and Aztlan is so central to anti-revisionism\u2014 claiming some abolition of the prison-house occurred at the end of Jim Crow is a founding myth of modern Euro-Amerikan ideology and its continued infiltration into revisionist communism is thus inevitable.\n\nOf course, economically speaking this was always false. Wealth inequality between Euro-Amerikans and their oppressed nations is currently worse than it was half a century ago and shows no sign of slowing. This was precipitated by the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which foreclosed one of the most prominent buy-ins for compradors in subprime mortgages and nothing came in to take its place. However, this relationship was fragile from the start, in part due to the economics (the \u201cmulticultural\u201d facade was only possible in the first place because of the global profits from China\u2019s privatization through to the commodities boom) but also the history of national struggle in the prison-house which had precipitated rapidly under Jim Crow.*\n\nNow, however, we see this deteriorate in nearly all facets. Affirmative action and other diversity initiatives, for example, are being dissolved while the systems for national oppression get similarly weaker. USAID was one wing of this internationally, but we should be clear that the stripping of this department is about its obsolescence more than it is about Trump being some accidental anti-imperialist or whatever. I suspect we\u2019ll see more direct arms sales like what occurred in Ukraine or I$rael as a carrot with the sanctions/tariffs regime being the stick.\n\n\n*Of course we should not confuse this shift with any significant change in actual national oppression that did occur. The cost of this comprador buy-in was the otherwise devastation of these nations\u2019 economic base, ghettoization of its communities, and mass incarceration of its workforce until entire populations are dependent on government aid.",

At a surface level we can expect that restructuring to involve the cutting of programs that signal liberal values like programs that might have actually done a little bit of good for a small number of people in various places, at a more fundamental level I expect the goal of the restructuring to be to refine the core function of USAID which is to subvert foreign governments and expand the sphere of influence for the US government and US corporations in the \u2018civil societies\u2019 (the realm of businesses and NGOs) of foreign countries.\n\nWhether the US is being ruled by a \u2018Democratic\u2019 or a \u2018Republican\u2019 regime it will have fundamentally the same foreign policy orientation: aggressive, chauvinistic, imperialistic. The goals of world domination remain the same. But there will be tactical and even strategic differences, and USAID will be restructured to serve the vision of the Trump regime. So far it looks like they are just taking off the gloves, no more liberal decoration, straight up subversion and domination via USAID. Trump will also want to purge USAID of people who might be disloyal to him, e.g. people who buy into the Russiagate stuff, who want to fight Russia more than China, who are driven by ideological factors that may be fundamentally imperialist but are insufficiently compatible (eg too \u2018liberal) with Trump\u2019s own vision. USAID is being reigned in and brought directly under the State Department - Rubio is in charge now.\n\nTrump\u2019s second term definitely seems like it is going to be different from his first, which is not unusual for US presidents. For example. Cheney practically ran Bush II\u2019s first term but by the end of the second term W seemed to be making the decisions. I guess there is a learning curve involved, like anything - it certainly involves working with a very complex set of organizations that all seek to maintain a degree of institutional autonomy. Maybe Trump feels like he understands things well enough to start smashing in a more aggressive but perhaps simultaneously more cohesive pattern than last time.\n\nIt is all very scary, but one can be hopeful that this accelerates the demise of the US Empire in a way that looks more like an internal collapse rather than a global existential conflagration.",
