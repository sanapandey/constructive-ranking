            "body": "\n*** \n\nModerating takes time. You can help us out by reporting any comments or submissions that don't follow these rules:\n\n1. **No non-marxists** - This subreddit isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism. Try r/DebateCommunism for that. If you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. **No oppressive language** - Speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned. TERF is not a slur.\n\n3. **No low quality or off-topic posts** - Posts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed. This includes linking to posts on other subreddits. This is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on reddit or anywhere else. This includes memes and circlejerking. This includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found. We ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn\u2019t care that much.\n\n4. **No basic questions about Marxism** - Posts asking entry-level questions will be removed. Questions like \u201cWhat is Maoism?\u201d or \u201cWhy do Stalinists believe what they do?\u201d will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. We ask that posters please submit these questions to /r/communism101.\n\n5. **No sectarianism** - Marxists of all tendencies are welcome here. Refrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable. If criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis. The goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\n6. **No trolling** - Report trolls and do not engage with them. We've mistakenly banned users due to this. If you wish to argue with fascists, you can may readily find them in every other subreddit on this website.\n\n7. **No chauvinism or settler apologism** -  Non-negotiable: https://readsettlers.org/\n\n8. **No tone-policing** -  https://old.reddit.com/r/communism101/comments/12sblev/an_amendment_to_the_rules_of_rcommunism101/\n\n***\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/communism) if you have any questions or concerns.*",

Between passages applauding (and calling for more) SEZs, insisting on heightened crackdowns on crime, advocating bald-faced economism, parading the superiority of \u201cexperts\u201d (who Deng insists are workers too, mind you), and pushing for heavy-handed capitalist labor discipline, you\u2019ll begin to wonder why the fuck anyone who cares about socialism/communism would like the guy.",

Markets, stock exchange and socialism are compatible. Why? Because they are, actually!\n\nAlso, as a side note, if you read this randomly selected quotation from Gorbachev, it all reads like the latest edition of Qiushi or Xi Jinping, with vague, brightly articulated lip-services and milquetoast socialist vocabulary while saying nothing concrete about class struggle or revolution. \n\n[https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/publications/soviet-news/1990/sovietnews\\_6523\\_0490.pdf](https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/publications/soviet-news/1990/sovietnews_6523_0490.pdf)\n\nOr let's compare Gorbachev's empty phrases of ,,law-governed state with political pluralism\", and Xi's recent speeches about socialist rule of law, a highly competitive market with institutional guarantees and what's basically encouraging bourgeois ideas in policy making. \n\n[http://en.qstheory.cn/2021-11/15/c\\_681256.htm](http://en.qstheory.cn/2021-11/15/c_681256.htm)\n\n[http://en.qstheory.cn/2023-01/17/c\\_848591.htm](http://en.qstheory.cn/2023-01/17/c_848591.htm)",
