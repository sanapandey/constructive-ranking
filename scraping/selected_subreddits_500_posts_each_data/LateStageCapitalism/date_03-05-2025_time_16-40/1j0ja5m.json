America is in rapid decline and is losing its influence all across Europe. It's resorting to desperation tactics like this bullying and coercion to try to cling to what little power it has left.",

Basically, all of the ways US propaganda works - the \"great man\" analysis, a refusal to see the realistic goals and security concerns of countries besides the US, and thinking history begins where it is most convenient for the most amount of outrage towards the enemies of the US. \n\nThere is nothing in the video posted that is false. Shutting out reality and calling it pro-Putin rhetoric is an insane and delusional way of seeing the world. Perhaps the video assumes a certain level of literacy on the subject, so the things said might be shocking or suspicious because they are so different than the false-consciousness of western media. \n\n[Watch \"Ukraine on Fire\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwZApPCFXIc)\n\n  \n[The infamous John Mearsheimer video: Why is Ukraine the West's Fault? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrMiSQAGOS4)  \n\n\n[Lindsey Graham And John McCain In Ukraine promising Azov Nazis to help them defeat Russia in 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ4e1A-LZEA)\n\n[This recent episode of Chapo Trap House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TesNV5Y5S3U)",

But the paternalistic rhetoric you're using about Russia needing to figure out its democracy before they get any privilege of self determination is exactly the same rhetoric the US employed to justify destabilizing Cuba, Chile, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Congo, Iran, Iraq, Vietnam, etc. It's like you don't even hear the tone of ethnic superiority in implying that the West is the side of righteousness against evil Russia.",
