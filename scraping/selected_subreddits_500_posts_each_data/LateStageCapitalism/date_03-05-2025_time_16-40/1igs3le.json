You can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nIf you want to have people immigrate legally and then have to pay them American wages/benefits which companies are obviously trying to avoid by hiring undocumented folks, while also having a worker shortage bc of how long it takes to legally immigrate, prices of food is gonna skyrocket bc they won\u2019t have people doing the work in the meantime. \n\nAs it currently stands the US is using them as cheap labor in poor conditions that wouldn\u2019t be tolerated by you, who seems so eager to volunteer for their jobs. However, like I said, when anyone on the left says \u201chey pay people more\u201d yall cry communism.

There isn\u2019t exactly a line of Americans ready to do farm work. This has been seen historically, too. Americans won\u2019t do the work that they\u2019re currently doing and that we rely on for food so yes, we should force companies to pay their employees more (look at the times American working class families were doing the best, it was also when corporate taxes and income taxes on highest brackets were the highest). Glad we\u2019re on the same page. Forcing companies to maximize shareholder value above all else is the stupidest concept from a long term perspective. \n\nTrump\u2019s solution is to put them in labor camps to do the work for free while enriching the private prison industry, so get out of here with the \u201coh I care about them\u201d bullshit.",

The tariffs are a submission move to exercise/consolidate power. \n\nThe point at the heart of this discussion is that Trump does, in fact, think that he got what he wanted. But everyone else can see that, while Mexico was supposed to end up looking weak/browbeaten from this, they're ALREADY making Trump backpedal. He thinks he looks good, but other countries will realize the opposite - classic Trump dumbassery. \n\nSo, yes, he got what he wanted. It doesn't look good for us, it's not good for the US, and Mexico's move is both hilarious and it just makes us look dumber. It went from \"US power move\" to whatever we're on now.",
