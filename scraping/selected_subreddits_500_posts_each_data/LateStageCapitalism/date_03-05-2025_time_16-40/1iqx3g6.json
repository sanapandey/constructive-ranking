    "selftext": "\nIsraeli occupation forces storm a wedding in Hebron and detain the groom\n\nIn a new escalation of its aggressions in the West Bank, Israeli occupation forces stormed a wedding in the city of Hebron, southern West Bank, on the evening of Friday, February 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to the official Palestinian news agency \"Wafa,\" Israeli forces raided the wedding hall, causing panic among attendees, especially women and children.\n\nDuring the raid, the forces detained the groom, a member of the Abu Turki family, along with several other participants for nearly an hour before releasing them.\n\nVideos circulating on social media show Israeli soldiers vandalizing several cars parked near the wedding hall.\n\nThe reasons behind this raid and the detentions remain unknown.\n\nThis incident comes amid an ongoing Israeli military siege on the city and refugee camp of Tulkarm for the sixth consecutive day, leading to widespread destruction of property and infrastructure and the forced displacement of dozens of families.\n\nAdditionally, Israeli forces have continued their military operations in Jenin and its refugee camp for the twelfth consecutive day.\n\nSince October 7, 2023, Israel has escalated its military operations in the West Bank, including occupied Jerusalem, resulting in the martyrdom of 894 Palestinians, the injury of approximately 6,700 others, and the arrest of 14,300, according to official Palestinian sources.\n\nThis ongoing Israeli escalation continues to worsen the humanitarian and security situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, raising growing international concerns over human rights",
