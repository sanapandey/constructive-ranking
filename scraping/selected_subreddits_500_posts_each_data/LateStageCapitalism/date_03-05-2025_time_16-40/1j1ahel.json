So much of my shopping is done through Amazon, especially since it's so quick and convenient. \n\nI understand it might be easy to quit if you're buying Want items (gadgets, electronics, fashion, etc), rather than Need items (groceries, clothing staples, medications, etc). \n\nBut are there any other comparable alternatives for people that can't really get out to shop much? \n\nI want to make it priority to at least cut down on purchases from Amazon, but it seems like there's not any great alternatives so far. Ugh. ",

If it takes you two years to get through every category, and you cut your Amazon buying in each category down by half, you can start another rotation of trying to see if there is a new option now for some of those peskier items.",

Switched to a local employee-owned grocer for all groceries, but would still go to Walmart for things like home supplies. Now I\u2019ve figured out other local places I can get everything I need and rarely ever go to Walmart. Used to exclusively go there. \n\nFor Google, I know many people promote Proton but that really only covers their email and other services. For search engines I actually switched to a paid one called Kagi and have had it for over a year now. It\u2019s so much better by every metric. For $10 a month I get results without ads, and I can promote certain websites in my own rankings. So they show up closer to the top if they have results for my query. You can also tell it to block certain sites or articles that are listicles \u201ctop 10 xyz.\u201d Also doesn\u2019t track all my searches to build a personalized profile or anything because\u2026it\u2019s not collecting data to sell it. The search is the product. You\u2019re no longer the product. $10 sounds steep at first but it\u2019s estimated google profits like $25 a month or something per user, and their results are kinda ass. They also offer a free trial and a light tie with limited monthly queries which I initially started with.",

You should expect to add \"Who is making this, where are they getting supplies from, and who do they do business with\" to the research behind every item; and in the best of circumstances that's all you need to do.\n\nMore often, you should also expect to email them every few days to remind them what you ordered, then to send you a purchase order, then \"don't you need my address?\", then to send you the shipping information once the label is created. It won't be every time - some smaller vendors have their shit together -, but plan for a month between \"I click the link to purchase the item\" and a shipping label being created, and for most of the responses to be \"What did you want again?\" Or \"I looked and we have just one sitting in the back!\" or \"We're closed for personal reasons, ask again next Monday\" followed by \"someone deleted the whole email chain, I don't know anything about what your order.\"\n\nEvery now and again, you run into actual scams, where the website immediately takes your money and then nobody ever responds to an attempts to communicate. If a site seems too professional, their story too perfect, familiarize yourself with your credit union's process for reversing a charge before you pay. It's usually quite easy if you communicate through a recorded medium.\n\n\nThe alternative to Amazon is researching everything you buy online, and then spending weeks reminding the seller to actually take your money and send you what you paid for. Big box retailers make \"add item to cart, pay for item, await shipping\" the whole process, as far as the customer is concerned. Dealing with other places reminds you that it's not.\n\n\nNobody ever said being a leftist is easy.",

The goal of a business is to generate profit. Nothing more or less. It doesn't matter if that goal is enacted at scale or in your local neighborhood.

The actual argument is society as it currently stands is awful. We are required to take part in it and even those with the best intentions will be corrupted by it. Capitalism is by its nature an extractive and manipulative system. You are in a sub called Late Stage Capitalism. You should understand this. Whether a capitalist is small or large only changes their ability to influence our lives. Their size and winnings doesn't change the nature of their role in this system though. My argument is actually a rejection of your quote. I do not believe people are fundamentally awful. I believe our society is fundamentally awful and requires people to do immoral things to survive and prosper. Like giving business owners our money and labor at a premium and for business owners to pay us less than we're worth of go out of business.",
