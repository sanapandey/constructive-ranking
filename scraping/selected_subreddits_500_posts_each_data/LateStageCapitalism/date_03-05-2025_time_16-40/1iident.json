However, Kerensky did this since he was an idealist who bought into the bourgeois democratic revolution as much as his followers. During the Russian Civil War, there were also anti-communist Russian nationalists, famously [Aleksei Brusilov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksei_Brusilov), who sided with the Bolsheviks on pragmatic grounds. Brusilov believed that the Whites were selfishly placing their class interests over the interests of Russia as a nation. He was fully convinced that only Lenin was capable of preserving Russia's status as a great power, even if this was under a different system he privately disagreed with.\n\nCapitalists can align with socialists against fascism, but they have to take a hardline stance on something in a scenario where the fascists conflict with that stance.",
