I didn't have any ideia of what is happening there, so I went to Google to look for more info, and I only found news telling the protests are happening because of a train accident, either in Portuguese (my native language) or English. Only one of the news I found (the one I'm linking here) treats the accident as the last drop in a bucket of a system that is failing, what justifies the size of the protests. \nI'm also surprised that I didn't see any post about it around here. \nWhat do you guys think or know about it? \n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/greece-tempe-rail-disaster-strike-d9996948371c5ec703d27006ae23db9b",

Indeed, it was the cherry on top of a government that thinks that has full immunity to do and say as they please, but yeasterday  they took a taste of what people can do.\nA little bit more info about the crash: it was a crash between a passenger train (that was doing the main train route of the country Athens-Thessaloniki) and a commercial train. This train, apparently was carrying illegal fuels and the govt was trying all these years to hide this fact through numerous shadow operations. Also, the train system has been left to rot all the previous years and it was privatised by the previous govt.\nA small debrief, i am happy to answer any questions.",

Two trains were put on the same line and crashed. In 2023. Two fucking trains riding the same line for 12 minutes. Greek railroad has been abandoned due to the austerity measures. It originally had 3.5k employees and now 600 (optimal number according to a study is 2k). The train routing operators were working long shifts without any days off, were lacking experience and we're mostly favor based appointed. There was also a commitment from 2014 that was meant to be implemented in order to have automatic breaking but all governments neglected that. The current government urged to blame the operator in the first 24h. The crime investigated here is political and economic. Not implementing safety assurances, appointing corrupted individuals, lying about safety. The result was the death of 50-52 people dying as a result of the crash\n\n\n2. The second train was allegedly transporting some tons of illegal substance that is use for diluting gas. It's most likely a mafia case with coverup from people from the government. The result was 5-7 people dying off of the fire caused by this substance\n\n\n3. Coverup. The moment the \"accident\" (I prefer the term murder) happened, the government rushed in with their usual dogs to remove and alter the crime scene. Both trains were moved out of the area and the ground has covered with new dirt. This effectively destroyed evidence. There a numerous other points thay I want to address that scream coverup but it's an extensive list. Let's just say that the only people moving the case forward are the relatives of the victims.\n\n\nWhat I want to stretch here, is although mafia being involved somehow, is a socking factor that may have driven people on the streets (which is a good thing), the majority of the people were murdered as a direct result of systemic negligence of a public transport in a capitalist society where our lives are worth less than the profits.",

                            "body": "First thing that happened after the train crash is that people with orders went on the site to cement the whole place. People assumed it was to cover up evidence.\n\nThe officials were denying that the train was carrying anything illegal and they were claiming that the operation happened for structural reason and for reasons related to theaccessibility to the site (bs, even cops (!!) testified that they were pressured to let workers cement the place).\n\nFast forward to the last few months, some audio recordings were released from passengers of the train after the crash calling for help, suggesting that not all people died from the crash, as we initially thought. Research teams of chemical engineers have shown since, that there was a fireball explosion, suggesting flammable material that is used to adulterate fuels. Thus, we now know that they cemented the place to cover up this illegal transport, and possibly to cover up the ties between the state and the legal/illegal fuel capitalists, but also to prevent further explosions.\n\nThis is why the anger of the people resurfaced lately, although the anger was never really gone, mostly because most of the victims were university students and this train route is a very common one to take, especially for students and workers ( I myself took this train more than 50 times in my life) and everyone can relate.",

Sadly many people died from fire, rather than the crash itself.\n\nFrom the first few days there had been people that suspected that the freight train was used to transport smuggled fuel or other illegal chemicals.\n\nThe current government did everything to deny this and cover up evidence: \n\n1. The site of the accident was covered in cement 3 days after the crash, while body parts where still being found. The police said that they have been ordered so by government and local official (members of the ruling party). As a result samples from the ground could not be collected to be tested.\n\n2. The Prime Minister (and the ruling party MPs) accused everyone that talked about \"illegal cargo\" of being conspiracy theorists and denied the existence of any illegal cargo. IIRC some MPs claimed that the explosion was caused by the... phone batteries of the passengers or from melting plastics.\n\n3. After some time, individual physists tried to explain the footage and concluded that the fireball must have been caused by some kind of fuel. Experts hired from the families of the victims reached the same conclusion.\n\n4. A few days ago the official report regarding the train crash was published, which mentioned that the explosion was -most probably- caused by some unknown fuel.\n\nWether or not there was smuggling involved is just the tip of the iceberg on how corrupt, ruthless and incompetent our government is. I'm greek and have been following this story closely (as most of Greeks for the past two years). When I'lll get some free time, I'll try to find some article in English on the full story.",

            "body": "The Tempi train crash will go down history as a pivotal moment in Greeces political and social scene where every single measure or procedure that was supposed to be taken in order to investigate what happened in a crash of such scale and why, simply never took place.\n\nIt all began when two trains collided while on the same tracks for more than 10 minutes, a passenger train and a cargo one. 57 people were murdered and countless more injured. The money taken from the EU to fund the development of the rail system was never used for the mechanisms that would have prevented this crash.\n\nOn the passenger train 57 people were murdered. It was a crime. After the initial crash a lot of the passengers who had originally survived were later on either burned to death or suffocated because of the fire that took place after a big explosion. The prime minister came out a couple of days after the crash to reassure the public that they are doing everything they can to investigate what happened, but that it's already known with certainty that there was no illegal substance of any sort on the cargo ship that could have caused the explosion.\n\nHowever, they never allowed any investigation to properly take place. The earth, the soil from the crime scene was dug up and carried away to other locations. We only found out about this because the families of the victims investigated on their own to find out what happened. Heavy machinery was brought to the scene and after digging everything up they then poured concrete everywhere. Everyone was outraged. The government alleged there are no attempts of cover up and anyone who talks  of anything of the sort is a conspiracy theorist.\n\nTwo key people who should have been called in for questioning and were working for the train organisation died shortly after and coincidentally in car crashes.\n\nAgain, anyone who speaks of the evidence is a conspiracy theorist.\n\nThe victims never underwent the proper medical examinations the procedures of such crashes require. No bone, no blood tests.\n\nThe firefighters who came to help on the scene got chemical burns but they were never called in for questioning. Their clothes never examined.\n\nAgain, anyone who speaks of such things is a conspiracy theorist. But the families never stopped looking. They found one of the locations where the soil had been dumped to, they found human remnants and bones from the victims there. \nIt is also important to note that even while the excavating and the cementing of the location was taking place, anyone was able to walk in and out freely since the authorities never marked crime scense as one properly. And by anyone of course we mean government officials.\n\nWhen approaching the highest judiciary authority to request why there has been such a deviation from normal procedures (everything mentioned above and more), the families were told that they should move on, that accidents like these happen and that they should turn to the church for relief and emotional support.\nAlso important to note is that that authority (the equivalent of the head of the Supreme Court) is appointed by the government. Also important to note is that, that same person was quick to dismiss the government of having any involvement with the spying scandal the prime minister was found involved in a couple years prior.\n\nFast forward a couple of months later and we reach 2024. By 2024 all major news media hadnt provided any substantial coverage of the case. As a matter of fact they were allowing government officials to come out and blatantly attack the families of the victims or accuse them of stirring the case up for personal gain, and some times even spreading false information about their personal lives.\n\nThe case changed a lot of hands by direct orders of the government. It was also supposed to come to the parliament because, according to the protocol, in cases of direct political responsibility (the ministries and their failure to implement the standards outlined by EU for the railway system and for which the funding was already given to the the various Greek governments over the years) all such cases need to be sent there. It was, but with great delay and secrecy. The families again named and criticized such delays and yet again no media was commenting on it. \n\nThere was, as part of the families private investigation experts, an inspection of samples from the second location where the soil was dumped, and they did find traces of flammable materials which suggests that the cargo ship was most likely carrying illegal substances used to mix with benzine.\n\nThat question could have been answered by the video footage of loading the cargo train. No such footage was ever found. Two years after the crash, last month, an employee came out and claimed that they found a USB stick with some footage of the cargo train in a trash bin, which was also given to the mainstream media, and in particular one exact reporter who seems to be on the governments payroll. The judiciary authorities working on the case hasn't yet come out to either confirm or reject the authenticity of that footage.\n\nAround December of 2024, the DA working on the case pressed charges against a certain government official (I might be wrong here - pls anyone correct me if I'm wrong. The information is too much and there are so many people and procedures involved that it's really difficult to keep track of) and a couple of days later her son was kidnapped. He was found approximately two weeks ago dead (mid February 2025), on top of a mountain but the time of death seems to be a day, if not a couple of hours, after he went missing. The media were quick to immediately reject any signs of fight or resistance, basically anything that could point to murder, but there has not been any official statements from the corresponding authorities. At least nothing was published. It is important to point out that while leaving his parents house the day he went missing he said that he would come back soon and his phone was still there charging.\n\nNow, just to remind everyone of where we are in this timeline, he went missing and died end of December. At the end of January, shocking audio footage from the cellphones of the victims came out right after the crash. Apparently some of the smartphones made phone calls to 911 (there is a feature where if a crash is detected, a call is made automatically with the coordinates being transmitted on that call while the phone is also technically on call with 911).\nOn those calls and unbeknownst to them, we hear the victims speak to each other right after the crash. The footage is extensive but to the public only an edited version of them was released because of how brutal it is. Phrases like \"I have no oxygen\" \"I love you\" and more were heard, along with their screams. It was now evident that a lot of them were alive after the crash, and they then died from the fire.",

                    "body": "The governmet\"s narrative fell apart. Everyone was in shock. There were demonstrations organized all over the country for January 26th. It was one of the biggest in Greece of the last 10 years. The media were first silent about them, then undermined them, and then were forced to speak about them and the case in general because the public was outraged.\n\nOn February 28th, another peaceful protest was organized. To commemorate the 2 years since the crime and to call for justice. It is estimated that over 1 million people came out in Athens alone, with all other cities in the country having all their main squares and streets filled with hundreds of people.\nPrior to the day, the government officials were warning the citizens not to participate because of potential riots.\n\nElderly people and families with strollers also joined the population along with students, employees and everyone else who came out to the streets. A general strike had been called as well.\n\nA couple of hours after the demonstrations started, and shortly after the parents of the victims made their speeches, a group of people strolled through the crowd towards the parliament and were given ample time by the police to station themselves across the policemen and next to the people (they were basically making themselves ready to throw their molotov bombs with policemen staring at the doing nothing).\n\nAnd then the molotovs rained down the policemen and the policemen rained their chemicals down on the people. Yes, the people. Who were forced to run because of the chemicals and were then ambushed and chased down by the policemen away from the parliament.\n\nSo after what was one of the most magnificent peaceful protests in the last 50 years of Greece's political scene, where no political party and ideology prevailed and all protested injustice and corruption, the policemen were chasing the peaceful citizens away and prosecuting none of the rioters, while there are also videos of policemen to let the rioters go away after they surround and give them time to walk away freely.\n\nThe coverage from the mainstream media concentrates on the riots and the coverage from the mainstream media follows suit. \n\nWhat we witnessed is the rage of a people who knows perfectly well they are being lied to and manipulated. \n\nThe prime minister has been absent from the media for well over weeks now, with his last interview after the demonstration on the 26th January being heavily criticized.\n\n\nI probably have omitted a lot of information. It's simply too much to include in a comment. Anyone feel free to comment and correct.\n\n\nTLDR: Greeks peacefully protest a corrupt government and a cover up of a crime while the media focuses on the riots erupted.",

            "body": "The greek culture is very rich in huge, well organized demonstrations that end up being \"confrontative\" to say the least, enough to empty the city centers and summon all the riot police available. Anarchists and communists (both quite strong there) show at demonstrations with flags whose poles are 3 inch thick, protective glasses, helmets, some even bike armor and faces always covered. Molotovs are usual, if there are no stones they just crush the floor and after some hours you start seeing that some of the riot police's shields have changed sides. We're talking about a people that defeated two fascist dictatorships during the 20th century, by themselves. \n\nGreece's economy was already destroyed beyond repair by the EU during the 2008 with their austerity programs that ensured that a crisis created by the finance sector would be paid by the working class and anything considered \"public\", including part of their monuments. There was a failed but admirable insurrection in Syntagma square where people came from all around the country, even the islands, in order to block the voting of the austerity programs in their Parliament.\n\nGreece also showed the limits of liberal democracy for the left: the party that won then, Syriza, a left coalition turned into party after the disgraceful display of their socialdemocratic PASOK, with alternative proposals to oppose what they considered a debt trap, won by a landslide, yet they simply got walked over by the EU's guys in suits, to the point that they ended up just doing what they were told and worse. Yannis Varoufakis comes from that party and it amazes me that he still has the face to encourage the left to take parliamentary democracy as the end all be all, specially under the EU.\n\nIt was just horrible for them, with living conditions getting so bad that a tree in an athenian park became the place where people would leave their last words, maybe a photo, and kill themselves in public, all of them people that couldn't cope with the misery they'd been pushed into. They haven't been very present on the news since then and in his case, no new meant just bad news whenever I checked again.\n\nPlenty more has happened to them, like their shitty circumstancial role as an anti-migration bulwark (assigned by the EU again), but what you're seeing is less of an anomaly in reaction to something specific than greeks being greeks and fighting against these shitty times: a people with a strong and proud tradition of class warfare in the streets, at least as strong as the french one.",
