We also know that extremely wealthy people have already planned for such an event and already have their bunkers in places like New Zealand. But what about the upper middle class? Would corporations just start buying bunkers for their top talent? Would  they already start building businesses in underground facilities?\n\nWould we get something like shareholders approving a share of a corporation's capital for building a part of the business underground in order to be hedged?  \nBut even if that becomes a thing, how would they have the foresight for it when most shareholders only care about profit \\*quarterly\\* ?\n\n**Comedic exploration of the topic:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmsK9yN2dGw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmsK9yN2dGw)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MW4tqmlZu8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MW4tqmlZu8)",

In the event we had a nuclear war and society frayed in this difficult period, they\u2019re going to be in the same position as everyone else with maybe a couple more things, making them incidentally more attractive targets.\n\nI like reading the zombie survival guide as a sort of idea for what that scenario might look like. People say they\u2019ll have mercenaries, but what good is their loyalty when moneys no good, and why would they listen to orders when they can just seize it for themselves?",

            "body": "I guess it depends how big the nuclear war is. An exchange of dozens of nukes is very different to the exchange of hundreds of them in terms of local and global impacts. \n\nIf we are talking about an extinction level nuclear war here\u2019s what I think will happen: society will likely completely break down for whoever is left in that hellscape. Federal government and military installations would be targeted before population centres. They\u2019re gone. Large cities will also be targets, so many state-based governments are also likely to be hit. Other things like transportation hubs and power facilities may also be targeted. The Internet will be patchy at best if not completely offline for countries affected. Local governments in rural areas may be all that\u2019s left in terms of government. Same for law enforcement. \n\nHonestly, at that point, money will likely become meaningless. What will be valuable is resources like food and potable water. And adequate shelter. Will some people accumulate more than they need and hoard it? Probably. But there\u2019s a limit to how much you can physically hoard, and you will need to be able to protect it. Desperate people will do things they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do to get their hands on these resources. Will some people find another way to take advantage of others for their own gains? Absolutely. That part will never change. \n\nWhat about the billionaires in their bunkers? I think their plans are just to sit in there and try to \u2018wait it out.\u2019 I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s much more sophisticated than that. And they probably underestimate how long that would take and what\u2019s left of society on the outside. Eventually they have to come out when supplies run out. But they will have no advantages against the hardened survivors on the outside. The opposite, actually. \n\nIn a limited exchange, say 10-12 nukes hitting each country, it may be different. There might be enough governmental structures left in place to keep society going, but the economy is likely to be heavily impacted. But if capitalism can find a way to keep going in this situation, it will. \n\nAre the middle class preparing for something like this alongside the billionaires? Other than preppers, I don\u2019t think so. From what I\u2019ve noticed most people aren\u2019t even thinking about nuclear war. \n\nJust my thoughts :)",
