The way his coalition stays in power is by selling off their vast natural resources and manufacturing arms.\n\nImperialist pressure from NATO (the United States) and election meddling (see: color revolutions) have forced the old eastern bloc into geopolitical \"under siege\" mode, where autocrats stay in power because the people fear and hate the west more than their own oppression. \n\nUkraine has a ton of problems with corruption, right wing political extremism, etc. but is being used by the US and Russia as a proxy battleground. Putin's war is a cynical land grab, but US involvement is also sketchy, as their primary goal is not \"saving Ukraine\" but weakening Russia. NATO *did* escalate things in the decades following the Cold War (this has been building for a long time) and may have forced Russia's hand, but all the claims of \"de-nazifying Ukraine\" and \"protecting ethnic Russians\" are utter bullshit.\n\nThe Ukrainian people are victims of the great power struggle between the imperialist west and its rivals, just like Afghanistan and Vietnam. The reason the war has taken on a more conventional character as opposed to guerrilla fighting is because it's happening right on Russia's border.",

Russia has a huge stranglehold on EU oil and gas. Ukraine has huge reserves of both. if Ukraine became friendly to the west and started selling their huge reserves to the EU, it would cripple Russia's oil based economy. that wouldn't have been an issue at all except the US got involved with the removal of the Ukrainian president in order to facilitate the EUs independence from Russian oil and gas. once Obama started the shale revolution here in America we became the largest producer of both oil and gas and we wanted to export that to our allies in Europe but logistically it's more expensive to ship overseas than to pump through the soviet pipelines and infrastructure that already exist. the only way to guarantee us those contracts is to cut off Russia from the EU. this is why we did a coup in Ukraine, and this is why we blew up the Nordstream pipeline. it's about our economic leverage over Russia and it always has been. we're starting to lose our global economic dominance and we are trying to exert pressure on our enemies (and more recently our allies) to maintain it.\n\nthis really is a proxy war between the US and Russia and we're using Ukrainians who we view as expendable in order to weaken them. the US *people* are propagandized but the US *military* has no delusions that we could just win a conventional war against Russia. so we use places like Ukraine who barely recovered from WW2 in order to maintain control. it seems to anyone who hasn't been paying attention that Putin just one day decided to invade Ukraine but there is decades of missed context in that analysis. that's why liberals are so hard for Ukraine. they are the classic example of someone who doesn't pay attention until election season and they just happen to be paying attention right now and since everything is partisan these days, Trump wanting to pull out of support for Ukraine is automatically a bad thing to them and so they've doubled down on war mongering. \n\nTrump is often wrong, but when it comes to pulling support for Ukraine, he's correct. we should have left them alone in 2014 but at best we should have helped fund the rebuilding after this war with Russia that, to clarify, we caused in the first place by not being able to mind our own business and prioritizing American dominance over the rest of the world. to clarify my position here I am 100% suggesting that Obama era policies are what caused this problem and 1st term Trump policies are what led to an actual war over there. Biden was too mindless of a leader to do anything other than perpetuate Obama's policies, too.",

            "body": "As someone who studied, lived and traveled through Russia, Belarus and Ukraine in the early 2000s the collapse of the USSR was more loss than winning. It opened the gates to western oligarchic meddling including diverting peoples material concerns towards nationalism and fascism in the name of promoting democracy, creating an oligarchic class and privatizing property to that level that they can never go back to communism even if they tried. \n\nPutin was installed as a western puppet to prevent any uprise of communists, but he also had to stem the tide of Russian oligarchs openly collaborating with western oligarchs and dissolving the country into further chaos. The Russian oligarchs initially openly welcomed western banking institutions but quickly realized western bankers and oligarchs don't play fair. When I was living there in 2002, 2003 I saw some pro Russian TV channels openly mocking some Russian oligarchs who had their wealth under hold or confiscated by western banks for not supporting certain political candidates. They didn't realize that the former Soviet states would slowly get out of their labor and market spheres and increasingly become pro west purely due to the currency value difference especially the US dollar which is artificially kept high. On top of that Everytime the US wants, it simply confiscates their wealth or embargoes and sanctions them so they have every right to try to move away from the dollar. But they also have a still strong communist leftist sentiment in the land that they have to fight if they become isolated from global oligarchy. \n\nBoth the US and the Russian states are at those cross points where they have to decide whether they can continue existing as separate entities or unite their oligarchies for a global oligarchic state. The US is worried that China and Russia if United and walk away from the dollar will create a huge counter force to the dollar hegemony and most of the states will try to move away from the dollar so Trump is trying to pull another Nixon. \n\nThe Ukraine war also kept Russia occupied instead of concentrating all their forces in Syria where they had their last remaining overseas base. At the end of the day this wars are about private wealth and money and nothing more. \n\nI personally feel that the American and Russian oligarchies should be dealt a death blow so that the Russians can create a state that works for them and the Americans can stop harassing the rest of the world for their dollar hegemony and actually contribute meaningfully for the furtherance of humanity.",

            "body": "Russia was between a rock and a hard place as to how and when it should respond to US / NATO aggression. Let's break it down in chronological order so it makes sense. I'll touch briefly on the nazi element and then we'll speed run the rest. \n\nFor starters, during the second World War, Ukraine was split between siding with the Nazis at the beginning of the war and eventually siding with the Soviets. But Nationalism was a huge problem at the time and Ukrainian nationalists were used by the SS divisions to round up and kill communists and Jews (communism being seen as a Jewish conspiracy by the Nazis). The jobs seen as being beneath the German Waffen SS, such as the murder of women and children, were left to the nationalists that SS units could recruit, but even some of the German Nazis were taken aback with the enthusiasm in which said nationalists carried out their duties. Following the war, the United States began working with former Nazis almost immediately, fearing Soviet invasion of Europe. With a sort of \"the enemy of my enemy\" mentality, they chose to overlook the hideous pasts of their new allies - this strategy is what lead them to train and arm the mujahadeen BTW, later known as al-Qaeda. We now know that said fear of Soviet invasion was grossly overstated by the former Nazis, but as pointed out in the [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22309161-blowback) Blowback by Christopher Simpson, post war German intelligence (still run by Nazis) was where the US received most of their intelligence on the soviets at the time. On top of working with former Nazi intelligence, stay behind operations were left behind in basically all countries throughout Europe. You can think of these as being secret armies, masquerading as civilians. Many of the Nazis and fascists that the CIA and MI6 worked with were in NATO countries - there's a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/765633.NATO_s_Secret_Armies) about it called\nNATO'S secret armies by Danielle Ganser which I highly recommend - but non-Nato countries such as Ukraine were selected as well, for obvious strategic reasons. Former Nazis and fascists all throughout Europe were trained by NATO, in coordination with the CIA and MI6, in sabotage, explosives, torture and terrorism and as can be predicted, many often were eager to use their new skills. When communism was gaining popularity in Italy for instance, the stay behind operation, dubbed operation Gladio, staged terror attacks on train stations and blamed the communists for them, smearing their public image causing them to tank at the polls. This is how the cold War was waged in Europe (it was much hotter and bloodier in Asia, Africa and Latin America). No European country seriously denazied, particularly not west Germany (70% of those holding public office were former Nazis). Ukraine was the same. In the early 90s, some of the stay behind operations came to light and all projects were said to have been abandoned. No charges were laid and it was barely, if ever, looked into. Somehow we just took their word for it. But all those trained secret armies didn't go anywhere... \n\nYou can probably see where this is going. I'm making this a two parter because reddit won't let me do it in one for some reason.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to provide [a source for the documentary I referenced](https://youtu.be/pKcmNGvaDUs?si=5-qF3NYV98VDUWD6). I've listed some books as well, but this is one of the documentaries I watched that provided historical context. It's actually a part 1 of 3 documentaries made by Oliver Stone, but it's the most important. Highly recommend.",

                    "body": "- following the collapse of the Soviet UNION, Washington stated that NATO wouldn't move an inch further to the east than Berlin. They lied, expanding into over 10 ex-Soviet countries, essentially encircling Russia. Now NATO was only brought into existence to combat the Soviet Union so why NATO still existed at the time (or still exists to this day) is up for debate. \n- in 2008, NATO stated that both Ukraine and Georgia would become part of NATO. Either country joining NATO was obviously a red line for Russia, which they stated openly. \n- In 2014, Victoria Nuland and company staged a coup D'etat in Ukraine known as the Maidan Coup. It was organised and funded by Washington (undermining democracy is what they do), using far right nationalists reminiscent of certain stay behind operations of the past. This wasn't a revolution, it was a coup imposed on Ukraine from the US. There audio recording of Victoria nuland bragging about it and an excellent documentary about it called Ukraine On Fire, directed by Oliver Stone. \n- immediately, the new undemocratic government put forward anti Russian legislation as well as using language that was tantamount to hate speech against Russians, while simultaneously recognising the far right rebels who had staged the coup. Crimeans, feeling threatened, participated in a referendum where over 90% opted to become part of Russia again (Crimea having been a part of Russia up until the 50s) with the Luhansk and Donetsk Region opting to become autonomous Republics, not recognising the new, undemocratic government of Ukraine. \n- Ukraine began shelling of the newly formed Republics as a response. \n- the Minsk 1 agreement was signed, indicating a cease fire between Ukraine and the Donbas region, but it was broken almost immediately by Ukraine, which resulted in a second agreement being reached. \n- the Minsk 2 agreement was reached in February of 2015. Article 11 of the Minsk 2 agreement stated that the Ukrainian leadership would maintain dialogue with the region, in good faith, and would grant them a level of autonomy. For 7 years and 2 residing presidents, this agreement was not bided by, as shelling of the region continued. 14,000 people had died prior to the Russian Special Military Operation, in the bloody civil war. Ukrainian nationalists were specifically targeting Russian speakers, which is essentially ethnic cleansing since a huge chunk of the population in the East speak Russian. The UN didn't intervene, even though according to article 1 of the UN declaration of human rights, all peoples have a right to self determination; and according to article 1, section 3, all States have the obligation to promote the process of self determination. Both the Ukrainian state and the UN failed everyone involved. Western media remained silent. \n- in 2016, Russia proposed a UN resolution, entitled \"Combating Glorification Of Nazism, Neo-Nazism And Other Practices That Contribute To Fueling Contemporary Forms Of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, And Related Intolerance.\" It's worth remembering that 27 million Russians died fighting the Nazis in WW2, a history they haven't forgotten and thus see nazism as an existential threat. Only Ukraine and the United States voted against this resolution. \n- in 2017 Washington agreed to the sale of 39 million dollars worth of weaponry to Ukraine, in direct violation of the Minsk 2 agreement. This was done under Trump as Obama realised the shit storm it would create. \n- in 2019 the United States withdrew from the INF treaty, against the wishes of Russia, meaning that it could now place nuclear armaments on the border of Russia. Once again, this was during the trump administration, so any attempt to label trump as working for Russia is completely laughable. \n- Then in 2022, while already violating the minsk agreements and continuing to buy and use American weapons, Zelensky began talking about the nuclear armament of Ukraine. Up until this point, talks had remained diplomatic. Russia has some of the best diplomats in the world. But needless to say, Russia saw this as crossing what they had previously outlined as being another \"red line.\"\n\nNow it's also important to briefly touch on the way Russia went about their military operation, because they did so legally. By recognising Donetsk and Lugansk as autonomous countries and signing defensive alliances with them, it meant that they could now respond to Ukrainian aggression within the Donbas. So although the narrative of Putin being a war criminal is catchy in Western media, it's actually inaccurate.\n\nTl;dr - Russia has a right to defend itself. Cold war never ended.",

NATO selling them millions of dollars in weapons and training Ukrainian battalions up to NATO standards prior to Russia's SMO was also a red line, which they were also very clear about. After the 2014 coup backed by Washington, they already had defacto membership. \n\nNATO had already broken their promise of not expanding eastward on 20 separate occasions by by expanding all the way to Russia's doorstep. Ukraine had broken their promise (twice) and gone against the Minsk agreement, continuing to fire on their own civilians in the Donbas region. NATO and Ukraine were essentially baiting Russia into a reaction, and the longer they waited, the worse off they'd be, because more and more battalions would be trained to NATO standards and more and more NATO weaponry would arrive to Ukraine. \n\nIt appears you refuse to understand the context that lead to this because of your biases. If this were Russia moving military to Mexico in anticipation of an attack, we'd have no trouble in identifying that as being aggressive behaviour and the US would be justified in treating it as a threat. But for some reason, we ignored Russia's early warnings, which left military response as the last option at their disposal. It all could have been avoided.",

I can only speculate on how things might have been different, but I can imagine that they would not have prosecuted the war in the way they did if their aims were only to protect Russo-Ukrainians or whatever. \n\nAs it happened, they pretty plainly were expanding their territory to have dominance over the Black Sea and to make sure Ukraine's status as a member of NATO is forever ambiguous (territorial integrity is a requirement for membership). If their claims of self-defense were true, they might have only moved into the Donbas instead of striking at Kyiv? Whatever the alternative was, it had to be better than firing an unholy amount of artillery into heavily populated areas and rolling tanks through towns. \n\nAnd while NATO encroachment was a genuine threat, Russia has shown itself to be pretty aggressive and prone to breaking promises, so maybe those states wouldn't be so eager to join the alliance if they didn't feel legitimately threatened by Russian aggression. And even if they had done things differently, the Biden administration was pretty hell bent on a war to grind Russia down anyway. I really don't know. I just know that this can't have been the only path.",
