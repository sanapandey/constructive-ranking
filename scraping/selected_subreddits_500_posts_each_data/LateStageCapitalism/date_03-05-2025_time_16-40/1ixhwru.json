What are some books everyone must read? About leftist theory, late stage capitalism, global issues in general, recent history, and philosophy.\n\nAlso lately the rise of far right in Europe has piqued my interest, so can you specifically recommend me books on that subject too?\n\nThank you :)",

If you don't have time, just read the chapters on post-WWII and \"The Bipartisan Consensus\". Really illustrates how the tropes of the U.S. being some force for good or democracy is an absolute lie. Outlines the beginning of the decline of the American dream from an economic perspective.\n\nA Brief History of Neoliberalism -- David Harvey\n\nPer the title, a brief yet insightful overview of how the current dominant, bipartisan ideology of neoliberalism (financialization of the economy, deindustrialization, deregulation, austerity) operates mainly in the U.S., UK, and China (China's case is a bit unique, but with similarities to the West).",

He says Liberalism began as a humanistic champion of individual and worker rights, but after WWI in the US, the Liberals knuckled under the corporate cabal to get their own piece of the pie, and became a buffer zone to protect the rich from the poor, instead of protecting the poor from the rich. Fear mongering (Commies! Terrorists! Illegals!), consumerism, and war mongering. He says the oligarchs need that liberal buffer zone, but by destroying the Liberals and their performative role (the welfare state), the right-wing elite have set in motion their downfall. He cites this dynamic as the fall of several empires in history.",
