The attempted TikTok ban was the straw that broke the camel's back, and then China did a super-flex with DeepSeek on top of that. \n\nI think most people are really coming to terms with the fact that not only the government, but also the corporations/billionaires that run it, are completely full of shit. People are not only preferring to use China's stuff, but I bet most people feel safer giving China their data then these tech companies.",

The oligarch branch of the capitalist class is transforming us into a theocratic technofeudalist state where the oligarchs will outright own regions of the country and run them as corporations. A new literal aristocracy is forming. We're about to have Lords Elon of X and Bezos of Amazon and Emperor Trump. The EOs are shock and awe in order to hyper-normalize massive and rapid change. This is not hyperbole. This is what they have been saying they would do and they are doing it.\n\nThe Democrats aren't doing anything because most of them are a part of the capitalist class and they believe they will personally profit from this.\n\nWe have two choices here. We become serfs of Lord Zuckerberg or we have a working class revolution and kick these motherfuckers out.\u00a0\n\nNobody is coming to save us, we have to save ourselves.\n\nThis is coming for the rest of the Western world, too.\u00a0 This is literally a \"workers of the world unite\" situation.",
