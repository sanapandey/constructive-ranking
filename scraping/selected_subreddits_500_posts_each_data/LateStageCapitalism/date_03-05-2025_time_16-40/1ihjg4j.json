I was the Director of Video Production for the Gravel Institute until it folded back in 2022.\n\nSeveral Gravel Institute colleagues and I have been hard at work developing a new series of videos with Jacobin Magazine, and our first new video has released today, featuring OG Gravel presenter and brilliant historian Matt Karp.\n\nThings are pretty terrible in America (and the world at large), but they don\u2019t have to be.",

That there has been no focused effort to buttress the pro-capitalist/anti-communist ideological agenda by the left over the past is precisely the reason we're where we are now (among other failures).\n\nOur goal here on this sub is to educate the people and see the overthrow of the capitalist order and institution of a communist system that works for everyone.  I hope you share the same goal.  So note that we do not support \"Reformism\".  The entire american system must be replaced since it was purpose built to serve only the rich.  \n\nAnd I really like the work Gravel did.  David Cross's video is fantastic.",

Having worked in leftist messaging and education for some time, a principal pain-point that creates roadblocks to changing people's minds is, more often than not, the sticker-shock of revolution vs reform. \n\nBuilding an \"ecumenical left\" via accelerated reformation over how people think about things may have a good shot at skipping the reformation step in praxis in favor of revolution. \n\nThe only way we'll win is with a broad coalition, and we gotta be persuasive and steadfast as hell in order to get there. If people don't know what we're talking about, they won't join us.\n\nI'm glad you liked the Cross video - it's been pretty wild seeing that one pop off over and over again recently. That one was a beast to make.",

            "body": "Prior to the New Deal, socialists and communists helped fight against the power of Capitalists (robber barons). Prior to that abolitionists fought against slavery. So for the first century and a half, the lower classes were fighting against the upper class in a more or less persistent manner. Haves v Have Nots \n\nThe partial victory gained via the New Deal gave the American worker the barest of hint of workers having a say in government- an attempt at sharing power. Looking back, it seemed to satiate the American worker. That, I think, helped make the second Red Scare even more pervasive and long lasting than the first. I think it continues to this day. The continued use of wedge politics, especially via radio and TV mediums as they were introduced, has disrupted that view of the class war that continues. The Haves v Have Nots\n\nThose rights that were won? That's gone, now. All actively being rolled back. It isn't Trump. Trump is a symptom. Biden was a symptom. Musk is yet another in a long line of capitalists that worked behind the scenes to destroy socialist thought, neuter civil rights and wear down worker's rights. The most arrogant are starting to come forward and show their disdain for the rest of us. Right now they are Musk and Peter Thiel. \n\nSo I think that, historically, the era of working class power has ended. It will only return if we see a return of actual socialists and communists and not just democratic socialists who think reform and working with capitalist political parties will be enough. In this, the US is woefully behind. It took decades of activism to reach union power enough to bring the 8 hour work day in the 1880s. Longer to abolish child labor and get unions legalized in the non agricultural portions of the economy (1930s).\n\nAgainst this backdrop is climate change. And it will only make right wing political responses worse and more accepted as desperate people look for answers.",

There used to be a strong and vocal intellectual left in this country throughout the 20th century. Debs received a million votes twice while in prison, communism was not yet a word everyone loathed without even understanding what it is. We had the Panthers, civil rights leaders who were openly socialist, there was Henry Wallace, decades of counter culture...etc. All gone now and ironically worsened by the internet. There are still academics and intellectuals of different kinds, but they have minimal reach and are discredited simply by slapping them with the Russian/Iranian/Chinese asset label. It seems pretty hopeless and it's all by design.\n\nI definitely don't see how the US could ever experience revolution or reform short of a total war scenario that kills millions and forces a fresh start. Even when more people die, starve or face imprisonment, I can't imagine a scenario where the citizenry wouldn't just blame one of the convenient scapegoats. We are following the textbook path to fascism.",
