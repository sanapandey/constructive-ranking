    "selftext": "I was reading about the latest in Trump's actions to undermine democracy/the constitution and I recalled something from back in my days of studying international relations...\n\nThe catchphrase \"Make America Great Again\" literally mirrors fascist rhetoric, specifically Fascist Italy while under the rule of Mussolini, in that one of the main rhetorics that he promoted were to \"return Italy to the glory days of the Roman empire\" or the \"romanita, roman-ness\"\n\nNot to mention the whole culture war that has been going on right now. Creating an \"us vs other\" and demonizing marginalized groups (ex: Black vs White, LGBT vs Straight), placing them as scapegoats for the nation turning to shit like the Nazis did with the jews.. and don't even get me started on the \"Roman salute\" shit.. this indeed freaks me the fuck out, like how tf did things get like this so fast \ud83d\ude43 (atleast feels like that now)..\n\nWhat do you think comrades?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The functional approach to realizing the status quo ante has predominantly been fascism for the past 150 years or so.
