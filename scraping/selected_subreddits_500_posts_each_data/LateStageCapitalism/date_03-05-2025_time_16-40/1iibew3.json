Most of them were conducted by radical Islamists based in the Xinjiang region, Terrorism peaked in the mid 2010s with the rise of ISIS with even ISIS declaring Xinjiang part of their Caliphate.\n\nWith the surge of terrorism in that Area in the 2010s, there is no doubt ISIS was radicalizing parts of the Xinjiang population. After China's deradicalization efforts, the number or ISIS based terrorist mass casualty events from 2017 to now dropped from many times a year to zero, as in none in a nearly 8 year period.\n\nAs for genocide accusations, it's pretty unfounded if you consider the laws in china. For instance it's well known China engaged in active population control with the one child policy to curb their unsustainable population growth, breaking the policy could mean heavy fines and even sterilizations. However less well known is that minority groups like the Uygurs were pretty much exempt and had a much much more lenient version and can have up to 3 children with no penalty. Laws against having more than 3 children were rarely enforced among minority groups in China so it was common for minority families to have even more than 3 kids.\n\nWhat happened was during the terrorism crackdown, the government started to strictly enforcing their existing population control laws which was still more lenient than the laws they had for the Han majority group. So if enforcing their existing fairly lenient laws for Uygurs is genocide, then the even more strict one child policy that the majority Han population is subjected to is Ultra genocide?\n\nIt's only recently that china has rolled back their national one child policy and have given the majority Han the same policy as the Uygurs of being able to have 3 kids with no penalty during the so called \"genocide\"",
