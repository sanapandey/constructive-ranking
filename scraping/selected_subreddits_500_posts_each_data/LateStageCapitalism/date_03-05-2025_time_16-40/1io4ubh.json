I then make the point that if billionaires are taxed even a little bit, we could have universal healthcare, free college, significantly better public transportation, etc. Dude isn\u2019t having it and believes billionaires are self made, what are yalls thoughts on self made billionaires?",

We are not arguing for taxing the capitalists we are arguing for their abolition.\n\nTaxing the rich doesn't change the capitalist power dynamic. This is the reason why it is primarily a liberal or social democratic demand.\n\nThe contradictions and exploitation in capitalism cannot be taxed away.\n\nRegarding self made Billionares: [The Myth Of The \"Self-Made\" Billionaire - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=316nOvHUS8A)\n\n>I then make the point that if billionaires are taxed even a little bit, we could have universal healthcare, free college, significantly better public transportation, etc.\n\nI also want to emphasize that this is not a money problem. It is a problem of the will of the US American ruling class (capitalists). The US government has more than enough money to finance all of this: [Why The Government Has Infinite Money - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFhKVCaadzE)\n\nOften this would be even cheaper than the current system. But that would make US Americans less desperate and capitalism can't have that.",

You're trying to up end someone's sense of justice and morality and their understanding of the basic functions of the world. That's also tied in to their family, their community-  their support. Like, to peel someone's beliefs from them can force them into a really isolating and scary place. Just as an example of what I'm talking about- there are whole support groups dedicated to getting people out of White Supremacist movements. It's WORK. \n\n  \nBut in times like that I remember guys like Fred Hampton who talked about uniting with people who have been taught to hate and that we have also been taught to hate. Fight fire with water and all that. \n\nAll this to say, that really does suck. And it's hard. But I think there can be value in conversations like that.",

It\u2019s austerity for the poor and socialism for the rich though\u2026 we spend on consulting firms that asses everything and take huge cuts out of whatever we are gonna make. Ex: fund education but 4 out of the 5 million invested goes to a consulting firm that determines we need new books and new standardize tests, 1.8 million goes to other garbage and less than 20,000 goes to teachers. Unfortunately in this country I don\u2019t see that  changing because both parties do that. It\u2019s a capitalism problem. On the other hand, the tax cuts have created massive national debt along with bad spending (wars, DoD, pentagon, CIA, fbi, nsa, homeland, etc). We are gonna hit the debt crisis soon because the interest alone to pay the bonds we have taken out to makes ends meet for decades\u2026 is gonna become unpayable. 1 trillion a year now and it will reach to 2 trillion.",

Tax the rich is a Democratic Party slogan, and it\u2019s having an argument about a tree instead of noticing the forest. We need to not have usury, private equities, etc. The financial class was birthed from the landlord class. The financial class is the reason we have a housing crisis because they tied the housing cost to loans and they allowed higher loans because they collect more interest and if you can\u2019t pay it\u2019s still a win. But with all these loans they have gotten us into debt peonage. Michael Hudson the Marxist economist is good at explaining this. You can find him on YouTube. \n\nThe rich only understand only two things: violence and profits. Violence doesn\u2019t work well. Mass strikes work, blocking ports. Which is why communists say we need to organize. Organize means learn basic skills that we knew that we were made to forget like fixing things, making things, cooking and gardening. Organize the community. Not everyone can do everything. But on the day that we have disruptions of service or if things become ridiculously expensive the community can get by specially the poorest. Every time that you can you put a thorn on the side of capitalists. \nTo me, if I have to buy a new car and can\u2019t fix basic things myself and need a subscription for the screen, for heating the car seat, etc I rather keep my old car. And we have these movements like the right to repair. Farmers with John Deere tractors are pirating software so they can repair the items themselves.",

No health insurance mandate, no paid vacation...And speaking with other people who are also not billionaires, but middle of the road (wage workers, in my life, machinists who in my experience are mostly Republican) it seems like they pay more for taxes when the democrats are in office, and they come up with all these programs \"bring back better\" comes to mind...

Do you want crime to be investigated in your area? (To be clear, not defending police as a concept). Do you have elderly or disabled people who you want to keep existing? Do you wish we had universal healthcare, housing, food, water, education rights? Would you like to see UBI one day? You probably do qualify for more benefits programs than you realize, many do qualify for some amount of EBT. There are subsidies for a lot of things you spend on as well. Or maybe not you directly but the people in your community. \n\nAnd those are just what we do with domestic funds. \n\nYou are benefiting. They pay for or recover costs of necessary spending with your taxes. And a lot of them aren't black box. Much of their spending is public record isn't it? My family and friends who work for the government have shown me spending budgets and employee pay scales from publically available documents so I would assume at least a large portion are like that. I'm not going to say we don't have hidden slush funds or whatever but I don't think most of it is hidden? (I may be wrong \ud83e\udd37)\n\nI'm not going to defend the illusion of democracy by claiming the Democratic or Republican parties do anything remotely to my liking.

But they are at best barely passable as is under either administration. It needs to be improved to more ideally serve the people who need it most. \n\nIm sure you could debate the effectiveness of how those funds are utilized and that's a matter of policy. Not necessarily that those intended uses are inherently bad. \n\nBut I'm also not going to say that no part of them is used correctly. I think the lives of working class people would be 100x worse if we just abolished taxes and let freedom take the wheel with every person for themselves.\n\nI would rather see socialist reform with high oversight to manage efficient spending without corruption. But until then I don't see 0 tax being a viable solution. Maybe when the majority of society sees basic human rights as basic. Because right now that's definitely not the prevailing belief. \n\n0 tax would just put people entirely at the mercy of corporations rather than almost entirely.

It's also VERY difficult to find any information on the provenance of where the minerals used in Fenty Beauty come from, but then again, this is common throughout all economic mineral trade globally. \n\nI do know that in 2020(ish) there were calls for a full investigation, but this fizzled out and I can't recall seeing any follow up. It was also a bit murky, because it cropped up in response to Rihanna posting in support of Indian farmers. \n\nThere is a Responsible Mica Initiative that certain brands have signed up to (Elizabeth Arden, Revlon, and others) if you want to avoid this.",

Stop any one person from having so much money that they can literally buy elections- as we\u2019re witnessing right now. \n\n2. An even better way to stop billionaires from becoming billionaires is better labor laws. Not only that but it would save US taxpayers a lot of money. Right now the majority of the employees of Walmart and Amazon are on some form of SNAP or gov\u2019t subsidies. If the Waltons or Bezos payed their employees a living wage not only would the middle class be revived, and the burden on taxpayers be reduced, but the Waltons and Bezos wouldn\u2019t have the money to buy legislation to allow them to further exploit their workers.",

It depends on how taxes are levied and what the revenue generated from the taxes is used for. Most likely, there is some validity in their assertion that taxation is theft (depends on the context but most likely there is validity) and you outright rejecting that likely objective truth is obviously not putting you in a position to have a decent conversation.\n\n\n2. What is your point that if we tax billionaires we can maybe have those things? The only way billionaires can even exist is if wealthy entities engage in state capture. The existence of billionaires is quite literally an example of market failure whereby the distribution of resources is grossly imbalanced to the point where economies are extremely fragile. For such a system to exist, it's basically inconceivable that this same system can tax billionaires to such an extent that we could have all those things. Billionaires exist because they aren't taxed properly and because they have an endless supply of a captive labor force whose labor they can exploit. If people are provided all basic human rights, then it's impossible to just endlessly exploit people like billionaires do.\n\n\n3. A self made billionaire is literally oxymoronic. It's impossible to be a billionaire without not only exploiting labor and stealing the productive value of that labor but it's also impossible to be a billionaire without receiving special privileges and benefits from the state that are not available to everyone.\n\nBasically, while the other person is obviously very wrong, your arguments are also deeply and fundamentally contradictory, which is not really effective for influencing/teaching/debating others.",

            "body": "The concept of ownership is a set of made-up rules that we are propagandized into believing are rational and natural.\n\nThe only difference between billionaires and everyone else is that the monopoly of power (aka the government) arbitrarily decided that billionaires should be billionaires. In this way, taxes aren't how billionaires give back, but what the government keeps after giving everything to the billionaire.\n\nSelf-made billionaires can be easily debunked by showing how absurd the concept of corporate share ownership (how billionaires make their billions) is at face value. \n\nA share is a right in perpetuity to receive a portion of a portion of any given corporation's profits, which we call dividends. Shares can be and are given for any reason or no reason at all. \n\nProponents of capitalism believe shares are given out to owners as reasonable compensation in exchange for their contribution to the corporation, their contribution to the corporation is so great, and so immesurable that they and their heirs deserve to receive dividend for eternity. The problem with this argument is that capitalism itself has found a way to quantify and measure every possible way an owner could contribute.\n\nIf an owner came up with an amazing, revolutionary, billion-dollar idea as an inventor, engineer, or scientist, that's called a patent and they are legally entitled to a portion of profits of their invention for just 20 years, not eternity. \n\nIf an owner works for the corporation, be it as a CEO or a janitor, then their contribution to the company is quantified by their salary, if they are a great CEO then their salary is higher, but once again, the fair market value of their contribution is a definite and not eternal money.\n\nIf an owner provided the company with money (which is how most owners become owners), we already have a name for that. It's called a loan, and they're given out in exchange for interest. Notably, in the United States, charging excessive interest is not only illegal but a crime known as usury. In my state of Pennsylvania, you can serve hard time in prison  if you charge over 60% interest. Since shares pay out for eternity, the theoretical interest rate for shares is also potentially infinite, so why isn't every shareholder in prison right now? \n\nNone of this matters, of course, because in the real world, corporate ownership is by design illogical. The owners are owners not because they \"built\" the corporation or \"helped\" the corporation in any way, but because we need \"someone,\" \"anyone\" to be an owner, and it might as well be them. Corporations are artifacts of feudalism, which demanded everything to have an owner, so much of our society operates under the idea that every corporation MUST have an owner. \n\n\nTL;DR: The concept of a self-made billionaire is an oxymoron. Given enough info, we can quantify the value each billionaire has provided to their respective companies, and it doesn't add up to anywhere near a billion dollars. Billionaires exist because we invented socialized production before we invented socialized proprietorship, so almost every enterprise needs to designate a guy or guys to dictate decisions and extract profits, not because they \"deserve\" the money in any way.",

Bought off patents. All inventions build on thousand years of past inventions and depend on access to infrastructure and materials, shelter, and food, schools etc. This all is and always has been a collective achievement by the people.\n\nI'd only consider a billionair self made, if they never used any infrastructure build by the people, never used other peope's work, did all the things necessary to sustain their existence themselves (gathering food, making cloth, building an room to live and work in, getting electricity) and created all the necessary knowledge themselves (finding all the formulas, writing the books, building the basic and advanced tools). If they can do this all by themselves and at the same time provide new real value to society that is worth billions, then yeah... they are self made then. Is it possible? Hahahaha hell no!\n\nBut that said, what is more problematic than insane wealth inequality, is the fact that billionairs have power to decide over our future.

The ability to start and fail a hundred times means that 1, you will inevitably make it one day and 2.
