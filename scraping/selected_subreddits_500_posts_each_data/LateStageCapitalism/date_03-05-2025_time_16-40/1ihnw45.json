When I get abused by an employer and later I (politely and humanly) describe what happened to me on, say, Google maps, those reviews ALWAYS get blocked by Google and they don't even tell me which guideline I apparently didn't follow (when I know that what I said was fine). I guess that exploiters stand together against the exploited.",
