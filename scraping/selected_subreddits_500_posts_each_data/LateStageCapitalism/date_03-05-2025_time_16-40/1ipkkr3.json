Heretofore, the \"American State\" has existed to serve the bourgeoisie in general and not, in my own opinion, \"play favorites\", more or less, with any particular faction or subset of them.  However, now we see that it has become so thoroughly corrupted that one faction has seized it successfully with the second coming of the orange insect king.  It's clear he is the servant of this Elvon Munks parasite.  America is effectively a monarchy now.  If now is not the time for a Revolutionary Cleansing, when is it?",

The government has already committed $3.9 billion to SpaceX as part of its NASA deal.\n\n\u2022 The new agreement says it is for \u201cwork required for the design, development, manufacture, test, launch, demonstration, and engineering support of the Human Landing System (HLS) Integrated Lander.\u201d Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has not announced it is targeting or reviewing NASA contracts for cuts.Trump has nominated Jared Isaacman as NASA administrator. Isaacman is a billionaire Musk associate who runs a payment processing company that is regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\u2022 Musk has been trying to dismantle the CFPB, which Isaacman has been working to dismantle as well as his own payment processing firm, which he has tried to dismantle. Last month, Isaacman's company was fined by federal securities regulators for not properly disclosing millions of pounds of payments to company executives' relatives.\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.*",
