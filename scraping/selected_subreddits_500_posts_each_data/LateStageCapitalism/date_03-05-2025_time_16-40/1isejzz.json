This was not possible in Southern Vietnam. Those who openly opposed are dared to tarnish the reputation of of the Saigon regime would be imprisoned or killed. \n\nWhen non-government newspapers published stories that reflected poorly upon the Saigon regime, the publications would literally be confiscated and its writers would be charged with crimes.\n\n\n>Reporters don't pose a threat in general, that's the point. \n\nI agree. But again, there is far more freedom of press today in Gaza than there was in Southern Vietnam. Most reporting done by Vietnamese who were against the Saigon regime/the US was done underground and in secret. \n\n\n\n>because most of the data is on the foreign correspondents only, which varied greatly by year. \n\nYes, and there are far more foreign corespondents in Israel/Gaza than there were in Vietnam. Again, the majority of reporters in Vietnam were military reporters. Again, most news that Americans got during the Vietnam war came directly from the US military reporters. Most people today are not getting their news directly from people employed by the Israeli military. There is far more conflicting information and reports with fact-checking coming out today than there were in during the Vietnam war where most news agencies just reported made-up data that came directly from the US military. \n\n>Also those are the reporters you hear about in Western media, there were reporters on the North Vietnamese side too. \n\nYes, this would be comparable to Palestinian newspapers that aren't in Gaza. And there are far more and they have much further reach than anything that North Vietnam had during the Vietnam war. \n\n>Death toll yes, obviously, it had over 10x the population of Gaza and the war lasted 20 years. \n\nI'm saying that the death toll in Vietnam was much higher than the death toll throughout the modern iteration of the Palestine/Israel conflict (from 1948 onward). \n\n>The overall death rate in Vietnam (including natural deaths) at the peak of the war, was still much lower than the death rate from direct casualties in Gaza even with the most conservative estimates.\n\nIncorrect depending on what you mean by death rate. \n\nWhen I said it, I was referring to casualties per time (day, month, year, etc). Far more people were dying daily in Vietnam than have been dying in Gaza. \n\nIf you mean casualties as a percentage of the population or per capita, then yes Gaza has a higher rate. \n\nTo bring this back to death of reporters...\n\n\nThis entire article is about how this year is the deadliest year in Gaza for reporters with 124 reporters killed. **The Vietnamese independence movement started with 200 reporters being killed in one single day** by the French soon after Vietnam declared its right to independence. From that point forward, all publications critical of western occupation were forced underground. \n\n\nAgain, the situation in Gaza is terrible and Israel is am apartheid state. But again, Vietnam was far worse.",

With very few exceptions, Israel hasn't allowed foreign journalists to enter Gaza since Oct. 7th. Even with ceasefire, they're still refusing to lift the ban. \n\nThere's some foreign correspondents in Lebanon, and they've been also targeted and included in the count, but they aren't the majority and are generally in less danger than the ones in Gaza. \n\n>If you mean casualties as a percentage of the population or per capita, then yes Gaza has a higher rate.\n\nThat's what \"death rate\" means\n\n>Again, the situation in Gaza is terrible and Israel is am apartheid state. But again, Vietnam was far worse.\n\nI don't think there's much point in arguing which US atrocity is worse. \n\nI have no doubt that Vietnamese journalist casualties were undercounted, which is almost certainly also the case for Gaza with how many people are missing. The Gaza count also doesn't include most of the independent journalists, or people with some form of online platform that are functionally doing the same thing.  \n\nThe point is that Israel is going after journalists in a way that hasn't really been seen in any other conflict before.

So, its really not that hard to tell that there are journalists there even if most of them have ben displaced and are being restricted in where they can go. \n\n\n>That's what \"death rate\" means\n\nIts not. You are ignorant. **I already explained that death rate can mean deaths per unit of time**. \n\nThe term \"rate\" is a measure of something in relation to another measurement. This 2nd measurement is most often time... velocity (miles per hour), flow rate (gallons per minute), etc. \n\nIn fact, here is a report from US government archives which refers to deaths from landmines in post WW2 Netherlands by saying [\"The current death rate is 1-2 civilians per year\"](https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/pm/rls/rpt/hk/2001/6961.htm)\n\n**So again, you are wrong.** I already specified that death rate can refer to different ways if measurement. Instead of simply clarifying which way you meant, you instead showed how bullhead and ignorant you are by arguing that deathrate can only man one thing.\n\n\n>I don't think there's much point in arguing which US atrocity is worse\n\nExcept you started this off by making an ignorant and illogical comparison to the Vietnam war. \nAgain, you claimed that more than twice the number of journalists have been killed in Gaza than in Vietnam. Aside from all the many reasons it doesn't make sense to compare the 2 (based on demographics) you are still wrong. Again, this article talks about 124 journalists being killed in one year. Vietnam had 200 killed in one day. \n\n>The point is that Israel is going after journalists in a way that hasn't really been seen in any other conflict before. While it's true that's it's largely because the reporters close to combat were mostly pro-US, this simply wasn't the case in Vietnam.\n\nAgain you are wrong. There is more freedom of press in Israel and Gaza than there was in Saigon. If you were to publish something critical of the Saigon regime or US occupation, you would instantly be labeled a communist sympathizers and be imprisoned (without trial) or killed. To even be a peace advocate would make you an enemy of the Saigon regime. \n\n\nThe issue here seems to be that you are shocked and accustomed to modern conceptions of press freedom. [You hear stories of journalists clearly identified as the press being targeted and shot at.](\nhttps://images-cdn.trtworld.com/trtworld/w1180/h663/q70/20787183_0-113-1396-600.jpeg)\n\nBut again, a reporter in Vietnam who was trying to report on US or South Vietnamese crimes wouldn't dare dress in a press outfit and identify themselves as the enemy. The reporters in Gaza dress this way because they expect to be afforded press privileges and not be targeted. A journalist in Vietnam specifically avoids dressing this way and hides the fact that they are a journalists reporting for am underground publication because they know it carries a death sentence. You are sort of arguing with the logic of a reverse survivorship bias (that still doesn't appear to have any data to support it). You think Vietnamese reporters were safer, while ignoring that the only reason they would have been safer (which they certainly weren't) is because they were better at hiding and not doing actual journalism.",
