    "selftext": "A bit of background because talking about brains requires credentials for some reason. I studied a Bachelor of psychology for 3 or so years, and it's become pretty apparent that psychology is mostly nature. The brain is a flexible organ that establishes neural pathways based on the environment that surrounds it, and so if we live in a capitalist-fascist hellscape, we get used to that idea. But not the stress. If we are overwhelmed by mental/physical tasks such as rent, groceries or work, there's no way around not releasing stress hormones.\n\nAnyway, basically every person under 30 I know seems to be heavily depressed because of all this. Depression itself is really hard to define unless there's a biological cause, and the genuine biological cases are extremely rare (sometimes people produce faulty neurotransmitters, the things that travel between neurons). Overwhelmingly, the people who I consult for depression are technically undiagnosable, and we can assume it's their material environment that causes this depression.\n\nSo, the vent. When I talk to most folks about how depressed the younger generation is, they can't stop blaming it on biological shit. Sickness, Long COVID, diet, the list of things is endless. It's really starting to get on my nerves. In a world that is increasingly atomized, where Capitalist-centric media is driving us apart to stop us organizing, where capitalists are increasingly privatizing the basic things that we need to live, where our basic urban design is car-centric and impossible to navigate without dropping a fat stack on a car, all these people can do is say... idk, just do things a little differently I guess.\n\nThe rates of depression are skyrocketing and for 99% of cases there's no real biological backing. People's understanding of psychology and genetics suck, and at the root of all this stress is capitalist privatization and centralization that seem to be getting worse day-by-day. But we can't seem to recognize that. \n\nAnyway, idk where I'm going with this. \n\nI guess I'd like to know people's thoughts and frustrations? I want people in my life to stop explaining depression to me in a shit way, and just recognize that this is going to get worse if we don't change our system. peace lol",

You'll notice, for instance, how they'll explain that\u00a0colonialism was fine because all of the indigenous peoples were just doing the exact same thing before Europeans got there anyway, and they don't bother to check to what extent this statement is actually true, because they believe they're operating from first principles.\n\n\nIt's a sort of just world hypothesis; they don't recognize it as ppst hoc rationalization. In fact, that's how they view socialist thought.\n\n\nMarxists, on the other hand, prefer to believe in material causes. Like, yes, mental health problems can be affected by genes.

All I could think about was: how detached from reality are they? \"\n\nMy god, is the fucking material conditions the fucking people live in, and they are right now worsening as time goes by, and the capitalists squeeze the working class dry. It's just, how don't they make the connection?",

How can anyone save enough money when it costs an average of $10k ANNUALLY just to own a car, something our society has made mandatory in almost every state (FYI, that total includes\u00a0 monthly car payments, car insurance, gas and yearly maintenance)?\u00a0\n\n\nJust as an anecdote, I was looking at using the bus to get to my work, which is exactly 6.8mi from my house, to save on gas. I live on the north side of Vegas, NV. I need to be at work at 6am. There's a bus stop right outside my neighborhood I can walk to in about 8 minutes at the very most (3 if the stupid HOA would ever get around to giving me my gate code, the useless fcks) and the bus drops me off less than half a mile to my work, but it only runs once an hour and the ride is estimated to take 26-28 minutes so just to be sure I'm not late, it's best to take the bus at 4:18 vs the 5:12. God, I hate this timeline.\u00a0",

The issue is that they don\u2019t necessarily see the connection between these issues and the issue of capitalism\n\nFor example, Long Covid wouldn\u2019t be nearly as prevalent if Biden and the CDC hadn\u2019t told everyone to unmask + vax & relax prematurely in 2021. And long covid is a huge, huge issue. Covid-19 still being with us is a huge issue. They prematurely stopped precautions all in the name of capitalism. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?\n\nDepression has been an issue for me on and off my entire life no matter how easy my situation was or how little I was being affected by capitalism.\n\nI\u2019m saying this because the point of this post is to link depression to capitalism and while I agree with that point there is a lot of nuance to it - they\u2019re not mutually exclusive. One can exist without the other and I don\u2019t think you can just slap capitalism on it and call it a day. Like yes, SO much of my mental anguish and SI would disappear without the pressure of survival late-stage capitalism. But my brain chemistry would ultimately still be fucked up.",
