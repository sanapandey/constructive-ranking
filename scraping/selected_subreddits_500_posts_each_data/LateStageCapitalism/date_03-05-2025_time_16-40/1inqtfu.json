Tesla sued Top Gear for libel and ended up losing in court. So, as a joke, the next time they did a test drive of a Tesla, they had a team of lawyers in the backseat telling them what they could and couldn\u2019t say about the Tesla so they didn\u2019t get sued frivolously again.",

The show leading into mine is muppets making crank phone calls!' And if there's one thing we can all agree on, it's that Jeremy Clarkson is a muppet.",
