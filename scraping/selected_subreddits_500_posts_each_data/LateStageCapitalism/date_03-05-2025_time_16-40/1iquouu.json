They won't be anywhere near it and they can blame whoever they want for it and take any action they want. Like George W. Bush did. Even if he's lying (like Bush with the Iraq War), anyone who says something about it will be demonized by mindless MAGA drones, like my parents.\n\nRemember 1995? Tim was a white guy, mid 30s, army background. Remember how after almost 700 people died, nobody started profiling white guy, mid 30s, army background.\n\nTo this day, anyone with brown skin coming into the airport gets moved to secondary screening and interrogated by CBP.\n\nObama started to look into extremism in the US military because there were a lot of incidents and then the Republicans started saying \"Oh that's awful what a horrible way to disrespect our heroes!\" and he stopped investigating it. We just get to live with all the violent nutjobs that they produce, apparently.",
