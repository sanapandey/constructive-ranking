There were no real consequences for losing, the Repubs and Dems can lie and commit genocide all they want because they know their turn on the chair is guaranteed.

It's almost like the thing I've been saying all this time about the natural progression of the bipartisan system.\n\nLet me translate \"Democracy is on the ballot\" to \"This ship has holes\" so you can better understand it in your analogy...

Because a ship might not be perfect but holes that you need to consistently be plugging seems like a deadly design flaw to me.\n\n>You are on team sink the ship own it.\n\nAbsolutely, this ship needs to be sunk, it is not fit for the sea/society. It's the \"Cybertruck\" of ships. The \"Boeing\" of ships. \n\nWe need an actual ship without holes to plug... But then what will you do, right?
