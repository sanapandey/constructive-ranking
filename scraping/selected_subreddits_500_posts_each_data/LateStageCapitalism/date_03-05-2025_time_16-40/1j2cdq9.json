It isn\u2019t a reflection that those countries are lazy and gross while the western world prospers. Countries that have those issues do because of the devastating impacts of colonialism, both in the past and currently.\n\nI lived in Madagascar in 2012-2013. I took a photo very similar to the one that the troll posted, of giant trash heaps in the street of the capital city and in the rivers where residents were forced to wash themselves, their clothes, etc. Madagascar was under French rule until the 60s, and in 2009 the country was hit with a military coup. In 2009, France and the U.S. backed Andry Rajoelina\u2019s ousting of President Marc Ravalomanana because Ravalomanana was implementing policies that didn\u2019t benefit France. As a result - violence and chaos took over and the west pulled all financial support and aid from the country. At the same time, so many foreign companies from China to France to Canada and the U.S. are in Madagascar mining its resources. In some regions, you\u2019d see nicely paved roads going from a secluded nice neighborhood to the mine\u2019s headquarters. It was paid for my Canada for the company and the company only, while the community, some of whom worked for the mine for almost nothing, didn\u2019t benefit from any investment. These companies have also been accused of contaminating their water and displacing residents. \n\nMy point is - if I would show those photos from Madagascar to many in the US/Europe, they see filth and \u201cthird world.\u201d They only see violence and chaos in places like Haiti without seeing the through line connecting the impacts of colonialism and occupation to the current state of things there.",
