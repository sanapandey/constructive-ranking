Society benefits when each person becomes their own best self, and, of course, they do as as well.  Capitalism is such a vile system that destroys everything just so a few of the worst examples of humanity can live in opulence.",

That\u2019s why I framed this in terms of Maslow\u2014when people\u2019s basic needs are met, they\u2019re freer to engage in creativity, community, and purpose, which benefits everyone. The problem is, capitalism often keeps people trapped at the survival level, preventing them from reaching that potential.\n\nI think a big challenge (whether under capitalism or any alternative system) is designing structures that *actually* support that kind of collective flourishing without getting hijacked by power imbalances. How do we ensure that \u2018living your best life\u2019 isn\u2019t just an ideal but something structurally supported at scale?",

It's been decades since I'd actively thought about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, but even so it was pretty easy to mentally critique the PR by realizing that there's a whole lot of material that goes into the rest of the pyramid that your job can't and/or shouldn't have any influence over.",

Ironically, Maslow\u2019s framework would actually critique that approach\u2014because it recognizes that you can\u2019t meaningfully focus on growth if your foundation isn\u2019t stable.\"\n\nIt\u2019s wild how often these ideas get repurposed to fit a narrative that ignores material reality. Do you feel like your workplace genuinely invests in its employees\u2019 lower-tier needs, or is it mostly lip service?\n\n\u00a0",

We have needs like self-actualisation even if we're hungry.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat we *do* know is that the idea of the hierarchy is used to write off the differences of people with lesser privileges - \"oh, they're too busy thinking about where their next paycheck is coming from to bother about politics\" etc. So there's a sense in which this zombie theory is used to ignore the desires of the disenfranchised.",
