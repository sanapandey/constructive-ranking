We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d \n\n\nRecreational drug use has absolutely nothing to do with the moral value of a person's character. And as leftists who value true personal liberty we should work to remove this stigma that has been drilled into our brains after years of \"war on drugs\" propaganda. \n\n\nKetamine by itself is just an anesthetic that can cause disassociation depending on the dosage. Many people take it and the experience enriches their lives and helps them move past certain mental blockages because it simply offers them a different mental perspective. \n\n\nThe fact that it's being abused by a person devoid of any introspection is just another testament of how shitty Musk is, because he can't even get there with the extra help of psychodelics. The drugs themselves aren't inherently bad or evil. We should work on ourselves to become more accepting of untypical ways of life in order to attract more people on the fringes to our cause, trust me there are so many people in these underground scenes that feel the oppression of capitalism every day but they think leftists are sticks in the mud who would judge them for dropping acid every once in awhile. I recommend everyone to search for acid communism and try to keep an open mind. This type of shit is just as infuriating as red scare propaganda to me!",

I happen to find it relevant. He wants to colonize Mars and be the leader of the Fourth Reich, for Christ's sake.",
