I have been conditioned to think of China is a brazen police state that is heavily punishing to dissent and allows for nightmarish conditions we would never abide by here.\n\nNow, of course, I know better, but I've reached a point where I'm curious of what it's actually like. Currently, I'm of the mind that it's a state like any other, that does some things notably better than the West and others much worse. They do, after all, have those infamous Foxconn factories there, markedly awful implements of capitalism. How socialist are they, really, and what does the U.S. not want us to know about the country?",

If you don't believe me the GDP per capita in USD terms and HDI figures in those cities are essentially developed country level already, even without taking into account the generally lower cost of everyday essentials in those cities.   \n  \nMy hometown is what's considered a tier 2 city, not as wealthy or important as the tier 1s but still regionally important with about 6 million people. There's really not much difference between living in my hometown compared to Sydney which is considered a 'global city', pretty much anything you can find in Sydney we have it over there as well. \n\nTo your last point, I'm inclined to agree that China is like any other country. with positives and negatives. it's certainly not as nightmarish as some in the West like to portray it as, but also not a socialist/communist utopia. For example buying a house is typically quite difficult in large tier 1 cities, but rent in comparison is no where near as bad as in the US. The good aspects would be better infrastructure overall and that the government seems to have a coherent plan on actually improving the lives of their citizens, which has shown tangible results over the past decades. \n\nMost importantly I suppose is the fact Americans should understand that China's government and Chinese in general just want to live a peaceful and if possible relatively prosperous life, like any other country and their people. The media discourse on China has become so toxic in the West that it has become hard to read the news without seeing shade thrown China's way for just about anything, it's like a weird obsession. It would be good for the media to reconcile their stories of how China is always on the brink of collapse, yet simultaneously the 'greatest threat to democracy/human rights', it's ridiculous that is almost funny. Or at the very least my hope is that people in the West can just keep an open mind about China and similarly I hope Chinese people can keep an open mind about the West as well.",

Granted I haven't lived in China for many years now but I do visit my family back there yearly so some of this info maybe wrong.\n\n\nUtilities are generally provided by nationalized (or at least regionalized) providers (e.g. China Gas for natural gas and \u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u7f51 for electricity). Water, sewer I think are provided by municipal providers.\u00a0\n\n\nTelecom and Internet are provided by 3 major public companies: China Mobile, China Telecom & China Unicom. They are all owned by the state but compete against one another in a weird way.\n\n\nTransportation really depends on the sector. China Railway corp runs all regional level and above commuter rail (including the fancy HSR). Intercity public transit is handled by municipal authorities (e.g. Shanghai Metro). Taxis are provided by private companies and there are a fair number of ride share services (same problem with Uber, drivers get shafted pretty hard). Airlines are a weird mix, the flagship carriers are generally all state-owned corps (Air China, China Eastern & China Southern). Smaller regional and budget airlines are privately owned.\n\n\nHealthcare is weird. There is a mix of big publicly owned hospitals and privately owned clinics. China tried to copy the US system after opening its doors to the west in the late 70s (I know, crazy). There is public health insurance, but till this day a lot of procedures will cost you an arm and a leg. The system is changing though and it's moving back towards a single-payer model. I'm in Canada here, generally here it's more expensive to manage chronic diseases out-patient due to drug costs not being covered, the opposite is true in China. Major operations will cost you loads of cash but most drugs are covered to some degree.",

As much as I'd love to have faith in humanity and believe we are able to transcend the laws of nature, the past, present, and future doesn't give any evidence to that.\n\nWhat makes you think communism eliminates wealth classes? Communism pushes for everyone to be paid according to their labor value, not that everyone should earn the same exact wage. Does that not create disparity between every profession? And about exploitation, what makes you think eliminating classes will decrease, let alone eliminate exploitation at all? In a true single class system, everyone earns the same. Disregarding the massive problems with implementing, maintaining and enforcing this system, how do you address the labour force? If a baker and coal miner works for the same payment, is the miner not being exploited, when he puts in more effort for the same reward?\n\nI find it funny that you call me ignorant, when you deliberately side-stepped everything else that I mentioned as the reason why China is socialist. Have you heard of government policies? Did you know it is possible for a government to implement policies from other schools of thinking if they think fits their society? Germany's economy is classified as a Social-Market economy, it has a large welfare system, public healthcare and education, and plenty of regulations against exploitative companies. They take what is good from socialism and communism, and combine it with what is needed in capitalism. But Germany isn't China. Germany promote liberalism like any other democracy. China promotes surveillance of the public for the greater benefit of the people. Germany's coming election will see the right gain even more control, and perhaps implement more policies benefitting the bourgeois, something that won't happen in China. You're hyperfocusing on one point and ignoring the greater picture. By your definition of socialist state, there is no single state in the history of our existence that is \"Socialist\", it only exist on paper.\n\nHere's some wisdom for ya. \u7eb8\u4e0a\u5f97\u6765\u7ec8\u89c9\u6d45\uff0c\u7edd\u77e5\u6b64\u4e8b\u8981\u8eac\u884c.

You're reaching far dude. \n\nIf they are a Spanish speaker and simply shared cause they enjoyed it, I have no problem with that. However I'm assuming that the person is sharing something with the intention to educate and dispel the negative perceptions people have with China, and I'm just trying to say that if that's your goal, then it would be more effective to share something that is in a language most people here can understand. To me, the scenario kind of is like if a english teacher passed around a book that's in another language and expected their students to learn from it despite most students speaking english.",

If you talk negatively about the motherland while living there and start amassing an audience, you're in quite some trouble.\n\nOther than that, some might try to counterbalance the overly negative content made about China from abroad, esp in the USA.\n\nIn the end, everyone loses.\n\nP.S.

When we landed in China and got to immigration. I found that I had misplaced my phone. The security saw my panic and came to see if she could help. She radioed to plane for them to search my phone right away and told me not to worry. Eventually, my phone was found, and we went our way. This was my first impression of China and coming off less than pleasant experience at Korea layover, so it made it an even bigger positive impression.\n\nNotable thoughts:\n\nWe had kids with us, and they were able to roam more freely and can be quite a distance from us, and we weren't worried after a while. Certainly not how it is when we are walking around the city here in the U.S.\n\nThe payment system is so convenient because I can grab and pay for things so easily. Every place accepts \"Alipay\" from markets to restaurants and even vendors in the streets. All I had to do was put my credit card in that app, and I was able to pay for everything.\n\nThe streets are very clean, no black gum stain everywhere\n\nIt was during the summer, so it was very hot. Good thing there are drink places literally everywhere. As an avid cold drinks drinker, their drinks stores make Starbucks drinks look like the gas station coffee cup, and I was paying only $1-$2",

Maybe not the highest quality, but certainly no worse than whatever beans a gas station would have. They do use a bunch of gimmicky mixins, syrups, creamers so maybe that is masking it a bit. The coffee itself is just coffee. If you get a plain drip coffee or a simple espresso drink it's not notably different than making your own or buying from am indie coffee shop, other than the quality of the beans and the care put into the preparation both likely being lower. It's not like they use instant coffee or get it pre-made in bags or something. \n\nI have been boycotting Starbucks for ages due to their support for Israel and their union busting activities, so I'm not trying to defend them. Just interested in what makes them seem different.",

And they go out of their way to help everyone all the freakin' time even with the most trivial things. They help foreigners, the elderly, the handicapped. I saw two police in the Beijing subway. They stood behind two handicapped persons (I think one was blind), one police held the hand of the handicapped, and my Western-trained brain just thought \"damn they want to handcuff them, they mistreat citizens just like in my home country in the West). Turns out they just held hands, chatted with them friendly and accompanied them ALL THE WAY TO THE DESTINATION to help them reach it safely! I learned from my wife who was with me at the time that it's normal that police helps anyone who demands it, even if it's just friendly chats if someone is lonely, helping elderly with groceries, giving advice to foreigners where to find the cheapest hotels with English speaking staff, or bigger things like risking their lives during natural disasters. If someone goes crazy and attacks a police with a knife, the Chinese police never shoots, they use a big \"fork-stick\" (called a \"man catcher\") with soft cushion ends to fixate the person and then de-escalate by talking, asking about life troubles, and helping the person regain their normal mental state. Often they end up drinking tea together and finding solutions together. China feels much much more like a giant family than a place with a million fractions who hate each other.\n\nThis is just one of countless examples on countless other topics I could give. Topics which we have been lied to in the West.",

So more then half of people accused of crimes are let go without formal charges. They only indict if they\u2019re sure theirs enough evidence to convict. The bad thing is that you can be held for 23 days in pre-trial detention simply for being accused so they can constantly question you. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice_system_of_Japan\n\nAs of 2001, Japan has a conviction rate of over 99.8%, even higher than contemporary authoritarian regimes.[2] Scholars say the biggest reason for Japan\u2019s very high conviction rate is the country\u2019s low prosecution rate and the way Japan calculates its conviction rate is different from other countries.[3][4][5][6] According to them, Japanese prosecutors only pursue cases that are likely to result in convictions, and not many others.[3][4][5][6] According to Professor Ryo Ogiso of Chuo University, prosecutors defer prosecution in 60% of the cases they receive, and conclude the remaining 30% or so of cases in summary trials. This summary trial is a trial procedure in which cases involving a fine of 1,000,000 yen or less are examined on the basis of documents submitted by the public prosecutor without a formal trial if there is no objection from the suspect. Only about 8% of cases are actually prosecuted, and this low prosecution rate is the reason for Japan\u2019s high conviction rate.[5][7][4] According to Keiichi Muraoka, a professor at Hakuoh University, the 60% suspension of prosecution in Japan is due to excessive fear that prosecutors will lose the case and ruin their reputation.[3]\n\nIdk how similar Chinas and japans criminal justice system is given that South Korea has widely different criminal justice system than japans. What I found interesting in Chinas justice system from what I know is the average sentence for a single murder is life with chance of parole after 13 years and a second murder is life with chance of parole after 15-20 years which is more lenient then a lot of countries. Also I noticed Chinas death penalty is majority of the times applied too \u201ccrimes against society\u201d or crimes that affect a lot of people that\u2019s why lots of billionaires get death penalty in China for fraud.",

The thing he said that sticks with me the most is how clean it is because they've converted almost entirely to EVs in the cities. That and it's quiet too. I spent some time over there in 2012/2013 on my cruise ship job and the smog was very real, you couldn't see from one side of the port to the other. To hear that that's been all cleared up is truly mind-boggling. \n\nHe also said that when he scanned his passport to leave, the picture that popped up to confirm his identity was from some random time when he was boarding a train. So, yeah, the surveillance is pretty intense. While it's fair to say that the US has really given them a bad rap through propaganda, I would always keep in mind that they are a top global power and act accordingly.",

All of the mentioned negatives above were the total opposite in China. I'm not even exaggerating. Especially the insane FRIENDLINESS of everyone I interacted with in China. And no matter if citizens, police, school kids, government employees, doctors... they where all so freakin' wholesome, helpful, and patient. I was not used to this from my life in Germany. The convenience, the affordability of amazing food and modern metros for the average citizen, the lively public places with free stuff to do and see. The Chinese find this normal but to me it all made me feel like a filthy rich Billionaire without spending a single cent... But the genuine friendliness and care is what I truly miss the most. I fell straight into depression after the reverse-culture shock hit me on arrival in Germany. Some things are for sure better in Germany but those things are not as important to me than all the things that are better in China. Idk maybe one has to experience it to understand.\n\nEdit: It's obvious but I will write it anyway so people don't accuse me of pretending perfection or Utopia: Of course China is not a perfect country and there is always room for improvement (e.g. too high studying pressure on kids). But their past achievements and the direction it's heading at high-speed is simply amazing.",

The worst is when people act like people in China aren't free and that it's some sort of scifi level surveillance police state. Anyone who actually lived there can tell you that you feel more free in China if you're just a normal person living their life and not some revolutionary wannabe trying to stir up shit. You can basically do anything you want(that's not blatantly illegal) and you can negotiate things. Also you don't have to act any differently when there's cops around. I find being free to live affordably with an actual clean cheap public transit system to be more important than being able to make a scene in public about how much I hate the government.",

And despite constant attacks and hardship (Japanese fascists committing genocide against China, UK forcing opium onto China and attacking China, driving the country into chaos and deep poverty and illness, which all lowered life expectancy in China to merely 32 year pre revolution). Now life expectancy in China is higher than in the USA. And so is life satisfaction and government approval. China also does more than any other country for clean energy (wind and solar power, planting record number of trees etc.) and to reduce poverty around the globe (building hospitals and infrastructure in 3rd world countries, sometimes even for completely free, where Western countries only give moral lectures and drop bombs). \n\nChina achieved all of this for their country and the world as a whole, not in spite of their government, but precisely because of their government. It is a government that came out of the people, from the biggest party in the world. It is not a perfect government but they are constantly improving and self-criticising.   \nAnd their successes are very real and historic in scale and quality.

Everyone there was SO kind, infrastructure  wise they were light years ahead of us even then, Nothing but an amazing experience. Our family friends lived in a beautiful suburb with nice houses and businesses, they did have a dedicated driver because the traffic was crazier than they were used to in the US. \n\nWe spent a weekend in Beijing. The hotel pool was in the style of a beach that got shallow on one end, but with pink tile floor and real actresses dressed as mermaids. Not in a cheesy disney world way (a place my parents also took me during the 2002 cheap flights era lol), it was so beautiful and forever a flashbulb memory from my 6 yr old mind. Many of my earliest memories are all over china: the great wall, forbidden city, markets with amazing artisan crafts, also this one store with bootleg DVDs i thought was SO cool. I still have shrek and harry potter DVDs with chinese language covers from this place. I specifically remember multiple locals asking for pictures of me with their kids because i had blonde hair at the time and we were speaking english, My mom also started taking pictures of me with the local kids when this occurred, and i have one with two girls my age in front of the forbidden city, they must have come from a dance recital because they were in cute tutus. Every kid and parents were always so welcoming and excited to see visitors from the US (in stark contrast to my later trips to europe where people were downright hostile to americans), despite speaking a different language. I have nothing but fond memories of this formative experience, and hope more than anywhere else to visit again one day. As an adult i admire the equitable and earth friendly society they have built there, and hope my own country can learn from it and be more like china now- virtually no homelessness, affordable electric vehicles, and collectivist values. No doubt the experience influenced my belief in and commitment to leftist values. Side-note: even little kids benefit, learn from, and appreciate exposure to cultures different from their own. Shoutout to my parents for choosing to bring me along on that adventure \ud83e\ude75",

            "body": "I went to China for an extended period last year. My wife is Chinese, and she's a researcher of Chinese feminisms. \n\nChina is socialist in name only. In the schools they'll teach China is a socialist country, but it has no characteristics of one; worker's rights are nearly non-existent, and making money/profit is what most people value highest. The socialist ideals however, are bend towards patriotism; work hard, so China will grow. People believe such meritocratic ideas much more than in the west, because if you're like 50 years old in China, you have experienced significant economic growth in your lifetime, so you've seen a positive effect of state-capistalism and will promote it to your children.\n\nLow workers rights have some interesting effects; there's personel everywhere. In the dead of night, in an empty subway station, there will be 8 security guards. Some taxi rides cost literally pennies, even in the local economy (we saw taxi rides for 10% the price of a coffee in the same city). Getting deliveries is cheap and fast; you can order a single drink to your home and it'll be there in 15 minutes for the exact same price as in the shop. This level of convience is only possible through exploitation, but since spending money boosts the economy there is social stigma on NOT making use of these services. \n\nThings being state controlled has interesting effects as well. I went to the hospital there, and within an hour I had not only seen a doctor for original consultation, I had recieved my first round of acupuncture treatment, and had 4 different medicines on me. Providing healthcare in a city of 21 million requires effiency, and that's what they have. The drawback? No privacy whatsover. Multiple doctors seeing patients in same room, with everyone overhearing each other. Treatment delivered in a room with open door, people walking in and out constantly. This is of course different for more servere/intimate procedures, but it was very intersting to see. For me, that privacy was a price I was very willing to pay for efficiency (compared to UK healthcare, where waiting lists of basic procedures are ~18 months). \n\nLack of privacy is common in other places as well. Many things are booked with your ID card, or as a foreigner, your passport. Think of museums, theater shows, but also hotels, and trains, and tol roads. Cash is non-existent, all payment through Alipay or Wechat, which are easily tracked. If you're doing anything in China, the government can track it. \n\nAs a regular tourist, or even regular citizen, you don't really experience much of that, but I'm sure it helps them keep an eye on organisers and protesters. The chinese feminism movements operate mostly from outside China, because many activists got arrested and intimitated by the police when they still lived in China. Feminism is not something the governement wants you talking about, and they make that very clear; I'm sure it's similar for other social causes. \n\nSome other results I noticed was that in my entire time there, I didn't see a single visibly disabled person or homeless person. This of course doesn't mean they don't exist, it means they are invisibilised. In general \"standing out\" in China is hard, and both the state and general culture will make it harder for you. The weird exception to it is if you're visibly non-Chinese like me. I'm non-binary but presented as male in my time there, but realised partway through the trip that I'd be happy to walk around in a dress there. People already stared at the tall blonde guy, and a dress would just have been \"western male fasion\". However, a Chinese person doing the exact same thing would be ostracised and told off within minutes. \n\nThe biggest interpersonal/cultural difference I noticed was the speed of things. My family in law is always busy, constantly doing things. If they want to talk to you they will call you 5x in a row and be angry if you don't pick up, regardless of whether you were busy or not. This goes for social things, but also work. Many family takes work phone calls at 8pm on Sundays, because you're never \"off the clock\". And all the social things are outside, and involve spending money. A lazy day in watching movies at home doesn't exist; if you're not actively working you're meant to be out spending money. We were absolutely exhausted for a lot of the time, and it took a lot of effort (and interpersonal conflict) to convince local friends and family there that we needed time to rest as well, and that rest could happen quietly at home instead of at a spa. \n\nTL;DR: \"I'm of the mind that it's a state like any other, that does some things notably better than the West and others much worse\" is pretty much exactly it. Personally I don't think I could ever live there, but I'm happy to visit my FIL regularly, and I think countries in the West could benefit greatly from learning certain things from China (and vise versa).",

I'm from China but live in Canada now, and my family benefitted from the massive economic growth so I have a lot more fondness towards the Country but I pretty much agree with everything you said here.\n\n\nI love daily life in Chinese cities. It's convenient, necessities are affordable, traveling around is easy and you don't need a car, mostly everywhere is walkable. There's endless things to do, things to try, food is way cheaper and much better tasting than Canadian shit (sorry lmao). The lack of privacy doesn't bother me much, cuz I find being amongst the crowd to be good for the soul. It's like being in NYC, where you wake up to some dude on street level yelling at their ex up on the 3rd floor balcony. Sometimes it's good to be reminded that I'm not the main character, it's some other guy's time in the spotlight.\n\n\nBut I also see the sociatal problems festering, like worker exploitation and wage stagnation, growing wealth gap, rising cost of living (housing especially). Like you said, the convenience and vibrancy of Chinese life is built upon exploitation and surveliance. Being in Canada for so long makes me uncomfortable with the number of cameras tracking me from the moment I step into customs to the moment I arrive at my grandparents place. I don't need to carry around tickets and stuff for the trains but I need to scan my ID to get on it.\u00a0\n\n\nBut it's also undeniable to me that China is much safer and vibrant if you just go about your own business. The surveliance quashes descent but also keeps crime at bay. Drugs are much less of a thing. Police are generally helpful, even if they will \"invite you to tea\" if you voice opposition. My QOL is much higher in China simply because there's more shit to do outside my own home and I don't feel unsafe walking down the street at 3AM.\n\n\n\nAuthoritarian capitalism is a weird beast. It's progress at all costs, and it's able to achieve amazing things like it did in China, but the question lies in progress for whom. So far, because the CPC/CCP's source of power comes an agreement with the Chinese people to raise their standards of living in exchange for exceptional power, the benefactors for such progress is aligned with the majority of Chinese people still. I hope the day where this alignment changes will never come.\u00a0\n\n\nSide note, it seems to me that recently (especially in online spaces) LGBTQIA+ visibility had sharply risen. Maybe it's because I'm a Bi dude, but I've seen the algorithm on Bilibili and Rednote feed me more Chinese homegrown LGBTQIA+ content (and creators) since COVID. I also see more Gay and Les couples out in the open when I'm on my yearly visit back in China, and more unassuming small pride decos on subway riders' backpacks. Needless to say all of this is anicdotal but I think younger people are low-key driving a sociatal change towards more LGBTQIA+ acceptance in China.",

Which IMO is a significant improvement",

I took my young kids to see it for the first time when they are old enough to analyze it and they said: \u201cDad? Why does America suck so bad compared to china?\u201d For the young it\u2019s alot of fun. The density of people and cheapness of food and goods means that for a $20 dollars you can have alot of food and fun on a night out. The kids loved all the pop up outdoor amusement parks with go-karts, mini fishing ponds, air soft shooting ranges, crazy slides and park rides that are probably too dangerous for our legal system all open late for very cheap. The parks are all manicured very nicely and lit up like a psychedelic dreamland so it\u2019s safe at night and families are out walking in them after dinner and you can get beers and bbq anywhere. \n\nThe downside to china is that you need to develop relationships to get things done. If you don\u2019t know anyone you will have red tape and a challenge to do business. But if you are well connected and get to know the right people you can bypass a lot of that and do things unrestricted or more freely",

It's by no means a perfect country. It just wasn't the communist dystopia I was being led to believe \n\nI had my own apartment in a 3rd tier city called Shenyang. Don't let the 3rd tier title fool you. My city had more people living in than NYC. It was a huge city to a Florida boy. I lived in an area of town called Joy City. It was filled with restaurants and shopping centers in interconnected malls. I could easily walk from my apartment to the subway station and then to my school all in less than 30 min. \n\nThe government was never really an issue for me. I had to check in with them when I first moved in and then whenever I traveled outside of the country for more than a few days. I was legally allowed to work in China, so I had a visa that made traveling around easy. You would see cameras everywhere, but i honestly felt safer from them. The only time I ever had a run-in with the police is they did a random visa check on our school to make sure we weren't employing illegal teachers. I showed them my passport and visa, and that was it. \n\nThe internet sucks... it just does as a foreigner. You can get a VPN, and they may work so you can get a Western website. It felt like playing whack a mole with the government, though. I'd get one, and it would be great for a few weeks and then get shut down. If I could read the language better, I probably could have found better options. \n\nThe people were awesome. I barely spoke the language and can't read at all. Everyone was amazing, though. I was still somewhat of an oddity to a lot of people, so there was plenty of staring and asking for photos to be taken. I also am a very hairy dude, and my students loved to pet my arms. I almost never had an issue with locals outside of that. \n\nThis is a lot, but i wanted to share my experience.

                            "body": "Marxism requires the abolishment of class, and that means ALL forms of class.\n\nMarxism is a science, not a utopia. The ability to abolish all forms of class structure does not make a country Marxist; rather, (Marxism-Leninism) is purely a form of government. China is an existing Marxist state. We can look into it in two lenses: the idealistic lens, and the materialist lens. While ideally, any Marxist state should abolish class, materialistically, a classless, prosperous society is not something that can be overnight, especially regarding imperialist forces from within and externally, in addition to productive forces and infrastructure for transforming a state down a socialist path. It should be noted that China did not have either of those things, and still, to an extent has a large portion of its population still in poverty. It has been doing a lot, both in the past decades, and several years, to pull this large 1.4 billion of its population out of poverty, obviously to a greater extent than any other developing state has ever realized. While countless millions still live in an underdeveloped society, China has been doing a lot to build these material conditions to enable socialism, hence why average wages have quintupled across the country almost every decade since 1970, and a whopping 800 million have been pulled out from extreme poverty altogether. In the Marxist sense, China\u2019s current view is to erase its poverty entirely to continue its transition down the socialist path. It was essentially forced into its position today by being isolated by both the US trading block and the USSR after the Sino Soviet split, facing stagnation. As a result, it opened up its economy and allowed for foreign investment into its work force, part of which helped it make the large leap into the second largest economy. With this money and resources to trade with other nations, it is only a part of what allowed it to continue its rapid industrialization and perform its poverty alleviation campaigns which have been so successful.\nAfter opening up its economy, has China headed back on a path towards socialism? I do believe so. I do remain cautiously optimistic, and highly critical of it just like any economy with a large capitalist class, but it has been making strives as of late. Other than the massive poverty alleviation campaigns, it has publicized more businesses, workers rights have massively improved, it has become self sufficient on renewable resources and energy, pollution has MASSIVELY decreased, and while the private economy does remain a large focus in helping develop its large impoverished population, it has set a goal towards socialism in 30 years.\nIs it state capitalist? Sure, call it that. Call it market socialist. I don\u2019t care. But names are just names. Any situation as complex as China deserves much more nuance and discussion rather than claiming it isn\u2019t Marxist for abolishing class structure, or whatnot. I recommend looking at China through the materialist lens, asking yourself why it is in the position it\u2019s in today not why it isn\u2019t an ideal utopia created in your head. Because, as I said, Marxism is not utopian. It is scientific.",

When I went on their subway I saw more ads by the CCP telling citizens to be filial to their parents, loyal to the country, dont embarass the country, etc. Its heavily based on confucian values.\n\nThought it was pretty odd to see more of these posters posted by the CCP than actual adverts!",

The people I understand required a little more grooming when it came to hospitality and personal hygiene but considering the trauma and experience they were carrying from their recent history I believe they would need more time.\nAnd one more thing I found interesting, the new generation was tall, I don't know how they did that. Probably some sort of hormone therapy or something but damn their kids and teens were tall specially in urban areas.\nThey had one of the best medical coverage I have ever seen plus their diet was also very positive as in processed snacks and sodas were not as popular as their traditional snacks and ice teas and dairy drinks.\nThe government has things properly controlled, indont even recall being stopped by police once even though my dad did get speeding tickets due to cameras. Crime in general was very low and one of the most amazing thing was how people cared about these standards. If someone litters they would all start shaming him for doing so.\nLiving their and seeing their daily routines and the facilities/utilities their government provided gives an insight into why and how they have progressed so well.\nHowever, their ethics (personal) and hygiene needed improvement and I'm quite sure they have probably improved a huge deal in the last decade.",

Keep in mind I was in a very small place on the coast, so a very different experience from Shanghai probably.\nThe good: the people were extremely polite and friendly, went out of their way to help even though they spoke almost 0 English. I saw no extreme poverty, as in other far east countries, and people seem to have a basic standard of living not too far from that of a middle of the pack economically country. You also had a feeling of safety all around, though that is often the case in smaller towns around the world.\nThe bad: the work hours were horrible. People were routinely pulling 12 hour shifts in conditions noticeably harsher than what I am used to, and I don't come from a rich country. While large industrial locations kept to a safety standard, such as proper procedure and safety equipment, small scale construction and such had literally 0 safety guidelines.\nI went through Beijing and the air was brownish from the pollution, which was once again a shock to me. And while someone in this thread said that police were more friendly, I was there during some celebrations and I did routinely see policemen with light riot gear and bamboo staffs.\nFinally, I did see quite a bit of favoritism to party members, such as cutting in line by showing a party ID and tinted glass limos with communist flags.\nAll in all, from what I saw china is a country far from what both the capitalist propaganda and the china glazers (sorry mates you know who you are) say. There's decency, both in the people and their economic situation, and china is definitely not close to a truly poor country, like poor African or south/ south east Asian countries, but there is very visibly quite a ways to go in multiple fronts for the people to reach a standard of living close to what the rich western countries have.",

            "body": "Went to China over the Xmas break for a month. I spent my time in Sichuan, Beijing, Xi'an, Hunan, and Shanghai with a lot of small and ancient towns in between.\n\nOverall, I loved China. Food is really good, people are really friendly (very forward which can be a lot at first. People will just say what's on their mind. If you're fat, they'll tell you, if you're cute, they'll tell you lol), the country is very beautiful. Also, they've done a lot of environmental stuff in recent years. Not as smoggy (I went during their winter though so idk) as it probably was in the 90's and 2000's. Electric cars are all the rage!\n\nI would say it's a capitalist country. Or at least as capitalist as other countries I've been to. Obviously more \"planned\" than other economies. But Shanghai for example is just a Chinese New York in my opinion. Despite the capitalism, the people themselves love communist ideals and symbols. There are hammer and sickles everywhere. Communist mantras all over the place. Pictures of Mao in a lot of shops and you can get Mao's face on pretty much any souvenir.\n\nOf course, the government is very tight. My google pixel was essentially useless over there so I had to get a Chinese phone to do anything. Of course, this came with the great Chinese firewall, so a lot of stuff was blocked (my VPN sucked, get a Hong Kong eSIM if you can). Face ID is pretty common, cameras everywhere, and police presence is pretty apparent. However on police, there are kinda two levels of police. Your normal day to day cops that are pretty friendly and I feel mainly there to direct traffic flow and give directions. And there are the more serious cops that you've heard of. They're the ones who are there to protect the Chinese government.\n\nTalking politics is pretty frowned upon and there are places where jokes and whatnot aren't the best thing to do. Places like the Forbidden Palace and Tiananmen Square (especially) you should be a bit more serious. Not too serious like you can't talk or whatever, but don't be obnoxious. A lot of locals would just tell us to be serious in certain places. Religious buildings too. We went to a monastery in Tibet and of course had to be very serious.\n\nWith safety, I think it's one of the safest countries I've been to. I'm not sure if that's because Chinese people are very trustworthy, or if you do something wrong you get sent to a gulag lol.\n\nOf course, China has a lot of human rights issues that get hidden, swept under the rug, or you generally don't mention it. Uyghur camps are an example of this.\n\nI definitely do want to go back again and see more of China though and I do recommend people go! Keep in mind this was my perspective as an Australian on holiday. Can't comment on growing up there or living there. But a few friends are from China and they seem to have a similar stance of \"it's got its issues, but it's home\".",

The common people are incredible. Gratuitous, kind, polite, curious, generous, absolutely amazing. \n\nWe were essentially \"hired talent\" for extreme sports. It became evident very quickly that due to circumstances beyond our control, we weren't going to be able to fulfill our \"contractual\" obligations to our client, a Chinese national with extensive ties to the Chinese government. \n\nWhile we were NOT forcably held against our will, we were transported everyday to our work location for 8-12 hours just to sit in a white room with no Internet access or other communication. We were over 100 miles from the nearest airport with true desert in any direction. We were also put up in the nicest hotel in town and wined and dined every night. We had an interpreter who was sympathetic to the expectations of our client, who we began to discover was filtering our communications/translations to be more PC. \n\nIt also became evidently clear that our hotel rooms were bugged, and our conversations were being recorded and reviewed by the client. (This sounds paranoid, but we tested our theory in innocuous ways) Then continued any sensitive conversations on nighttime walks. \n\nWhen we asked to leave, we were told by our client that \"they are worried they may not be able to collect on their investment\" and did not permit us to leave until conversations with our leadership panned out which took around 10 days. Our treatment did not change during this time and we were eventually given a ride into Yinchuan to depart back for the states after a series of strong personal bribe attemps, that we rejected, due to our desire to leave the country legally/ethically. \n\nOverall, 10/10. Would go back to China. The propaganda in the states is not true, as usual. As they say \"it's hard to hate up close\" and the common folks are incredible. If money wasn't involved, everything would have been a wonderful experience.",

I greatly respect the national culture, the inventions/inventiveness of the Chinese people, aspects of the religious/spiritual/philosophical belief systems, etc. It was such an impressive place that invaders who made incursions into China, like the Mongols and Manchus, basically decided to adopt the local culture rather than try to impose their own! \n\nIt\u2019s also inspiring to me how a large mass of people, acting to further one goal, can be SO powerful, and can basically accomplish just about anything. When they were developing their country at their most frenzied pace, they were constructing the modern day city of Rome on just about a weekly basis lol. For even huge and complex problems like climate change etc, it makes me feel like if we get hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of people mobilized toward a goal, there\u2019s basically nothing we can\u2019t accomplish.\n\nBut, the overdeveloped & overbearing state, the political system which seems to trend towards autocracy & despotism from the imperial system to the present day?

(obviously shit happens in china and the culture is very misogynistic but that\u2019s not the point i\u2019m making rn.) she couldn\u2019t believe i came with her to keep her safe. so i asked about the cameras, and the vibe changed. she said that the chinese ppl love the cameras because they keep everyone safe, but in all honesty\u2026 it was absolutely a scripted answer because everyone says almost the exact same thing. they police themselves because they know they\u2019re continuously policed. \n\nso what about extortion? i saw luxury cars mostly only in shanghai or beijing. almost all had military insignias on them or the drivers were in military gear. interesting to see but couldn\u2019t really understand why. fast forward, i meet a friend who owns a video wall company, they would buy direct from the chinese manufacturer, while there they took them out and hung out for the night. they described in painstaking detail (once completely hammered and away from others) how once they reached a certain amount of profit, govt officials showed up, demanded millions, and basically run an old school protection racket against them, only\u2026 there\u2019s nothing they need to be protected from. they just pay it or the govt takes it all and shuts it down. \u201cpay me or pay more taxes\u201d. \n\nand lastly, escape. no one i met can make enough money to actually travel and potentially get out, outside of scholarships, job offers, etc. it seemed *incredibly* hard to get out of the country even for a vacation. obvious exceptions but still. \n\nanyways. i\u2019d type more but it\u2019s 330am now. \n\ntl;dr. \n\nchina is fucking incredible and terrifying at the same time. america has a long way to go to catch up in so many ways, but our personal freedoms are *very* clear when over there. \n\ngo visit. it\u2019s worth it.\n\nedit: adding that i did not see sweat shops or anything but it was clear they existed somewhere. the entire fashion trade there is wildly inconsistent with what\u2019s real what\u2019s not etc. but you would be surprised how much real stuff gets left behind due to legal reasons. so many designers claim they\u2019re made in italy, france, etc. but are almost completely made in china, and due to laws around exports they sometimes leave actual things behind (or these places hid and make test products by the thousands) and you can easily purchase them. \n\ni\u2019m certain horrible working conditions exist there but they weren\u2019t clearly visible to someone on tour. it\u2019s not like i\u2019d be going to see that stuff near concert venues.\n\nedit 2: spelling, grammar, formatting.",

As immensely friendly and helpful as they were, they couldn't do anything, I asked a police officer, who then directed me to a station security officer. While slightly bored/annoyed, they tried to help me to the best of their ability, and were, overall, pretty nice. Sadly didn't manage to find him, but reviewed the monitoring and asked the train conductor whether he was there. They couldn't find him, and he didn't get off at my stop. Walked around a bit, met some really nice people in a tea store. Ran into my companion sometime later.\n\nFor the context, he was a German citizen, but appeared clearly middle eastern.\n\nHis experience was vastly different than mine - after missing his stop he was shouted at by several people at the train station he got off at, had to argue with a salesperson at the counter so that she would let him buy a ticket back, and was treated with disgust and contempt most of the time. And when he travelled with me later, there was an apparent change in the attitudes of everyone around us - looks of curiosity changed into ones of suspicion, security everywhere (and there's a lot of it) kept eyeing us all the time. In one incident, when one of the gates in the metro wouldn't accept his ticket, he got into trouble with the metro guards, and if not for a Chinese-speaking Serbian who defused the situation, I'm pretty sure he would have gotten arrested.\n\nThough overall, China is nowhere as bad as Western propaganda claims it to be, it is far from paradise. A lot of surveillance everywhere, for better or worse, and there is security and armed police swarming everywhere. All metro stations have riot shields kept ready at the entrances, and all trains are patrolled by cops with automatic weapons. On the other hand, it appears genuinely prosperous, and beautiful. There's a lot of technology everywhere, you see very little poverty. Shenzhen, especially, is a very new, modern city.\n\nAs for the people, well. I don't like making blanket statements, but both my co traveller and I have come out of mainland China with an impression that it is, well, simply put, a racist society. My friend told me that he never experienced this level of discrimination and mistreatment. And while I met a lot of lovely, very friendly Chinese people (and every single Chinese mainlander I met outside of China was a really cool person), the difference in the way I was treated by security staff alone vs when travelling with a non-white friend was violently clear. And it speaks for itself.",
