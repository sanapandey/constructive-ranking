Obesity, diabetes, drug overdoses, suicides, firearms, and homicides, among other common causes of death, were less lethal than poverty.\u00a0",

            "body": "A fundamental contradiction of capitalism is that it creates widespread poverty at a greater rate than it amasses wealth into the hands of the few.  In order for the rich to get richer, the masses must get poorer.  This is a CONSEQUENCE of capitalism; it is a NECESSARY requirement to how it operates.  It cannot function otherwise.  \n\nCapitalism is the greatest crime against humanity to have been committed.  Those who have have been waging it must be brought to justice.\n\n*\\*non-violently, no violence is advocated with this post, violence is not supported or advocated.*",

Some of the cities have a bus that will travel around the city, and there is a bus that will go between the cities a couple times a day, but if I suddenly lost my car I would have to Uber to the grocery store to the doctors office and I would quickly run out of money or die.\n\nMy mom\u2018s dashboard malfunctioned so it wasn\u2019t going to pass inspection because the check engine light couldn\u2019t come on. \u00a0She could still see the speed because the little screen that controls the stereo shows the speed, but all the other lights were unavailable In the area where the speedometer is. \u00a0There was no way she would ever be able to get that fixed. She was living on SSI and after paying her rent and her car payment she had $20 a month left over.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s last term people like my mom were only getting $16 a month in food stamps.\n\nSo for food, toilet paper, gas for the car, cleaning products, any dental care she would need, soap, anything, she had a total of $36 every month.\n\nHow would you budget to do $1000 repair on a car when you have $36 every month after paying rent and car?\n\nSo she chose to end it quickly rather than slowly starve to death in her apartment.\n\nAnd I really miss my mom.\u00a0",
