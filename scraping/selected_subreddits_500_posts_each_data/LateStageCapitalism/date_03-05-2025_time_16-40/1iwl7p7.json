    "selftext": "I'm not even going to link any articles because they're all so fucked up.  \\[SearchEngineThat'sNotGoogle\\] it and you'll find one. Basically, this dude lost his last $500 on a crypto rugpull and then shot himself in the head after he said \"If I die make me a meme coin\".\n\nSo he shoots himself in the head and is bleeding out on X Live and these motherfuckers are creating memecoins while the he's dying.\n\nLate Stage Capitalism, indeed\n\nEDIT: I'm going to add this after reading through the comments. The guy was probably a piece of shit, almost certainly a virulent capitalist, probably responsible for the situation he found himself in. That said, I think the tragedy here is that money has become this important in our society, that somebody would kill themselves over losing it, that people would then profit from his death.\n\nAnd I'd like to remind everybody that he was somebody's child and they're going to bury him BECAUSE OF CAPITALISM. Nobody should have to bury a child.\n\nEVEN MORE EDITS: To address the accusations that this is fake by a couple of bootlickers in the sub. There is a gofundme for a person using his picture that claims he committed suicide 2 days ago. His name was Arnold Haro. He was 23. He had a one year old daughter. Seriously, all you have to do is put 'crypto trader kills self' in the search engine of your choice and even if his story doesn't come up, plenty of others will ",

In other words, if I believe another deserves to be abused, then I believe my own abuse is deserved (whether consciously or not; whether I admit or deny it). This is true because I, like every other person here, am a human being with a life.  \n\nI don't believe anyone should be abused (not even abusers themselves); I don't believe abuse is ever justifiable, and I don't believe life in and of itself isn't inherently valuebale and of worth (nor do I believe some lives have greater value than others). And I get the impression you take the same position. \n\nI hope those who don't agree can be honest with themselves about why they hold the beliefs about human life that they do and how that reflects their feelings about themselves and their own inherent value (or lack thereof).",

Online, the term is used in a similar vein as Kill Yourself, in reference to posts that are considered bad or incompetent, as well as referring to people who have committed suicide, and in images it is commonly paired with \"You should look into it\" or \"Become one\".\n\nthere's at least 5 people on linkedin named Arnold Haro, so maybe it's just a coincidence. stranger things have happened. it would be a terribly clever way to profit from faking your own death, though",

It is a fact some people are hardwired to die. They literally can\u2019t be happy and sure a hard life doesn\u2019t help but it cannot be blamed I have basically no income get jumped all the time can\u2019t afford medical and can\u2019t get let alone hold a job because of all the injuries piled up healed or otherwise. I am still able to smile genuinely most of the day. look I am not arguing for or against any syste. However if we put caps on the essential shit and let people charge what they want for the art,toys,and other genuine extras. As well as converted our infrastructure to a more green powered and less gridded set up we could solve the \u201ccapitalist problem\u201c it\u2019s basically limited capitalism or regulated capitalism. Everything stays the same we just don\u2019t allow necessary resources to be unreachable and fix infrastructure to be more affordably maintained and cost effective. ( most of this can be fixed by rearranging our taxes and where they go)",
