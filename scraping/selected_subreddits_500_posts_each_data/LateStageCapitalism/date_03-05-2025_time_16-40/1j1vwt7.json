I get pretty disgusted by it and want to tell them to unionize and give them all copies of The Manifesto.\n\nYes, I know that scouting \"may\" have some benefit to children, but in the end, it's a capitalist tool, operated by capitalists, exploited by capitalists, and any benefit to the children is far outweighed by the massive benefit to the capitalists who operate it.\n\nSry for rant...Young peeps are our future, our \"Young Pioneers\" and they would benefit much more by being direct participants in building social structures for the benefit of society.  Their natural zeal for life is being wasted on rich ghouls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13k3cm538bme1.png?width=229&format=png&auto=webp&s=9076ba116701820013a42220b3743fc6f3444c2c\n\n",

I went toe to toe with a casual friend, fellow girl scout parent and (Believe it or not) local small business owner. The friend and her daughter were driving a massive gas hog truck around our very rural area, spending entire Saturdays selling the damn cookies. I refused to do it. She told me that I was wrong. Back then they were $4 a box and the local troop kept $.75.\n\nMy argument was clear. The damn near exact cookies were available as a Walmart house brand product, a larger pack of things like thin mints was $.99 at the time. They are now a bit over $2 and better than GS cookies, BTW.  So, we can assume that the things cost less than a buck a box, wholesale, since Walmart can make a profit at that price. Once you add the wholesale price to the local troop cut, roughly 60% of the money ends up where exactly?  A bloated bureaucracy with grossly overinflated salaries for the C suite, and what else? The final argument was that I was being berated by a businesswoman who has a retail store with Saturday hours. She is paying somebody to take her place in her store while wasting more on gas than the troop gets with their cut of the sale, wasting hours, watching her kid run for miles down rural driveways to hopefully sell a box or two, if somebody is home and can be guilted into overpaying for a nearly empty box of overpriced shit.  She literally did a full day and netted eighty bucks for the troop. If there was any lesson to be had, it was showing your daughter how to make bad decisions.  I was not popular with all the girl scout mommies after that.",

You can imagine the kind of conniving socialite person drawn to this vs, in an ideal sense, a successful exec who have worked her way up. Bonnie has been with the girl scouts for decades and is a good pick. The practical alternative isn't Bonnie taking a $50k salary but instead someone like Betsy Devos taking it on for social gain and to push an agenda.\n\nBonnie started as a working class person and as such should be given the benefit of the doubt. Replacing her with some rich lady who is just bored and has some political agenda isn't the fix reddit thinks it is. A lot of groups like Girl Scouts, Feeding America, etc pay big CEO salaries because they dont want a chummy board member to force a DeVos on them. It allows them the chance to buy, in theory, proper ethical and non-corrupt leadership.\n\nOf course there should be no reason for this organization to exist as a charity. A proper girls program like this should be socialized or done via mutual aid from the local community. These girls shouldn't be selling candy (which is problematic considering how many girls struggle with ED and body issues and how our society shames their bodies) It should just be a government program. This shows the many flaws of \"just have charity address this.\"\n\nThere's no fix here but total socialization. Same with healthcare. Same with a lot of things.\n\nThat being said, reform is possible and needed too until we can get to a more socialist world. Why aren't there salary caps on these kinds of roles that would still be attractive to people like this but guarantee they can't go farther than x amount? Groups like Charity Navigator rate these groups and their spending and salaries and such which is helpful, but is clearly not enough. I don't see why these CEO salaries can't be capped at, say, 4-5x the media US salary which then would still be an appealing $250-$300k, essential lawyer or doctor money. Or even at a ridiculous 10x the median would still be $660k, essential a king's ransom, and still less than what she is being paid today.",

Every kid in the troop would not have been able to afford the dues and the uniform. However, Girl Scouts waved the fee and gave every kid uniform vouchers. We sold a total of 50 boxes that year (with 20 members in the troop) and it never impacted our scouts' eligibility for being able to participate in the program for free. The weirdly obsessive \"I must sell thousands and thousands of boxes\" impulse never occured to anyone in our troop. (I was part of that hype as a kid and burned out on it, and swore not to hype up sales with my own troop.)\n\nYes, that CEO is paid way too much. I find most non profit organizations to be similarly problematic, too. Especially international orgs aimed at development and aid work. \n\nHowever, our troop found ways around the exploitative aspects. We sold a couple boxes of cookies (you are required to sell if you want to do any other fundraising as a troop that year, but there's no minimum I was aware of) and we did other fundraisers. I remember making \"slime\" and holding a readathon with fond memories. We made enough to cover the simple trips we took, and used much of our proceeds to purchase and distribute care packages for unhoused community members. (Socks, hygiene products, chocolate and non perishable easy to eat foods, etc.) For us, Girl Scouts was a great experience for the kids and adults involved.",

But it was clear that the area leader? Person? I don't remember the title - but that she was essentially working with goals of establishing X number of new troops every year. Once established, it's offloaded onto troop leaders, and then there are various moneymaking things so the troop can be self sufficient, including, of course, the cookie sales. But it's only a percentage of the sales, of course. \n\nI'm a working mom with hardly enough free time as it is, and I just could not commit to everything that would go into peddling cookies and whatever other items during non-cookie season. And if you really look at it, it's usually moms out doing the heavy lifting, advertising, sale tables, etc to get the cookies sold to meet sales goals. \n\nI think the whole thing was started with the best of intentions only to have morphed over the years into an MLM.",

There\u2019s ups and downs to every group, and so much of what an individual troop does is the result of what troop leaders are willing to do. \n\nDo I think there are things GSUSA needs to do better? Hell yeah. Do I love cookies as a fundraiser model? No, but it\u2019s not substantially different than any other fundraising model. Did my kids learn a lot? Sure did. \n\nHowever, as much as I would change things about it, pointing out the CEO salary is not helpful. Non profits have to pay competitive salaries too. It\u2019s a hugely faceted, national organization. People who work for and run non profits are not volunteers. Their jobs are not easier or less than their corporate counterparts. And let\u2019s especially not go after our female CEOs who lead an organization that focuses on leadership for girls. \n\nA debate about the wealth gap - I\u2019m here for it.
