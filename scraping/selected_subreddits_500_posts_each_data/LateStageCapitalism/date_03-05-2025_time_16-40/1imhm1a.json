    "selftext": "These steps come from afar.\n\nThe cracks in capitalism\u2019s rotting facade are widening. Inflation crushes paychecks, wages stagnate, climate collapse accelerates, and fascism rears its head as the system\u2019s last desperate defense. We\u2019ve seen this script before \u2014 history warns us that when capital feels threatened, it turns to repression, scapegoating, and authoritarianism. From book bans to attacks on LGBTQ+ rights, from union-busting to the militarization of police, the signs are undeniable:\u00a0the ruling class is tightening its grip.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth they fear:\u00a0our power lies in collective action.\u00a0Individual resistance isn\u2019t enough. Complacency, despair, or fragmented efforts will only deepen the crisis. To dismantle fascism and capitalism, we\u00a0must\u00a0organize \u2014 not just in the streets, but in workplaces, schools, and communities.  \n  \nFor some, Marx is the devil himself, and just mentioning his name is enough to scare most of those reading this right now. But Marxism is not about taking what you have, the banks do that. Marxism is about understanding the world that capital has created around you.\n\nMarxist theory isn\u2019t dogma \u2014 it\u2019s a toolkit for understanding how we got here and how to fight back. Engage with Marx, Engels, Lenin, Luxemburg, Fanon, Davis, and modern theorists. Study how capital exploits, how fascism co-opts discontent, and how solidarity can break both. Theory without praxis is empty, but praxis without theory is directionless.\n\nThis isn\u2019t idealism \u2014 it\u2019s necessity. \n\n**\u201dThe philosophers have only interpreted the world; the point is to change it.\u201d**\u00a0\u2014 Marx\n\nThe road ahead is long and painful. But together, our steps will go further.",
