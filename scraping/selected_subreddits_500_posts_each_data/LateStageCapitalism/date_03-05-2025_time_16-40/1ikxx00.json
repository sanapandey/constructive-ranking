They just push prices till the absolute limit to which protests are within a controllable limit. Not just this, slowly but surely more and more things are becoming subscription based and ownership is getting out of reach, just as the WEF said. They are basically turning society into a perpetual motion machine. Stop, and you'll no longer be able to afford anything (already halfway there btw).",
