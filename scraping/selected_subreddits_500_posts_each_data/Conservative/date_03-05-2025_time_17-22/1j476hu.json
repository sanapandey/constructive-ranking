They are totally out of touch with the country and the people in it. Even your standard issue Dem still loves our country. \n\nIt\u2019s sad because the Canadians reject them and make fun of them, and they hate Republicans. So they just roam from sub to sub humiliating themselves and spouting woke nonsense.",
