The U.S. has lousy talent and infrastructure for chips and so so for the rest. To get global investors to underwrite this they need regulatory certainty and defined subsidies to help on the spin up costs help. \n\nThe kinds of firms that do this underwrite tightly to not huge returns. By threatening this he\u2019s also threatening some similar ira provisions as well around domestic solar manufacture which would mostly occur in red states.  \n\nWhether or not this stuff is a good idea can debate. But the uncertainty makes it uninvestable. He\u2019s back and forth and also back and forth on tariffs. This is going to gradually create an uncertainty inflicted recession from lack of investment even if he ultimately changes nothing. Deals to fund this simply won\u2019t close while this drama continues.",

They happen based on the investing climate with many individual actors making rational decisions. Day by day gyrations on tariff policy, real estate policy, whether or not we are honoring prior legislation (IRA, chips act), enforcement approach, cause rational investors to at the very least wait. And the more mercurial he is, the less they can trust any assurance made by the government. Ultimately investors hold the bag if the government changes its mind, and hold all of the risk. We had long periods in the last Trump admin where people simply did not invest because of this and sat on cash and bonds. He will cause that again if he\u2019s not consistent and committed to crossing of an area once he\u2019s done whatever he\u2019s going to do. \n\nThe perception is any particular industry is one persuasive trending meme away from adverse actions, or really one shitty 25 year old right wing blogger saying something made up that trends and creates political opportunity for Trump to do Trump. Put another way, populism is very effective at getting a coalition and on public safety and culture issues, but will reliably reduce growth if it\u2019s the normal way economic topics are handled. \n\nThe way to navigate that today is relationship with Trump and his inner circle but many companies don\u2019t have that capability even though they are good at investing otherwise. Trump needs to show consistent policy and investing climate that is not contingent on having a direct relationship with him to offset random change chances. Most companies won\u2019t be able to. TSM can but it\u2019s a trillion dollar company.",

You can\u2019t make an act that basically asks them to come here or gives some ineffectual incentives to try to entice. You hit them in the pocket book. You make it cheaper to be here. \n\nTrump said it clearly: it\u2019s gonna suck for a bit to get us back to where we need to be. There\u2019s going to be a period of change to get from a position where we are largely losing money globally from sending grants and aid and from deficits in trade.\n\nThe way back is to stop said aid to countries that largely don\u2019t NEED it in the form of grants. Maybe do like other countries and invest in countries, and I don\u2019t know maybe get a return on that money. Bring manufacturing back here so that we are exporting instead of primarily importing, and create jobs so Americans are making money.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the big one\u2026 jobs. Employment also relies on supply and demand\u2026 if there are 150 workers and 100 jobs, companies WILL undervalue/ under appreciate workers because they are highly replaceable. In a situation where there are 150 jobs and 100 workers, companies must compete to fill roles and will absolutely pay more to keep good workers. \n\nAnd considering that Trump\u2019s moves have actually had chip manufacturers decide to move to the U.S. it appears to be the right way to go.",

I\u2019m far from an expert on this subject but from what I\u2019ve read it sounds like this was a deal made as part of CHIPS and that TSMC has only received a small portion of that money to date. If that\u2019s the case, and CHIPS is shuttered, I\u2019m not sure that the rest of the funds will get disbursed to them. There were other factors at play here, including incentives to move the chip fabrication to the US in light of the import tariffs but I\u2019m not sure what they all were. It will be interesting to see what TSMC ultimately ends up doing. Losing their fabrication capabilities would  have far reaching consequences.",
