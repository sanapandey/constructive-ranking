As an outsider US political enthusiast, i would've, with the influence of r/politics, cheered these as heroic and strong (as they did) a few years ago. But now Its just comically cringe and embarrassing. The divide in the US is staggering. Hopefully, regardless of some foreign policy diagreements ive had with the trump admin, more americans are  on the conservative side than the crazy grandstanding, heavily manipulative left once this is all said and done. The Dem's coordinated attacks on common sense are more a danger to the world than any fumble the trump admin would ever experience",

It\u2019s gotten so **bad** that supposed, and I quote, \u201cjournalists\u201d are losing their shows too. Just I believe a week and a half ago, Joy Reed\u2019s show was canceled and she straight up walked out of the network entirely. Before that we had Don Lemon, and Jim Acosta. \n\nThe behavior these radicals are engaging in has shown us their true colors and now it\u2019s starting to cost them. The reaction that we the sensible people had on November 5th is exactly why you don\u2019t get in bed with them. The radicals **will** sink the party, and that\u2019s EXACTLY what happened.",

This is when the progressive mind virus really took hold of the Democrats and branched out. From that point, the integrity of the Democrat party straight up vanished. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. This situation is incredibly saddening because this is a hell of their own creation. I hope that the Democrat party will return to their original values and rejoin the decorum because this is just awful all around for everyone involved, but the problem with that is that the Democrat party as it stands may very will be beyond saving.",
