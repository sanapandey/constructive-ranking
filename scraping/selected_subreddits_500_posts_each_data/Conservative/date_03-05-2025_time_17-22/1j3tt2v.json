I voted for Clinton, and I'm glad she lost) and god was I miserable looking back it. I got sick to my stomach and was in a mental and emotional state of despair following the election loss. As I navigated the real world and looked with my own eyes and ears rather than taking other people's propagandized information as facts, I've shifted. Other than Covid, which hit us primarily because of how ill the US is as a whole, everything else was pretty damn peachy under Trump's first term, and that really hammered that nail in that the media is all just pushing an agenda now, collectively.\n\nI still see mostly people on the left who suggest blocking out friends and family just because they voted for Trump because of all the irrelevant propaganda they've been force fed for the past few years. I wouldn't do that to anybody who voted for Kamala at all.",
