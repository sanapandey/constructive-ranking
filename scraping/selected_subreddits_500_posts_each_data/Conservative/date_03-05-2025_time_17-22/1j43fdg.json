MSNBC still employs Rachael Maddow, they clearly don't care about retaining any credibility.  \n\nFor one moment on one night a child was recognized and literally lifted up for the world to cheer.  It was apolitical.  The power of positivity is a real thing in chronic medical condition outcomes.  Not that the democrats would know that because they struggle with facts, reality, data, and real science as can be clearly shown in US healthcare expenditures versus outcomes.  Little hint, we have the highest expenditures in the world with the worst outcomes in the industrialized world.  \n\nPerhaps...just perhaps...this was an attempt to find atleast one shred of common ground so they can get together behind SOMETHING to show some semblance of unity.  Cheering a pediatric cancer survivor should have been an easy one.  Unfortunately, here we are.",
