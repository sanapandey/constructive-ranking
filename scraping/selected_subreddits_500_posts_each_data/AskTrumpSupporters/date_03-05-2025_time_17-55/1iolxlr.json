I try to focus on things that are more concrete than just \"culture\", as I talked about in another comment (ideology, behavior, general outcomes). Ideology = voting patterns, responses in surveys; behavior = very broad, but most obviously crime stats; outcomes = things like wealth/income, health, education, etc. \n\nYou seem to want to get me to say that I care about race for its own sake, and I do. I'm White, I like White people, I like the societies we build, and I want to maximize the chances that we continue existing (while being independent and prosperous). So if that is your big experiment, I have no problem saying that yes, I absolutely care about race. But I don't think a person has to have all of my views on race in order to share most or even all of my views on immigration. \n\nRegarding values: I just don't know what it means in this context, because even if you got me to concede that there was a hypothetical black Canadian whose values were closer to mine than a hypothetical Eastern European, it doesn't really have any implications for immigration policy unless you think this is true on aggregate (or that we have some sort of selection process to filter out people with Bad Values, or people that simply lie about their values, etc.). I get that for you it's a thought experiment, and I'm supposed to just take it as a given that one person shares my values and the other doesn't. But if race and values aren't actually separable in that way, then that isn't possible.\n\n* Example: how would I feel about a Chinese person who had my exact values and worldview? Well, he would be a proud Chinese nationalist who wants the best for his people. So he either wouldn't leave China in the first place or he would only be here insofar as it delivers benefits back home! Both are far from ideal. So sharing 'values' doesn't actually mean anything. You can be a good person in my eyes and still make for a bad American.",
