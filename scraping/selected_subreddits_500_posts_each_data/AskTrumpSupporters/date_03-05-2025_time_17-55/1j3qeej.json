China can make deals with any country it wants. You know, like they do with the US and Europe. High tariffs for cheap goods. Thumbing their noses at the western world over absurd \"human rights\" claims. You know, like China has done for a very long time.\n\nI find these sorts of questions to be \"who will make our cheap shit\" or \"who will pick our crops\" type questions.",

As a European, it's completely insulting and it's spurring on boycotts of US goods in favour of European and other Western alternatives (e.g. see /r/BuyFromEU, established two weeks ago in response to recent US policymaking).\n\nI just cannot fathom how any American can look at the current administration and think that it is going to extract *more* from us - it already extracts far more than any other country - and it's pushing otherwise pro-US nations further towards their regional markets and the Chinese market.\n\nThe US already essentially defines global trade. Now everybody finally has an out and you are expecting them to *double down*? Why? What do we get out of that?",

            "body": "> These countries have threatened targeted tariffs in retaliation.  \n\n1. You failed to mention that these countries have various tariffs and taxes on American goods before Trump came into picture. They aren't increasing the tariff rate from 0% to 25% because Trump was elected. They're threatening to increase the tariffs from X% to X% - if they have the balls to bet against Trump, that is.  \n2. Trump has promised reciprocal tariffs. Increasing the tariffs on American goods further would result in the same for Canadian goods too if Trump keeps his word.\n3. GOP controls Congress and Executive, both have a variety of measures to counter targeted tariffs against red states - and the blue states wouldn't have a say because of the broad interpretation of the commerce clause. And if an activist judge says otherwise, then the red states would gain rights to counter such tariffs.  Lose-Lose for all except Trump.\n\n> Will these countries, out of necessity, form new \"free trade zones\" with themselves, excluding the USA?\n\nYou mean multilateral free trade agreements? \n\nLike the [CPTPP (2018), which comprises of all the individual countries you mentioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership)? \n\nOr the [CETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Economic_and_Trade_Agreement) between Canada and the EU and [various other FTAs of the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreements_of_the_European_Union)? \n\nFTZs have a specific meaning which I'm not sure you understand. What are you trying to even say here? That these countries would have even freer trade than they do right now? \n\nThey can go right ahead, it wouldn't take long for all of them to just be exchanging Chinese goods between each other. These countries would just turn into actual EPZs (Export Processing Zones) for China - the entirety of these countries. Chinese flagged ships would just be moving Chinese goods between these countries. Good luck enforcing marine environmental regulations with China!    \n\n>  Chinese exporters who might typically lose out to American manufacturers\n\nThis is the funniest statement in your question.  I don't even want to address such an absurd statement.  \n\n> these tariffs likely to create business opportunities for European\n\nI'm not quite sure how you expect business to thrive in the EU with their regulatory and tax burden. The [state of innovation in the EU is abysmal](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1891485693731287384). They are quite literally in the rear view mirror compared to Asia and the US.   \n\nCanada is on a decline too - why would you put money in Canada when the next door neighbor won't actively try to find new ways to fuck domestic businesses over while trying to please the globalists?\n\nFrankly the EU should worry about large countries exiting the EU bolstered by American support. Hungary, Italy, Romania - not looking good.\n\n> How do you think this will affect US businesses?\n\nWait a minute. I thought tariffs were supposed to be paid by working class people, as the business would just pass on the costs, right?  Is the change in narrative because OTHER countries are threatening tariffs, that would somehow only magically hurt America and not their own people, and NS would like to avoid hitting the logical fallacy of only American tariffs hurting its own citizens?  \n\nAre you finally admitting that businesses will pay for not manufacturing in America?\n\nIn that case, the response to these businesses is that they wouldn't have to worry about tariffs if they manufactured in America. How simple!\n\nBy the way, what a specific, loaded \"question\" with multiple statements that essentially had their periods replaced with question marks. Do you even care about TS responses or do you just want to tell us that Trump is going to kill American manufacturing!?!?!\n\nAfter 10 years of propaganda, I think a lot of TS are immune to falling for such obvious bait. You report on the trade war as if China and Europe are the only \"nuclear powers\" of trade.",

I mean, what is even the point of your comment? Trudeau is out in a few days, polls are not looking good for his party, and we don't know if Canadian \"conservatives\" will keep up the NeverTrump charade after the election. Canadians, Brits and Germans are the top victims of TDS due to Reddit. So I don't think conservatives there can fully appear to ally with him or even play pretend like Fetterman does sometimes.\n\nMy disdain of Governor Trudeau (or any leftist politician) for that matter does not immediately result in an approval of their opponents though. I mean, is the \"**Christian** Democratic Union\" going to stop taking in migrants that are hostile to Christians? There's a reason why \"RINO\" is quite a lot more frequently used than \"DINO\".\n\nBut it's clear that Canada and the US were on a similar path, and Canada tripped hard after Trudeau fucked them over. Clearly importing the entirety of Punjab didn't work very well and I'm sure the Indians are quite happy to send their unemployed in.\n\nhttps://bmofundcentral.com/articles/a-tale-of-two-countries-how-the-u-s-and-canada-ended-up-on-different-economic-paths/",
