Obviously there are some on the right that have some pretty garbage takes or blindly believe every meme or thing they hear that are often wrong too, but to my point they\u2019re actually actively consuming political media.\n\nTwo of my best friends are liberals and we just discussed this for our first time after years of friendship. My (male) friend was getting a bit heated tbh while his wife was actually genuinely surprised at the things I brought up in the conversation they knew nothing about. I think generally they aren\u2019t always blue folks but just don\u2019t like trumps personality. I completely can see that being your opinion if that\u2019s how deep you are in politics. I personally wish Trump wasn\u2019t always saying some of the stuff he says but in the end he\u2019s getting the things I want to see done. \n\nHonestly that\u2019s what it boils down to in most of my conversations with reasonable liberals. I\u2019m able to disregard his personality and focus on actions while they are too put off by him just in general regardless of other details.",

It's a sort of don't ask don't tell situation for both sides and honestly it's perfectly fine this way. Knowing who my co workers voted for isn't relevant at all to my or their job, and getting involved with politics would just create conflict. \n\nMy previous job which skewed much younger wasn't like this and there was conflict since it skewed liberal until I went into a position there working midnights with a bunch of veterans. When I was with the mostly liberal software devs it sucked because they snuck in politics in their conversations and I mostly just didn't talk to them when that stuff came in or I left. When I worked with the military folks who were also conservative it was great. \n\nSo at least in my experience there really is no need to share politics at work.

He\u2019s very educated and smart. Has deep-seated trauma starting in childhood. He\u2019s 61 now.\n\nI am interested in what difficulties the passport issues create. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a decision I would have made. For the people affected I\u2019m sure it is a big deal. It\u2019s not my priority though. You don\u2019t need a passport if you don\u2019t have food, or shelter, or a place to live without mold, or your husband is murdered by a terrorist, or you have a firebomb thrown at you while out eating dinner, or the windows get smashed out of your store for the 3rd time. These are issues people I know are dealing with. I\u2019m worried a lot more about that.\n\nAnyway, I gotta go. Those were good questions, appreciate the chance to answer.",

It\u2019s a sweeping statement making it so there are legally only two genders. This will stop funding for programs designed to help people just like your friend and many others. It doesn\u2019t need to happen at all.\n\nI completely understand that the trans population is such a small percentage of the population that gets so much attention. There are bigger fish to fry. Much larger world problems. But they\u2019re being used as an emotional tool and distraction and need more support than ever. There\u2019s enough money to help every person in your city with all the problems you listed. Can you help me understand how holding trans people down will help that?",

For example the tampons in boys bathrooms issue. I\u2019m 57 and I\u2019m a female. All my life I\u2019ve had my own supplies with me in my purse. At school if I or my friends were cut short we were informed we could go to the office and get supplies.\n\nI don\u2019t know why this isn\u2019t still a good solution.  It would cost almost nothing and upset no one. I understand public schools have a nurse (I never went to a public school until college) and this would be even easier in that case.\n\nBut one side has to spend a ton of money and piss everybody off, and the other side has to freak out thinking they are trying to groom their kids. Both reactions seem absurd to me and there has been a completely unnecessary expenditure of money, time, energy and stress.\n\nYou could get one box of multiple size tampons (they come in a variety pack), one box of pads and one box of panty liners. With 1 to 2 percent of born females possibly presenting or transitioning as male in the school that should last awhile.\n\nSo for less than $50 and a few minutes of time, we no longer have an issue. But it\u2019s been blown up into a huge thing, and for what? Political distraction and manipulation. And I agree it\u2019s rotten to use people who already have a lot to deal with as political pawns. \n\nWhat I want is to find out who is diverting the money away from people\u2019s needs and where it\u2019s going. We are paying for things we\u2019re not getting. I agree the amount of money coming in is not as big a problem as what it\u2019s being diverted to. There is shocking fraud and waste. If we don\u2019t get a handle on it we are screwed. Perpetual debt and waste isn\u2019t sustainable. \n\nIf our country and constitution falls, the new regime is likely to be even less kind to trans people. China is our main danger and don\u2019t they just execute them? If I\u2019m wrong I\u2019d like to be corrected but anyone who doesn\u2019t fit in they can just kill with impunity.",

It\u2019s very confusing as you seem to have alot of trans folks close to you and you\u2019ve voted against their interests and your beliefs. Do you ever speak to other Trump supporters about these opinions you have? I made a comment up here in Canada about tampons in bathrooms for a new Trans coworker who\u2019d asked for some help. One of my more conservative coworkers could not even believe what he was hearing.\n\nEdit: just wanted to add regarding China. The USA was making great ground offering services to the trans community. It\u2019s obviously just been pushed back. It\u2019s almost the exact same in China now. Limited access to care and treatment, nothing for people under 18, they can still officially change gender with government (can\u2019t anymore in usa), no protections for discrimination in workplace. There are no executions happening to my knowledge. Laws in USA vary state by state too. Some are better than others. I\u2019m no fan of the CCP but I have recently realized the amount of anti Chinese propaganda I have ingested my whole life.",

That is a much more efficient use of resources because govt. doesn\u2019t take 90% off the top to perpetuate themselves. So I put my money where my mouth is and took two carloads of supplies to a homeless camp this week. I gave $9,000 USD to charities in tax year 2023 and did a lot of hours of volunteer labor. Private charities can help far more people with the same resources, and with less social engineering manipulation because our goal is help, not control (most of the time, not all). So fellow pro-reformers out there, if you can do more private charity please do. There is need during the transition, and there is fear. Let\u2019s fight those things!\n\nPS - I\u2019m picking up one of my trans friends in a couple of hours to go work on a community garden. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. It\u2019s a victory garden. Let\u2019s do it!!!!!",

Only extremists aren't decent in public. \n\nFor example my family is from NYC. We are some European American. My grandmother really didn't like Black folks. My grandfather on the other hand was very into the acceptance of everybody. My grandfather had friends from all races and cultures. To troll my grandmother and teach her a lesson he would randomly invite over his colleague Stanley and his entire family for dinner. Stanley and his family were African Americans. \n\nMy grandmother was always very inviting to them and she played the host like she always did. She was an amazing cook so Stanley's family was always in for a real treat. She put up a facade of an accepting and tolerant White woman. After they left she let my grandfather have it. He would say you're ridiculous. \n\nWell over time my grandmother really started to change and realise that her preconceived motions about Black folks weren't right. In her later years her prejudices took a major downturn. \n\nThe moral of the story I'm trying to share is that Stanley's family was never the wiser to my grandmother's beliefs. She sent them Christmas, birthday and Easter cards. She always welcomed them with a feeling of love, etc. she was as tolerant as my grandfather for all they knew. Over time she learned too. Not fully though because Obama being president was to her liking. But she was ok with a Black doctor by her later years.\n\nPeople can believe that they don't want to deal with gender neutral bathrooms and pronouns all while being respectful in a public setting. \n\nI'm not against trans people at all. I work with them and have hired them. I have no ill will at all. But I'm not going to say that I agree that teenagers should be getting treatment for it. I'm not going to say that I think 8 year olds should need to be taught was a trans person is further than their need to understand their world. And 8 year also doesn't need to be taught about sex like some people want. I'm from a huge city and I didn't know about sex until maybe late 8th grade. \n \nSo Trumps polling is because people do want to stop the proliferation of these ideas into the mainstream. That's all very different than being bigoted in your day to day life when you interact with people.",

So while somebody may seem open and accepting in their public life. Privately they may vote for things online with their beliefs that may affect the public. \n\nFor example you may be a public school teacher who sees the way this gender ideology is confusing children and know that if you just set firm boundaries that kids do better overall.

That along with feminist idealogy had made unclear the path for so many people all while not actually benefitting them. \n\nIt all snowballs.

But leave me alone if I mix this up and don\u2019t remember what someone has decided they want others to call them on that particular day. \n\nIt\u2019s been my experience that the people who push this the hardest to be accepted and tolerated are often the least willing to just let others live their lives. I\u2019m happy to respect how someone wants to be addressed.. it doesn\u2019t cost me anything. All I ask is the same in return. You live your life, I\u2019ll live mine, and we\u2019re good.",

I served in the Army for a few years myself but was medically discharged after being diagnosed with insulin dependent Type 1 diabetes. Similar to trans individuals I require a hormone for life, multiple times daily (insulin) this alone made me unfit for duty.. not because I wasn\u2019t willing, or not because I cant take care of my health (I do) but because the military has to prioritize readiness and the safety of the unit. The same principle should apply to transgender soldiers.. ongoing medical needs like hormone therapy and surgeries can impact deployability, and in high-stakes environments, that affects everyone. The military has strict standard across many health conditions in order for soldiers to be \u201cFit for duty\u201d. This isn\u2019t  just about the individual too..  it\u2019s about the impact on the entire unit.\n\nAs for kids, pushing puberty blockers and surgeries on minors is reckless. These treatments have lifelong irreversible consequences, and young people lack the maturity to make such irreversible decisions. Let kids grow up first. \n\nAll that said, I\u2019m not here to tell adults what they can or can\u2019t do with their own bodies. But when it comes to the military and kids, there are valid concerns that go beyond politics and shouldn\u2019t just be dismissed as bigotry. If Trump has other policies affecting trans people, I\u2019d want to see the actual executive orders and judge them individually.  I actually have no problem disagreeing with policies I think go too far. The left often demands total alignment on every issue, among their own, and that\u2019s exactly why they\u2019ve lost moderates like me. (I didn\u2019t vote for Trump in the previous 2 elections)",
