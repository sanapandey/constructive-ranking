    "selftext": "I just learned today that DOGE is seeking to get access to taxpayer data at the IRS. The access he seems to be after (according to various articles) is the Integrated Data Retrieval System which enables employees \u201cto have instantaneous visual access to certain taxpayer accounts,\u201d\n\n(source: [https://apnews.com/article/doge-treasury-irs-taxpayer-data-musk-7d6b80e429106250afa6d02e55a981b1](https://apnews.com/article/doge-treasury-irs-taxpayer-data-musk-7d6b80e429106250afa6d02e55a981b1) )\n\nWhat I'm really curious to know is how do Trump supporters feel about this? I mean, a guy from the outside being able to access your personally data instantly like that is scary as heck to me, but I want to know more what you folks think of this. Is it Ok? Is that part of the whole package you voted for? Or are you all seething mad? Enraged? I have no visibility on this and no clue.",

Who on the Right doesn't believe the government is wasting trillions?\n\nIn this specific case I see plenty of independent observers corroborating what's being reported.  Many 'ants' are crawling all over USAID's financial reporting and they've found a lot of 'food' highlighting unjustifiable spending.\n\nI've never been an Elon fan and wrote him off as a nothing more than showman and an investor with a lot of money.  He wasn't a founder of Tesla, he was an investor who virtually stole the company from the founders when it started looking appealing.  I'm being forced to revise my analysis of him because what he's doing now is evidence my narrative is overly simplistic.  I still think he's 90% a self-interested showman with no real technical talent.  But there is something else missing.  It'll take longer-term observation to work out that last 10%.\n\nBut I do like what he's doing at the moment.  He's taking almost all the incoming fire from the MSM and allowing Trump and Vance to get on with the job of governing.  If he does find fraud, and I think the totality of the evidence corroborates that he really is finding fraud, then all the better.\n\nHim publicly exposing government waste and basking in the limelight of disclosure may well be the perfect use for his publicity seeking.",

We already have DC's version of criminals as heroes - it's called Suicide Squad. We will soon have Marvel's version of bad guy heroes called Thunderbolts. We recently had a true story of British gentlemen behaving badly behind enemy by the order of Winston Churchill. It's a trope with a strong mythology behind it. Sometimes you have to send in the bad guys to catch the bad guys. That's what DOGE is. Paint them as despicables all you want. They are our despicables and they are cutting off the taxpayer funding of the deeply entrenched award winning despicables in  government.",

Many people may not know these facts about DOGE (very clearly many of the non-supporters posting in this thread don't know this fact based on the things that they're saying). And yet Nonsupporters are downvoting this very important comment by u/DidiGreglorius. Clearly the Nonsupporters aren't here to actually engage in meaningful exchanges to understand things. No reason at all for the downvotes on this. In fact by downvoting it non-supporters are apparently trying to keep other non-supporters from learning this by keeping it further down in the comments. Not even sure why I follow this thread anymore since non-supporters clearly aren't genuine in their curiosity, but rather agenda driven.",

I just want them to have an actual process. I want that process and timeline to be public. What is happening now is absent process and transparency. Financial audits don\u2019t happen with 20 year olds barging into government agencies, and moving their newborns in and sleeping there. \n\nFinancial audits happen with forensic accountants. They typically start by sitting down with *other accountants* and being walked through how the finances work within an organization. Those walkthroughs then inform the sample(s) of transactions that are followed, end-to-end. \n\nFrom this, reports are made. Reports exist so that the recipients of the reports (in this case, us citizens) can have more confidence in the data. A data example might be: it looks like USAID provided grants around $60m USD to help build schools in Jordan. The audit looks at: did the money get spent on schools in Jordan? It doesn\u2019t make a judgement about if this was \u201cthe right use of money\u201d or \u201csmart\u201d or\u2026any other subjective criteria. It looks at: did USAID have the authority to do this, and did the money end up where they said it ended up. That\u2019s pretty much it. The question of *should* $60m be used to fund schools in Jordan is an entirely different question. And one that cannot be answered through a financial audit.\n\nDo you think these reports are coming? Most of what I see is the latter: shocking headlines to get people worked up about a federal agency funding schools in Jordan. Worthwhile conversation to have! Just shouldn\u2019t be happening in this muddy, wishy washy \u201cthis is an audit\u201d.\n\nHave you seen any evidence that a process is being followed? There are blueprints for this. DoD has been undergoing many audits over the last decade. Legislation that was introduced by a California Democrat. Conducted by independent auditors.",

He's been sparring with a few folks in Congress (McConnell,  Pelosi, Schiff, also Corey Booker, etc) about their low salary and extreme rate of wealth growth while in office,  and IMPLIED he thinks they're doing fraud, but no such paper trails have been presented by DOGE. More generally,  today Elon said something along the lines of \"most of the crazy spending is probably 80% incompetence or not caring, and only 20% fraud, but that's still a lot of fraud!\"",

And yes, there are admins whose job it is to administer the credentials and oversee these processes- and you can know for a fact that they have admin override credentials. \n\n>You don't seem to be parsing the difference between the status quo and this (and \"this\" is sort of the whole point to DOGE, no?).\u00a0\n\nI'm saying that the federal government has had access to these kinds of records for decades.
