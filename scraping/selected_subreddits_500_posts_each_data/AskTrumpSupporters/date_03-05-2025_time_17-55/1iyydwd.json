There would be a naval blockade and focus on containment. We would also have to take out all their shipyards since they have 230x our shipbuilding [capacity](https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2024/12/08/dwarfed-by-china-in-shipbuilding-us-looks-to-build-its-defense-base/) which would quickly overwhelm us in a grinding naval war. The question is whether they go nuclear in response at that point. \n\nThe invasion scenario is a bogeyman, though. It's infinitely easier for them to just use soft power and not end up in a nuclear war.",

They are already learning from Japanese, British, and Russian mistakes, and we know what they want. The gap between the time it takes to build ships and personnel training, which spans years, and the time it takes to sink a fleet of ships, which takes at least an hour, has widened significantly. As you know, United States power in the pacific lies at the might of USN which badly needs an overhaul and increase fleet capacity. We want allies not to rely on us but also we want them on par on budget parity. It\u2019s like bringing your rich friends to a restaurant and they expect you to pay for it.",
